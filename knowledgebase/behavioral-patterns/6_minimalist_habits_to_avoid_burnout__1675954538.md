6 minimalist habits to avoid burnout: (you'll thank me later)

Greg McKeown is the #1 NYT best-selling author of Essentialism. He
summarizes the essentialist lifestyle as "less but better." It's about
getting the right things done... not the most things done. (This is also
how to avoid burnout.) Try it with these 6 minimalist habits:

1. Make 'no' your default. If it's not an obvious yes, it's a no. An
extra project, a diﬃcult client, an acquaintance's wedding that is
extremely far to travel to... Just because the opportunity arises does
not mean you should say yes. Be absurdly protective of your time.

2. Create (and maintain) boundaries. If your working hours are between
9am and 6pm, don't answer that 8pm email. It can usually wait until
morning. If you don't respect your boundaries, others won't either.

3. When someone asks you to take on another task, respond with this:
"I'm happy to... But if we're adding this to my scope, what are we
taking away?" 1 in, 1 out.

4. Diﬀerentiate between what's urgent and what's important. Answering
that ping? Might feel really urgent. But spending uninterrupted time on
your presentation for tomorrow? That's important.

5. Prioritize sleep. 1 less hour of sleep might seem like 1 more hour to
get work done... But 1 less hour of sleep actually = 2+ fewer hours of
productivity tomorrow.

6. Stop multitasking. Spend 3 hours in the morning on your #1 priority.
"The word priority came into the English language in the 1400s. It was
singular... It stayed singular for the next ﬁve hundred years." Priority
= 1 thing.

TL;DR: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

Make 'no' your default Create (and maintain) boundaries If 1 task is
added to your plate, 1 must be removed Diﬀerentiate between what's
urgent and what's important 1 extra hour of sleep \> 1 extra hour of
work Priority = 1 thing
