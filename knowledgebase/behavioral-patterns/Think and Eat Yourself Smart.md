"Laurie and I cannot recommend this brain-changing, life-changing book
enough, and we pray you'll benefit as much as we have from reading it!"
Matt and Laurie Crouch, TBN "In a well-researched look at our food
system, Dr. Leaf serves us a wake-up call to declining physical health
if we continue on our current path. But there is hope. In this
insightful book, Dr. Leaf helps us understand that each time we eat, we
are choosing. With an informative combination of scientific research and
scriptural principles, Dr. Leaf shows that healthy eating may not be
quick or cheap, but it is something we all can do. Thanks to this book I
am motivated to make healthier food choices and help others do the
same." David I. Levy, MD, clinical professor of neurosurgery, University
of California, San Diego; author of Gray Matter: A Neurosurgeon
Discovers the Power of Prayer . . . One Patient at a Time "Betty and I
were introduced to Dr. Caroline Leaf by Peter and Ann Pretorius, our
missionary partners in Africa. They were excited because she was having
such a profound impact on people throughout South Africa. We invited her
to be a guest on LIFE Today, and she has continued to have a powerful
impact---not only in her own country but here in the United States. A
neuroscientist, Dr. Leaf shows the connection between our brain and
food. The fact is, many people are killing themselves because of what
they eat---or don't eat. The pointers Dr. Leaf provides in these pages
will surely make us think twice before we take the next bite and equip
us to be better stewards of the bodies God has given us." James Robison,
founder and president of LIFE Outreach International; founder and
publisher of The Stream "This book is unique. There are books about
nutrition and there are books about the mind---however, we cannot think
of any book that links the mind and nutrition in the detail Dr. Caroline
Leaf does. We definitely never learned this information when we were in
medical school. The information in this book has changed the way our
family eats. We are healthier, fitter, slimmer, and smarter. Dr. Leaf is
the real deal. She talks the talk and walks the walk. We know her
lifestyle; we know what is in her pantry and fridge and what she eats at
her table. Her whole family lives out what she has written in this book.
It will change your life." Peter Amua-Quarshie, MD, MPH, MS, and Mercy
Amua-Quarshie, MD, MPH, FACOG "There is a difference between desiring to
be well and being tired of being sick. Those who truly desire to be well
will confess healing Scriptures every day. They would not dare miss
taking their vitamin supplements. They would not eat anything or in any
way other than God's way, under any circumstance. Caroline Leaf's new
book, Think and Eat Yourself Smart, will help anyone who has the desire
to be well and who will change their ways and lifestyle to God's ways.
It will help you, and here I quote Dr. Leaf, 'Admit it, quit it, and
beat it!' Get it! Read it! Do it! And with long life, God will satisfy
you and show you his salvation!" Kenneth Copeland, Kenneth Copeland
Ministries "This timely and essential new book from Dr. Caroline Leaf
promises to be exactly the resource I need both for myself personally
and as a recommended resource that could dramatically benefit all of my
patients and their families, as well as my own family and friends. I am
eager to faithfully

implement its life-integrating principles and important paradigm
changes, to recommend it to patients and colleagues, and to reap the
benefits of healthier thinking and healthier food choices. With
continued estimations that perhaps 80 percent of today's diseases and
disorders are directly related to chosen lifestyle issues, Dr. Leaf's
challenging call toward deep, long-term, and sustainable changes in our
lives---spirit, soul, and body---is a truly life-giving message that can
help save us from further devastation of preventable disease,
dysfunction, and death. Thank you so much, Dr. Leaf, for applying your
neuroscientifically sound perspectives to this important issue!"
Dr. Robert Turner, neurologist "I am so excited about the release of
this book from a woman who truly knows what she is talking about and
lives it out every single day. My last season in life was the most
challenging one I've ever faced health-wise, and even though I've always
been quite focused on good nutrition and exercise, my body was obviously
needing more. I know this book will be a life-changing and life-saving
tool in your hand, and with all my heart I say thanks to Dr. Caroline
for putting into our hands a book filled with practical answers and a
way forward, so that each one of us can live out God's perfect plan for
our lives." Darlene Zschech, composer, worship leader, and pastor;
author of Worship Changes Everything "It is my honor and pleasure to
endorse Dr. Caroline and her new book, Think and Eat Yourself Smart. Her
passion for the well-being of others is genuine, and I know the lights
will go on for many as they absorb the truth and perspective within
these pages. We live in a world consumed with so many things---including
food and the pursuit of health, beauty, opportunity, and influence. I am
confident this book will be life-changing for many and will fuel
foundational truths that make for a blessed, effective, and fruitful
life." Bobbie Houston, Hillsong Church "Admit it! Quit it! Beat it!
These are the main ingredients to this tasty dish of a book. The brainy
truths and guidelines presented in Think and Eat Yourself Smart are a
welcome addition to Dr. Leaf's prior works. We need to be more mindful
of how we think about and practice the art of eating. I am sure this
work will awaken minds with simple truths that will lead to sharper
thoughts and healthier lives!" Dr. Avery Jackson III, neurosurgeon "Did
you know your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and God created us
to glorify him? Have you ever thought about the fact that God can't move
through you if you're not able physically to do what he wants you to do?
In her new book, Think and Eat Yourself Smart, Dr. Caroline Leaf reveals
how to have a healthier lifestyle and a sharper mind. She is a member of
Gateway Church and has spoken during our weekend services and
conferences. Her medical knowledge, combined with her revelatory wisdom,
will completely change your life." Robert Morris, founding senior
pastor, Gateway Church; bestselling author of The Blessed Life "My
friend Dr. Caroline Leaf has the uncanny ability to explain complex
topics in a way that is practical and attainable. Her insights in
acquiring health, both physically and mentally, are beautifully penned
in every page of this book. I'm grateful for her hard-hitting advice.
I've seen it transform the lives of many---including many people close
to me. This book will change your thinking and your life." Priscilla
Shirer, teacher and author

"In Think and Eat Yourself Smart, Caroline shows how increasing your
awareness of emotional responses to food enhances your ability to make
wise and mindful choices about what you actually eat. In turn, you
enhance not only your physical health but also, more importantly, your
mental health and your capacity to use mindfulness in all your daily
choices. I wholeheartedly endorse Caroline's program of thinking and
eating wisely." Dr. Jeff Shwartz, psychiatrist and author "It is my joy
to endorse this latest book by Dr. Caroline. She is a marvelous vision
of health, vitality, and energy! If what she is recommending to eat is
testament to her gorgeous mind, body, soul, and spirit---well, in the
famous words of the character in When Harry Met Sally, 'I'll have what
she's having' (on my food plate, please!). We live in a world of 'fast
foods' where some children don't even know that milk comes from an
animal, not a carton. There is a hunger to get back to basics and
actually experience the freshness of an apple, the scent of homegrown
herbs, and the zest of a freshly squeezed orange. I'll be the first to
experiment with Dr. Caroline's recipes and food combinations--- so to
all who desire to live a long life filled with energy, joy, and the
goodness of fresh, yummy, seasonal foods (as I surely do!), bon
appétit!" Pastor Chris Pringle, senior minister of C3 Church, Sydney
"Have you ever wondered why you eat the way you do? Well, answers to
this question and more are in Think and Eat Yourself Smart. Dr. Caroline
Leaf seamlessly weaves science and biblical insights together to explain
how our thinking relates to our eating habits. Read it and gain the
wisdom you need to improve your health!" John and Lisa Bevere,
bestselling authors; ministers; cofounders of Messenger International
"Today millions of people are suffering from the health effects of bad
eating patterns, while countless individuals are enslaved so that we can
have a plethora of cheap food. In Think and Eat Yourself Smart,
Dr. Caroline Leaf shows us how we can use our minds not only to choose
to establish a healthier, integrated lifestyle but also to improve the
lives of those suffering injustice within the global food industry."
Christine Caine, author of Unstoppable "Think beyond the fork!
Dr. Caroline compels us to increase our gastronomical intelligence. Her
findings will shock you, and her solutions will inspire you to take back
control of the dinner table. If you wouldn't settle for a fake diamond,
why settle for fake food? Learn from a trusted source what real food is
and enjoy the vibrant life awaiting you when you choose to follow in her
footsteps." Pastor Colleen Rouse, Victory World Church, Atlanta "As a
physician and a pastor's wife, I've seen countless individuals suffer
unnecessarily from dietrelated illnesses. I highly recommend this book
to anyone desiring to experience victory in the areas of weight
management and wellness." Dr. Lillian Robertson, MD, FACOG, Emmanuel
Ministries "My dear friend Dr. Caroline Leaf is the real deal. She lives
out the words in her books and shares with us how we too can eat
ourselves smart. God has gifted her with a brilliant mind and the
ability to communicate a fascinating message to the world. Be smart and
buy this engaging book." Shelene Bryan, author of Love, Skip, Jump;
founder of Skip1.org "We always appreciate Dr. Leaf's clear, concise,
and helpful point of view on matters of the mind."

Gabe and Rebekah Lyons, founders of Q "Dr. Caroline Leaf has done it
again! Dr. Leaf delves into a systemic problem in our individual lives
and reveals a systemic solution. Think and Eat Yourself Smart is
divinely inspired and supported by sound scientific facts regarding how
we think and how our thoughts affect our eating choices. This
transforming book is a must-have for everyone on planet earth. This book
supports 2 Timothy 1:7, which reminds us that God has given us, through
the incredible power in our sound minds, the ability to act on these
choices and transform our world." Dr. Edith Davis, PhD, first
African-American female geophysicist; author of How We Really Learn

Acknowledgments

The hours that go into a scientific book of this nature are endless. And
as information is conceptualized and formed into ideas that can be
expressed logically---an endeavor that never has an end because of the
nature of science being a continual cycle of discovery---a highly
skilled research assistant becomes imperative to the success of a
project of this nature. To this end, I acknowledge Jessica, who not only
became such an assistant but did so with excellent skill,
professionalism, and brilliance. She helped me read through, evaluate,
and think through the minefield that food and eating have become in the
world today---a struggle we really had to target. We had so many
discussions as she tirelessly helped research and make sense of a
plethora of conflicting information. She helped connect multiple complex
concepts and edited my writing with excellence and wisdom. She spent
hours in the kitchen helping create and prepare our family's favorite
recipes to put in this book. She encouraged me when I felt overloaded
trying to finish a book in record time in the midst of my challenging
travel schedule. In all, she went over and above and beyond the call of
duty, burning the midnight oil throughout. And not only did Jessica play
a huge role in helping shape this book with her brilliant mind, but I am
proud to say she is also my daughter. Thank you, Jess; your contribution
was more than invaluable. I could not have done this book without you.
And my whole family climbed into this creative process: my dearest
husband, Mac, who never seems to get tired of listening to me teach, who
is consistently excited about the messages I share, and who gave up a
flourishing business to run our organization. He unconditionally looks
after my every need---he is outstanding and exceptional as a husband,
father, and businessman. I love you endlessly, Mac. Dominique, my second
daughter, would encourage me over the phone in the midst of her busy
studies at university. With her passion for healthy, quality food, she
became a great sounding board for my ideas. She also climbed into the
kitchen to help

develop delicious recipes. Jeffrey, my son, kept us all grounded and
amused with his calm, philosophical nature as passionate discussions of
ending hunger and resisting big food corporations arose during
mealtimes. Alexy, my youngest daughter, literally stretched my mind as
she challenged me to explain the neuroscientific concepts I propose in
this book---and adequately so, as this is her field of interest. She
came up with the concept of "the mindset behind the meal." I acknowledge
Dr. Peter Amua-Quarshie, who for seven years has been my scientific
advisor, patiently listening as I have challenged scientific paradigms
in memory and thinking, all while keeping an eye on my scientific
accuracy. He also spent weeks combing through the 1,500-plus citations I
worked from for this book. Finally, I wish acknowledge the exceptional
Baker Books publishing team---I could not wish for a better one. They
have given me the freedom to explore and express my research and have
been professional and supportive and enthusiastic. Chad Allen, Karen
Lee-Thorp, Brianna DeWitt, Mark Rice, Lindsey Spoolstra, Hannah Brinks,
and the whole team---thank you. You are wonderful.

Prologue

You may have heard that our global food production system is deeply
flawed. You're right. In fact, it's probably worse than you imagine.
Fortunately, there's hope. It is possible for us to vote with our forks
for better practices that respect our health and the health of the
planet. To begin voting for a better way, we need to increase our
knowledge about food and food practices. We need to improve our shopping
and cooking skills. And, most importantly, we need to change our
attitudes toward food, health, healing, and nutrition. Once we have
opened our minds to a new, healthy way of approaching food, and have
started removing unhealthy foods and habits from our everyday lives, we
will have entered a culinary world bursting with magnificent smells,
tastes, sights, sounds, and feelings that will bring joy to both our
mouths and our stomachs. Yet such changes will require more than a bit
of effort. This book is not a
feel-good-quick-fix-magic-solution-pop-a-pill-latest-food-fad-I-have-theonly-solution
diet. It is a long-term, sustainable challenge to a big problem: what to
eat in our world today. It is an attempt to reintroduce a culture of
thinking and effort back into eating, one based on diligently stewarding
the body and world God has entrusted to us. In the spirit of renewing
the mind, it is a lifestyle book that seeks to reimagine what we eat
within an integrated spirit, mind, and body framework (Rom. 12:2; 1
Thess. 5:23). The mind is a key factor throughout this book. Thinking,
as you will see, plays a dominant role in eating. Toxic thoughts can
negate the positive effects of good nutrition. Healthy thoughts can
enhance the effects of good nutrition and mitigate the effects of bad
nutrition---to a degree. In fact, healthy thoughts lead to better food
choices. Eating and thinking are so intertwined that what you are
thinking about before, during, and after eating will impact every single
one of the 75--100 trillion cells in your body, including the cells of
your digestive system. Your state of mind will have a

negative or positive influence on your digestive health, and your
digestive health will also have a negative or positive influence on your
state of mind. One reason I felt convicted to write this book is because
of the plethora of complicated and conflicting messages about food we
are all exposed to. There is always someone new telling us they have the
solution to everyone's dietary and/or exercise habits, suggesting that
if we don't follow their advice we will surely drop dead. Even a lot of
nutritional advice from so-called experts is often based on overblown
correlations and inaccurate interpretations. And that is not even
mentioning the \$50 billion supplement industry. I worked out that if I
had to follow the advice of just one company, I would be taking up to
sixty-five different tablets, three times a day! The fact is we are all
unique, which means that a way of eating, exercising, and sleeping that
works for you may not work for me, even if it is a healthy lifestyle and
a real food diet, which I will discuss in part 1. Let's take juicing as
an example. This has spiraled in popularity and for good reason; it is a
great way of getting all those necessary fruits and veggies into your
daily intake. But I personally get very lethargic and uncomfortable
after drinking any type of juice (and I have pretty much tried every
combination). I prefer to get my daily intake of veggies in other ways.
So this book will not give you the solution but rather teach you how to
be your own solution, with the help and guidance of the Holy Spirit.
Rather than getting caught up in whether we should go paleo, vegan,
vegetarian, gluten-free, plant-based, raw vegan, or follow the blood
type diet or even genetic typing (to mention just a few diets that are
popular today), it would be much better to understand the fundamentals
of eating, the completely entangled relationship between thinking and
food, and how our uniqueness spreads throughout our spirit, soul, and
body. ------------ The book is divided into three parts that will help
you begin approaching these issues with a renewed mindset. Part 1,
"Admit It!" deals with the dysfunctional state of our current food
system, and how far it has become removed from the concept of real
food---the real food system God gave us. Part 2, "Quit It!" focuses on
the power of the mind and the impact of toxic thinking and toxic food
choices on the brain and body. Part 3, "Beat It!" deals with lifestyle
changes that can help you begin the task of thinking and

eating yourself smart. It includes twenty-one of my family's favorite
recipes, which can help you apply these lifestyle changes in your
kitchen and your tummy! I am not a dietician, nutritionist, or medical
doctor. My area of expertise is the mind, and I have approached eating
from this perspective. After extensive research for years in aspects
related to mind, brain, and body health from a scientific perspective, I
personally do not think you have to have a degree in nutritional science
to know what you should put in your mouth. I think the fact that we feel
we cannot even make our own food choices anymore without the help of an
"expert" is a sign of just how broken our food system has become.
Indeed, the field of nutrition is massive, and the research is so
extensive that it is not possible in a book of this size or nature to
present all sides of every argument. To this end, I have had to be
selective and have included as many original sources as possible to
encourage and empower you to make your own choices---to encourage and
empower you to think and eat yourself smart in every area of your life.
God has given us a choice: life or death, blessings or curses (Deut.
30:19). He has also given us, through the incredible power in our sound
minds, the ability to act on these choices and transform our world (2
Tim. 1:7). And the world we live in desperately needs transformation.
Today, nearly a billion people are hungry and almost two billion people
are overweight or obese.1 Indeed, for the first time in our recorded
history, millions of people across the world are both overweight and
starving: dying of lifestyle diseases that are preventable.2 The
exploitation and waste of the earth's natural resources, partnered with
a dramatically expanding world population and increasing levels of
chronic diseases, have led many to question what we should eat, how
people will eat, and the way in which our current food production system
has contributed to these issues. Despite all our advances---and there
are many to be proud of---millions of people are condemned to live out
their days in doctors' offices or dying of extreme hunger; the rest of
us are confounded by the latest nutritional advice, marketing campaigns,
and calorie-dense foods of a global food industry. What exactly is
stopping us from avoiding illnesses and premature deaths that are
largely preventable? How have our choices led us down this destructive
road, away from God's perfect plan for our lives (Jer. 29:11)?

These tragic facts compel us to question the way we think about our
food. As the stewards of God's creation (Gen. 1--2), we are not only
responsible for our own wellbeing---spirit, soul, and body---but that of
the entire world: a world that God so loved that he was willing to send
his one and only Son to save it (John 3:16).3 We can change nothing
until we fully comprehend what needs to be changed. Just as every action
first begins with a thought, we, as the children of the Creator of this
beautiful universe, first have to understand the broken food system we
face (Col. 1:15--20). We have to take these thoughts captive unto Christ
Jesus, asking him to guide our minds and show us the way forward (2 Cor.
10:5). And, as we renew the way we think about what we eat and how we
eat it, we take the first step to renewing our health and the health of
God's wonderful planet (Rom. 12:2). Only after we admit it can we quit
it and beat it. The choice is ours.

P ART 1

ADMIT IT!

1 Real Food and the MAD Way of Eating

Today, the McDonald's logo is more recognizable than the Christian
cross.1 And just as the cross represents Christianity, the McDonald's M
can be seen as the image of what has come to be known as the Western
Diet, appropriately referred to by its acronym MAD: the Modern American
Diet.2

The Diversity of Diet Throughout our history, human beings have
survived, and thrived, on a diversity of diets.3 The early Hawaiian
peoples, for example, ate a diet that could be called "high carb" in
today's nutritional language, with the majority of their calorie intake
derived from the foods traditionally grown on the island.4 The African
Maasai tribe's traditional diet, one that my own husband Mac grew up on,
largely consists of grass-fed beef and dairy products, including cow's
blood. The people that inhabit the Japanese island of Okinawa have
customarily eaten a largely vegetarian diet, with limited amounts of
fish and meat products.5 Traditional cuisines are as diverse as they are
delicious. Human beings are also able to adapt to different ways of
eating over time. The original researchers who examined the
Mediterranean diet, for instance, found that it took several weeks for
foreigners on Crete to adapt to the diet, and in particular the olive
oil consumption, of the native islanders. Indeed, after suffering quite
a bit of initial gastric discomfort, these foreigners reported an
improvement to their overall eating habits and health after several
weeks.6 Similarly, over time certain populations have become better
adapted at digesting starch, resulting in a greater number of AMY 1

copies of the enzyme amylase in their genes, which enable these
individuals to break down carbohydrates more easily.7 Indeed,
differences in diet are found not only between communities but within
them as well. In my family alone, we have had to learn how to navigate a
diverse range of foods. I can only tolerate bland meals and get ill from
fungi, gluten, avocado, and tree nuts. My husband and three daughters,
however, adore avocados, mushrooms, and nuts, and eat rich, spicy foods.
Yet my two eldest daughters cannot digest lactose well, while my
youngest daughter has a love affair with cheese. My son, on the other
hand, can eat anything, including gluten and dairy. Trying to decide
what we are going to have for dinner is quite a challenge, as I am sure
you can imagine! A consistent theme across dietary research is that
there is no one way of eating that works perfectly for everyone. God
created fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and all the other important
nutritional building blocks that make up the food we eat---all perfectly
and intricately balanced within real, whole foods. Essentially, we all
have to safely experiment within the context of our unique situations,
and, like Daniel in the Babylonian court, find a way of eating that is
God-centered, enabling us to thrive and carry out God's will (Dan. 1).
We are fearfully and wonderfully made, and our uniqueness pervades every
part of our lives, including what we eat (Ps. 139:14). We, like Daniel
and his companions, have to find a way of eating that suits us, so that
we can run the race that God has set before us (Heb. 12:1).

Real Food Is Wired for Love Yet there is one thing the cultures
discussed above have in common: they eat real food.8 This may sound
obvious at first. What else can we eat, besides real food?
Unfortunately, this is where the MAD is unique. Despite the apparent
diversity of foodstuffs in our grocery stores, restaurants, and homes,
many of the products available for purchase today are industrially
manufactured "food-like products," as journalist and activist Michael
Pollan calls them.9 They contain unfamiliar substances that extend shelf
life and flavor, and are often derived from just three highly processed
commodities: corn, soy, and wheat.10

Real food is food grown the way God intended: fresh and nutritious,
predominantly local, seasonal, grass-fed, as wild as possible, free of
synthetic chemicals, whole or minimally processed, and ecologically
diverse. It is grown according to God's multifaceted genius, transfused
throughout interconnected ecosystems, because he created our ecosystems.
If there has been one consistent theme across the research I have done
for this book, it is that our food systems are wired for love: when we
care about the way our food is produced, and care about "what the
animals we eat, eat," we consume foods that are the most nourishing for
us.11 For instance, humans (like many other species) are most attracted
to fruits when they are fresh, ripe, and succulent, which also happens
to be when these fruits are incredibly nutritious.12 Similarly, animals
that have been treated humanely and allowed to roam in an ecologically
rich environment are more nutritious for us to consume, with a higher
omega-3 fatty acid content, to mention just one of the many benefits.13
Seasonal, natural, and local are not just trendy bywords. These words
actually indicate food choices based on a growing body of evidence on
the benefits of locally produced foods grown in strong, diverse
ecosystems and eaten as fresh as is possible in a world where not
everyone is a farmer. Indeed, many of the best chefs source local,
organically grown foods not necessarily for their nutritional benefit
but for their wholesome and rich flavor---good nutrition and good flavor
are inseparable.14

Organic versus Conventional Agriculture To understand what real food
means, we need to examine a hot topic: organic agriculture. The terms
organic and conventional are controversial and have many
interpretations. Essentially, organic farming is mainly based on
biology, or "using living organisms rather than synthetic chemicals,"
while conventional farming is mainly based on chemistry, using synthetic
substances such as pesticides and growth hormones.15 Over the past
several decades, conventional agriculture has come to dominate global
food production. This dominance has helped to produce the modern food
industry, with its large supermarkets and fast-food establishments,
through increased yields at lower prices.16 Organic farming, because it
rarely uses chemicals, has to adapt to the local environment. This

adaptation promotes biodiversity through smaller and more varied
yields.17 Organic farms are therefore generally considered more
ecologically sustainable; they use roughly 30 percent less energy than
conventional agriculture and are less toxic to living organisms.18 The
synthetic chemicals used on conventional farms are, of course, tested
for safety before application. Yet they are examined individually and in
laboratories, not in the complexity of the real world. For instance, one
pesticide in residual amounts may be certified as safe for human
consumption, but what of the combination of all the chemicals used?19
With an estimated 516 million pounds of pesticides sprayed on
conventional crops each year in the United States alone, this question
should deeply concern us.20 What is the cumulative effect of these
artificial substances, particularly in our chemically laden world, where
over a hundred synthetic substances are in our bodies at any given
moment?21 And what of the estimated two hundred million pounds of toxic
substances that industrial agriculture leeches into American water
systems per year?22 As biologist and Berkley professor Dr. Tyrone Hayes
notes, it is akin to your doctor giving you potentially harmful pills
without asking you what other medication you are taking.23 Additionally,
more and more research suggests that even residual, "safe" amounts of
chemicals may in fact be more damaging than larger amounts, particularly
on the endocrine system.24 We also have to ask ourselves how applicable
these laboratory studies, mainly carried out on animals, are in terms of
human health. We cannot subject humans to similar laboratory testing for
ethical reasons (although I certainly agree that there are serious
considerations concerning animal testing as well). Yet results from
studies done on animals do not prove beyond all doubt that such
chemicals are safe for human ingestion.25 Animal studies are ultimately
just that: animal studies. We cannot copy and paste results from these
experiments onto real-life scenarios involving humans. Indeed, in
science the absence of harm does not necessarily equal the presence of
safety, since it is not a system of absolute certainty.26 Unfortunately,
synthetic substances are used not only in conventional agriculture but
also in conventional feedlots, which is why organic animal products have
several particular stipulations. For instance, the USDA requires that
organic animals are raised on certified organic land, fed organic
grasses or grains, never given antibiotics or growth hormones, and have
outdoor access.27 There is, however, room to interpret these

regulations, regardless of how happy the hens may look on the
packaging.28 For instance, "outdoor access" could be just a small patch
of dirt in some large-scale certified organic farms, with limited
opportunities for the animals to graze.29

The Organic-Industrial Complex When we start to talk about large-scale
organic operations, some of the benefits of organic farming mentioned
above become clouded. As Pollan points out in The Omnivore's Dilemma: A
Natural History of Four Meals, how environmentally friendly is the mass
transportation of organic products across states, and indeed, across
countries? What about the environmental impact of large-scale organic
farming operations? And what of the occasional application of organic
pesticides, sometimes applied in greater quantities than their synthetic
equivalents for the same effect?30 Since one of the founding ideals of
the organic movement is the restoration of the relationship between
consumer and producer, thereby restoring trust and mutual obligations in
the arena of food production, the rise of an organic industry is
perplexing.31 How can I know that my food is farmed, as far as possible,
in an organic manner if I am so removed from the farmers who grow it?
How fresh, nutritious, and "sustainable" is such a system, particularly
when my vegetables are picked, shipped, and packaged many days, and
sometimes even weeks, before I consume them?32 Thus, in choosing real
food, we need to think about the spirit of organic agriculture rather
than blindly accept the label "organic."

Real Food and the Modern Supermarket Now that we have a definition of
real food and some idea of the difference between conventional and
organic agriculture, we can take a look at our local supermarket and
assess how real the food sold there is. Let's start with organic foods.
The word organic has taken on an almost religious significance with
consumers, yet here is a subtle trap: organic foods can also be refined,
preserved, and highly processed. Organic cookies after your organic
microwave TV dinner, anyone? The terms organic and healthy are not
interchangeable.33 We have seen that real food is "whole"

food: unprocessed fruits and vegetables, meats, dairy products, nuts,
seeds, and grains. Real food should, by and large, be processed in a
kitchen, not a factory. Foods that are packaged and transported hundreds
of miles should come under our scrutiny, since this is another food
industry snare. Organically farmed kiwi fruit from New Zealand, when you
live in New Zealand, is a great option, yet the same cannot be said if
you live in Texas. Why? Well, in order to maintain the shelf life and
further improve the sight, smell, taste, and texture of these
long-distance products---both organic and conventional ---something has
to be done to them to prevent them from rotting. These foods have to be
processed in some way, even if the "processing" means picking the
produce when it is unripe and adding gases to the packaging so that it
withstands long-distance shipping.34 Shipping foods over long distances
drains the ability of these foods to truly nourish us. Broccoli, for
instance, loses many of its nutrients two to three days after being
picked, and most of its nutrients after a week.35 Similarly, many citrus
fruits are picked before they are ripe and sprayed with ethylene gas, so
that you can buy a nice-colored fruit---a fruit that is not necessarily
any more ripe and nutritious than its former green self.36 "Fresh" in a
supermarket does not necessarily mean that the fruit or vegetables were
picked that day or week or even month.37 In most cases, "fresh" just
means that these foods rot sooner than the highly processed, sugary
products found in the middle aisles of the store.38 Indeed, how "fresh"
can your vegetables truly be if they have traveled fifteen hundred miles
to get to the supermarket---the average distance that "food-like
products" travel in the United States alone?39 As much as it may sound
logical to preserve our foods from rotting so we don't get ill, we ought
to first ask ourselves the simple question: Why do real, whole foods
spoil in the first place? The answer is we are supposed to eat food that
is as fresh as possible, much like manna given to the Israelites in the
desert (Exod. 16). As Pollan discusses in Food Rules, the nutrients in
most foods (with the exception of some foods such as honey) attract not
only us, but also other living organisms, including the microbes that
cause food to rot and make us ill.40 To create foods that can last for
days, weeks, or even months on the shelf, and can be transported across
states and countries, food corporations have to reduce the nutrient
content, while

adding preservatives and additives to maintain freshness, flavor, and
texture.41 The snare of "long-life" foods can directly affect our
health. Take the average loaf of bread available today. To adapt the
production of bread to the food industry's goal of a large market for
cheaply and efficiently produced foodstuffs, the wheat germ, which
contains the natural oils that give bread its true, wholesome flavor and
make it nutritious, has to be removed, since it causes bread to rot
within a day. To make up for this loss of flavor and texture, the wheat,
after it is heavily processed into white flour, is made into a
bread-like product that contains preservatives and additives such as the
infamous high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).42 Or, in the case of many
organic packaged breads that last for days, organic sugars and other
strange-sounding ingredients are added. These preservatives and
additives have serious side effects.43 For instance, azodicarbonamide, a
synthetic chemical used to manufacture rubber and plastic, is used in
the United States as the food additive E927 to bleach flour and
condition dough in industrial bread production.44 This same chemical may
cause respiratory problems, such as asthma and allergies, in the workers
who come into contact with it, while there are no conclusive studies
that show the additive is safe for large-scale human consumption.45 As a
result, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people
should avoid this chemical as far as possible, since the risk of
ingesting it is largely unknown, and a number of countries (such as the
European Union and Singapore) have made its usage illegal.46 Efficiency
and affordability are often traps in themselves, with costs that are not
apparent in the purchasing price of many modern foods. A major part of
that hidden price is reduced nutritional content, the loss of wholesome
flavor, and the impact these foods have on our physical health, in
exchange for convenient meals with an extended shelf life in our
pantries. Instead of taking the wheat germ out of the bread for our
convenience, we should ask ourselves why God created wheat like that in
the first place. Yet even if we avoid the bread aisle, the architectural
layout of the modern supermarket, designed to influence our food
choices, poses a threat to our health. Grocery stores, for example,
deliberately place candy and chocolate bars by the checkout counter in
order to promote "impulse buying." The less time we spend thinking about
the health effects of

consuming too much sugar, the more likely we will buy the candy.47
Likewise, healthier products are often put close to the bottom on the
shelves, while processed, sugary foods with bright packaging are put at
eye level, socially conditioning us to buy more of them.48 How real,
then, is the food in our supermarkets? Real food, again, is fresh and
nutritious, predominantly local, seasonal, grass fed, as wild as
possible, free of synthetic chemicals, whole or minimally processed, and
ecologically diverse. We have seen that in our supermarkets, even the
fresh produce isn't very fresh. Foods are no longer whole, but processed
to extend shelf life. They travel long distances. And synthetic
chemicals are used freely. Even this quick snapshot is looking bleak.

A Better Approach: Let's Get "Agro-Ecological" But if our nearest
supermarket isn't a good source of real food, what other options do we
have? We'll explore that question in more detail in part 3, but here I
will give you just a sketch of the solutions my family has found. To
ensure that the food we eat is as fresh, nutritionally dense, and whole
as possible, we buy local, organically produced food as much as we can.
Although "buying local" has become a trend over the past several years,
both organic and conventional farming practices can, indeed, be local;
there is no official definition.49 We understand it as merely knowing
the faces and facts behind our dinner plates---particularly because
these foods are more expensive. In order to achieve this goal, we have
planted an herb garden in our backyard with a few hanging fruits (it is
a work in progress), and we are part of a community-supported
agriculture (CSA) system: a co-op where we purchase meat, egg, and
produce shares from local, organically operated farms that are delivered
on a biweekly basis. If necessary, we supplement our CSA foods with
items bought from local farmstead stores and grocers. Most of our meals
are home cooked, and occasionally we will treat ourselves to a delicious
dinner at a local organic farm-to-table restaurant. If we are going to
pay more for the food we purchase or grow ourselves, we intend to
steward our money wisely, since we view our money, and indeed the whole
of creation, as a gift from God, one that we will be held accountable
for (Matt. 25:14--30). When we purchase local, sustainably, and
organically grown produce or garden items from the local farmers' market

or grocery store, for example, we not only build a relationship with the
individuals who produce and sell our food but we also have firsthand
access to the knowledge of how our food was grown, as well as access to
fresher and thereby more nutritious produce.50 In turn, this knowledge
increases our appreciation for the wonderful gift of real food. It also
enables us to support the wonderful people in our community who work
hard to grow this food, care for our local environment, and worship our
wonderful Creator (Matt. 14:19). It is easy to believe in God when you
see his majestic work in nature, including cow manure, earthworms, and
zucchini shrubs! We use an "agro-ecological" measuring stick to define
real food. This is a fancy way of saying that, out of love for God's
creation and our fellow man, we would like to respect and understand the
whole environment our food is grown in, the people who grow it, and the
people who eat it. Agroecological farming methods essentially imitate,
adapt to, and work with nature.51 I am not, however, against purchasing
any foods grown in different regions of the world. We are a family of
coffee, tea, dark chocolate, banana, mango, and quinoa lovers---all of
which have to be sourced from outside the United States. Yet we continue
to apply an agro-ecological measuring stick to these foods as well: we
only purchase items that are fairly traded, sustainable, and organically
produced. Not only do these foods help developing regions "grow
themselves out of poverty" by supporting local economies, ecosystems,
and independent farmers but they are also far more delicious than their
chemically laden counterparts and more nutritious.52 I do believe that a
local, sustainable food system can incorporate many global aspects, just
as the Slow Food movement (which began in Italy as a response to the
industrialization of our food system) is dominated by a global
appreciation of real, slowly prepared, and naturally produced local
foods.53 Ultimately, our food choices first begin as thoughts, and
taking every thought captive unto Christ Jesus includes our thoughts
about food. It is essential that we strive for perfection in every area
of our lives, including the food we buy and eat, just as our heavenly
Father is perfect (Matt. 5:48). As a family we therefore practice, to
the best of our abilities, what is known as conscious consumerism: think
before we buy.54 As the apostle Paul declares, "Whether you eat or drink
or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God" (1 Cor. 10:31 NIV).
Over time we have developed the love-

based habit of thinking about how our food was produced---a habit I will
be talking more about in parts 2 and 3 of this book. Before we spend
more time on solutions, however, we need to look more deeply at the
flaws in our modern food industry. We will turn next to the problems
caused by the mass production of crops and animals.

2 The Trouble with Mass Production

God created a natural world that is characterized by incredible
diversity (Gen. 1). This ecological variety helps to prevent disease
through the special functions, or what I like to call the "I-factors,"
unique to each species within the ecosystem, just as each of us is
uniquely made in the image of God with a specific, love-based purpose in
his plan. From the thousands of species of bees that pollinate our world
to the millions of tiny microorganisms that enrich our soils, the world
is wired for love and life. In contrast to this rich diversity within
each ecosystem, imagine an ecosystem in which a single species of a
single plant dominates. This is what we have on many massive farms
today. Picture wheat or corn---one species---as far as the eye can see
in every direction. This is called monoculture, the mass production of
single ("mono") crops. Food monocultures, such as corn, soy, or wheat,
and the factory farming of animals both focus on the mass production of
a single species and are removing the delicate ecological balance found
in diversity.1 In 1904, for instance, there were over seven thousand
varieties of apples grown in the United States. Today, we have lost
roughly 86 percent of these varieties.2 Certainly, God has given us the
freedom to choose, but we are not free from the consequences of our
choices. And the consequences of a monoculturestyle food system are the
necessary use of artificial substances such as pesticides to merely keep
crops alive, the loss of diversity and thereby health, and the
destruction of our planet.3 Indeed, the majority of us today consume
foods that essentially come from plants kept alive on an IV of synthetic
substances.4 These plants survive our manipulation of the natural
diversity found in nature, but they do not thrive in such conditions.
And, with the alarming loss of 75 percent

of our natural agricultural diversity, seed banks (such as the
well-known Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway) are being established
across the globe to urgently save as many varieties of produce and
grains as possible.5 Is this a healthy situation? What happens if the
crop of that one particular species is infected with some kind of
fungus, for instance? The midnineteenth-century Irish potato famine,
although it happened in a different time in history, with its own unique
origins and results, can still serve as a warning for us today. All of
Ireland was crippled because it had put its faith in one variety of one
crop, the Lumper potato. When these potatoes were infected with fungus,
an unknown strain of Phytophthora infestans, they turned into a
revolting mush. Around a million people starved to death, while
countless others were compelled to leave their homeland.6 With our
continued reliance on monocultures such as corn, soy, and wheat, there
is the very real danger that our global food production is at risk of
failing in a similar manner.7

Corn and Soy: Our "Golden" Crops? Why have corn and soy in particular
become the dominant monocultures today? Although the changes in American
agriculture over the past several decades are manifold and complex, one
of the turning points was the Farm Bill of 1933, which was a response to
the need for an adequate food supply during the Great Depression. A
great and admirable goal: millions of Americans were starving, and the
individuals behind this bill were passionately driven to help them.
However, this same bill, which is reintroduced every five years,
continues to promote the large-scale government subsidization of corn
and soy production in the United States, despite the fact that the
times, and the issues we face, have changed dramatically.8 However, the
overproduction of corn and soy only began around fortyfive years ago.
Previously, the Farm Bill paid farmers not to overproduce grains that no
one could afford to buy. In the 1970s, the US government shifted its
farm policy toward the support of large, consolidated, one-crop farming
operations rather than traditional, diverse family farms, since large
operations could produce far more food at lower prices. It was the time
of US Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz's "get big or get out": no
longer

would the US government pay farmers not to overproduce corn. Now the
motto of the day was "fence row to fence row": produce as much of these
single crops as possible by employing as much scientific and
technological help as humans could provide.9 Joining the US government's
"get big" support with its own, the oil industry further consolidated
this trend toward large monoculture farms. Big farms, with their big
technologies, require a big bit of oil: the global food industry is
largely run on fossil fuels, while it supports the petroleum industry
through the development of corn ethanol. Now, at the average gas station
in the United States, you can find corn-based nourishment for not only
yourself, at the small convenience store, but your car as well: the corn
sources of both "foods" are often one and the same. It therefore should
not surprise us that agribusiness's special interest lobbying power in
Washington is second only to the oil industry's, while members of the US
government are often supported by Big Agriculture's dollars during
election campaigns.10 This monetary influence is particularly alarming
in light of the fact that many economists consider the use of food for
fuel as a major contributor to the high price of food today, further
exacerbating our global food crisis.11 And there certainly is a lot of
corn and soy to go around. These two crops account for roughly half of
the three hundred million acres of farmland in production in the United
States, while just fourteen million acres produce "specialty crops" such
as vegetables and fruit (the other major staple produced in the United
States is wheat). This large-scale subsidization has, in turn, allowed
food companies to manufacture cheap corn-, soy- and wheat-based products
in equally large numbers and to provide us with what appears to be an
unlimited variety of foodstuffs. Indeed, it is estimated that the modern
American food industry produces an average of six thousand calories per
person per day, while more than seventeen thousand new industrial food
products are introduced each year.12 Of these products, a startling 77
percent come from corn, soy, and wheat.13

Great Yields at Great Cost: Mass Animal Production Without these farm
subsidies, the shelves of our grocery stores would not be filled with
meat and dairy products, and a burger would not cost a

dollar.14 What do corn and soy have to do with meat and dairy? Today,
animal feed is made up largely of corn and soy. The modern food industry
has taken animals off the farm and placed them in industrial facilities
called CAFOs, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations. These facilities
are often located in different states and are specifically geared toward
feeding, slaughtering, or packaging meat on an industrial scale.15
Indeed, you need look no further than the average supermarket: rows and
rows of neatly packaged pieces of meat overwhelm the customer with
choices. It is estimated that these industrial feedlots have doubled
meat production in the United States alone over the last fifty years.16
Within these operations, it is both cheaper and less time-consuming to
feed the animals corn and soy in confined spaces, even though these
grainbased, immobile diets are not well adapted to the way God created
these animals. For example, cattle have rumens, which are designed to
digest various grasses and plants, not massive amounts of grain, and as
a result these cattle are more prone to disease and general ill health,
such as stomach ulcers, while they are less nutritious to consume. God
designed cattle as animals that graze over stretches of grass, but these
industrial operations work on economies of time and scale: confined
cattle eat all day, getting fatter in a much shorter space of time,
while a single operation can hold far more cattle in a smaller space.17
In the feces-covered facilities of many industrial operations, these
grainbased diets necessitate the large-scale use of antibiotics (80
percent of all antibiotics in the United States alone) to simply prevent
the animals from dying. This has significantly contributed to the global
antibiotic-resistance crisis. Many animals are also given growth
hormones to further speed up the fattening process.18 These hormones are
associated with a number of health risks in both animals and humans,
including a possible correlation with cancer, which is why many
countries no longer permit the use of hormones in industrial meat
production.19 Yet the animals are not just fed corn and soy. Expired
cookies, candy, and even other animals are often turned into feed,
including feed for large-scale dairy operations. We have turned
herbivores like cattle into carnivores, often with fatal side effects.
Perhaps the most infamous example of this is the recent epidemic of mad
cow disease, a variant of bovine spongiform encephalopathy that leads to
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans.20

In the United Kingdom, cows that were fed the remains of other cows in
meat and bone meal contracted this disease, killing over a hundred
people in 1996. Although this major incident shows the dangers of
feeding animals to other animals, it is often still considered an
economically viable practice for industrial operations. Many feedlots in
the United States, for instance, feed their cows chicken meat, while
some companies even consider it "sustainable" to feed chicken to farmed
fish.21 Unfortunately, these cruelties have not subsided over time. If
you live in America, your tax dollars are currently being used to fund
research on the immunocastration of male pigs (boars) to improve the
flavor of the animals and make them easier to handle inside the CAFOs.22
In fact, pigs' tails are already cut off inside these confined
facilities, since when the animals are stressed they tend to chew them
off.23 Similarly, chickens have part of their beaks sawed off, since
they too are destructive when stressed.24 Are we being good stewards of
God's magnificent creation?

Animals, Workers, and the Environment: All Are Affected These industrial
meat operations are sources of cruelty not only to the animals they
intend to slaughter but often to their employees as well. In Fast Food
Nation, Schlosser highlights the disturbing abuse of workers, in
particular migrant and nonlegal peoples, within the American meat and
fastfood industries.25 The poignant 2014 documentary Food Chains further
highlights the injustice faced by many of the people who produce the
food we consume today.26 Indeed, human trafficking is a dominant issue
in agriculture, both within the United States and globally. Slaves are
used to pick fruit and vegetables on a number of commercial farms, in
meatpacking factories, and in food-service establishments, while the
trafficking of women for sexual purposes often accompanies the
development of large commodity farms with many laborers.27 In some cases
it is impossible for these industrial operations to even find people
willing to work, compelling these companies to use prisoners to
slaughter the animals. In light of these circumstances, where injury and
death are ever-present, is it any wonder that many employees in
slaughterhouses develop pathological disorders? 28 In fact, within the
often-merciless logic of the industry, the abuse of not only labor but
also the environment is often hidden behind the abundance of

"cheap" food. In CAFOs, for instance, lakes of sewage can often be found
nearby the facilities, releasing toxic gases into the air (such as
ammonia and methane) that contribute to our current global climate
crisis, while polluting the surrounding land and waterways. One CAFO can
in fact produce as much waste as a large city. Likewise, the
transportation of animals from the farms where they spend the first few
months of their lives, to the feedlots where they are fattened, to the
slaughterhouses where they are killed, to the packaging facilities where
they are transformed into neat commodities, to the various food
establishments that sell these products further contributes to global
warming. Overall, the global meat industry contributes more to global
warming than cars, trains, and planes---an alarming 18 percent of all
emissions.29 This environmental pollution is just another example of the
danger and narrow logic of monoculture production today. On smaller and
more diverse farms, the waste from animals was often used to fertilize
the crops: nature worked in tandem. By contrast, in industrial
agriculture today we have created two major issues where once we had one
solution. As Pollan notes, we took the animals off the farm to plant
more crops and created a fertility problem that requires the large-scale
use of artificial fertilizer, while we placed the animals in industrial
operations and created a waste problem that is contributing to the
destruction of God's beautiful planet.30

What Is the Real Price Tag? Yes, more people certainly can afford to
purchase meat today than ever before in our recorded history. However,
the monetary cost of cheap meat, like that of mass-produced bread and
other foodstuffs, does not reflect the true price paid to bring it to
our plates: the effect it has on the lives of the people who work in
these facilities, the damage it does to local environments, the 38.4
billion dollars a year of taxpayer money given to the meat industry in
subsidies, and the strain it puts on our own health as we overconsume
meat that is less nutritious and potentially contaminated with deadly
microbes from the process of mass production. One could include in that
price the fact that all the land used to produce animal feed (around
twothirds of arable farmland), could otherwise be used to feed the
millions of

starving people in the world today, including the estimated forty-nine
million Americans who suffer from food insecurity and hunger.31 Finally,
we can't appreciate the real price of cheap food until we consider its
effects on our health. We'll take a brief look at that next and explore
it more fully in part 2.

3 The MAD Diseases

The MAD is aptly named, since it is high in refined sugar, salt, and
saturated fat, which are added to make the processed foodstuffs edible
and attractive.1 A diet high in added sugars correlates with a greater
risk of obesity, dementia, stroke, cancer, tooth decay, insulin
resistance related to diabetes and metabolic syndrome, heart disease, an
overload of both unhealthy triglycerides and oxidized LDL
cholesterol---the list can go on and on. (For more on sugar, see chapter
17.) Excessive consumption of the high amounts of sodium in processed,
salty foods can lead to high blood pressure and heart disease, stroke,
kidney damage, cancer, weight gain, osteoporosis, and overeating---this
list is equally long and alarming.2 Processed, heated, and refined fats,
as well as "trans fats" (hydrogenated fats), are the bad fats commonly
found in foods such as margarine, shortening, your average American
pizza, and the processed cheese so widely available in grocery stores.
These bad fats have been linked to a higher risk of heart disease,
macular degeneration, multiple sclerosis, certain cancers, diabetes,
obesity, osteoporosis, infertility and endometriosis, and depression.3
(For more on fats, see chapter 16.)

A Slice of Pizza a Day Keeps the Doctor Away? With one-third of American
vegetable consumption consisting of French fries, iceberg lettuce, and
potato chips, and the US Congress having classified pizza as a
vegetable, these diet-related diseases are a daily reality for millions
of people.4 Indeed, the average American consumes around 130 pounds (60
kilograms) of sugar per year, including 53 gallons (201 liters) of

soft drinks.5 Fifty million Americans eat at fast-food restaurants
daily.6 A mere 10 percent of grocery purchases are fresh vegetables and
fruit.7 In fact, recently the American School Nutrition Association
(ASNA), which is heavily funded by food corporations and claims that its
purpose is "to better serve the nation's children," published a rather
disturbing position paper. In order to "prevent waste," fresh fruits,
vegetables, whole grains, and low-sodium options are no longer required
with every school meal, while junk food is a part of the reimbursable
food system in place in these schools and can even be sold as an
alternative to school meals.8 As a mother of four children, I am beyond
shocked that the health of our future generations is compromised by
corporate money in an institution where they should be protected.

The Other O Word: Today's Obesity Pandemic The MAD is not just an
American problem. It is one of the United States' most successful, and
ubiquitous, exports. More and more of us are eating this way, which is
leading to what the United Nations calls a "global public health
disaster."9 In truth, food corporations that manufacture vast amounts of
raw materials and processed foodstuffs (that can be transported over
thousands of miles without rotting, of course) have come to dominate
global food production, while the emerging world is one of their fastest
growing markets. Traditional food systems are increasingly being
replaced with the preserved, processed, and packaged Western foods that
already flood our eating establishments.10 Now, for example, you can
readily find soda, chips, cakes, cookies, breakfast cereals, and candy
in small convenience stores in African villages, Guatemalan towns, and
Asian cities.11 Is it any wonder, then, that soft drinks are more
readily available than clean water in many public schools in California
and many villages in Africa?12 In the past thirty-five years, the
world's obesity rate has doubled.13 According to the 2013 Global Burden
of Disease Study, around 2.1 billion individuals worldwide were
overweight or obese, while obesity-related illnesses were responsible
for 3.4 million deaths, with a 3.9 percent reduction of average life
expectancy. In fact, emerging nations have a 30 percent higher rate of
obesity than developed countries, and are particularly

at risk of diet-related illness since malnutrition and starvation early
in life contribute to an increased risk of obesity and diet-related
chronic diseases later on.14 Many obesity researchers predict that these
statistics will only take a turn for the worse. By 2030, it is estimated
that over two billion people will be overweight, while half this number
will be dangerously obese.15 In the United States alone, diet- and
exercise-related chronic diseases, which are largely preventable through
lifestyle choices, are one of the principal causes of premature death,
while 50 percent of the population will be overweight by 2030.16 More
people die now from obesity-related illnesses than cigarettes. If this
trend in rising obesity does not improve, future generations may live
shorter lives, and lives more prone to disability, than their
predecessors. Indeed, nation members of the World Health Organization
(WHO) have called for a 2025 goal to end the rising epidemic of weight
gain---this is unquestionably a global issue with profound consequences
on global health.17

The Butterfly Effect Clearly, in the globalized world we live in today,
what we buy for dinner has international repercussions---there is a
definite "butterfly effect" associated with our food choices.18 Perhaps
one of the most well-known, and indeed controversial, examples of the
global impact of food production is the 1994 North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA opened the trade borders between the United
States and Mexico, making American corn, subsidized by the US
government, cheaper to purchase. Subsequently, many Mexican farmers lost
their farms (since they could not compete with the low price of corn
grown in the United States), compelling these individuals to find work
elsewhere and contributing to the rise of illegal immigrants in the
United States.19 Likewise, labels such as "Fair Trade" or "Whole Trade"
on many foods today highlight the fact that what we choose to eat can
and does impact the people and communities that produce our foods.
Within the globalized context of our food industry, we cannot
immediately justify our food purchases by claiming that we do not hurt
anyone else when we buy them.20

It just takes one person to make a difference: read the book of Esther
and consider Esther's impact in the Persian court of King Ahasuerus.

Food Aid That Does Not Aid Unfortunately, the highly processed,
nutritionally wanting foods of the MAD also make their way into emerging
countries through American food aid policies. Regardless of the good
intentions behind these policies, the United States' emphasis on sending
its surplus food to developing nations around the globe has stifled
local economic development and food production and led to many of the
same diet-related diseases that Americans face.21 At one recent
international Slow Food convivium in Italy, the African delegates put
this threat to local food production and health starkly: "We have plenty
of resources. We have plenty of knowledge. We have plenty of workers. If
you Westerners . . . would just stay out and quit displacing our
indigenous economy and food systems with poor-quality commodities, we
can feed ourselves, thank you."22

4 The Mad Truth about the MAD

If the MAD is so dangerous for our health and the health of our planet,
why do we continue to eat this way? Part of the strong allure of our
industrial food system is its convenience, a factor that has greatly
contributed to its global success.1 In the twentieth century, as more
and more women went to work outside the home, foods that required the
least amount of time to prepare found a ready and willing market.2 Many
of us today lead incredibly busy lives, and food preparation is often
the first part of our schedules that is sacrificed in light of other
demands on our time. Buying your food at a farmers' market and coming
home to prepare a meal does take significantly longer than heating up a
prepackaged box meal in the microwave. This mealtime expediency has
allowed many of us to advance other aspects of our lives. As sustainable
food activist Oran B. Hesterman of the Fair Food Network explains, by
placing food production in the hands of roughly 2 percent of the
population, the other 98 percent have had the freedom to specialize,
which has contributed to the development of fields such as technology,
medicine, and education.3 Nevertheless, the convenience generated by the
industrialization of our food system comes at a great cost: our physical
and mental health as well as the health of our planet. In 1937, George
Orwell said, "We may find in the long run that tinned food is a deadlier
weapon than the machine-gun."4 Unfortunately, as chronic, diet-related
illnesses such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease have become
two of the leading causes of death in our world today, Orwell's words
seem prophetic.

Cheap Food: A Modern Mirage The price tag on real, whole foods such as
pasture-raised chickens and organically grown fruit and vegetables is in
many cases higher than the artificial foods that characterize the
Western Diet. However, the truth is that none of us can afford the true
price of following the MAD: its low cost is a dangerous illusion.5 When
I walk down the aisle in my neighborhood grocery store, I do not see
cheap breakfast cereals, meats, dairy products, chips, and snacks of all
shapes and sizes. I see the annual health care costs, now estimated to
be over \$100 billion, of obesity-related illness, which is predicted to
rise to over \$283 billion by 2020. I see the annual \$245 million cost
of diabetes in America, which is steadily increasing. I see the billions
of dollars of food and water waste across the globe. I see the
environmental costs of industrial food production, which costs taxpayers
billions of dollars each year.6 I see the cost to many farmers who can
no longer compete in such an industrial system of food production,
compelling them to sell their farms to meet their debts, while some
farmers have even decided to end their lives.7 I see the cost imposed on
future generations, who will inherit a broken food system and an
unhealthy planet. I see the cost to our integrity as human beings,
indeed as Christians, as we support a food system that allows millions
of people to die of obesity, malnutrition, or starvation while we misuse
God's earth. There is no such thing as cheap food.8

Fighting for a Better Meal I do understand and fully appreciate that
millions of people cannot afford real, whole foods, which is one of the
principal tragedies of our dysfunctional food system---a system that has
"forgotten to feed people well."9 There certainly are a number of
amazing individuals out there, fighting for the right of all people to
have access to real, whole foods. In New York, a teacher in the Bronx
named Stephen Ritz began growing healthy foods in his classroom,
teaching low-income children from broken neighborhoods the skills to
create "new green graffiti."10 Ron Finley, who calls himself the
"guerrilla gardener," started growing organic foods for his South
Central Los Angeles neighborhood, which is a federally recognized "food
desert"---there is no fresh produce available in the immediate

vicinity.11 My eldest daughter volunteers in a food desert in the
Dallas--Fort Worth metroplex, where a dilapidated football field has
been transformed into an organic farm (after supermarket vendors refused
to establish a grocery store in the area, since they would not be able
to earn enough money) under the management of Elizabeth Hernandez.12
Indeed, the farm supplies vegetables to local farmers' markets and
restaurants, including one of our favorite places to eat in Dallas: Café
Momentum. The restaurant's executive chef, Chad Houser, takes former
juvenile offenders and trains them to become chefs, truly embodying the
spirit of their motto: "Eat. Drink. Change Lives."13 On alternate
Saturdays, my daughter also volunteers at a farm that supplies both Café
Momentum and our own CSA, Happy Trails Farm, which is run by Fina
Longoria-Johnson, her husband Larry, and her daughter-in-law Jessica
Longoria.14 Stephen Ritz, Ron Finley, Elizabeth Hernandez, Chad Houser,
Fina Longoria-Johnson, Larry Johnson, and Jessica Longoria: these are
the true, everyday heroes of the sustainable food movement. And you can
be one too. In the end, unless we all collectively participate in
re-creating the way we grow and eat our food, we will have a system that
continues to choose disease and death over life (Deut. 30:19). We all
have to fight, in whatever way we can, for a better meal, since we all
deserve to eat real food that nourishes us. The United Nations'
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states that "everyone ought
to have the ability to choose a healthy, wholesome way of eating insofar
as they have a right to a healthy, wholesome life."15 If God feeds the
"birds of the air," how much more does he care for our nourishment as
his children (Matt. 6:26)? This right should not be denied by large
corporations eager to maintain the goodwill of their shareholders, nor
should it be denied by government officials eager to maintain the
goodwill and financial support of large corporations.16 Our food crisis
is principally a matter of the dignity of each human being on this
planet---of every member of God's creation. Many of us can afford to
purchase more real, whole foods from local producers who are truly
attempting to create a sustainable food system. In the United States in
particular, people spend less money on food than the rest of the
developed world (around 13.2 percent of their income), while it is
estimated that 90 percent of the average American food budget is spent
on highly refined and processed foodstuffs. In 2011 Americans spent
\$117 billion on fast food, \$65 billion on soft drinks, \$17 billion on
video games,

\$5 billion on ringtones, and \$310 million on pet Halloween costumes,
just to name a few categories.17 These statistics are shocking
eye-openers, calling for us all to take personal responsibility. And
according to the Centers for Disease Control, income status is not a
determinant of fast-food purchases in the United States: people do not
just buy fast food because that is all they can afford.18 If we value
our health and the health of our beautiful planet and all its
inhabitants, why are we not willing to pay a little more for
nutritionally dense, wholesome foods by budgeting elsewhere?19 Is our
wellbeing, and the wellbeing of future generations, not worth giving up
that large soda and cheeseburger, or dressing up our dog as a fairy on
October 31?

Vote with Your Forks and Votes It is essential that we not only "vote
with our votes" to demand official changes in food policy and support
government officials who are trying to change our current food system
but also "vote with our forks."20 Every time we buy food, we support the
system that produced it, contributing to its perpetuation. As
sustainable food activist Ellen Gustafson highlights in We the Eaters:
If We Change Dinner, We Can Change the World, as consumers we have the
ability to demand better food production, both for ourselves and for the
rest of the planet, through refusing to buy products that are
destructive to our health and the health of the communities that produce
them. When we buy fair trade chocolate, we tell chocolate companies that
it is not acceptable to use cocoa beans harvested by child slavery, and
that we cannot wait until 2020 to end this travesty. When we buy at
farmers' markets that sell local and organically produced foods, we tell
food corporations and our government that creating healthy, ecologically
friendly communities is more important than convenient, cheap, and
unhealthy food; that we, and every other person in the world, should
have access to fresh, whole foods, and that we do not support the vast
amounts of waste that result from our current food system.21 Businesses
cannot thrive if we do not purchase their products: as consumers, we can
communicate our wishes through our pocketbooks. In fact, this consumer
demand for more natural foods is the main reason why Wal-Mart has more
and more organic options in their stores, and Whole

Foods is continually increasing their number of locally produced items.
Our consumer dollars are the main reason that many countries have banned
the use of growth hormones in industrial meat production or the use of
"pink slime" (meat processed and treated with ammonia). We,
collectively, one person at a time, have the power to change the world
by changing what we eat, and gradually make healthier foods more
accessible for more people.22 I would go even further: as Christians, it
is a way for us to communicate that our God is love, a way for us to be
a shining light in this world, by demanding products that respect his
beloved creation (Matt. 5:16).

5 Marketing to Children and Other Scandals

Convenience is not the only reason why the MAD dominates our eating
habits. We are also manipulated by research and bombarded with marketing
messages that encourage this unhealthy way of eating. Indeed, large
corporations spend millions of dollars on research annually, calculating
the precise amount of fat, sugar, and salt that will satisfy our taste
buds and keep us coming back for more, regardless of the health
consequences. For example, one of the leading centers of food research
in the United States, Monell Chemical Senses Center, has performed
experiments on young children, feeding them various sugary foods to
calculate their "bliss point," the level at which their desire for sugar
is at its climax. This data is subsequently used to formulate products
that can be marketed throughout the globe.1

Is the Health of Our Children for Sale? Shockingly, children in
particular are targeted by the food industry, as the example above
indicates. Many youngsters have what corporations call "pester power"
over their parents, or the ability to keep demanding certain products
until the parents or guardians give in. Since children and adolescents
have more and more purchasing power in today's economy, "pestering" is
an important source of income for food corporations, which is why they
are willing to spend an estimated \$1.8 billion annually on

marketing to these age groups. Targeting children when they are young is
in fact a significant way to establish lasting brand loyalty.2 The Rudd
Center for Food Policy & Obesity rightly calls this concentrated
marketing to children a "crisis in the marketplace."3 Although the US
Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) was
established in 2006 to restrict the advertising of processed foods high
in sugar, salt, and fats to children under the age of eleven, these
self-regulating efforts have largely proved inadequate. An estimated 86
percent of the food products marketed by CFBAI members to children are
still alarmingly high in processed and refined sugars, salt, and fat,
while marketing to youth over the age of eleven has increased.
Similarly, food corporations have continued to advertise their processed
food products through other channels, such as social media, which has
led to a 23 percent increase in exposure to children.4 With the obesity
rates among children increasing exponentially, alongside diet-related
illnesses such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease, the promotion of
these unhealthy food products for the sake of corporate profit is
deplorable.5

Gimme, Gimme, Gimme: The Industry Message of "Eat More" Our current
industrial food system has created an environment that essentially
floods our senses, adults and children alike, with the message of "eat
more" unhealthy, processed foods. Indeed, an estimated 70 percent of all
food-related advertising is for highly processed foods and drinks high
in sugar, salt, and fat.6 Children are even exposed to this message at
school, where vending machines, snack shops, and lunch bars are often
filled with foods high in sugar, salt, and fat. In a recent visit to a
children's hospital in Texas, I found a popular fastfood restaurant on
the ground floor, alongside multiple vending machines with sodas, chips,
and candy. I watched in horror as "food-like substances," including
soda, packaged cookies, and packaged desserts, were served to sick
children. I was stunned at the number of obese children and adults
walking the floors and sitting in the waiting rooms consuming junk food
from the vending machines. And when the doctors and nurses were eating
the same things, I had to sit down in shock. In many cases, food

corporations make the sale of their products in schools, hospitals, and
other institutions attractive by offering financial benefits in exchange
for the chance to sell their foodstuffs.7 It is a tragic state of
affairs when dollars can override health---particularly in an
institution dedicated to health!

Do You Want Vitamin C with That? Some may argue that many of these
industrially produced foods are in fact "healthy." Cereals, snacks, and
breads are "fortified" with vitamins and minerals, and meat and dairy
products have reduced fat content, for instance. Indeed, we are
bombarded with phrases like "high in Vitamin C," "full of great
antioxidants," "low fat," and a "great source of omega fatty acids," but
these are largely marketing devices supported by unhealthy scientific
reductionism.8 For example, milk in its whole, natural form is full of
essential proteins and other nutrients such as vitamins A and E, which
are fat-soluble. When we remove the fat from the milk, we lose these
fat-soluble nutrients, while the pasteurization process destroys many of
the beneficial proteins. The milk, now less nutritious and less
flavorful, needs added vitamins and flavor-enhancing ingredients like
sugar and even chocolate. Moreover, the sugars in the milk are quickly
absorbed into the bloodstream, causing our insulin levels to rise, since
there is no longer fat in the milk to slow down the digestion process,
while the milk is less filling, possibly leading us to drink more than
we ought to.9 A small glass of real, whole, organically produced milk
within the context of a balanced lifestyle is therefore a far superior
option than a conventional glass of "low fat" milk with "added
vitamins," since real milk is designed the way God intended it to be
consumed---in its whole form.10

Reduce Your Fat Intake or Your Sauces? The Rise of the Nutritionist
Paradox Nutrition is an incredibly problematic subject. We do not eat
carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in a vacuum, for instance. We eat in
the complex framework of daily life. How much, when, and why we eat
these foods are

equally important considerations to take into account. How do they
interact with other foods that contain carbohydrates, fats, and
proteins? How were these foods grown and prepared? How fresh were the
foods? Were we stressed or relaxed when we ate the food? These important
considerations will lead to whether we eat real foods that will nourish
us or food-like products that can make us ill.11 As Pollan notes,
subscribing to reductionist science, whereby we focus on individual
nutrients at the cost of the bigger diet picture, is like losing our
keys in a parking lot at night and only searching for them under the
streetlight. We know they could be anywhere in that parking lot, but we
only look where we are able to see easily. In fact, nutrition science is
certainly not at the point where we understand every element of every
food, nor what happens to each element when they are separated or
isolated.12 Our vision is incredibly limited, despite all our advances
in the science of food. For example, coffee beans have over a thousand
phytonutrients (that fight diseases), only a small percentage of which
have been identified. The complex yet beneficial interaction between
just these hundred phytonutrients we can identify, let alone the other
nine hundred or so, is also little understood.13 Fresh thyme, one of my
favorite herbs, has a complex array of antioxidants---from alanine to
vanillic acid, the list is as long as it is remarkable.14 And these are
only the antioxidants we have discovered so far, all in a small green
sprig! What a wonderful, insightful, and proactive God we serve, indeed.
Yet increasingly, man-made foods have displaced the knowledge of natural
cuisine that traditionally originated in our homes and larger cultural
heritage, necessitating the advice of nutritionists as we learn to
navigate the modern food system. This flood of complex, conflicting,
ambiguous, and constantly changing (over time and between different
nutritional experts, who cannot seem to agree) nutritional information
is now available to us on a daily, even hourly, basis.15 Many of us
cannot decide what oil or fat we should cook with, let alone what in the
world we should cook. In fact, we cannot even take the word of
nutritional professionals at face value. A number of dietitians, for
instance, are "sponsored" by Coca-Cola to recommend the soda as part of
a balanced diet.16 How unbiased is their health advice going to be?
Since when did something as fundamental as eating become so utterly
confusing?

During my travels, countless individuals continue to ask me what they
should eat for a healthy mind and body, as if I can, hopefully, solve
their "omnivore's dilemma."17 To use Pollan's popular saying, you should
"eat food, not too much, mostly plants"---just as your mother and
grandmother would have told you in the past.18 Unfortunately, real foods
are increasingly hard to come by for many of us and impossible for
millions on the lowest rungs of the economic scale, while these "techno
foods" befuddle us with their many health claims and odd-sounding
ingredients.19

Supplement without Supplements It is precisely this reductionism that
also makes supplements potentially unsafe or ineffective. As professor
of nutrition and sustainable food activist Marion Nestle explains in
Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health,
the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA)
deregulated the supplement industry and now permits supplement producers
to claim health benefits for their products without the oversight of
official standards or independent studies. Even when negative health
effects of certain supplements are published, the companies that produce
these "natural" alternatives do not need to withdraw their products,
since the FDA does not regulate the production of these supplements.
Unless you habitually read medical journals as a hobby, how will you
know what can harm you?20 Indeed, who even knows what goes into those
capsules, liquids, and powders? The recent herbal remedy scandal
involving Wal-Mart, Walgreens, Target, and GNC in the United States
should serve as an urgent reminder. According to official court
documents, only 4 to 41 percent of the supplements examined actually
contained what was written on the labels.21 Despite the fact that
government drug regulations are not perfect (which I will discuss in
greater detail in my upcoming book on mental health and wellbeing),
allowing the supplement industry to police itself poses an equal threat
to public health, particularly when large amounts of profit are
involved.22 The supplement industry, which is often just another arm of
the pharmaceutical industry, is worth an estimated 55 billion dollars.23
Of these billions of dollars, it is difficult to tell what percentage is
actually spent on supplements that benefit the consumer.

Medicine is ultimately medicine, whether it is man-made or found in
nature, and there are many things in nature that can harm us, such as
poisonous plants and fungi. A growing body of research continues to show
how even "safe" vitamins can cause damage in excess or out of the
context of the foods that naturally contain them.24 Vitamin C, for
example, is an essential cancer-fighting nutrient found in many fresh
fruits and vegetables. Studies have shown, however, that vitamin C in
its supplement form does not reduce the risk of developing cancer, while
recent research has indicated that it can in fact increase the risk of
developing cancer.25 Demographic groups who use supplements are
generally more educated, have higher incomes, eat better, and exercise
more, and thus we cannot say that supplements work and are safe because
people who take them are healthier ---science is quite a bit more
complicated than that.26 Indeed, official public health organizations
will not recommend general supplementation because of the dangers
associated with overdosing. Unless supplements are part of a prescribed
medical regimen, many of us would be far better off using our income on
real, whole foods.27

Exercise: The Magic Moving Bullet? If supplements aren't the solution,
what about exercise? According to the WHO, one in three people partake
in little or no exercise across the globe, resulting in an estimated 3.2
million deaths annually, which makes physical inactivity one of the
leading causes of mortality today.28 Exercise, however, can never
replace an unhealthy diet; it is not a magic bullet that will allow you
to eat whatever you feel like without any consequences. Both physical
activity and a way of eating that is predominantly characterized by
real, whole foods are essential for a healthy spirit, mind, and body.
The food industry's myopic focus on exercise is in fact a subtle way for
corporations to shift attention away from their processed food products,
since encouraging people to eat less of their processed food products
directly impacts a corporation's revenue---bottom-dollar logic once
again.29 During the latest Bush administration, for instance, food
industry leaders and government officials began a campaign (with Shrek
as a figurehead) for healthier lifestyles that focused on physical
activity rather than the products these companies sold. It is a sad fact
that, around the time of this campaign,

Shrek also started appearing on processed food packages such as Oreo
cookies, which further contributed to the food industry's confusion of
exercise and diet.30 With their billions of dollars devoted to research
and marketing that harness and shape our food preferences, large food
corporations effectively swindle our taste buds. But they do more than
that. Through their economic clout and their government connections,
they hijack the whole agriculture industry, including farmers. Let's
look next at the effect their economic and political clout has on the
food that reaches the public.

6 Who Rules the Economic Roost?

By controlling the supply chains, large food corporations rule the
economic roost, so they set the economic rules. As the dominant buyers,
they put pressure on farmers and other producers in the vertically
integrated supply chain, compelling them to produce greater quantities
of cheap food---food the corporations want grown. By specializing and
controlling the entire process, including the necessary raw materials
(such as seeds or young animals), these corporations minimize both risk
and expense while establishing uniformity among their products. The
individual farmers have to provide the land, facilities, time, and labor
needed to produce foodstuffs, while the raw materials remain the same.1
In fact, the average farmer today earns only 14 cents on every dollar
spent on food in the United States, compared to 36 cents in 1974.2 With
so many calories on the market, the critical issue these companies face
is the fact that as humans we can only eat so much in one day---the
stomach has a fixed ceiling. How do the companies solve this essentially
biological problem? Make portion sizes larger, offer irresistibly cheap
deals, tempt you with candy "impulse buys" at the checkout counter, and
create foods that leave the consumer with enough room, and the desire,
for more ---the list of techniques is long, frightening, and subtle.3 At
the same time, access to healthier foods such as fresh fruit and
vegetables is limited by price manipulations generated by government
subsidization of foods like corn, soy, and wheat. For the millions of
Americans on food stamps, for example, the few dollars a day they have
to spend makes it almost impossible for them to choose to eat
healthfully. Since the government supports the production of unhealthy
processed foods, they are cheaper and more readily available. The US
government's

artificial support of processed foods makes it impossible for people of
low or no income to afford a balanced diet, because a bag of apples is
more expensive than sugary breakfast cereal.4

Only Desserts in Food Deserts? Assuming, that is, that these individuals
even have access to a bag of apples. Millions of Americans, and
particularly people in inner-city neighborhoods, live in "food deserts,"
areas where local stores within a five-mile radius do not even carry
fresh fruit and vegetables.5 In fact, one recent study has shown that
grocery stores are four times more likely to be built in predominantly
Caucasian neighborhoods than African-American communities, while African
Americans are 30 percent more likely to die from diet-related heart
disease.6 How empowering is the modern supermarket, convenience store,
or restaurant to these individuals when the choices are limited to
unhealthy, refined, sugary foods that can lead to obesity, chronic
illness, and an early death? How empowering, indeed, is the modern food
establishment for any of us, when the government's policies
intentionally make healthy, real foods more expensive by subsidizing the
MAD? What, ultimately, is the point of having a food system that does
not do what food should do: nourish us?7

The Door That Keeps Revolving Unfortunately, government officials are as
likely to have a relationship with the food industry as they are to
police it. Not only do these corporations put pressure on the US
government through their lobbying power, but there is also a revolving
door between government and industry. Many government officials leave
their bureaucratic positions to work for major food corporations, while
an equal number have left the corporate world to enter the realm of
government.8 Former Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman, for instance,
hired a lobbyist for the meat industry as her chief of staff. On the
other hand, Veneman's predecessor left his position as Secretary of
Agriculture to work for the food industry (which often has far better
pay). These individuals certainly have the knowledge and experience
often required to work as a

regulator or a corporate employee. Nevertheless, there is always the
risk of conflict of interest: How can we be sure they will act in the
interest of public health rather than their former colleagues, if there
is a conflict between the two?9 Even if there is no such relationship in
place, the food industry can still influence the US government in favor
of its own interests.10 A disturbing example of this sway is the recent
sugar controversy between the US government and the WHO. In 2003 the
WHO, concerned about the rising obesity epidemic, recommended that the
average individual should limit his or her added sugar consumption to
less than 10 percent of daily calories. This percentage was based on a
conclusive body of scientific evidence on the dangers of excess sugars
in the human diet. Nonetheless, the sugar industry, unhappy with the
limit capped on its product sales in the name of health, put pressure on
the US government, which subsequently threatened to withdraw funding
from the WHO if they did not change their dietary guidelines. A year
later, the 10 percent added sugar recommendation disappeared from the
WHO's global report on diet.11 An article in BMJ highlights how the food
industry's manipulation of nutritional science continues to pose a
threat to our health. Overall, industry-funded research generally favors
the products of food corporations.12 For example, according to a 2013
study published on PLoS Medicine (a peer-reviewed online medical
journal), papers whose research was supported by Big Agriculture's
dollars were five times more likely to say that there was no "positive
association" between sugar consumption and weight gain.13 With companies
such as Nestle, Coca-Cola, and Pepsico funding organizations such as the
Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) and Medical Research
Council's Human Nutrition Research unit (HNR), how do we ensure that
conflicts of interest do not occur? From 2001 to 2012, only thirteen out
of the forty scientists at the SACN claimed they had "no interests to
declare."14 What of the other twenty-seven scientists? Whose interests
possibly biased their interpretations of their work? The sugar industry?
The meat industry? The dairy industry? The list of potential biases can
go on and on.

David versus the Food Goliath

Smaller, more biologically diverse family farms cannot compete with the
power of these large food corporations. In terms of bushels per acre, or
animals per acre, small family farms do not meet the surface
productivity of large farms---large farms supported by the capital of
big industry and big government subsidies. At the same time, these
smaller farmers lack the financial resources to compete with Big
Agriculture for governmental influence, through the large-scale funding
of election campaigns, for example.15 Is it any wonder that the small
family farm is slowly disappearing from agriculture, while a mere 8
percent of farms produce 63 percent of our food?16 By taking cheaply
grown or raised commodities and producing processed foods sold at
premium prices, these large corporations are able to expand their
profits. Through what farmer and food activist Wendell Berry describes
as the logic of short-term economies of scale, these companies aim to
keep profits high and expenses low by producing as many goods as
possible for the cheapest price possible. "Externalized costs," or the
effects of such short-term practices, are left for us as a society to
take care of.17 A percentage of our taxes, for instance, are used for
farming subsidies, the treatment of diet-related diseases, and
environmental issues such as the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico (which
is related to chemical runoff from conventional agriculture).18 Indeed,
since many of these externalized costs are long term in nature, such as
global warming, chronic illnesses, and water pollution, we are shackling
our descendants with the true cost of creating the modern food
industry.19 When I look at our broken food system, one alarming
Scripture comes to mind: "The LORD is longsuffering and abundant in
mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He by no means clears
the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the
third and fourth generation" (Num. 14:18). What kind of future are we
leaving for our children? How, I ask each one of us, is participating in
this dysfunctional food system part of God's commandment to love our
neighbors as we love ourselves, including our "neighbors" of the future
(Mark 12:31)? Or to love God, through and for whom all things (including
the world and all the wonderful living organisms in it) were made, with
all our hearts, souls, and minds (Mark 12:30; John 1:3--4; Col. 1:16)?
Is this bringing heaven---or hell---to earth (Matt. 6:10)? What curses
are we leaving on future generations?

Our Current Food System Is "Wasted" It is a tragic fact that this
short-term logic of exploitation for gain has created an international
food system that is characterized not only by vast amounts of
convenient, cheap foods but also by what has come to be known as the
global waste scandal. Today, we could feed the world's starving with a
percentage of the food that is thrown away throughout the world. From
bananas left to rot in piles on a farm in Ecuador, where large numbers
of people are starving, because they do not meet the supermarket
regulations of what a banana should look like, to the thousands of
pounds of perfectly edible animal parts that do not please our
sensibilities, regardless of the fact that our ancestors ate them, the
industrial food system generates more food waste than ever before in
human history. In fact, as author and activist Tristram Stuart
indicates, in the space of twenty-four hours a supermarket can throw
away enough food to feed more than a hundred people.20 These statistics
are truly shocking. Yet we are all to blame. Industry and households
combined waste an estimated 1.3 billion tons of food each year, an
alarming figure that excludes the tons of water we also waste. Many
sustainable food activists, in fact, see a direct correlation between
cheap food and waste.21 If I only paid \$1.99 for my fast-food burger,
or for the giant box of cereal I bought at the store yesterday, what
does it matter if I throw most of it away? It was so cheap, after all.
The less an item costs us, the less we tend to value it. This scandal is
no less than the "theft of the world's natural resources."22 Indeed, we
are essentially stealing from God himself, who commands us to be good
stewards of his creation and to care for those less fortunate than
ourselves throughout the Old and New Testaments. This abuse of our
natural resources is one of the major reasons why close to a billion
people are dying of malnutrition and starvation in our world today.

Good Intentions Should Not Sway Good Decisions Undoubtedly, not everyone
involved in the global food industry is dominated by the logic of
corporate capitalism.23 A number of the pioneers of the industrial food
movement, and many of the individuals involved in the industry today,
view their work as necessary in light of the world's

expanding population, like many of the individuals behind the original
Farm Bill did. For example, the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman
Borlaug, often referred to as the "father of the Green Revolution" in
agriculture, was able to feed millions of starving people through his
work on the mass production of wheat at the International Maize and
Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico.24 Indeed, my own father was a food
technologist in Africa, and his passion was to marry the traditional
bakery to modern technology, thereby supporting the development of
businesses in impoverished communities. However, we still have to deal
with the consequences of the convenience, efficiency, and productivity
of our global food system, no matter how many good intentions support
it. As Gustafson points out in We the Eaters, we have to adopt Borlaug's
innovative thinking but not necessarily his methods.25 The current food
system not only leaves almost a billion people starving while billions
of dollars of food is wasted but also feeds the rest of us food products
that cause disease and death while damaging our health and the rest of
God's wonderful creation.26 It is imperative that we renew the way we
imagine global food production and consumption (Rom. 12:2).27 The huge
corporations and industrial farms may dominate in Washington, but if we,
the public, vote with our wallets and encourage the innovative thinkers,
we can make a substantial difference.

7 The Genetic Elephant in the Room

You may have wondered when I would discuss the genetic elephant in the
room. Due to the complexity surrounding the use of genetically modified
organisms (otherwise referred to as GMOs or GM foods) in our current
food system, I decided to save the worst aspect of the MAD for last.
What exactly are GM foods? Genetically engineered food production,
otherwise known as recombinant DNA technology, is based on the science
of genetic determinism, which sees mankind, and the world we live in, as
essentially materialist or physical. It is based on a "monoculture of
the mind," as leading anti-GMO activist Vandana Shiva notes.1 Indeed,
this way of thinking can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, whose
philosopher Democritus argued that everything consists of atoms tumbling
around in the universe, coming together and breaking apart.2 We are
myopically reduced to our material aspects; in this monoculture of the
mind, living organisms act like machines with interconnected pieces, and
with the appropriate know-how they can therefore be put together and
taken apart like machines.3 Biotechnologists can, based on this
materialist logic, take a specific gene from one organism and place it
into the DNA of another organism in order to create a new type of seed
with one or more desired traits, such as herbicide-tolerant plants and,
most recently, apples that do not go brown after you cut them.4 This
process is known as in vitro DNA modification---and it is somewhat like
a complicated genetic game of cut and paste.5 Yet where do we draw the
line, as Christians, between mimicking creation and thinking we can do
better than the Creator by shifting DNA from one species to another, for
example? When do we start eating the "forbidden fruit," thinking that
God did not quite get it right? The church

needs to open a way for a serious discussion of these issues, yet I have
never heard a sermon on genetic engineering and Christian bioethics. We
are God's stewards, and we will be held accountable for the way we have
cared for the world he loves and has entrusted to us (John 3:16). Why
are we not talking about how to steward in the real world, with
real-world issues?

Genetically Modified Smoke and Mirrors: What Is Really Fact? Today the
two traits that dominate the market for genetically engineered foods, a
market which is concentrated on large-scale soy, corn, cotton, and
canola production, are insect resistance (IR) and herbicide tolerance
(HT).6 In the United States, the world leader in industrially produced
GMOs, these crops account for half of all agricultural production (169
million acres), which involves an estimated 93 percent of soybean
acreage, 85 percent of corn acreage, and 82 percent of cotton acreage.7
In 2014, farmers using GM seeds accounted for roughly 49 percent of
global agriculture usage in the aggregate, most of which is concentrated
in a handful of countries, such as the United States, Brazil, South
Africa, and Argentina.8 While GM crops continue to spread, a number of
headlines have recently declared that the debate over the potential risk
to our health from GMO consumption is essentially over. This is a
premature prediction. Newspaper headlines, and indeed any source of
material, cannot be taken at face value. There is potential publication
bias, especially considering the biotechnology industry's influence in
GM food science.9 In a 2011 study, for example, Portuguese researchers
found that there was a "strong association" between industry-related GMO
research and positive outcomes for GM foods in these scientific
studies.10 Merely because a study was published in a journal, and sounds
intellectually intimidating, does not mean this study is necessarily
true---look at who funded the research. Essentially, we should always
apply the principles of "asking, answering, and discussing" to any piece
of information we come across.11 As the apostle Paul would have said, we
need to take every thought (including our examination of GMOs!) captive
unto Christ's wisdom. In the case of scientific information, many media
outlets are sensationalist at best. Any

facts garnered from these sources are essentially the result of the
author's interpretation of the scientist's interpretation of their
work---very much like the telephone game my four children played growing
up.

GM Science versus GM Certainty Proponents of GM foods often state that
the disapproval surrounding this new agricultural technology is
irrational, since science has "proven" that it is safe. Yet, as I
discussed above, science is not a system of absolute certainty. The
scientific method is a phenomenal tool that enables us to discover and
comprehend, within our limited human understanding, God's incredible
universe.12 But it does not replace God. To argue that GM foods are
completely safe is to deny that there are many things we have yet to
learn about genes, let alone the way genes react in an organism within
our multifaceted ecosystems.13 Indeed, we are only beginning to realize
that our so-called "junk" DNA is really not junk at all, and how the
science of epigenetics (the study of how the environment controls gene
activity) is far more complicated and far-reaching than imagined. Who is
to say what will happen when we take one gene from an insect and insert
it into a plant? The absence of harm in scientific papers does not
immediately equal safety in real life; it only means that as far as we
can tell, as we look under the streetlight in the parking lot (to once
again use Pollan's analogy), we cannot see any immediate health hazards.
The true pursuit of this science has to be as unbiased as is humanly
possible. This is an especially hard task when an industry that is
heavily invested in a technology controls the research on this
technology.14 International biotech companies such as Monsanto and
Syngenta, who dominate the global GM commercial market, publish the
majority of the studies available on GM foods. The relationship between
these biotech companies and researchers can be either direct (such as
employing their own researchers) or indirect (by funding university
studies through large grants, for instance). Potential publication bias
cannot be overlooked in these instances, since these companies have the
most to lose, in terms of billions of dollars of annual revenue, from
findings that question the safety of genetically engineered foods.15

There are a number of other factors to consider. Researchers cannot
access the GM seeds and their particular isogenic lines, that is, any
seeds with similar genotypes, without permission from these companies.
Furthermore, independent scholars have limited financial support
compared to industry-funded research. Even many regulatory bodies, such
as the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), can only access
industry information on GM foods if the companies in question give their
permission. How can we rely on the "proven" safety of these studies if
the biotech companies restrict access to the information necessary to
carry out completely independent trials?16 In fact, most of the
available studies on GM foods do not thoroughly examine long-term and
multigenerational health effects.17 As biochemist and nutritionist
Dr. Árpád Pusztai (widely known for his work on GM potatoes) indicates,
"the main danger is that we do not know what the main danger is."18
Although a recent paper by French plant geneticist Agnès Ricroch and her
colleagues has argued that these short-term trials, which are usually
three months or less in duration, are acceptable measures of GM food
safety, the paper itself contains several contradictions. Most notably,
while the study indicates that GM foods are safe, according to both the
long- and short-term studies carried out over the past several decades,
it claims that there are no long-term rodent studies available for one
of the main GM crops produced today: corn.19 According to an academic
review of the studies on GM foods and health published that same year by
José L. Domingo, a professor of toxicology and environmental health,
there are in fact an equal number of scientific papers on both sides of
the GMO safety debate, while the vast majority of these studies were
industry-funded and therefore at strong risk of bias.20 Likewise,
Environmental Science Europe published a paper at the beginning of 2015
noting how there is no global scientific "consensus on GM food safety,"
no global "epidemiological studies investigating potential effects of GM
food consumption on human health," and no global "consensus on the
environmental risks of GM crops" by the global scientific community.
Indeed, this journal also notes how a "list of several hundred studies
does not show GM food safety," while the "EU research project provides
no evidence for sweeping claims about the safety of any single GM food
or of GM crops in general."21 Exactly what is "certain"?

As the scientific community still argues over GM foods, the number of
studies strikes a disquieting note. GM foods have been associated with
autism,22 allergies,23 and infertility,24 to name just a few potential
long- and short-term health effects.25 Most recently, the WHO released a
report on Monsanto's Roundup Ready seeds (a herbicide-resistant GM
crop), noting that they have potential carcinogenic effects.26 At the
very least, GMO products should have labels, so that the consumer can
freely make their own informed decision on the risk that these foods
pose to themselves, their loved ones, and the planet.27

I Smell a Rat One of the few available long-term rodent studies on GM
corn is the 2012 Séralini paper on Roundup (also known as glyphosate,
the leading herbicide used today) and Roundup-tolerant GM corn. French
professor of molecular biology Gilles-Eric Séralini and his team of
scientists found that, compared with control groups, rats exposed to
both this herbicide and corn over two years suffered from a number of
health issues such as tumors, necrosis, kidney disease, and early death
related to the additive POE-15. Since POE15 is not considered an active
ingredient, regulators did not assess its safety in the same way that
glyphosate was tested. After a firestorm of both criticism and support
for the findings, the Food and Chemical Toxicology journal retracted the
peer-reviewed paper in 2013. This withdrawal elicited even more
international criticism and detailed responses from the authors, while a
global petition was signed against the journal's actions. At the same
time, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) argued that the Séralini
et al. paper had not followed its guidelines for three-month-long rodent
studies. This announcement was particularly troubling in light of the
fact that Monsanto's long-term trials also failed to meet the EFSA's
recommendations, yet the biotech giant was not subject to the same
criticism. In the summer of 2014 the paper was republished in another
journal, Environmental Sciences Europe, further adding to the
controversy surrounding the study. This Séralini affair, whether or not
you agree with the methodology and findings of the paper, still
underscores both the inadequacy of our current methods to examine the
safety of GM food production and the convoluted

nature of a public debate that is far from over. What other potentially
toxic ingredients, inactive or otherwise, are in these chemicals and
seeds? Is the uncertain risk associated with commercial GM food
production worth the purported benefits of the technology? Indeed, is it
possible to have a reasonable scientific debate on a technology that
industry and government have already invested billions of dollars in? Or
in an environment where the scientists who examine this technology are
both personally and professionally condemned?28

The Myth of the Environmental Vacuum The potential risks of GM food
production are not limited to human health. GM crops are monoculture
crops and are therefore prone to the issues this type of agricultural
production causes, including a dramatic decrease in the environmental
diversity essential to a balanced ecosystem. In fact, a growing body of
research on the ecological impact of GM food production, for example,
indicates that over time both weeds and insects can develop resistance
to these new chemicals and crops, thereby necessitating the use of more
and more pesticides (chemicals that have been linked to cancer and birth
defects) for the same desired effect.29 For instance, in Iowa many
farmers now have to deal with rootworms that have developed a resistance
to the genetically modified corn (that contains insect genes),
compelling many of them to increase their use of insecticides to combat
this infestation.30 Indeed, some researchers have estimated that GM
foods have increased the rate of overall pesticide use in the United
States alone by 122 million pounds in the years 1996 to 2011.31 Although
a recent German meta-analysis, or a detailed survey of the scientific
studies available on a particular subject, has argued that GM food
production decreases pesticide usage by 37 percent, over half of the
studies used in this meta-analysis were short term (mainly one farming
season). Since insect and weed resistance occur over an extended period
of time, this meta-analysis is not an accurate survey of the long-term
effect of GM foods on pesticide usage. Also, the data analyzed in this
meta-analysis focused primarily on insect-resistant, genetically
engineered crops. Herbicidetolerant crops, however, account for the
greater percentage of GM agricultural production today. This
meta-analysis is not a suitable account

of GM agriculture in general, even though the authors claim that it
provides "robust evidence" in favor of GMOs, which will "greatly improve
public trust in this technology." In fact, that data collected was
restricted to just three crops (soybeans, corn, and cotton) in
predominantly three countries (South Africa, India, and the United
States) and was based largely on farmer surveys (which are less
dependable than fixed measurements). This is by no means "robust
evidence" that all GM food production in the world is safe and
beneficial. Likewise, correlation in science does not imply causation,
and there are other variables, such as different types of farms, that
can also account for the findings of this analysis.32 GMO agricultural
production never occurs in an environmental vacuum. In a research
laboratory these genes can be controlled to a degree, although we are
only beginning to understand the way genes function.33 Once GMOs are
incorporated into complex ecosystems, however, their effect on the
interconnected nature of these systems is little understood. If
scientists do not even know 98 percent of the organisms in the soil used
to grow the crops, how can we suitably measure the effect of GMOs on
intricate ecosystems over time?34 This risk is particularly alarming in
light of the fact that genetically engineered seeds contaminate non-GMO
crops through natural processes such as pollination and the weather.35
Ultimately, we have introduced artificial organisms into an environment
we cannot control. Whether or not we choose to eat GM foods, we are all
part of these ecosystems---we are all affected by the agricultural
production of GMOs.36 Even if genetically engineered food increases
agricultural yield, as the German meta-analysis discussed above argues,
more processed foodstuffs and grain-based animal feed will not fix our
broken food system. Fundamentally, the goal of a food system is not just
to feed people but to feed them in a way that nourishes and sustains
life. In the sections above we have already seen the result of too many
empty calories: these unhealthy foods can lead to disease and early
death, just as lack of food leads to disease and early death.37 GM corn
and soy are solutions that stay within the framework of a global food
industry that emphasizes quantity over quality.38 We have to step out of
this pattern of thinking.39 As Hesterman notes, "The system we have in
place is still largely based on this outdated concept that agriculture
is part of the manufacturing sector." Food is not the same as food-like
products. Ultimately, we need to renew the way we think about

our meals, and not conform to the way the world thinks about our meals
(Rom. 12:2).40

We Have Enough Food to Feed the World Indeed, hunger is not an issue of
food production. Today, we have enough food to feed the world.41 The
system that delivers this food, however, is one where millions and
millions of pounds of food go to waste on a daily basis, millions of
pounds are turned into animal feed and gasoline for our cars, almost a
billion people are starving, and 30 percent of the world population does
not get enough micronutrients.42 As celebrated economist and 1998 Nobel
Prize winner Amartya Sen notes, "Starvation is the characteristic of
some people not having enough food to eat. It is not the characteristic
of there being not enough food to eat."43 GM foods are an oversimplified
(and inherently indeterminate) solution to the complexities of hunger,
where there is enough food for everyone but not everyone can access this
food. We need to change the political, social, and economic forces that
do not allow people to alleviate their hunger.44 Growing more and more
corn or soy is merely taking the easy way out and does not solve the
underlying issues that lead to food insecurity and starvation. The
industrial production of corn and soy are Band-Aids on a gaping wound.
Even the potential of increased yields from GM crops is in question.45
For instance, Monsanto's genetically engineered soybeans have a "yield
drag" (or reduced yield) of 5 to 10 percent compared to conventional
soybeans.46 Indeed, a recent United Nations and World Bank long-term
review, known as the International Assessment of Agricultural Science
and Technology for Development (IAASTD), analyzed data from 110
countries and 900 participants and noted that GM crops cannot meet the
food needs of the world's population.47 In terms of consistent,
intrinsic yield increases, or the "amount of food that crops can produce
under ideal circumstances," GM crops, as opposed to conventional
agriculture, have not lived up to the promises of their defenders.48
Indeed, the current food industry has failed at meeting its promise of
more and more yields: overall crop losses have actually increased since
the mid-twentieth century in the United States alone.49

Thus far, the biotech companies who often promise "better food to save
the world" in response to their many critics have not yet lived up to
the hype of their marketing campaigns.50 For example, "golden rice,"
which was featured on Time magazine's front cover as a solution to the
tragic levels of vitamin A deficiency that affects millions of children
globally, failed to overcome the cultural norms of rice color in Asia in
the absence of social programs educating the communities in question.51
And scientists still debate just how much of this rice (with vitamin A
engineered into it, which is responsible for the "golden" color of the
grain) will have to be consumed to meet children's nutritional needs.
Some estimates note that up to fifty bowls of golden rice a day would
have to be eaten to meet the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A.52
In light of the potential dangers of vitamin supplements we discussed in
chapter 5, it is even more imperative that these nutritional findings
are thoroughly and independently tested before they are offered as
solutions that can "save a million kids."53 We should not embrace these
new technologies based on future promises that have not yet
materialized, in the same way that you would not purchase my products if
I only promised to help you in the future.

Is There a "Seed" of Hope Anywhere? Is it even possible, however, to
create a food system that focuses on both quantity and quality, while
stewarding God's planet with integrity and compassion? The growing body
of research on agro-ecological farming methods offers some exciting
possibilities. Across forty-four projects in over twenty sub-Saharan
African nations, for example, agro-ecological yields have been
significantly higher than conventional or GM farming methods, with an
increased yield of 214 percent within a ten-year period.54 Similarly,
the Rodale Institute's thirty-year-long Farming Systems Trial (FST) has
shown how organic farming methods can equal conventional yields, while
remaining more resilient during seasons of inclement weather.55 In a
number of cases, organic farming has actually been shown to be as
effective in terms of yield as conventional methods.56 Additionally, a
2014 meta-analysis on organic versus conventional agriculture found that
the previous estimates of low yields for organic farms

had been overemphasized due to the views of the scientific community at
the time. In fact, both multi-cropping and crop rotations on organic
farms significantly reduced the assumed yield disparity between organic
and conventional farming methods.57 We should urgently consider
investing our dollars in technologies that promote ecological diversity
and resilience.58 The search for alternative food systems is indeed
urgent, since the production of GM crops has left us with a global issue
of food sovereignty ---who governs our food supply? Biotech companies
and food corporations are continually increasing their control over what
we eat, while public institutions for agricultural development, such as
Borlaug's International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico,
suffer under a lack of available funding.59 Since these companies can
patent their GM seed technology, farmers can no longer save their seeds
and plant them in subsequent seasons---a time-honored practice that has
continued since the beginning of agriculture. Yet God created seeds in
such a way that they can sustain a regular food supply by being
replanted---this is part of his "wired for love" foundation of our
world. Now, however, GM farmers have to purchase new seeds, and new
chemicals, each year, often increasing their debts in the process.60 And
according to the USDA's Economic Research Service, giving control of
seeds to private companies has in fact led to a significant overall
decrease in the amount of funding given to agricultural research and
development.61 We know less, but we are allowing these companies to earn
more. This expansion of the private sector's control over our seed
supplies is essentially a monopoly on the "genetic resources on which
all of humanity depends."62 We can survive without a lot of things, but
food is indubitably not one of them. Indeed, in countries such as India
the fight against GM foods is not predominantly concerned with the human
and environmental health effects of these crops but rather campaigners
focus on food security and sovereignty, and the freedom for local
communities to control and determine their own food sources.63 The
patenting of GM seeds involves significant amounts of money. Monsanto
can gain millions of dollars per annum by abolishing all the seedsaving
habits of farmers in the United States alone, while its earnings from
court cases against farmers who have purportedly saved their seeds is
equally high. An alarming pattern has emerged over the past several
years whereby some farmers are prosecuted by these multibillion-dollar

companies for the use of GM seeds, even if they argue that their lands
were, unbeknownst to them, contaminated by these genetically engineered
crops. The private investigating teams hired by these biotech companies,
which search the countryside for patent infringements, have discovered
many of these purported cases.64

Real Food and Real Scientific Advances I am, of course, in no way
antiscience. As someone who has spent the last thirty years researching
the mind and brain, I have a great appreciation for the scientific
method as an exciting tool that enables us to discover more and more
about our God by examining his magnificent creation. I do believe that
genetically engineered biotechnology has significant research potential
within a laboratory, enabling us to identify particular genes in
isolation (as was done with "snorkel rice," which failed to create a
floodresistant rice variety but provided scientists with an important
body of information nonetheless).65 And there certainly are many pro-GMO
scientists and organizations, such as the Center for the Application of
Molecular Biology to International Agriculture (CAMBIA), that are
challenging private corporate control of GM food technology.66 Yet, as
an uncertain technology that enables large corporations to gain control
of our food supply, the process of science, and even politics, GM foods
pose an imminent threat to us all. ------------ Rather than trying to
change what God has given us in nature, a far better use of science in
our food system is science that devises ingenious solutions that imitate
God's creation. Over the past several years, the science of "biomimicry"
has sought to do just this: to mimic the genius found in nature while at
the same time respecting the intricate complexity of our world's
ecosystems.67 Essentially, this exciting field is focused on "innovation
inspired by nature," or what I like to call innovation inspired by God's
design.68 Farmers, inventors, and researchers are continually making
incredible advances in sustainable and natural food production, from the
use of fish tanks and water-grown vegetables in greenhouses (known as

aquaponics), to practices that use cows to imitate wild animal grazing
patterns to reverse desertification by fertilizing the soil, and to
multifaceted organic farming methods and animal husbandry used to
sequestrate excess carbon in the land, thereby helping to combat global
warming.69 For example, Will Allen, a Milwaukee-based organic farmer and
the founder of Growing Power, "provides safe, healthy, affordable"
produce for communities using an astonishing array of natural,
scientific techniques: "acid-digestion, anaerobic digestion for food
waste, bio-phyto remediation and soil health, aquaculture closed-loop
systems, vermiculture, small and large scale composting, urban
agriculture, and permaculture."70 Allen, whose farms are incredibly
productive per acre, has rightly received an honorary PhD for his
incredible contribution to the field of biomimicry.71 The genius of
these sustainable farmers and food producers can easily be compared to
that found in the offices, practices, and laboratories of individuals
with many degrees behind their names.

It Is Time to Quit the System The MAD way of eating is the product of
human choices. Many of us are not compelled to eat its highly processed
foods, nor should we accept its many chronic diseases and starving
millions. By opting out of this system we collectively make it more
possible for others less fortunate than ourselves to access real, whole
foods and rewire our food system toward health again. Yet before we
plant a garden in our backyard, we have to plant a healthy garden in our
head. In the following chapters I will show you how thinking is the key
to a healthier you and a healthier world. Admitting there is a problem
with our global food system is the first step. Now it is time to quit
the system and beat it at its own game.

P ART 2

QUIT IT!

8 Mindset and Meal

By now you have a detailed picture of a global food system that has gone
devastatingly wrong. Some might say you have all you need to know to
start making better choices as a shopper, eater, and voting citizen. But
unless you are able to identify and change your mindset about food, all
of this information will be useless. Suppose, for example, that your
mindset includes beliefs like What Dr. Leaf calls real food will be hard
to find, is expensive, and tastes like sawdust. Cheeseburgers make me
feel good. These deeply rooted beliefs will cause you to disregard much
of what I've said. Or suppose you feel discouraged and believe that
There's nothing I can do about the global food business. It's too big
and I'm too small. That emotion and belief can also short-circuit your
willingness to take action. Because mindset is so important to what we
actually do, part 2 is devoted to the mindset behind the meal and the
meal behind the mindset. How does thinking affect eating, and how does
eating affect thinking?

The Mindset behind the Meal Research shows that 75--98 percent of
current mental, physical, emotional, and behavioral illnesses and issues
come from our thought life; only 2--25 percent come from a combination
of genetics and what enters our bodies through food, medications,
pollution, chemicals, and so on.1 These statistics show that the mindset
behind the meal---the thinking behind the meal--- plays a dominant role
in the process of human food-related health issues,

approximately 80 percent. Hence the title of this book: you have to
think and eat yourself smart, happy, and healthy. God has given us a
"sound mind" (2 Tim. 1:7). We have the mind of Christ that enables us to
think well (1 Cor. 2:16). You will learn about the enormous impact
thinking has on your brain and body as you choose and eat food. Indeed,
the power in our mind to think and choose is incredible. Since God gave
us this powerful ability to think, feel, and choose, we therefore have a
responsibility to understand this power and use it well in every aspect
of our lives, including what we choose to eat and how we eat (1 Cor.
10:31). If we do not have a healthy mind, then nothing else in our life
will be healthy, including our eating habits. This discussion of the
impact of thinking on eating incorporates the elements of choice and its
consequences (Deut. 30:19), bringing all thoughts into captivity to
Christ (2 Cor. 10:5), renewing the mind (Rom. 12:2), being led by the
Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:5--6), respecting the temple God has given us (Ps.
139:14; 1 Cor. 3:16--17; 6:19-- 20; 2 Cor. 6:14--18; 1 Pet. 2:5), and
respecting the earth and animals God has entrusted to us (Gen. 1:26;
Lev. 25:23; Ps. 24:1--2; 50:9--12; John 1:3; 3:16--17; Col. 1:16--17).

The Meal behind the Mindset Although your brain is only 2 percent of the
weight of your body, it consumes 20 percent of the total energy (oxygen)
and 65 percent of the glucose---what you eat will directly affect the
brain's ability to function on a significant scale.2 Your brain has
"first dibs" on everything you eat. I call this the "20 percent factor,"
or the eating behind the thinking, and it underscores the fact that how
and what we eat affects our mind, brain, and body. Even though this
factor is only 20 percent of the story, you can't just eat whatever you
feel like and expect your life to improve if you think good thoughts. On
the contrary, God wants us healthy in our spirits, souls, and bodies (1
Cor. 6:19--20; 1 Thess. 5:23; 3 John 1:2). All three are important and
are supposed to work in an integrated way, influencing and feeding into
each other in a cyclical fashion.

Thinking is fundamentally intertwined with our mental and physical
health. In fact, one of the things you will learn in part 2 is that if
you eat while emotional, your body does not digest your food correctly.
If you think right, you will eat right, and if you eat right, you will
think right. I hope you have begun to see the reasoning behind eating
and our spiritual and physical responsibility to eat a healthy diet.
Many people ask me, "If our minds are so powerful, why does it matter
what I eat?" Some individuals have even declared passionately that "I
can eat whatever I want and pray God will bless it to my body even
though I know it isn't healthy." Certainly, you are free to choose, but
you are not free from the consequences of your choices. Those of us who
can afford to purchase better quality food, once we understand how
dysfunctional our current food system is, have a responsibility to
change the way we eat. Turning a blind eye for the sake of convenience
is not worshiping Christ in everything we do (1 Cor. 10:31). To make
this choice indicates a lack of respect and stewardship for our own body
and the blessings of the earth God has graciously provided. We cannot
pray God will turn our cake into kale. This may sound hard, but the
reality of what we eat is truly a matter of life and death. We cannot
survive, let alone thrive, without proper nourishment. And the situation
is urgent. As we saw in part 1, the MAD diet has morphed into the global
industrial diet. Even though people in other countries disapprove of
American fast food and TV culture, this MAD diet has invaded virtually
every country. As mentioned earlier, it is, unfortunately, one of the
largest US exports.3 On a daily basis, more and more of us are consuming
foods that destroy rather than nourish our bodies and our planet.
Changing our mindset behind the meal, and the meal behind the mindset,
is a global issue. Yet in this book I am not going to give you a list of
what to eat and what not to eat to improve brain and body health. I am
going to teach you how to think about what and how you eat. The thought
of writing yet another diet book that you may read and use for just a
few weeks, with minimal longterm changes in your life, does not interest
me. As a clinical therapist and scientist, I want to help you make
lasting changes in all areas of your life by teaching you to use your
incredible mind. You do not have to be a nutritionist to know how to
eat. You have to learn how to think before you eat.

Renew Your Mind, Renew Your Plate As a culture, we have become so
accustomed to our current, global MAD food system that it has become a
part of our nonconscious minds. When was the last time you thought about
what the chicken who laid your eggs ate? Or how the sugary breakfast
cereal in your pantry was made? Or how long ago your neatly shredded and
packaged lettuce was picked? It is a learned and habituated food system.
Most of us do not even stop and think about the principles of cheap,
easy, and fast that this system is founded on. The MAD establishment,
from supermarkets to fast-food restaurants, did not dominate the food
landscape fifty years ago, yet in just a few decades it has taken away
the most important part of eating: thinking has been supplanted by
convenience.4 We saw in part 1 that with the large-scale
industrialization of our food system came big agribusinesses dominated
by the logic of short-term economics and extensive food marketing
campaigns to keep profits high. One thing we will see in these next
several chapters is that research on the mind shows how marketing has
changed our thinking both about what food is and how, when, and where to
eat it.5 We have been subtly shaped by a culture of convenience. Yet we
are not doomed to follow the ways of the MAD. God has designed our minds
to control our brains---our biology does not control us!6 When we change
our mind, we change our brain, and our body follows suit. We can undo
the effects of marketing.

9 Taking Responsibility

Our first step in undoing the effects of a lifetime of marketing is to
face the fact that it has happened to us and decide in our minds to take
responsibility for what we eat. The brain does the bidding of the
mind---where the mind goes, the brain follows.1 What you think affects
what you eat, and what you eat affects what you think. There are
countless research studies in journals, online, in the media, and in
bookstores highlighting the impact of both thinking and diet on the
brain and body. We can now say with certainty that consuming highly
processed, sugar-, salt-, and fat-laden MAD foods contributes to
increased levels of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
Alzheimer's, stroke, allergies, autism, learning disabilities, and
autoimmune disorders. The list can go on and on. Although we are seeing
an ever-increasing public awareness of the effects of lifestyle choices
on our health, fast-food establishments and supermarkets are continually
being built across the globe.2 Within my own neighborhood, four new
chain grocery stores have opened in the last several months!

A Mental Blank Wall Many individuals do not know, or do not want to
acknowledge, how dysfunctional our food system actually is. While
writing this book, I often had discussions on food and healthy eating
with the pastors, leaders, drivers, and other incredible people I have
had the opportunity to meet during my travels. These people are
compassionate and loving, yet most of

them had no clue that our food system was so far removed from their own
belief systems and values. Even when I speak of these issues from the
podium, I often come face-toface with a mental blank wall. It never
ceases to amaze me, for instance, that when I speak on the dangers of
soda, which creates structural damage in the brain, several people in
the audience always visit the vending machine and buy cans of soda
during the lunch break. Indeed, the green room is usually filled with
such drinks: many of the visitors grab one and joke, "Don't let Caroline
see you with that!" After drinking soda not only will you have a
distended colon and an insulin rush but you will also reduce your IQ
level, invite brain fog, throw your body into toxic stress, and
contribute to the destruction of the earth's natural resources. How is
this respecting our bodies as God's living temples? Are we being good
biblical stewards? Ultimately, the MAD industrial food system dominates
our world. Parents take their children to fast-food restaurants between
school and their next sporting activity. People fill up their grocery
carts with foods containing strange ingredients no one can pronounce, or
no ordinary kitchen has ever heard of. Many restaurants do not even know
how their chickens were raised or how their vegetables were grown.
Church functions are hotbeds of fast, convenient, and highly processed
foods. Charities and food aid still cripple local, healthy food
production in developing nations with imported processed foods, good
intentions notwithstanding.3

The Only Balanced Meal We need to take personal responsibility for what
we put on our plates. If we eat the MAD diet on the very, very odd
occasion, we can rest assured knowing that God, in his gracious and
loving way, has built backup systems into our brain and body that will
pull us out of potential danger. After all, stressing about our food is
as bad for our health as eating unwholesome foods! But if we knowingly
continue down a path of eating food-like products instead of real food,
merely because we would rather use our money to buy that new iPhone, we
should not be surprised when the consequences are far from what we
desire.

It is foolhardy to believe that we can live our lives however we choose
and, when medical problems arise, run to our doctors and dietitians for
a quick fix, ask God why this is happening to us, and tell everyone we
are under spiritual attack. We are always under spiritual attack on
every front. Paul says we are in a war, not going to war (Rom. 7:23;
Eph. 6:11--13; 2 Thess. 1:4). We are part of this battle of restoration:
we are called to be God's heirs, soldiers, and high priests, extending
his love and forgiveness in the world; this is what it means to be true
followers of Christ, who extended God's love and mercy into the world by
conquering sin and death (John 14:12--14; Heb. 4:14; 1 Pet. 2:9). We are
called to bring heaven to earth, and this does not happen without a
fight (Matt. 6:9--13).4 In fact, I think a frightening mentality among
many Christians today is a pervasive view of the world as fallen and
hopeless, despite the fact that Christ has already made all things new
(2 Cor. 5:17; Rev. 21:5). We have the God-given responsibility to care
for the earth---the whole world is waiting for Christians to fully
appropriate their identity as God's heirs and take responsibility for
creation (Rom. 8:19--22). The world is being restored---a restoration
that began with Christ and will be completed with Christ, and through us
as his heirs.5 We were not created to stand by, complaining about the
evil things we witness or hear about and exclaiming that we cannot wait
to go to heaven and leave this wretched earth behind. We are supposed to
bring heaven to earth, to apply God's love to the terrible things that
make us want to duck our head in the ground like spiritual
ostriches---terrible things like our corrupt food system. Once we know,
we have a responsibility to act (James 4:17). As Christians we cannot
say that it is impossible to escape or change the MAD diet--- while
hoping that saying grace over our food will make it healthy. Real grace
is not just said before a meal; real grace is the meal. I am not trying
to make you feel guilty. Negative emotions will just make things worse,
and give you terrible indigestion to boot. I write these words with a
spirit of conviction, not condemnation, for we "are destroyed for lack
of knowledge" (Hos. 4:6). Destruction is a final, horrific thing. I am
trying to increase your awareness by warning you of the dangers of
putting trash in your mind or in your body. I know life is challenging,
yet I also know God is greater than our struggles---nothing is
impossible for him (Matt. 19:26). And Jesus himself said that God cares
about what you eat, just as he cares for the nourishment of the birds
and all living creatures (Matt. 6:26).

Essentially, thinking about the impact of your lifestyle choices will
have a profound influence on the health of your spirit, soul, and body.
I know I am belaboring this point, yet it truly cannot be said enough:
the only balanced meal is one that includes your thoughts.

Lose the Mindset, Lose the Weight As we take responsibility for the
condition of our bodies, the question arises, what is a healthy weight
for us? Scientists think about this in terms of body mass index (BMI), a
ratio of weight to height. Unfortunately, what exactly is a healthy BMI
is still being debated. According to a growing body of research, a
healthy BMI can be as high as 35---contrary to the longheld scientific
dogmas that have defined what is considered overweight and obese.6 These
findings are perhaps unsurprising in light of artwork from the
Renaissance and Baroque periods, for example, where women are frequently
portrayed according to standards many of us would consider overweight or
obese. The BMI is an imperfect scale, since it does not take into
account many factors associated with our weight, such as body fat
percentage.7 Wearing a size zero does not necessarily mean you are
healthy, just as an organic label does not necessarily mean the food is
healthy. We are all different, uniquely created in the image of God. Yet
this shift away from popularly held conceptions about BMI is not an
excuse to lie on your couch and binge on food-like products such as soda
and fast food. There certainly is a point where being obese or
overweight is damaging to your health, and a lack of exercise negatively
affects both your physical and mental wellbeing. MAD processed foods
have many negative health effects. Our ultimate goals should therefore
be a healthy diet and a lifestyle that nourishes and sustains us, not a
supermodel body that is defined by superficial cultural standards.
Indeed, you may lose weight on a diet or by taking a pill, yet such
weight loss shocks your body while your mind is still entrenched in old
patterns of eating.8 The effect is short term at best. However, when we
understand and remove the habits, mindsets, and cues that result in
incorrect eating and overeating, we can make truly sustainable lifestyle
changes based on a balanced, thought-based way of eating.

How, then, do we reshape our mindsets and habits? That's what we need to
consider next.

10 The Meeting of the Minds

For many years I researched, developed, and tested a theory that
delineates what the mind is, and how we think and build memory in order
to learn.1 I describe this theory, the Geodesic Information Processing
Theory, as the science of thought, which I have applied in many ways
with my patients and in my research over the past thirty years.2 Based
on this theory, in the following chapters I am going to explain how easy
it is for us to get caught up in incorrect thinking patterns when we do
not monitor what enters our minds. You will also begin to understand how
mindsets become mindsets (which are really entrenched memories with
emotions attached, thus the equivalent of an attitude) and influence our
perceptions. If you look at this schematic of the Geodesic Information
Processing Theory, you will see that your mind is divided into two
parts: the nonconscious metacognitive and the conscious cognitive. You
will also see a section that is called the symbolic level, which
represents our senses and what we say and do. Across the bottom strip of
the model you will see text boxes that represent what is happening in
the brain, or the neural correlates, as a result of the mind in action.3

When you are thinking, choosing, and forming thoughts or memories, your
mind is "in action."4 The mind is separate from the brain and changes
the biology of the brain.5 A mind in action changes the physical
structure of your brain biology. This process is called neuroplasticity
and is something I have been studying for the past thirty years.
Although the idea of neuroplasticity was rejected in the 1980s, when the
prevailing wisdom was that the brain could not change (a damaged brain
would always be a damaged brain), it gained validity in the mid-1990s
and is now discussed throughout the scientific community.6 The brain
only changes, however, because of the action going on between the
nonconscious and conscious mind. As you think about what you are
listening to, smelling, touching, tasting, or looking at, your
nonconscious and conscious minds kick into high-energy action and your
genes respond by switching on and off, making proteins that form into
treelike structures called dendrites, which are memories.7 You literally
wire thoughts into your brain, thereby transforming the biological
landscape of your brain.

"Magic Trees of the Mind" Golgi Stain

The more you think about something, the more developed your memory
concerning this thing becomes. In fact, over a period of twenty-one
days, short-term memory becomes long-term memory.8 It takes another
forty-two days (two more twenty-one-day cycles) to automatize that
long-term memory and turn it into a habit.9 This means it takes a
minimum of sixtythree days to form a habit, not twenty-one as is often
quoted. There is an interesting interplay that takes place between the
incredibly fast nonconscious mind, with its trillions of memories, and
your slower, more evaluative, but equally powerful conscious mind. The
conscious mind assesses the incoming information from your five senses,
yet it does so through the lens of four to seven embedded thoughts that
have moved from your nonconscious into your conscious mind at any one
moment.10 Current events are examined in terms of existing and related
memories. What you

have already built into your mind determines how you will understand and
make decisions about new information. In the following chapters I will
explain my theory in more detail, ending with an analogy that will show
you how it applies to the food we choose to eat.

Nonconscious Metacognitive Level of the Mind The nonconscious
metacognitive level of the mind, which is on the far left of the graphic
above, is incredibly extensive. It is beyond the constraints of space
and time and operates in a quantum way: unlimited, interrelational, and
simultaneous.11 It is where your stored memories interact in a dynamic
fashion, setting up your belief systems and shaping your uniqueness,
which I term the I-factor.12 Essentially, your I-factor is the perfectly
created you. It is your uniqueness as a human being made in God's image
(Gen. 1:26) and all the choices you have made, which have created
genetic changes, consequently adding layers to the core of who you are.
These layers enrich you if they are Holy Spirit--led layers, or they
diminish you if you choose to believe the enemy's lies. Who you choose
to listen to is vitally important in terms of the quality and level of
truth you build into your nonconscious mind. Where your mind goes, your
brain follows. The nonconscious mind is responsible for somewhere
between 90--99 percent of your mind's activity.13 For example, out of
the 10 million bits per second processed through the eye, only a maximum
of 50 bits per second are processed consciously.14 The nonconscious mind
operates twenty-four 18 hours a day, at fantastic speeds, about a
quintillion (10 ) bits per second at a 27 synaptic level and an
octillion (10 ) bits per second at a microtubular level, for the whole
brain.15 Indeed, the mind is truly magnificent. It is the orchestra
conductor, operating in the brain in the form of rhythms and
frequencies, which communicate among its biological components like a
beautiful piece of music.16 The nonconscious mind drives and influences
the conscious mind, which means it is the dominant part of your mind.17
Once a thought is planted and becomes a habit in your nonconscious mind,
it will shape your perception of anything related to that thought. This
interrelated nature of the mind

gives a whole new level of meaning to James 1:21: "The implanted word
\[will\] save your souls." What you have stored in your nonconscious
mind will shape your perception of reality. The nonconscious mind is
connected into the spiritual part of who you are.18 What this means is
that God has already provided answers to our issues (including what to
eat, how to eat, and for any kind of eating disorder). Everything we
need for our future is already completed (Isa. 46:10), and it's all good
(Gen. 1:31). The answers are already accessible to us through the Holy
Spirit (John 16:13). In fact, the past, present, and future are not
fixed variables in your nonconscious mind, which means it is not bound
by time. Essentially, the nonconscious mind works on quantum principles,
which do not follow the normal rule of time in classical physics. The
past, present, and future affect each other---much like what happened
with Denzel Washington's character in the movie Déjà Vu.19 By implanting
the Word in your soul (mind), you affect your past, present, and future!
Yet we need to choose to implant these spiritual realities in our
nonconscious minds to "save \[our\] souls" (James 1:21). Once we begin
to do this, we will truly comprehend how the work of the cross created
our future: "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the
LORD, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a
hope" (Jer. 29:11).

The Conscious Cognitive Level of the Mind The conscious level of the
mind, which is represented in the middle of the schematic above, is
responsible for roughly 1--10 percent of our mind's activity.20 It is
much more sedate than the nonconscious mind but equally as powerful. For
instance, it operates at only 50 bits per second through the eyes as
compared to the total of 10 million bits per second.21 It is dependent
on the nonconscious mind, which is the source of our individual
uniqueness, and is therefore influenced by what is stored in the
nonconscious mind.22 The conscious mind only operates when we are awake,
and it is the part of us that is consciously and deliberately thinking
and choosing.23 We have the ability, with our conscious mind, to change
and

reconceptualize embedded memories---this means we can change and
overpower toxic eating habits.24 Remember, 2 Timothy 1:7 says that we do
not have a spirit of fear but of love and power and a sound mind. The
core of the design of our conscious and nonconscious levels of mind is
based on these latter qualities. We are essentially designed to think
and choose well; we are made in the image of a powerful, loving God!
This is called "the optimism bias" in science.25 Because of this bias,
memories can be willfully redesigned in a positive direction.26 This
powerful ability to redesign or reconceptualize our thoughts, however,
can only take place when these memories move from the nonconscious mind
into the conscious mind---that is, when we become aware of our thoughts.
As the Scripture says, we need to bring all thoughts into captivity (2
Cor. 10:5).27 We have to choose to change our minds. Our conscious mind
operates on a "one thing at a time" sequential basis, within the context
of classical physics principles. The conscious level of mind is
therefore bound by space and time. This space-time framework enables us
to fully direct our attention, focus our reflections, and apply
repeated, diligent, and rigorous effort to a particular issue (including
what we eat), which leads to true learning.28 This is called the Quantum
Zeno Effect (QZE) in quantum physics.29 I know this may sound like a
highly complex and strange phenomenon, yet it is essentially what is
happening as we repeatedly pay attention to and process information.
Constantly thinking about something or listening to something creates
genetic change, and learning takes place. This can happen with
everything: when we are constantly exposed to messages about fast food,
for example. These new thoughts become entrenched and implanted into our
minds. The QZE aligns with Proverbs 4:20--22. In this passage, the
author cries out, "My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear
to my sayings. Do not let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the
midst of your heart; For they are life to those who find them, and
health to all their flesh" (emphasis added). Having a healthy mind,
body, and spirit begins in the mind, when we start implanting healthy
lifestyle patterns of thinking in our nonconscious mind and choose to
act on them through our conscious mind. This is a truly hopeful scenario
that shows God's loving grace and mercy. When we understand how we wired
in an unhealthy mindset, we can wire it out and replace it with a
healthy and life-giving mindset. And this ability to

change the landscape of our brains goes for all thoughts, not just food
thoughts! God really did design us with the amazing ability to renew our
minds (Rom. 12:2).

The Level of the Senses The symbolic output level, the third section on
the schematic of my theory, incorporates the five senses through which
we express ourselves and experience the world. These senses are the
bridge between the external world that we inhabit and the internal world
of our mind.30 We experience the events and circumstance of our lives
through our senses, including what we taste, what food we smell, what
food and food marketing commercials we see, what food advertisements we
hear, and what foods we touch. Our senses are therefore a food
battleground, and we have to choose what we will allow inside our mind.

A Perfect Circle The Geodesic Information Processing Model operates as a
perfect circle. Information from the events and circumstances of life
(including marketing messages about food and the latest diet fads) comes
in through our five senses and is received by the conscious cognitive
level. This incoming information activates the four to seven related
memories/mindsets to move from the nonconscious level to the conscious
level of the mind. These existing mindsets/belief systems/clusters of
thoughts with their intertwined emotions or attitudes, as I mentioned
earlier, shape how you perceive and think about the incoming
information. As you pay directed and focused repetitive attention to
this thought, a short-term memory is built. Over time (sixty-three days,
to be precise, as mentioned earlier) it will become an automatized
memory (a habit) and will move into your nonconscious mind, dynamically
influencing your conscious mind. And so the perfect circle goes on.

The Mind versus Big Food

A frightening example of this circle is food marketing. Marketing
campaigns firehose information into your conscious mind through your
five senses. This sensory information is designed to grab your attention
with emotional and visual effects that fire up the senses, which, in
turn, excite the brain. This excitement occurs as your mind tells your
brain what to do with the incoming information, establishing the ideal
conditions for building memory. In addition, the repetition factor in
food marketing through various media such as billboards, radio, displays
in retail centers, magazines, newspapers, books, and the internet on a
continual basis will succeed in planting and automatizing these memories
into your nonconscious mind---but only if you choose to pay attention to
them with your conscious mind. This is precisely because whatever you
pay attention to on a regular and continual basis becomes automatized as
part of your long-term memory store. Indeed, because your nonconscious
mind drives your conscious mind, whatever you implant in your
nonconscious mind influences your conscious mind within the context of
the circle discussed above. This circle acts as a continual feedback
loop, promoting whatever eating patterns you have planted in your mind.
The more the circle focuses on a particular thought, the stronger that
thought grows.

Getting Ads Stuck in Your Head? What does this look like in real,
everyday life? Here is an example: you take your kids to school along
the same route each day, you see and hear the same food-related radio
advertisements, billboards, and fast-food establishments on a daily
basis. Every day, these purposefully designed and emotionally laden food
advertisements follow the circle between your nonconscious mind and
conscious mind, and their messages are reinforced in a rigorous,
disciplined way. By the sixty-third day, these food messages have turned
from short-term memories into long-term memories. In other words, this
repeated exposure to food marketing causes learning to take place, which
eventually becomes part of your long-term memory; it has been
automatized into a habit. You have actually changed your brain
structure, which is neuroplastic, through changing your gene expression
with your thoughts.31 This process is the Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) I

discussed earlier. You have built a memory/mindset of I am hungry now.
Fast-food places sell yummy food. Suddenly you are feeling hungry, or
your children are complaining that they want something to eat, and the
first thing you think of is that cheeseburger that was advertised on the
radio! Yet we can consciously override these food habits embedded in the
conscious mind and rewire them, as I discussed earlier. Many individuals
in the scientific community and business world tell us that we cannot
change who we are or overcome bad habits, that we are essentially
victims who have brain diseases. However, if we line up science with
God's written Word and our scientific interpretations are led by the
Holy Spirit, we will be able to see a glorious world where we can change
and can overcome whatever is thrown our way. By our choices, we are more
than conquerors through Jesus Christ (Rom. 8:37). Each time we make a
choice, we collapse probability into a reality. We make something that
has not yet happened into a real physical thought, which in turn impacts
every one of our approximately 75--100 trillion cells. This collapsing
of probabilities through our choices is called the observer effect in
quantum physics; it is happening all day long as we are doing life.32
The example above highlights the potential power of food marketing, and
the need for us to constantly be on our guard (1 Cor. 16:13). If we are
not aware of the impact of our environment, we will unintentionally be
collapsing probabilities into realities---realities that have very real
consequences. That cheap fast-food hamburger you are eating was a
probability that collapsed into an actuality on the first bite. We must
continually monitor what passes through our five senses. Whatever you
think about will grow, and what you grow is what you do (Prov. 23:7).
Essentially, whatever you are paying attention to and thinking about
becomes part of the memories/mindsets in your nonconscious mind,
influencing the choices made by your conscious mind. Indeed, the real
tragedy of the food marketing example is that this disciplined and
repeated memory-building process should be applied to our thinking, our
schoolwork, our jobs, and other healthy pastimes---not the consumption
of processed, MAD, food-like products. Unfortunately, one of the most
stubborn mindsets we have to contend with tells us that we are too busy
to do the mental work to change our eating habits and too busy to
prepare meals at home. We will explore this hurry sickness next, with a
view to uprooting it from our minds. We will

also look at the link between hurry sickness and television viewing and
explore the effects that television has on our food mindsets.

11 Toxic Schedules and Television: Twin Enemies of Our Minds

Hurry Sickness I do understand that many of us live incredibly busy
lives. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that many of us have what I
call toxic schedules: rest is a luxury we frequently yearn for. And,
when it comes to food, our fast-paced modern lifestyles have produced
the mindset of I am too busy to cook, and convenient foods at least give
me a little bit of time to do what I want. I just need a break. Sticking
that TV dinner in the microwave, and getting our comfy chair ready in
front of the TV to watch the latest celebrity show, seems to be a far
better deal than fussing about in the kitchen trying to prepare
something edible, knowing we will have to clean all those pans later.
After a long, hard day's work in our cubicle, even the idea of preparing
quinoa and chopping some fresh cucumber and tomatoes seems as if we have
just been handed one of those twenty-page-paper topics we were assigned
in college. Although modern technology has made our lives easier in many
respects, thereby saving time for the things we like to do, it is
nevertheless a twoedged sword.1 As James Gleick notes in Faster: The
Acceleration of Just About Everything, these advances have in fact made
it easier for us to work all the time.2 We essentially live under the
Directorate of Time: the clock has become our master.3 Indeed, we can
fall into the trap of living under an unnecessary sense of urgency,
which can put us in chronic toxic stress and make us ill---and give us
terrible indigestion.4 Is it any wonder more and more of us suffer from
discomforting stomach ailments?

This hurry sickness now drives a significant part of our daily lives,
challenging the value of a good, homemade meal with fresh, real food
ingredients.5 Sitting in front of the television and watching in-depth
discussions on famous break-ups with our microwave meal in hand now
seems like a much better deal for many of us. Certainly, I am taking
some liberty with my caricature, yet if we are honest with ourselves
there is more than a little bit of truth in the picture I have painted.
It never ceases to amaze me that more people know about the latest hair
color of a celebrity than where their food comes from. And yet healthy
food is essential for life! The rise of what journalist and activist
Eric Schlosser calls a "fast-food nation" has in fact contributed to our
hurry sickness.6 According to Gleick, fast-food establishments "have
created whole new segments of the economy by understanding, capitalizing
on, and in their own ways fostering our haste."7 The more we patronize
such institutions with our hard-earned money, the more we build a
mindset (through the QZE and the perfect circle between the conscious
and nonconscious mind) that food should be cheap, fast, and prepared
with little effort or time. Under this Directorate of Time, we can
become nutritionally starved even though we are surrounded by what
appears to be an abundance of food. As I mentioned in part 1, today we
have a new health threat: more and more people suffer from both obesity
and malnutrition.8 Our current food system is overloaded with empty
calories that do not sufficiently meet our nutritional requirements, and
an increasing number of us are suffering, both mentally and physically,
as a result.9

Eat Less from a Box, Eat Less in Front of a Box: Toxic TV Schedules
Talking about the effect of food marketing on our nonconscious and
conscious mind leads us to a discussion about television and how it
plays into poor food habits. First, I am in no way against television in
general. I have my own television show, and my son Jeffrey loves film
production and screenwriting. I myself watch television (yes, I am a
Downton Abbey fan!), and I believe that all forms of media can be
wonderful sources of relaxation, cultural communication, and learning.

Yet excessive television viewing is one of the defining features of our
modern culture and correlates with mental and bodily ill health.10 For
example, a study of more than two thousand toddlers showed that watching
TV between the ages of one and three was linked to attention span issues
and a decreased ability to control impulses later on in childhood. Every
hour spent watching TV increased toddlers' chance of focus and attention
problems by a frightening 10 percent.11 A 2015 study published in the
journal Infant Behavior and Development supports the findings of this
earlier paper, putting this correlation in startling terms: "cognitive,
language, and motor delays in young children were significantly
associated with how much time they spent viewing television."12 Similar
correlations between viewing time and mental and physical wellbeing have
been found for both adolescents and adults.13 How is this risk related
to our eating habits in particular? Because governmental bodies and food
conglomerates use the television to market their food-like products to
both adults and children, the MAD food diet is being wired into the
nonconscious minds of every individual who is not aware of its
influence, including toddlers. We merge with our environments because of
the plasticity of our brains, and environmental influences can become
our new norm if we are not guarding our thoughts.14 Wired-in mindsets
are learned mindsets and may feel normal because of familiarity, even if
the mindset or habit is essentially unhealthy and toxic.15

Toxic Targets: Are Our Children for Sale? As a society, we should be
especially concerned about the impact of food marketing on our children.
A growing body of research shows that a greater familiarity with
fast-food restaurant advertising is linked to an increased chance of
obesity among children and young adults and is associated with the
consumption of high-calorie snacks, drinks, and fast food, and a lower
consumption of fruit and vegetables.16 For instance, in one study
individuals who were surrounded on a daily basis by images of
predominantly MAD foods via TV advertisements, billboards, magazines,
and other forms of media were more likely to overindulge when they ate a
meal.17 Constant exposure to food cues within our environment impacts
eating habits. This impact in turn suggests that the advertising does
indeed make us think more

about food.18 Likewise, several research projects indicate that children
are far more likely to eat unhealthy, calorie-dense foods when they
drink sugarsweetened beverages (SSBs) and if they watch excessive
amounts of television.19 Another study showed that each additional hour
in front of the television increased the likelihood of regular
consumption of sugary beverages by an alarming 50 percent.20 And
children are constantly surrounded by these MAD food images. The average
child will be exposed to approximately thirteen food commercials every
day, or 4,700 a year, while teenagers see more than sixteen food
advertisements per day, or 5,900 a year.21 These statistics are related
to television viewing only and exclude food commercials in other mediums
of advertising such as magazines, shopping malls, schools, social media,
and so on.22 What is the cost to their health? The
"eat-more-processed-foods" message is wired into their nonconscious
minds through repetition and automatized learning. These learned habits
or mindsets will shape their conscious thoughts about food, and thereby
their food choices. Is it any wonder then that exposure to MAD food
advertising is associated with higher consumption of fast food by
children?23 Unfortunately, food marketing campaigns directed at young
people are a global phenomenon. MAD food and drink advertisements are
common during children's TV programs in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and
across the Americas, to name just a few regions.24 The food industry
spends \$1.8 billion per year in the United States alone on food
marketing targeted to young people.25 The overwhelming majority of these
ads are for unhealthy products high in empty calories, sugar, unhealthy
fats, and/or salt.26 Although policies and regulations have been
introduced to control food marketing, they are often flawed. Statutory
legislation to control children's exposure to highly processed and
sugar-laden foods on television was introduced in the United Kingdom in
2007, and similar regulations have recently been established in
Ireland.27 However, these regulations are not applied to program
content, while the American food industry remains largely, and
unsuccessfully, self-regulated.28 With an estimated two hundred million
school-aged children overweight or obese globally, the impact of food
marketing is truly a global health issue.29 As the MAD food industry
continues to insufficiently self-regulate its marketing agendas, more
and more youth are crippled with lifestyle diseases that can affect
their future development, spirit, soul, and body.30 Is

this not a form of child abuse?31 Is it not our responsibility as the
guardians of future generations to do all we can to create a healthy
environment for them to develop in? Is it not our task to love, care
for, and protect our children (Ps. 127:3; Matt. 19:14; 1 Tim. 3:12)?
With children as young as two years of age being treated for obesity,
and official bodies such as The Obesity Society (TOS) concluding that
SSBs contribute to the US obesity epidemic, especially among children,
we need to start asking ourselves these difficult questions.32

This Is Your Brain on "Speed" Up to now we have been speaking of
television's influence. Now let's consider social media too. It turns
out that TV and social media actually increase our hurry sickness
because media outlets flow at a much faster pace than real life.33
Indeed, new forms of media are getting faster as technology advances. A
Twitter post, for example, has an estimated life span of roughly a
second, if your followers subscribe to a lot of other profiles.34 Again,
I am not against these forms of media per se. I do have a Twitter
account, as well as a Facebook page and an Instagram profile. Yet as we
become saturated in a high-paced media culture, we tend to develop an
increased desire for these whirlwind transitions because they satisfy
the 27 processing speeds of the brain (10 bits per second).35 We are
essentially designed to do busy well.36 Television in particular, with
its cuts, edits, zooms, pans, and sudden noises, changes the brain by
triggering the release of dopamine and various other transmitters
related to neuroplasticity, and therefore learning.37 Indeed, your
entire body responds to fast-paced media forms. As Norman Doidge
explains in The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph
from the Frontiers of Brain Science: The response is physiological: the
heart rate decreases for four to six seconds. Television triggers this
response at a far more rapid rate than we experience it in life, which
is why we can't keep our eyes off the TV screen, even in the middle of
an intimate conversation, and why people watch TV a lot longer than they
intend. Because typical music videos, action sequences, and commercials
trigger orienting responses at a rate of one per second, watching them
puts us into continuous orienting response with no recovery. No wonder
people report feeling drained from watching TV. Yet we acquire a taste
for it and find slower changes boring.38

Even your heart and entire body get accustomed to the speed of modern
life! Thus, you have to remember that what your brain and body will be
learning is based on your choices. The more you choose to watch
television and/or participate in fast-paced social media outlets, or
allow your children to do so, the more your brain will change, and the
more you will desire the "speedy" rush. Ultimately, there is a fine
balance between being intellectually stimulated through conversation,
learning, and understanding and becoming negatively addicted to these
swift forms of media as one picture or video or piece of information
after another floods your senses.39

Following the Leader: You Control the Circle Despite the fact that we
feel the pull of the sensory information coming into our conscious minds
through the media commercials, we can control how we process this
information. Indeed, one of my favorite advertisements is for a
fast-food establishment in South Africa---it makes me laugh every time I
watch it on YouTube! Yet the message behind this particular commercial
has no effect whatsoever on me, since my nonconscious mind is embedded
with information on how the fast food was produced and what effect it
will have on me if I consume it. These memories/mindsets are immediately
brought up from my nonconscious mind into my conscious mind when I view
this commercial. When this happens, I do not crave the fast food, or
think I should go to a fast-food establishment when I am hungry---I just
laugh because the advertisement is genuinely funny. I have learned to
control my reactions to the sensory information I receive through
directing my mind. Yet what will happen if you do not plant healthy
mindsets into your nonconscious mind? You feel thirsty, so you think
soda, and choose to go out and purchase a soda because you associate
that soda with the happiness of the marketing campaign you saw on
television. You may not believe that you will be transplanted to a
gorgeous beach with happy individuals drinking soda, while dolphins leap
excitedly in the background, but the positive emotions associated with
the idea of fun, relaxation, and friendship imbue that sugary drink with
a strong appeal. The perfect circle has built a mindset that says, I am
thirsty. And if I drink this soda I will quench my thirst . . . and be
happier.

Now you may say that the scenario I have painted is ridiculous, and that
you do not think like that at all. Ultimately, however, we each live out
of what we have built into our nonconscious minds. The reason fast-food
corporations spend millions of dollars associating soda with contentment
is because these commercials make soda attractive in your mind.40 When
you think of that soda, your nonconscious mind will bring up the four to
seven happy memories that the advertisement promised, or the short-term
satisfaction associated with a past experience involving soda. These
corporations do not hold a gun to your head, compelling you to drink the
soda. Ultimately, the choice is yours. And your choices are based on
what you have built into your minds. How could you redesign this
mindset? You need to learn how to think about soda again. First, you
need to bring that thought about soda into captivity (2 Cor. 10:5).
Remember that journal article about the relationship between added sugar
consumption and lifestyle-related diseases like diabetes. Remember that
documentary on today's obesity pandemic, and how our children may end up
living lives that are more disease-prone and shorter than our own
generation. Remember that newspaper article on sugar production and
slavery in the Dominican Republic. Remember that book on the sugar
industry's manipulation of scientific data. Remember the damage to our
world's water supplies associated with the large-scale production of
soda. Remember the information in this book! Begin asking yourself hard
questions and accept that there will be some hard answers. Are there not
roughly ten teaspoons of sugar in a can of soda? 41 This added sugar can
cause your insulin to spike, and the enteric nervous system of your gut
(or "gut brain," as we will see in chapter 12) to secrete an abnormal
amount of amyloid protein, which will start destroying the blood-brain
barrier and can contribute to the formation of the amyloid plaques of
Alzheimer's disease.42 This sugar will bind to the proteins in your
blood, and your hemoglobin AC1 can rise in a frightening process called
glycation, which contributes to neurodegeneration.43 Excess sugar can be
stored as triglycerides in your body, making you gain weight, while your
normal stress response has been activated into protect mode, which may
cause unhealthy physical responses in your brain and body if it carries
on in the long term.44 And these are just a few of the negative effects
excess added sugar consumption may have on your own body. What of the
destruction of our planet's natural resources, or the cost in human
lives

associated with sugar production?45 Are we being righteous stewards of
God's creation? Of our own temples? Are we loving our neighbors, or
ourselves? Now, does that soda actually live up to its commercial
promises? If you examine the facts behind soda production and
consumption, think critically about the impact of the soda industry and
your own choices in terms of both your own life and the world, and plant
these thoughts in your nonconscious mind through this process of
"asking, answering, and discussing,"46 the next time you watch that TV
advertisement your reaction will be determined by an entirely different
set of memories. Memories that you have chosen to implant in your mind;
memories that will determine whether or not you choose to drink the
soda. You choose life or death with your food thoughts and food choices
(Deut. 30:19--20).

The Choice Is Yours Yet why do so many people acknowledge that soda is
unhealthy---and continue to drink it? I have emphasized choice in the
passage above, since information is only as powerful an influence as we
allow it to be. We have to choose to process this information, or create
a mindset/habit in our nonconscious minds based on the information we
receive on a daily basis through our five senses. The true cost of soda,
and our MAD food system in general, can be frightening. Do we really
want to acknowledge this cost? Is it not more convenient, and more
comforting, to ignore it? And it is certainly difficult to rewire our
habits, although it is not impossible. It is easier to continue
following old patterns of thinking. And if we have spent sixty-three
days or more (which establishes habituated thoughts in our nonconscious
minds as discussed above) processing the sensory information we receive
from drinking a soda (such as the smell, taste, and touch of soda) in
the context of the "good life," reading just one article on the dangers
of excess sugar consumption will not necessarily convert us to a
healthier lifestyle overnight. The positive marketing of soda, perhaps
married to your own happy experiences drinking soda, has (insidiously I
would add) become an established memory in your nonconscious mind. Now,
"soda = good life" is packing that 90--95 percent punch in terms of
influencing how you perceive

the information in the article on the dangers of soda consumption. Soda
and its association with the good life has been automatized into a
powerful nonconscious force in your conscious mind---and thus a powerful
force on your choices. And, as the health article fades from your
short-term memory within the space of twenty-four to forty-eight hours,
the "soda = good life" emerges with a renewed vigor.47 After all, you
may think to yourself, How bad can soda really be? Everyone drinks soda.
If it were so bad for us, why would the shops and restaurants still sell
it? Even my own doctor drinks it! Many hospitals even give Coke to
patients as part of their meals. Anyway, nutritionists are always
telling us something is bad, then it is good, then it is bad. Not even
they know what they are talking about. My soda example may sound like a
food industry conspiracy theory, but ultimately the choice is yours. On
a daily basis, we are all bombarded with sensory information, from all
walks of life. Yet we have the ability to choose how to process this
information. We allow this information to affect our choices. I
certainly do not believe the marketing of all products should be
completely forbidden (although I find fault with unrestricted marketing
of food products to young children), nor do I think we need legislation
against diet gurus or individuals who promise that certain foods or ways
of eating will heal all our ailments and help us live to a hundred and
five. But I do believe we should be taught how to process all the
food-related information we come across, and indeed all information we
receive through our five senses; we should be taught how to think
critically and develop wisdom. Once we recognize that we do have this
ability to think and choose ---to truly think and truly choose for
ourselves---we will become empowered to make healthy, life-promoting
decisions, not just in terms of what we eat but in every area of our
life. As I keep repeating, the only balanced diet is one that includes
your thoughts. We need to be selective, indeed "fussy," about what we
allow into our heads and what we put on our plates. God has designed the
body to work together perfectly. As the apostle Paul noted, "Each part
does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the
whole body is healthy and growing and full of love" (Eph. 4:16 NLT).
This Scripture not only applies to the church as the body of Christ but
to the whole of creation, since we all came from God (Gen. 1:1--31; John
1:3).

Critical thinking is vital, because our choices determine our mindsets.
And as we'll learn next, those mindsets aren't just locked away in our
brains, far from our stomachs. The truth is that physically there is a
tight connection between the mind and the gut. They communicate in ways
that scientists have been astonished to discover.

12 What's Eating You?

The act of eating is not just a biological function for survival. The
consumption of food, as normal as it is, is in fact a highly emotional
and metacognitive event. Indeed, this should come as no surprise to us:
throughout human history, gathering around a table and eating food has
been a way for us to celebrate or commemorate notable seasons,
individuals, and events.1 Meals are a focal point for social gatherings,
and sharing food is a powerful medium of communication both within and
between cultures. I certainly believe that the joy of preparing a meal
and sharing it with people is incredibly powerful and therapeutic. As my
daughter likes to say, one seasoning every cook should use is the
pleasure of a hearty gathering, which should be sprinkled generously on
every plate. Who needs a handful of digestive supplements when you have
good, real food and good, real company? Yet meals can have either
positive or negative emotional "seasonings," both of which affect the
way our bodies digest food. Our gastrointestinal (GI) tract is very
sensitive to our emotions, since it is connected to our brain's
hypothalamus, which controls the feelings of satiety and hunger and
deals with our emotional state of mind. Our mind and gut are acutely
interconnected, and thus happiness, joy, and pleasure, as well as anger,
anxiety, sadness, and bitterness, for example, trigger physical
reactions in our digestive systems. Our large and small intestines are
densely lined with neurons, neuropeptides, and receptors (the "doorways"
into cells), which are all rapidly exchanging information laden with
emotional content. Indeed, we have all experienced this gurgling
emotional activity in our guts, colloquially known as being "sick to
your stomach," having a "gut feeling," or having "butterflies in your
stomach."2

Indeed, unless we are aware of what our digestive system is telling us,
we may fall into the trap of overeating. The pancreas releases at least
twenty different emotionally laden peptides, which regulate the
assimilation and storage of nutrients and carry information about
satiety and hunger.3 Do not ignore the information these peptides
provide. Just as eating when we are angry or when we are trying to bury
another unpleasant emotion will affect the way we assimilate the
nutrients in our food, eating when we are not hungry will upset our
digestive system.4 Overeating will make the food we eat or drink less
beneficial, since the emotions generated by toxic thinking interfere
with the proper workings of our body. Eating when we are in a distressed
emotional state, or not hungry, is essentially like adding every spice
and herb in the cupboard to the meal. All these seasonings will destroy
the balance of flavors among the meal's components. Emotionally driven
food consumption literally adds a flood of chemical, emotional
"seasonings" to our food; our digestive system, like our palate, will
not know how to interpret such a conflicting range of signals.5 When we
react incorrectly to the events and circumstances of life, we move into
toxic stress, or stages two and three of stress.6 Toxic stress keeps our
"fight or flight" response activated, which inhibits gastrointestinal
secretion and reduces blood flow to the gut, thereby decreasing
metabolism and affecting our body's ability to digest food.7 In fact,
toxic thinking and emotions, which lead to toxic stress, can affect the
movement and contractions of the GI tract, cause inflammation, make us
more susceptible to infection, decrease nutrient absorption and
enzymatic output, upset the regenerative capacity of gastrointestinal
mucosa and mucosal blood flow, irritate intestinal microflora, cause our
esophagus to go into spasms, give us indigestion and heartburn by
increasing the acid in our stomach, make us feel nauseous, cause
existing digestive issues such as stomach ulcers to worsen, and agitate
our colon in a way that gives us diarrhea, constipation, and/or extreme
bloating.8 To say that we should not eat food because we are stressed,
unhappy, angry, or any other negative emotion is most certainly an
understatement.

A Healthy Gut Is a Happy Mind

Yet thinking good thoughts cannot excuse an unhealthy diet. The
digestive system itself is a rich source of neurotransmitters, which
carry signals inside the brain and body.9 In fact, 95 percent of the
serotonin and half the dopamine in the body are produced in the gut.10
Considering these neurotransmitters are famous for their mood-calming
and reward effects, respectively, we should be paying a lot more
attention to what we are putting in our gut---what we eat affects the
way these neurotransmitters function. Indeed, beneficial symbiotic gut
bacteria produce benzodiazepinelike substances, which are naturally
occurring antianxiety neurochemicals.11 A healthy gut promotes a calm,
satisfied, and happy mind.

Sweet Dreams Are Made of Cheese Digestive functioning even affects our
sleeping patterns. Researchers have found that people with Irritable
Bowel Syndrome (IBS) tend to have enhanced Rapid Eye Movement (REM)
sleep.12 REM sleep is one of the stages of sleep, and we cycle through
these stages in specific time periods in order to obtain optimal memory
consolidation and restoration of the mind.13 Since dreaming occurs
during REM sleep, disturbed digestion is associated with excess
dreaming---so-called "pizza dreams" actually do occur. The "gut-brain
link" is highly influential, two-way communication, affecting everything
from our digestion to our sleeping patterns.14 The "gut brain" and
"brain brain" need to engage and talk, and these conversations are
controlled by our thought lives. This is why it is so important to make
sure our minds are implanted with the Word of God, since our minds
affect every part of our bodies.

Sick to Your Stomach: A Brief History of the Mind-Gut Connection The
gut-brain link is not a new discovery. In 1833, American army surgeon
William Beaumont treated Alexis St. Martin, a French-Canadian traveler
who had been shot in the stomach.15 The wound left an opening in the
skin that allowed Beaumont to observe the pumping, to-and-fro motion of
the

stomach and also to see what happened when his patient expressed
different emotions.16 St. Martin's stomach, for instance, produced less
acid (acid necessary for the proper functioning of the digestive system)
when he was fearful, angry, or impatient.17 In the French-Canadian's
stomach, upset thinking led to upset digestion! Over a century later,
Michael Gershon, known as the father of the gutbrain connection,
researched and wrote extensively on the effect of thinking and the
enteric nervous system (ENS). His work highlighted the GI system's
sensitivity to emotions.18 Anger, anxiety, sadness, elation, pleasure
---all of these feelings (and others) trigger symptoms in the gut.19
Moreover, Gershon showed how the gut-brain connection is a two-way
street: the gut feeds back into the brain, thereby affecting the mind.20
His work has since been supported by numerous studies, and many
researchers today continue to probe the complex relationship between
thinking and the GI system.21 The new science of neurogastroenterology
was born, which includes the examination of psychosomatic upsets that
have a gastrointestinal expression and their relationship to the central
nervous system (CNS).22

The Enteric Nervous System The gastrointestinal (GI) system is
controlled by the enteric nervous system (ENS), often called the "second
brain."23 The ENS consists of about 200-- 600 million nerve cells, which
control every aspect of digestion---a considerably higher number of
neurons than in the spinal cord.24 The ENS communicates with the central
nervous system (CNS) through the nerve pathways; in fact the ENS
originates from the same tissues as the CNS during fetal development. It
also contains a number of structural and chemical counterparts to the
brain.25 Indeed, researchers have found that the ENS uses many of the
same neurotransmitters, or chemical messengers, as the CNS.26 As food
makes its thirty-foot journey through the digestive tract, there is
ongoing dialogue between the ENS and the brain via the autonomic nervous
system (ANS), which controls the body's vital functions.27 These two
systems are connected via the vagus nerve: the tenth cranial nerve that
runs from your brain stem down to your abdomen.28 This back-and-forth
communication is why, in normal circumstances, you stop eating when you

are full. Sensory neurons in your GI system inform your brain when your
stomach is distended and full.29 Likewise, this communication between
these nervous systems also explains why being anxious about something
can ruin your appetite or make you feel bloated: the entire gut-brain
connection is saturated with our emotions.30

If You're Happy and You Know It, Go and Shop Our emotions impact not
only the way our body digests food but also our choices---before our
meal even enters our mouths! As obesity and dietrelated statistics
continue to rise at an alarming rate, a growing number of officials,
organizations, and individuals are demanding better labeling and
improved nutritional knowledge.31 Yet this approach may do little to
alleviate our "global eating disorder," since it does not place enough
emphasis on thinking and emotional awareness. What is the point of
knowledge, including nutritional information, if we do not know how to
apply it or if our nonconscious mind is already filled with toxic
thoughts about food? A number of studies indicate that training people
to pay attention to their emotions is a far more effective approach to
developing a balanced diet than nutritional labeling.32 People have a
tendency to not think about their food choices and the attached emotions
when shopping for, preparing, and eating food.33 Yet some researchers
have found that as emotional awareness develops, food choices can be
improved with an approach that is geared toward deep thinking. In one
study, for instance, participants who had received training in
recognizing their emotions shed, on average, excess weight over time,
whereas the individuals who received no emotional training tended to
gain weight.34 Similarly, a review of thirteen separate studies showed
that people with functional gastrointestinal illness who tried
psychologically based approaches found greater relief from their
symptoms than those who received conventional treatment alone.35 When we
eat reactively, that is, without deliberately examining the mindsets
embedded in our nonconscious minds, we increase our risk for making
unhealthy food choices. These mindsets may have been shaped by the
latest food marketing campaign or by the need to bury our sorrow in a
tub of ice cream, but unless we are aware of these memories and their

power to influence our choices, how useful is knowing the number of
calories per serving or the warnings of health professionals? If we are
honest with ourselves, we understand this "willful blindness" all too
well.36 How many times have we had a bad day and grabbed that tub of ice
cream, knowing that it is bad for our health? And how many times have we
eaten the whole thing anyway? The nonconscious mindsets of I have had a
bad day; I deserve ice cream and Ice cream tastes so good override the
temporary memories of I know I should not eat this ice cream because I
want to be healthy and I know that I will regret eating it later in our
conscious mind. Of course, no one has strapped us to a chair and is
forcing spoonfuls of ice cream down our throat. We have selected, or
chosen, to suppress our knowledge of the health facts of excessive
refined sugar and fat consumption; we have chosen to eat the ice cream.
However, if we are not aware of how we are selecting certain
food-related thoughts, and selecting to ignore other food-related
thoughts, how can we truly make the right food choices---food choices
that are sustainable in the long run because they are built on
unyielding, healthy memories? Truly, we are destroyed for a lack of
knowledge; many of us lack the knowledge of how to apply our knowledge.
It is perhaps not surprising, even if it is troubling, that people still
drink soda after I talk on the health dangers of consuming sugary
beverages. These members of the audience have chosen to suppress the
temporary memory of my talk in their conscious minds in light of the
mindsets associated with drinking soda that they have chosen to implant
in their nonconscious level of mind. Although it saddens me to see
people drink soda, it is their choice nonetheless. Indeed, what we are
thinking about when we choose the food we are going to eat influences
how we enjoy that meal, and the value we place on that meal. If we
believe a certain food is expensive and exclusive, for instance, we will
enjoy it more---even if the food is not really any better than its
cheaper counterpart.37 If we think a certain food is cheap, on the other
hand, we place less value on it and enjoy it less, even if it is exactly
the same as a more expensive substitute.38 Likewise, a number of studies
show how individuals, when they are not aware of their eating behavior,
will consume food regardless of their hunger level. Paul Rozin,
professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, showed that
amnesiac patients who were told it was

dinnertime ate a second complete meal within ten to thirty minutes after
having eaten the first meal, and a third meal ten to thirty minutes
after the second meal, even though they could not have been physically
hungry. Just thinking it was time to have a meal or a snack was enough
to make them want to eat!39

All You Need Is Love All the structures of our brains and bodies are
wired for love. We are made in the image of a perfect God, a God who is
love (Gen. 1:26; 1 John 4:8). We are wired to think good thoughts and
make good choices. We are designed to wire in healthy, beautiful
thoughts and eat healthy, beautiful food. Yet we also have free will,
and can choose to do the opposite---but not without consequences (Deut.
30:19; Eccles. 7:29). Emotional awareness in terms of your food choices
is so important that I would in all honesty recommend putting "positive
attitude" on your shopping list! Feelings rooted in love, such as peace,
hope, joy, and compassion, inspire food choices rooted in love.
According to one study in the Journal of Consumer Research, for example,
when people are hopeful, they think about the future, and they tend to
be aware of eating for the future: a healthy diet is a hopeful diet. On
the other hand, when people tend to ruminate on negative things from the
past, they are less inclined to purchase food products that promote
longevity: if things are so bad anyway, why bother buying that local,
organically grown kale?40 Emotions, choices, and actions cannot be
separated since they are part of the perfect circle in your mind, which
in turn impacts your entire body. Your thoughts, with their associated
emotions, determine what you choose to eat: you are what you eat, and
what you think.

The Real "Balanced Meal": Eating for the Spirit, Soul, and Body The
relationship between the gut and the brain, and the relationship between
our feelings and shopping habits, are just two examples of the
multifaceted, interconnected lives we all lead---a concept often at odds
with

modernity. We live in a world that tends toward intellectual
reductionism. Globally, we have become accustomed to a
parts-rather-than-whole approach, including the way we approach food.
Why else would doctors, as our go-to health figures, have negligible
training in nutrition, even at Harvard's medical school?41 To say that
what we eat affects our health is certainly redundant. So how can such a
basic, fundamental fact be overlooked when dealing with matters of
health and illness? It is imperative that we shift the way we think
about health. Our brain is not an input-output machine. Our body is not
an input-output machine. We are each intrinsically, brilliantly, and
intricately designed with a spirit, soul, and body (Gen. 1:26; 1 Thess.
5:23). This is known as our triune nature.42 Our triune nature is
divided into different components. Our spirit is our "true you," or what
I call our perfectly you.43 Our spirit has three parts: intuition,
conscience, and communion (worship). Our soul, which is our mind, also
has three parts: intellect, will, and emotions.44 Lastly, our body has
three parts: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, from which the brain
and the body form.45 Our mind, or soul, has one foot in the door of the
spirit and one foot in the door of the body. The mind creates coherence
between the spirit and the body, and therefore influences and controls
brain/body function and health, and influences spiritual development.
Our mind, with its intellectual ability to choose and its emotional
authority, controls all physical aspects.46 Thus emotions, as part of
the mind, are an intrinsic part of our food choices. Our brain is
designed to respond to our mind, and our mind is designed to respond to
our spirit (John 14:26; 16:3; Rom. 8:14; Gal. 5:16). Every thought,
feeling, and action begins in the internal activity of our mind, which
means that we choose with our minds to listen to our spirits, we choose
with our minds to listen to the Holy Spirit speaking truth into our
spirit, we choose with our minds to act, we choose with our minds to
speak, and we choose with our minds to eat. And all these mind-based
choices impact our physical brain and body as well as our spiritual
development and mental health. The ultimate question is, what have we
implanted in our mind? What mindsets will be shaping our choices?
Remember, "as he thinks in his heart \[mind\], so is he" (Prov. 23:7,
emphasis added).

Fasting for the Spirit, Soul, and Body

One aid to disciplining the mind is fasting. Whether it involves
skipping one meal or more or excluding certain foods from the diet,
fasting has played an important role in human history---spiritually and
physically. In today's world, however, eating three meals a day is
generally understood as healthy, although there is actually no
conclusive scientific basis for not skipping breakfast, lunch, or
dinner, or even all three occasionally.47 A growing body of research
actually indicates that different types of fasting can improve health
and longevity, such as intermittent fasting (eating fewer meals),
caloric restriction (eating less per meal), and alternate day fasting.48
These types of fasting can potentially improve cardiovascular function,
increase longevity, increase resistance to age-related diseases, and
enhance mental and physical health in general.49 Intermittent fasting
and caloric restriction both affect energy levels and free-radical
production from oxygen metabolism, as well as cellular stress response
systems, in ways that protect neurons against genetic and environmental
factors while enhancing energy production from the mitochondria, which
generate chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).50
Likewise, caloric restriction triggers a decrease in inflammatory
factors, which contribute to the onset of disease.51 Skipping a few
meals on a regular basis can even protect against the onset of illness.
Fasting has been shown to enhance brain function and reduce the risk
factors for coronary artery disease, stroke, insulin sensitivity, and
blood pressure.52 For instance, restricting calories can support the
induction of sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), an enzyme that regulates gene expression
and enhances learning and memory. Fasting actually has a similar effect
on the body as exercise. Skipping a meal or eating less and exercise are
both mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), suggesting
they are underpinned by similar mechanisms in the body.53 And we
definitely want BDNF mediating! This neurotrophic factor helps maintain
brain health, prevents cell death, and builds memory.54 In fact,
intermittent fasting and caloric restriction can aid intra-brain
communication by supporting interactive pathways and molecular
mechanisms that specifically provide benefits to the neurons. These
pathways produce protective protein "chaperones"---neurotrophic factors
like BDNF and essential antioxidants, which help our tiny cells cope
with stress and resist disease.55 Similarly, fasting may protect neurons
against the onset of Alzheimer's disease by preventing amyloid beta and
tau

pathologies on synaptic function.56 Overall, research on fasting
indicates that skipping a meal or two can promote resistance to stroke
and neurodegenerative disease. Our food choices literally change the
environment around our cells and the environment within our cells---an
incredible support system (one of many) that highlights the goodness and
mercy of God.57 By making the right food choices we can change our
brains!

Triune Fasting On a spiritual level, fasting is a common practice. For
example, Greek Orthodox Christians fast from certain foods 180--200 days
per year, prior to Easter, Christmas, and the Assumption. Catholic
Christians fast from certain foods for approximately forty days before
Easter.58 The Daniel Fast is very common among Christians, and usually
lasts between twenty-one and forty days.59 Biblically, the call to fast
is found throughout both the Old and New Testaments. It is a way for
Jews and Christians to make their beliefs part of their everyday lives,
in a sense of bringing heaven to earth (Matt. 6:9--13).60 It enables us
to put God above our earthly pleasures, in the sense that we put God
first and appreciate food and drink as a gift from him rather than love
food and drink in and of themselves.61 It enables us to become addicted
to God. We do not fast merely to get healthy and lose weight.62 We fast
for the spirit, soul, and body: by putting God first, "all these things
shall be added to you" (Matt. 6:33). The growing body of fasting
research actually confirms the integrated triune nature of man, since as
we discipline our mind and choose to reduce our bodily food intake and
focus on God, our spirit, soul, and body all develop. Fasting is a way
of asserting our mind's and spirit's control over our body. It's so
important for us to understand that we have the freedom to choose our
mindsets that chapter 13 will briefly address the opposing view, that
our physical brains make us do what we do. We'll see that despite the
glamor of brain scans, we are very far from being stuck with the
mindsets we currently have.

13 This Is Your Brain on Brain Scans

We have all seen the headlines: "This is your brain on drugs"; "This is
your brain on porn"; "This is your brain on YouTube cat videos." All
right, perhaps not quite the last headline. Nevertheless, the
unscrupulous use of brain imaging by media outlets, companies,
university press offices, and many researchers seems to offer us
physical proof that everything from obesity to murder originates from a
brain that is imbalanced or diseased.1 These visual pictures are
misleading when it comes to where the responsibility lies for our
health. Our biology is not our destiny.2 The damage in the brain that
results from incorrect lifestyle choices---including what and how we
eat---does constrain an individual's ability to think and choose, but it
does not destroy it. Based on my research, experiences, and beliefs, I
view the brain and mind as separate and, more importantly, I believe
that the mind controls the brain. Over the twenty-five years that I
practiced clinically and trained thousands of teachers and students and
corporations, I saw countless people overcome biological and societal
difficulties, pursue their dreams, and succeed. I have met so many
people in the course of my travels teaching this message around the
world, and have had the privilege of seeing them overcome impossible
circumstances. I have seen, both firsthand and in scientific literature,
indeed in history, the power of human choice.3 And I believe in a God
who is love, a God who has given us powerful, sound minds (2 Tim. 1:7; 1
John 4:8). We cannot get excited when we hear sermons about how powerful
God has made us and refuse to hear the other side of the coin---that is,
that we can use this power incorrectly. If we believe we are fearfully
and wonderfully made, there is a heavy responsibility that comes with
bearing

God's glorious image (Gen. 1:27). If we believe we are powerful lions of
God, then we also have to recognize our ability to kill---an ability
that can be used for both good and bad. We have to take personal
responsibility for the way we think, speak, act, and eat (Luke 6:46;
12:48; 2 Cor. 5:10; James 4:17). We need to stop being victims of our
biology, of what happens to us, and start being victors. Are we not more
than conquerors through Christ (Rom. 8:37)? Is anything impossible for
our God (Matt. 19:26)? We are not meant to just cope. We are called to
conquer. We are called to choose life (Deut. 30:19).

My Brain Made Me Do It Today, there is a massive split in the world of
neuroscience. Many scientists believe that the mind is a result of
firing neurons: they see the mind as an emergent property of the brain.4
On the other hand, many scientists (myself included) are mind-body
dualists: we argue that the mind changes the brain.5 The neurocentric
perspective of the former argument arises out of humankind's desire to
worship the created (brain) instead of the Creator. Indeed, this
neurocentric, brain-focused mindset is, alarmingly, influencing all
walks of life. It has become increasingly fashionable to assume that the
brain is the most important level of analysis for understanding human
behavior, and that the mind is more or less expendable, literally a
by-product of the brain.6 We see the firing of neurons and we assume
that this is what love or hatred is. Yet what if love causes the neurons
to fire? It is a "chicken and egg" question that ultimately requires us
to make a judgment based on our own interpretation of the data. In a
secular world, I understand, even if I do not agree with, the
mechanistic emphasis on the brain and the belief in matter that can be
measured in a quantifiable manner held by many scientists and
researchers today.7 Their beliefs have shaped their interpretations of
neuroscience, just as my beliefs in an almighty God, human free will,
and the intangible power of the mind shape my interpretations of
neuroscience. Yet why is this neurocentric vein of thought so dangerous?
Essentially, the "oversimplification, interpretive license, and
premature application of brain science in the legal, commercial,
clinical, and philosophical domains" can lead us into murky waters when
it comes to taking responsibility for our

actions.8 Are you a murderer, or did the different activity seen in that
brain scan make you do it? Are you addicted to food because your brain
is wired that way, because you have inherited a genetic disposition from
your parents---or because you have made choices? Someone may say, "My
brain scan shows I have an overactive amygdala, so it is hard for me to
control my emotions and that is why I cannot control my eating." Once
you start down this path, you will ultimately have to question your
belief in free will, since a predominant focus on the brain takes the
control away from the individual and places the blame squarely on the
brain. I do not deny that very real changes will happen in the brain
(how the mind changes the brain is my area of expertise) when we lead a
toxic eating and thinking lifestyle, nor do I deny that some individuals
do have damaged brains through no fault of their own. Yet for the most
part the mind (that is, our thoughts and choices) comes first, which
causes problems in the brain and body, which in turn feed back into the
mind, making us feel awful if our mind is toxic.

There Is No Excuse for Excuses Even if we do feel awful from wrong
lifestyle choices, we need to stop looking for excuses and recognize
that the mind is more powerful than the brain and body. Where the mind
goes, the brain and body follow. In most instances we got there first
with our mind, so we can get back to a good place in the same way: with
our mind. The colorfully illuminated brain on an fMRI scan, SPECT, or
other imaging technology cannot be trusted to offer an in-depth view of
the mind. This phenomenal but developing and limited technology provides
a mere glimpse into activity happening in the brain in terms of energy,
glucose metabolism, and blood flow.9 It does not show our thoughts.
Neuroscientists are very far from determining the exact link between
what they see on the scans and the content of our thoughts.10
Brain-imaging technology cannot read your thoughts, desires, loves,
lies, feelings, morals, or the uniqueness of who you are---nor what is
going on in your mind when it comes to eating.

To some neuroscientists and philosophers, you may be nothing more than
your brain, but to God, you are a spirit, soul, and body---uniquely,
fearfully, and wonderfully made---the crowning glory of his creation
(Ps. 139:14). This gives us great hope for getting eating right so we
can have healthy bodies, brains, and minds. Our brains and bodies have
to do what we tell them to do through our minds (our choices, which are
real electromagnetic and quantum signals with real chemical effects in
the brain and body). It is not logical to see behavior, including food
choices, as beyond a person's control simply because some associated
neural activity can be seen in the brain. As psychiatrist Sally Satel
and psychologist Scott O. Lilienfeld explain in Brainwashed: The
Seductive Appeal of Mindless Neuroscience: Scans alone cannot tell us
whether a person is a shameless liar, loyal to a product brand,
compelled to use cocaine, or incapable of resisting an urge to kill. In
fact, brain-derived data currently add little or nothing to the more
ordinary sources of information we rely on to make those determinations;
mostly, they are neuroredundant. At worst, neuroscientific information
sometimes distorts our ability to distinguish good explanations of
psychological phenomena from bad ones.11

We know someone is a shameless liar when they lie shamelessly. The same
can be said for loyal customers, addicts, and murderers. Viewing their
brain activity on a slide is essentially "neuroredundant" in terms of
knowing that they have chosen to do these things. If we look for answers
on a brain scan, we can fall into the trap of seeking all the solutions
to all our problems in an image of glucose metabolism, energy, and blood
flow. This is scientific reductionism at its worst, focusing myopically
on a sense of "we are what our neurons do." Brain scans are essentially
as accurate as trying to hear the exact conversation in the street below
when you are standing on the roof of a skyscraper.12 You may see the
mouths moving, but you will not hear the conversation. By the same
token, brain scans see activity but they don't know the actual
conversation happening within the depths of the brain as the result of
the mind in action. Such an overreliance on information from brain
imaging does a great injustice to the beautiful complexity of the
scientific method as a means of understanding the beautiful complexity
of God's creation. It's clear, then, that we have both the precious
freedom and the awesome responsibility to choose our mindsets. They
aren't determined by our brains or our genes. Let's take a closer look
at how that responsibility plays itself

out with respect to the destructive eating habits in which we or our
children can find ourselves ensnared.

14 Confused Emotions, Destructive Behaviors

Many diet plans today are principally based on behavioral changes. They
all tell us that we need to exercise more and eat better, often with
some elaborate plan that feels like someone has just removed the joy
from eating and locked all pleasure in a dark medieval dungeon. But
remember, our minds are more powerful than our behavior---our minds
direct our behavior. The only way weight will come off, and stay off, is
through our minds: when we plant healthy food "trees" in our brains with
our minds, we will eat heathy food in reality. When we discipline, or
renew, our minds, we change how we think about eating, thereby changing
the framework of our food choices. The nonconscious mind is very
influential in our thinking and choosing, as I have discussed earlier,
but the equally powerful conscious mind can override the past. Until we
build an awareness mindset of how and when to eat, with the correct
emotions attached to the process of choosing and eating food,
sustainable weight loss will not occur. We literally have to convince
our dominant nonconscious level of mind (95 percent of brain function,
remember) by building an automatized, reconceptualized mindset into it,
which replaces the reason we have an unhealthy diet, and unhealthy
weight, in the first place. We do this convincing; we take charge of our
minds. The toxic behaviors of our pasts do not have to take over our
future. We are what we think. Yet this change is not instant. It takes
twenty-one days to rewire neural pathways, plus another forty-two days
for a full sixty-three days to firmly build these new mindsets into our
nonconscious level of mind so that we

use them and actual change is evident in our life.1 Any diet that
promises instant results should come under our intellectual radar; real,
permanent change always takes time and effort. No amount of positively
affirming that I will not eat that ice cream, even if I had a hard day
and feel I deserve it will succeed single-handedly in the creation of
healthy eating patterns. Until the toxic food mindset that dominates our
minds is dealt with, we are essentially swimming vigorously against the
tide of thoughts in our own heads. We are fighting a battle we do not
believe we can win. But we can win. God designed the human mind with an
absolutely breathtaking ability to change itself. We can renew our
thinking (Rom. 12:2). I will address the techniques for correcting
thinking patterns in part 3 of this book, and more information on
renewing the mind scientifically and spiritually can be found in my book
Switch On Your Brain.2

The Apple Never Falls Far from the Tree What we choose to eat affects
not only our health, but our children's health as well. At first glance
this statement may sound redundant. Of course, what we choose to cook
and eat, our children will eat as well. Yet we are not only giving them
a meal. We are teaching them a way of eating---a food mindset that they
can carry with them throughout their lives. It is therefore imperative
that we as parents and guardians focus on teaching our children about
dealing with emotions and healthy eating patterns. Children will do what
we do, not what we say. A sedentary lifestyle and poor diet can
predispose a child to a toxic, lifestyle-related illness, even in the
happiest of families where emotions are balanced.3 Nourishing lifestyle
patterns that foster a healthy response to the need to eat must be
established at a young age.4 We also need to teach our children about
their emotions and how to handle them, even when it is uncomfortable for
everyone involved. Confused emotions create disorders in the mind, which
in turn will produce behaviors that are equally confused and
self-destructive.5

The Elephant in the Dining Room: Eating Disorders

One category of self-destructive food behavior is eating disorders. Much
research has focused on how negative, destructive emotions contribute to
anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and other eating disorders.6 These are seen
as emotional eating patterns. Yet there has been a sore lack of research
that could help gain insight into how positive emotions are distorted by
those suffering with these life-threatening disorders, which have a
death rate up to twelve times higher than all other causes of death
combined for females between the ages of fifteen and twenty-four.7 One
recent study, however, has highlighted the role normal, positive
emotions can play in exacerbating eating disorders. The researchers
found that the subjects of the study battled with negative emotions such
as poor body image, in addition to having a paradoxically positive sense
of pride over being able to maintain and exceed their weight-loss goals.
Indeed, this study also found that the women who had the most difficulty
understanding how to recognize when positive emotions were becoming
distorted (through their thinking) engaged in more frequent
anorexia-type behaviors such as vomiting, laxative use, restricting
calories, excessively exercising, checking body fat, and constantly
controlling weight. Many of the participants knew they were damaging
their health, yet their sense of pride at their results helped maintain
their destructive eating habits.8 Yet eating disorders are disorders,
not diseases. Change in these lifethreatening patterns of food
consumption comes with choosing to change based on an awareness of the
fundamental need to change. The concept of a brain disease is very
limiting and almost always gives a sense of hopelessness: the view that
you are what your brain does, and there is really nothing you alone can
do about it. A brain disorder, on the other hand, brings hope in the
sense that although there have been significant biological changes in
the brain, the brain can change (neuroplasticity). The mind is more
powerful than the brain: it directs the change. Choosing to change and
quit a toxic thinking pattern can in fact result in brain regrowth. A
number of psychologists and neuroscientists have found that adult brain
volume, which can be reduced by anorexia nervosa and other eating
disorders, can also be regained through changing thinking patterns or
mindsets.9 Renewing your mind does not just apply to changing the way
you think. By choosing to change the way you think, you can literally
regain gray matter in the brain! When God said his plans for you are
full of hope, he truly meant it (Jer. 29:11).

Processed Food and Addiction Eating disorders necessarily bring me to
the topic of food addictions. All addictions are similar in that the
sufferer craves the feel-good buzz they receive from their chemical
neurotransmitters when they binge eat, gamble, smoke, have sex, or take
drugs.10 The term "food addiction" certainly tends to conjure up a
vision of obese individuals hiding in a pantry and eating uncontrollably
in the dark. Yet it is more important to consider the concept of food
and addiction, versus food addiction. In other words, how does something
that is biologically necessary for life become an addiction? It is
different from an addiction to alcohol or drugs, which are not necessary
for survival.11 Have we altered our foods in such a way as to make them
particularly prone to becoming addictive?12 Why do we not get addicted
to kale or tomatoes as easily as potato chips or soda, for example?
Among many food researchers, there is a consensus that the food-like
products more and more of us are consuming today can influence brain
function in an addictive way by distorting normal thinking pathways.13
As I discussed in part 1, the three main constituents of processed,
preserved, and refined foods in particular---sugar, salt, and fat---can
hijack brain function and constrain our ability to choose.14 I briefly
mentioned studies done by major food companies on calculating "bliss
points," where taste buds are titillated "scientifically" to determine
the point at which foods will literally be irresistible or the point
where we will want more and more, thereby giving birth to potential
"food addictions."15 Through this process, damage can occur in the
brain.16 Walter Willet, chair of Harvard's department of nutrition and
also one of the single most cited nutritionists today, points his finger
directly at the food companies when it comes to today's food system.
Willet regards the transformation of food into an industrial product,
which I discussed in part 1, as stripping away most of the nutrition
from our foods.17 Processed sugar, salt, fat, and other components of
food have been distorted and made into decontextualized and concentrated
forms of their original design.18 Is it any wonder, then, that these
foods impact our brains like drugs?19 It gets worse. Although the food
industry is well aware of the power of manipulating our taste
preferences and reward circuitry in the brain, as we saw in part 1, the
government does not regulate their efforts. The food

industry "is not required to test its products for addictive effects on
the brain or the extent to which constituents of its food provoke
overeating."20 Of course, if someone deliberately designed a product in
such a way as to manipulate your biological processes in order to make
more money, you would be outraged. Yet why are the food industries
allowed to do so without encumbrance? Indeed, the high amounts of
refined and processed sugar, salt, and fat in the majority of MAD foods,
and thus the majority of food products many of us consume today, are
incredibly alarming from a brain science perspective. These ingredients
cause massive abnormal dopamine releases each time they are consumed, in
far greater amounts than we have ever before been accustomed to in human
history.21 Dopamine enhances memory formation, so the memories of these
foods keep getting stronger, reinforced in our minds with toxic effects.
These foods are particularly adept at getting us "hooked."22 This is
called the plastic paradox: our mind changes our brain's wiring in
response to external signals.23 Why is this a paradox? The signals that
change our brains can be good or bad. The same plasticity principles are
employed as we wire in a good or a bad habit. Yet if the mind can change
the brain, why are unhealthy habits so hard to break? We used plasticity
to build these habits over time; we used plasticity to implant them in
our souls. As you well know, whatever you think about the most grows.
Thus, by the same token, the same kind of effort goes into breaking the
habit, but because we are reversing the tide, there is effort involved.
Plasticity does not equal effortlessness. Plasticity means change, and
true change is never effortless. Essentially, where our mind goes, our
brain follows. As you will recall, our thoughts make up roughly 80
percent of these signals, and other external factors make up the
remaining 20 percent.24 Good, healthy signals equal good, healthy brain
changes, while bad, unhealthy signals equal bad, unhealthy brain
changes. Yes, the process of change is a challenge. Yet remember, we are
designed by God to bring all thoughts into captivity (2 Cor. 10:5).
Regardless of how subtle and clever the marketing campaigns of the food
industry are, and how irresistible the bliss point becomes, we still
have the mind of Christ (1 Cor. 2:16). We are not machines running on
chemicals, and we are not victims of our biology. We are highly
intellectual, thinking and choosing beings made in the image of a
perfect God (Gen. 1:27). And we have been

given the Holy Spirit to aid us, who is far more powerful than a
cheeseburger craving (Rom. 8:26--27).

Are We Hooked on Being Hooked? Addiction, including food addiction, is
not a chronic, lifelong disease, as the current biomedical model depicts
it to be.25 According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine
(ASAM), addiction is "a primary, chronic disease of brain reward,
motivation, memory, and related circuitry."26 However, there is
extensive evidence, particularly in population studies, that the vast
majority of people who quit addictions do so on their own.27
Unfortunately, "food addiction" is being placed into the same brain
disease category, which inevitably aims to remove responsibility from
the individual.28 According to this vein of thinking, being overweight
or obese becomes something we just have to cope with, "very much like
the management of other chronic diseases, such as asthma, hypertension
or diabetes," says Dr. Daniel Alford at Boston University Medical
Center. "It's hard necessarily to cure people, but you can certainly
manage the problem to the point where they are able to function through
a combination of pharmaceuticals and therapy."29 The brain disease model
and food addiction language focus predominately on bearing, not healing,
lifestyle-related issues. Of course, God did not say that life would be
easy and carefree. But Christ did come to set us free and give us life
abundantly (Luke 4:18; John 10:10). He came to heal us (Exod. 15:26; Ps.
30:2; Matt. 9:35; Mark 5:34; Luke 8:43--48; James 5:16). God has made
all things new in Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 5:17; Col. 1:20). Jesus has
already won the victory (John 16:33; 1 Cor. 15:57; 2 Cor. 2:14). We are
more than conquerors through Christ (Rom. 8:37). We were never created
to just cope.

We Are Designed to Be Addicted . . . to Love Our brain's reward circuits
fire up a neurophysiological response par excellence when we think and
eat in a healthy way. God has given us an incredible variety of foods,
and ways of eating, which are exactly what we need specific to where we
live. I call this the "wired for love" concept that

is operational in our brains and bodies, and in this universe we
inhabit. Indeed, God is love, and the whole of his creation is therefore
based on the principle of love (1 John 4:8, 16). When we try to recreate
foods in such a way as to go against the design of nature rather than
mimic nature, as I discussed in part 1, we interfere with God's plan.
Ultimately, science is here to understand God's universe, not to
recreate it: science explains the "how" of creation. It enables us to
learn "how" to steward God's world in a way that allows it to function
optimally within its own created parameters. Indeed, with a sense of awe
and humility we are able to learn from nature through biomimicry.
Science is not here to improve on a design that is already good. The
latter is an "eating from the tree of knowledge" approach: we think we
can do better than God (Gen. 3:5). Taking this into the world of
addiction, reward circuits in the brain become hijacked by our choices
(mind), which change the brain physically. Defunct biology is not to
blame.30 The toxic reward circuits from wrong thoughts and wrong food
choices (and other environmental factors) in a circular feedback loop
can certainly affect the clarity of the mind. In fact, the foods our
parents ate also affect our health epigenetically.31 Yet the mind is
still stronger than the brain: Christ said he would never give us any
more temptation than we are able to bear, and he has provided a way for
us to bear it (1 Cor. 10:13). The brain will rewire, or renew, in the
direction the mind sends it; as discussed above, this is known as the
plastic paradox.32 This is why the vast majority of people can and do
quit addictions on a daily basis. Choosing to get out of a toxic
addiction is what testimonies, and indeed miracles, are made of.

Fight Fire with Fire If the food corporations are deliberately thinking
about how to get us to buy their products, it is time for us to be
deliberately thinking about what this is doing to our life, our loved
ones, and our planet---and what we can do to fight back. All of us
should be planning how we can fight back in our own unique way. Whether
it is growing a garden, raising chickens, lobbying, farming, cooking,
blogging, writing, speaking, filming, dancing, or whatever our passion
is: we name it, we believe in it, and we do it. We all

have an incredible power to think, which enables us to succeed at
whatever we "put our minds to"---literally! Just reading the statement
above gives us the power to override the influence of the food industry.
Because of neuroplasticity, what we read changes our brain, which can
start to change the way we think.33 We merge with our environments, and
if we choose not to merge with the current food system, if we choose to
opt out of its dysfunctional MAD diet, we will be amazed at how our life
can change. Wherever our mind goes, our brain follows. Awareness and
knowledge are powerful tools in the "thinking" fight against the MAD
diet. Reading the information in this book should be only the beginning
of the journey; there are a number of incredible references in the
endnotes to this book that will increase our knowledge arsenal. In fact,
just knowing that the grocery store layout is designed to get us to
purchase processed and refined food-like products by companies that do
not have our health as their bottom-line focus can empower us to make
more lifesustaining food choices and dramatically shift our mindset
behind the meal.

What Kind of Addict Do You Want to Become? We are designed to be
addicted to God. Our brains are wired to latch onto something, and that
something is God. Any toxic addiction, whether it be to food, drugs, or
even a person, is the result of misplaced choice. Yet, as a growing body
of research shows, the majority of people can quit addictions.34
Individuals who stay addicts usually subscribe to the biomedical model
and defeatist philosophy of "once an addict, always an addict."35 Yet
God came to set us free, not lock us in (Luke 4:18). As C. S. Lewis said
in The Weight of Glory, "We are far too easily pleased."36 Do not make
food your idol, nor any other created thing. It will always disappoint
you, but God never will. Never forget that you are more than an
addiction. The toxic choices you may have made in the past do not define
you. You are defined by your identity in Christ (Gen. 1:27; 1 Cor. 6:17;
12:27; Gal. 3:27--28; Col. 2:9-- 10). You are his child---you are his
heir (John 1:12; Eph. 1:5; 1 Pet. 2:9; 1 John 3:1--2). Let us start
acknowledging this divine identity in our food choices as well. This is
what it means to "seek first the kingdom of God and

His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you" (Matt.
6:33). Seek Christ first, and the pleasure of real food and good health
will come as a by-product of being addicted to him. Let us start this
process of change by increasing our knowledge of what real food is; let
us start changing our attitude toward food; let us start developing the
skills necessary to change. We must choose life (Deut. 30:19). And we
can choose. As we'll see in the next chapter, not even our genes are set
in stone and beyond the reach of changes. The science of epigenetics is
teaching us how environment and choice alter even our genes.

15 Me, Myself, and My Epigenetic Environment

In 1988 John Cairns, a British molecular biologist, produced compelling
evidence that our responses to our environment determine the expression
of our genes. Cairns, through examining gene mutations, saw that not
only does gene expression change in response to internal and external
signals but the gene itself also changes.1 A new field in science was
subsequently born: the science of epigenetics, using the term coined by
Cairns's predecessor Conrad Waddington (who used the term as a way to
describe how an organism adapts over or above how he commonly understood
genetics, hence epi, which means "upon" or "above" in Greek).2
Epigenetics examines how environments regulate gene activity and
expression as a response to both internal and external signals. Through
these observations, the scientific community has developed a greater
understanding of how what we think about, say, and do changes the
environments of our cells.3 For instance, when we think, we learn
because we are changing our genes and creating new ones in response to
our need to store the new information. To understand how this works,
think of the way our bodies produce antibodies in response to viruses
like measles or chicken pox. New genes are created by recombination (the
process by which genetic material is broken up and joined to other
genetic material) in response to the need to express the proteins to
make these antibodies and protect our bodies.4 The same happens with our
thoughts---thoughts are real things! Essentially, people, plants,
animals, and other living organisms start with a certain genetic
code---the "nature" part of the well-known nature/nurture concept---at
conception.5 Yet, the choice of which genes are "expressed," or

activated, is strongly affected by environmental influences in terms of
epigenetics.6 These environmental influences are the "nurture" part of
the equation: the social, emotional, cultural, and economic environments
we grow up in.7 God has set up a complex and beautiful interplay between
us, our biology, and our environments. Due to this exchange, the
expression of genes can change rapidly over time: genes are influenced
by internal and external factors, and those changes can be passed along
to our offspring.8 Yet there is one other factor, the most powerful
factor in God's intricate design, which dominates both nature and
nurture: our uniqueness or Ifactor.

The I-Factor We have a love-filled, powerful, and sound mind (2 Tim.
1:7). We are fearfully and wonderfully made (Ps. 139:14). We have a
phenomenal Ifactor. And we can change our mental and biological
environments with the thoughts we choose to think.9 The emerging science
of epigenetics is beginning to shine a light on how mental and physical
health are within our reach, which contradicts the dominant, mechanistic
belief that humans are biological machines.10 Epigenetics highlights our
ability to respond to our environment, which includes everything from
what we think to what we generally understand by environmental
exposure.11 Thoughts and emotions, alongside exposure to sunlight,
exercise, food, and everything we choose to put onto and into our body,
directly affect DNA expression.12 Epigenetics is therefore the process
of how the operation of genes changes in response to internal and
external signals. Epigenetic changes occur apart from the genes,
switching them on and off through processes called methylation and
acetylation, respectively. Acetyl and methyl groups are clusters of
atoms that attach onto the gene and associated proteins, making them
more or less receptive to receive and respond to biochemical and mind
signals.13 An acetyl group switches the gene on and a methyl group
switches the gene off. A growing body of research is highlighting how
these methylation and acetylation patterns change in response to
thinking and lifestyle choices.14

Thinking toxic thoughts can change gene expression, just as certain
diets or exposure to chemicals and pollutants can also result in changes
that affect our genes. We see this power over our circumstances mirrored
in Scripture. In Philippians 4:7, the apostle Paul notes how the peace
of God can protect our hearts and minds, a powerful truth reflected in
Isaiah 26:3: "You \[God\] will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is
stayed on you, because he trusts in You." Proverbs 4 praises the beauty
of God's living words, which "are life to those who find them, and
health to all their flesh" (v. 22). When we implant God's Word into our
minds through our thinking, we fill our brains with the powerful
environmental influence of God's love, which directly impacts our mental
and physical health in a positive direction. Talk about a "sound mind"!

Fat Is in the Fire: The Danger of Toxic Food Environments Epigenetics is
essentially the pathway by which our body takes a signal from the
external world (food, events, and circumstances) and internal
environments (thoughts) and turns them into a set of chemical,
electromagnetic, and quantum instructions for our genes.15 Thus, through
our thought and lifestyle choices, we can create either a very healthy
or very toxic environment around our cells.16 Whatever we eat directly
influences the environment around our cells; this biological process is
what sustains life.17 Good, real food means a healthy environment in our
brain and body, and this allows genetic expression to happen as it
should. The proteins, fats, sugars, vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients,
and all the other necessary components of food will affect our body in a
wired-for-love way ---just how God intended. And add a positive,
love-based thought life to our menu, and we are set on the pathway to
true, sustainable health! Yet what happens if the environment is toxic?
Say we go to the store and buy conventional burger patties, which came
from cattle raised on a largescale feedlot similar to the ones I
discussed in part 1. First, the fats such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty
acids in the meat have a different structure from the fats in
chemical-free, grass-fed cattle because the animals have been fed grains
(many of which were genetically modified). In many cases these

cows are even fed animals, and stale cake and candy with wrappers on
(not to mention the fact that they eat these foods standing in their own
feces).18 These new types of fats upset our biochemistry in much the
same way as dropping crunchy crumbs into the keyboard of a computer
upsets the functioning of the buttons. Just as that computer will
experience difficulties, our biological processes will not function as
they ought to, which can increase our risk of developing heart disease,
diabetes, obesity, infertility, and Alzheimer's disease, to name just a
few diseases. Of course, both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are
essential for our health, and without them we would die. Omega-6 is
necessary to make the epigenetic signals that promote inflammation,
while omega-3 develops epigenetic signals that calm inflammation.19
These two fatty acids work together in cell membranes and share
regulatory enzymes, so when omega3 needs more enzymes, omega-6 will need
fewer enzymes.20 The wired-forlove design, in terms of omega-3 and
omega-6 content, is such that we get the correct balance between these
two fatty acids in our meat. When we eat foods with this balance of
essential fatty acids, we will feel better, have more energy, and be
able to think more clearly and quickly. In fact, our blood flow will be
smoother and thinner, which prevents inflammation and protects against
brain disorders and heart disease.21 When we eat conventionally raised
beef, however, our omega-6 to omega-3 ratio goes up in favor of omega-6.
Traditionally raised cattle fed a 100 percent grass diet have a ratio of
omega-6s to omega-3s that averages to about 1.53 to 1. The ratio of
these fats in cattle fed grains like soy and corn, however, skews
heavily in the direction of omega-6 to 7.65 to 1.22 A recent study, for
example, showed that eating moderate amounts of grassfed meat for only
four weeks can give individuals healthier levels of essential fatty
acids. The volunteers who ate grass-fed meat increased their blood
levels of omega-3 fatty acids and decreased their levels of the
proinflammatory omega-6 fatty acids, potentially lowering their risk of
cancer, blood clots, cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and
inflammatory diseases, to name just a few of the health benefits of
omega-3s. The individuals in the study who had consumed conventional,
grain-fed meat, however, ended up with lower levels of omega-3s and
higher levels of omega-6s than they had at the beginning of the study,
suggesting that eating conventional meat can be especially detrimental
to one's health over time as omega-6 levels increase.23 Processed and
refined gluten products are not the

only foods that cause inflammation, contrary to popular opinion
surrounding gluten- and grain-free diets. Conventionally raised animals
are also a problem: as omega-6 levels increase, the risk of inflammation
increases. Essentially we have to remember it is not the foods per se
that are to blame but rather what humanity has done to these foods.

Biting Off More Than We Can Chew? And it's not just the fat in the fire,
as the saying goes. Animals forced to live miserable lives in
reprehensible conditions, having hoses forced down their throats when
they choke from the diet their rumens cannot handle, have higher levels
of stress hormones, as I am sure you can imagine.24 These hormones
toughen the meat since they remove glycogen from the muscles just before
death, which leads to decreased levels of the lactic acid needed to make
meat tender.25 These hormones also lower the concentrations of vital
B-complex vitamins; zinc; copper; chromium; antioxidants such as
glutathione, potassium, iron, and linolenic acid; and vitamins A, E, and
C, to name just a few, that make up an essential part of our dietary
health.26 Grass-fed, organically raised, and humanely treated cattle, on
the other hand, provide a perfect balance of what we need to both
survive and thrive in a wired-for-love way. Ultimately, we should be
concerned about the way these animals are being treated, not only for
their sakes but for our own health. As Michael Pollan says, "You are
what you eat eats."27 If we make toxic food choices, they will affect
the epigenetically balanced environment in our brain and body, not to
mention the effect raising cattle in large confinement facilities has on
the intricate balance of our ecosystems. Our health, and the health of
our beautiful planet, will suffer as a result. Yet food choices rooted
in love will sustain life, since God created the world, and God is love
(1 John 4:8).

An Epigenetic Investment in the Future In the early twentieth century,
Dr. Francis M. Pottenger Jr. researched the dietary patterns of cats to
gain a greater awareness of how food consumption and health are related.
His findings were extraordinary: dietary choices not only affected the
cats eating the food but the health of

the next four generations of cats.28 His findings suggested that diets
can alter the way genes function, since the behaviors of the previous
generation were passed on through a form of genetic memory
inheritance.29 Pottenger's research has since been corroborated by a
number of animal and human studies.30 One of the seminal studies done on
epigenetics and diet was carried out on agouti mice by the American
scientist Dr. Randy Jirtle.31 The agouti gene is closely related to a
human gene that is expressed in obesity and type 2 diabetes.32 Agouti
mice, which have yellow coats, tend to eat ravenously if given the
opportunity and have an increased incidence of food-related illness and
death as a result.33 This same pattern of overeating is repeated in
their children.34 Jirtle, however, changed this--- epigenetically. He
bred agouti mice offspring that were normal, slim, and healthy, simply
by changing part of the environmental signal: the diet of the pregnant
mothers!35 Jirtle fed the agouti mothers-to-be a diet rich in a chemical
known as "methyl groups."36 These methyl groups are molecule clusters
that are able to inhibit the expression of certain genes. This shift in
food consumption changed the expression of food consumption genes in the
younger agouti mice without making changes to the maternal DNA
sequence.37 Thus a simple change in diet (the 20 percent part of the
mindbody connection discussed in chapter 10) in the pregnant mother
changed the genetic environment and had a dramatic impact on the gene
expression of her baby mice. Epigenetic changes are incredibly
important! According to a growing body of research, the same
diet-related epigenetic changes occur in humans. According to one recent
study, a mother's diet during pregnancy can alter the DNA of her child
and increase her progeny's risk of obesity.38 Further studies have
confirmed that a mother's diet before conception can permanently affect
how her child's genes function.39 These findings suggest pregnant women
should follow careful dietary advice, as diet may have a long-term
influence on the baby's health after it is born. The maternal diet can
affect the environment of both the mother and her child.40 Indeed, women
of reproductive age need to have greater access to nutritional,
educational, and lifestyle support to improve the health of the next
several generations, since awareness can reduce the risk of diet-related
conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.41 Yet maternal diet is
not the only important factor in terms of epigenetic inheritance and
diet. Researchers have found mice with obese fathers, even those mice
with no symptoms of obesity or diet-related illness, frequently

passed these characteristics on to their daughters.42 Sons cannot dodge
this epigenetic bullet either. Both sons and daughters of obese fathers
can inherit an increased risk of developing diet-related metabolic
diseases.43 Scientists have also found that the offspring of obese
mothers may be spared health problems linked to obesity but their own
children then inherit them, so obesity and its health consequences may
skip a generation.44 Understanding how epigenetics functions through the
generations is particularly critical in terms of malnourishment. When a
pregnant mother is undernourished, her child is at a greater risk of
developing obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other diet-related chronic
diseases, in part due to epigenetic effects. A new study in mice
demonstrates that this "memory" of nutrition during pregnancy can be
passed through the sperm of male offspring to the next generation,
increasing risk of diet-related disease for the grandchildren as well,
although it is uncertain at this point in time how long such effects
will continue to have a heritable impact.45

Your Children Are What You Think Our food choices are not the only
epigenetic legacies we leave to our children. Another study found that
the experiences of a parent, even before conceiving, markedly influenced
both the structure and function of the nervous system of subsequent
generations. In particular, this study found that a traumatic event the
parent experienced affected the child's DNA, thereby altering the brain
and behavior of the next generation.46 Similarly, when researchers
examined the brains of rats that had been nurtured in a loving way by
their mothers, they found significant biological differences, especially
in a region of the brain called the hippocampus, which plays a
significant role in regulating our response to stress. The more
nurturing the mother was, the more this gene was activated, and the more
the mother's children were able to deal with stress in a healthy way.47
This is not surprising, since God is love and his entire creation is
meant to function in a wired-for-love way. Love heals, since love is the
source of all existence. Studying epigenetics, or how thinking and
eating environments impact current and future generations, is essential.
With the rise in neuropsychiatric disorders, obesity, diabetes, and
metabolic problems, we need to develop a multigenerational approach that
looks at the fact that genetic memory can

be passed between generations.48 This science is of course still
developing. Researchers are not entirely sure of how the signal works
and changes the environment, but change does occur.49 If we care about
the health of our descendants, we cannot ignore our epigenetic impact.50
God was not merely being vindictive or harsh when he said that the sins
of the fathers would be visited on subsequent generations (Exod. 34:7;
Deut. 30:19). He wanted us to realize that we have to be careful about
what we think, say, and do, since our choices affect not only us but our
progeny. Science is catching up to the Bible.

Planting Healthy "Trees" in the Future If you eat a healthy diet, you
are not only investing in your own health but the health of your
progeny. By planting an apple tree in your garden, or by planting a
healthy thought "tree" in your mind, you are investing in not only your
own physical and mental health but that of your biological legacy. What
better way to show love for your neighbor, including your neighbor of
the future (Matt. 22:39)? What better way to love selflessly and without
limit than to give up a momentary pleasure not only out of care for your
own wellbeing but also the wellbeing of your children's children's
children? The pathway through which epigenetic signals change our
internal and external environments and affect the expression of genes
has many twists and turns. We can literally nurture epigenetic change by
directing these twists and turns using our I-factor, or the unique way
we think.51 We can get involved in the process of changing our mental
and physical health in either a good or bad direction through our
choices.52 Indeed, the price of real, whole foods is a bargain if it
buys not only our own mental and physical health but that of the next
four generations after us. By that same token, what is the true price of
cheap, processed, and refined MAD foods if they are crippling the health
of our progeny?

16 The Whole Beef and Nothing but the Beef

What do epigenetic food choices look like in our everyday lives? In this
chapter I want to explore protein, fat, and cholesterol. In chapter 17
we'll look at sugar, and in chapter 18 we'll discuss wheat and gluten.
And we'll find that the conventional advice is not always supported by
science. Let's begin with protein. As we saw in chapter 15, the right
protein choices positively affect the environment around our cells, and
thus our health. We all probably learned in school that proteins are the
building blocks of our cells: protein's vital role is to build,
maintain, and repair all our bodily systems, and it is necessary for
growth and development throughout our life. We may also remember that
protein is broken down in the body into amino acids and fats, which both
our brain and the rest of our body need to thrive.1 Amino acids are
actually the building blocks of proteins. Everything from our bones to
our organs, muscles, arteries and veins, skin, hair, and fingernails is
made of protein.2 9 In fact, we have around eight billion (8 x 10 )
proteins per cell.3 Proteins called hemoglobins help carry the oxygen
that reddens our blood.4 Enzymes that digest our food, synthesize
essential substances, and break down waste products for elimination are
all proteins.5 Proteins produce the energy needed for life when fats and
carbohydrates are in short supply during times of starvation.6 Proteins
and steroids form hormones, which regulate the delicate chemical changes
that constantly take place within the body governed by the endocrine
system.7 Our chromosomes have proteins in their structures. Protein is
like a vehicle that "drives" fat and cholesterol throughout the body.8

To say that protein is an important nutrient is certainly an
understatement. And, as with most nutrients and vitamins, too much, too
little, or poorquality protein in the diet will have detrimental effects
on our physical health.9

Your Brain on Protein Your brain thrives on good-quality protein
sources. It needs protein for neurotransmitter activity, since many of
your internal chemical messengers consist of amino acids, amino acid
derivatives, and small proteins that are built from amino acids, known
as peptides.10 Neurotransmitters enable the brain cells (neurons) to
"talk" by relaying information between them.11 Adrenaline,
noradrenaline, and dopamine are made from the amino acid tyrosine.12
These neurotransmitters make you feel good, stimulate you, motivate you,
and help you cope with stress.13 GABA, derived from the amino acid
glutamate, on the other hand, counteracts these neurotransmitters,
relaxing you and calming you down after stress.14 Serotonin is another
important neurotransmitter, made from the amino acid tryptophan, that
keeps you emotionally balanced.15 Melatonin, also derived from the amino
acid tryptophan, is crucial in establishing the sleep/wake cycle.16
Endorphins are peptides (small proteins) and act at opioid receptors and
therefore modulate pain.17 Neurotransmitters carry electrical signals
across synapses, the gaps between nerve cells, thereby delivering
chemical messages from one cell to the next.18 This inter-cell
interaction is what it means to build short-term memory.19 And once a
neurotransmitter has delivered a chemical message, it is released back
into the synapse, which is like a swimming pool filled with an
electrical-chemical cocktail. The neurotransmitter is recycled,
reabsorbed, or broken down.20 A deficiency in amino acids affects your
neurotransmitters' ability to have these meaningful conversations. It
can make you feel flat, apathetic, and unable to relax; lacking in
motivation, focus, and concentration; and unable to build solid
memory.21 Clearly that is not a desirable situation for your brain! On
the other hand, sufficient amounts of good-quality proteins in your
diet, and thus amino acids, help with mental health issues.22 These
amino

acids are more effective than prescription drugs---most of the latter
have awful side effects.23 When Hippocrates said "let food be thy
medicine," he truly hit the mark, since a healthy, balanced diet of real
foods can keep both your brain and body in shape by ensuring that you
receive an adequate intake of amino acids. Of the twenty amino acids
needed for proper construction of proteins, eight (or nine, for
children) are called essential amino acids, since the body cannot
synthesize or make these for itself.24 These essential amino acids must
come from our diet.25 Good-quality animal proteins, such as grass-fed,
organically raised beef and eggs from pasture-raised hens, are excellent
sources of these amino acids.26 Many of these essential amino acids are
also found in plant-based proteins, such as soybeans, quinoa, seeds,
nuts, beans, rice, and legumes. These plant-based proteins are
incomplete sources of all the amino acids and need to be eaten in
combination with other foods in order to maintain good health.27 Brown
rice and lentils, for example, combine to give us a complete protein
source.28 Another important point to note about meat is how much muscle
meat we consume, and the impact this has on our bodies. Muscle meat has
large amounts of the amino acid methionine, which produces the toxic
by-product homocysteine.29 Even though meat is a good source of vitamin
B12,30 our body uses up vitamin B12, as well as vitamin B6, folate,
choline, and betaine, to neutralize the homocysteine. If we consume
excess amounts of muscle meat, we can reduce the amount of these
vitamins in our body, which are essential to the proper functioning of
many biological processes.31 Indeed, high amounts of methionine can
decrease the level of glycine in our body, which is another essential
amino acid predominantly found in the skin, bones, cartilage, and organs
of the animal. An imbalanced methionineglycine ratio can have negative
health effects on our mental and physical health, potentially increasing
our risk for mortality.32 Our obsession with muscle meat is actually a
recent historical phenomenon. In the past, the sections of animals we
prize most today, such as muscle cuts like sirloin steak, were often
thrown away or fed to the dogs, while the animal bits we have deemed
less culturally pleasing, such as eyes, kidneys, bones, and feet, were
treasured for their life-sustaining properties.33 Even in nature, many
carnivores leave behind the muscle meat in favor of the more nutritious
parts of their prey.34 Although eating these parts of the animal may
sound unappealing, if you do eat meat, and want to

do so in a healthy and balanced way, try slowly incorporating them into
your diet in blended soups, bone broths, and stews. The bottom line with
protein: get enough high-quality protein without overdoing your servings
of muscle meat. Consider plant proteins, eggs, and organ meat, and look
for grass-fed beef and pasture-raised poultry.

Cholesterol: Scapegoating the Scarecrow The subject of eggs and meat
leads us inevitably to a discussion of cholesterol. It is a rather
unfortunate truth that "science advances one funeral at a time."35 Many
individuals today equate the consumption of animal protein sources with
cholesterol levels and a higher risk of mortality. Yet, while the
cholesterol and heart disease hypothesis has gained much ground
culturally, with the low cholesterol and "heart healthy" labels on food
in grocery stores around the world, the science of cholesterol has
regressed into a game of broken telephone. The original data in this
area of nutrition, with its imprecise correlations, has been lost in a
sea of interpretations and so-called facts: high cholesterol levels are
bad news.36 How could anyone possibly argue otherwise? Today the terms
LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol are bandied about with such ferocity
that it certainly is useful to stop and ask yourself what exactly they
mean. LDL and HDL are lipoproteins that carry cholesterol around your
body---they are not cholesterol. LDL is the "vehicle" that carries
cholesterol to the cells, and HDL takes excess cholesterol away from the
cells.37 Cholesterol itself is mainly synthesized by the liver. It is
essential for the production of hormones, vitamin D, bile acids for food
digestion, and cell membranes, to name just a few of its beneficial
functions.38 It even acts as an antioxidant, combating the damage done
by free radicals in the body. One of the major flaws in the
cholesterol/heart disease hypothesis is the assumption that cholesterol,
observed at sites of damage in the body, must somehow have caused that
damage. As an antioxidant, however, cholesterol is a vital part of the
healing process, not the cause of the damage!39 Of course, vitamins,
antioxidants, and herbs do reduce cholesterol levels in the body. Yet
these substances do not fight and destroy cholesterol as a malignant
substance---they take over cholesterol's role as an antioxidant.40

If you decided to take out the garbage at home, instead of your spouse
for instance, your husband or wife is not the "bad guy" by default. It
is the same with cholesterol: a decreased amount of cholesterol does not
mean that cholesterol is unhealthy; it merely means someone else is
taking out the trash. In most cases, the body does a very good job all
on its own of balancing cholesterol levels.41 We have all been led to
believe, for example, that eating a piece of steak will raise
cholesterol levels. However, this is not necessarily the case. The liver
will simply reduce its cholesterol production in response to signals
from the digestive system, thereby maintaining the correct cholesterol
balance that the body needs.42 Similarly, neither LDL nor HDL is
intrinsically unhealthy.43 The problem comes in when you upset the
balance of the system. An "accident" in your body keeps LDL in your
bloodstream, preventing it from reaching the cells, much like an
accident during rush hour will prevent you from getting to work---you
are stuck in the resulting traffic jam. During this time, the LDL
oxidizes and is now seen as a threat (think of those individuals who get
irritated in traffic and develop road rage), which kicks your immune
system into action and can contribute to plaque buildup inside the blood
vessel walls, which leads to heart disease. Essentially, the biological
processes associated with cholesterol are a lot more complicated than
merely good and bad cholesterol.44 Just as there is no magic bullet for
health, there is no one "bad guy" to point out in terms of disease.

Death by Low Cholesterol? Limiting your cholesterol intake can actually
lead to physical and mental ill health, as well as early death.45
According to a growing body of research, low levels of cholesterol are
associated with decreased cognitive performance,46 increased mortality
risk,47 increased risk of cancer,48 less emotional stability and
control,49 a greater chance of developing depression,50 an increased
suicide risk for certain parts of the population,51 a higher risk factor
for hemorrhagic stroke,52 and a decreased ability to fight infection.53
The brain, in particular, needs cholesterol. Despite the fact that your
brain makes up just 2 percent of your body weight, it uses 25 percent of
your free

cholesterol.54 Cholesterol is an essential nutrient for neurons and a
building block of the cell membrane.55 When cholesterol levels are low,
the brain does not work very well: adequate cholesterol levels improve
mental cognition.56

The Big Fat Myth? So how exactly did cholesterol become the evil
Professor Moriarty of nutrition research? One of the key figures behind
the diet-heart hypothesis that dietary cholesterol can lead to
cardiovascular disease was Ancel Keys.57 Building on earlier experiments
carried out by Russian scientist Nikolai Anichkov, who researched the
dietary patterns of rabbits and concluded that cholesterol in the blood
leads to heart disease (otherwise known as the lipid hypothesis), Keys
concluded from his own studies that saturated fat consumption leads to
increased cholesterol levels, which in turn leads to an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease and heart-related mortality.58 Keys's
research, however, was far from conclusive. The 1950s informal Six
Country Analysis,59 which compared a country's overall amount of
saturated fat available for consumption and heart disease levels, began
by excluding data from a number of the countries---argued by many to be
a classic example of publication bias. What would his results have
looked like if he had used the data from all the countries he examined
at the start of his research? When he chose to exclude the other
countries, what did he mean by their lack of "fully comparable dietary
and vital statistics data"?60 Yet despite this missing data, Keys's
actual observations do not equal causation, regardless of how many times
they are repeated in government policy, media sources, clinical offices,
scholarly establishments, and academic sources. In fact, when all the
data was analyzed by two of Keys's contemporaries, an entirely different
observational conclusion emerged: saturated fat consumption decreased
the risk of overall mortality (in terms of death unrelated to heart
disease).61 Keys's Seven Country Study, a cohort-based research project
that follows groups of individuals over time, began in the late 1950s
and continues to this day. Like the Six Country Analysis, this study has
its limits. It is based on observational data, and, while there has been
a correlation between

saturated fat intake and heart disease, it is by no means an unambiguous
one. For instance, participants in Italy, Croatia, Serbia, and Japan did
not experience an increased risk of heart disease with higher
cholesterol levels. On the other hand, the cohorts with the highest
levels of cholesterol (American railroad workers) did experience a rise
in heart-related disease and mortality. Based on this study, it
therefore appears that cholesterol is not always an alarm bell---it
depends on the context. Instead of blacklisting cholesterol, researchers
should try to determine what makes these populations particularly
susceptible to heart disease.62 In fact, the cholesterol witch hunt that
has taken place over the last several decades has actually hidden a
number of important findings in the Seven Country Study. For instance, a
2002 paper noted that lower LDL levels were associated with an increased
incidence of depression among the older groups. Moreover, like the Six
Country Analysis, individuals with higher cholesterol levels actually
lived longer than the cohorts with lower levels of cholesterol, who were
actually at a greater risk of developing cancer. Nevertheless, Keys's
studies have become the foundation of the diet-heart hypothesis, despite
the lack of conclusive clinical evidence to support it.63 Indeed, even
the renowned Framingham Heart Study, another cohortbased research
project that began in the mid-twentieth century to examine the causes of
heart disease and continues to this day, does not support the diet-heart
hypothesis.64 According to one of the lead researchers, "There is, in
short, no \[overall\] suggestion of any relation between diet and the
subsequent development of coronary heart disease."65 Indeed, according
to a pattern that began to emerge by 1997, limited saturated fat intake
may in fact result in an increased risk of cognitive decline and
cancer.66 These findings are similar to the overall mortality results of
the Six Country Analysis and Seven Country Study discussed above and
highlight the critical need for more research to be carried out on the
long-term effects of decreased saturated fat consumption and the
relationship between saturated fat intake and cholesterol.67

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Fats

Your body needs fat for all its processes, as does your brain.68 Fats
protect you from disease; aid the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients
such as vitamins A, D, E, and K; control inflammation; help with blood
clotting; balance your mood; make you more focused; and can maximize
your intelligence through improving cognitive function, to give just a
few examples.69 In fact, your brain is around 60 percent fat---without
fat in your diet you cannot think or build memory correctly.70 Fats come
in several different forms: saturated fats, monounsaturated fats,
polyunsaturated fats, and trans fats.71 Saturated fats have no double
bonds in terms of their chemical makeup and are found predominantly in
animal products and tropical oils (such as coconut or palm oil).
Monounsaturated fats, which consist of one double bond, are found in
nuts, seeds, olive oil, and avocados, for example. Polyunsaturated fats
have two double bonds and can be found in animal products, nuts, seeds,
and many different kinds of oils. Trans fats, or hydrogenated fats, are
mainly found in highly processed and refined foods, such as margarine,
fast food, and heated oils. Food sources generally have varying
combinations of these types of fats. A simple internet search of fats
will inevitably come up with a list of sites noting the same warnings.
Saturated fats are principally associated with trans fats in the
scientific "naughty corner" because they are said to raise blood
cholesterol levels and lead to heart disease, while mono- and
polyunsaturated fats are "good fats" that form an essential part of a
balanced diet. Yet, as I discussed above, both unoxidized LDL and HDL
cholesterol play a vital homeostatic role in many of the biological
functions of our brain and body. Indeed, reduced cholesterol intake has
been associated with increased overall mortality, increased risk of
stroke, and cognitive decline in the studies mentioned above.72 It is
unclear, based on the evidence pool we currently have, if a diet high in
unoxidized LDL and HDL cholesterol and low in saturated fat will achieve
the same benefits or be more detrimental. Yet even if you are especially
worried about saturated fat intake, you do not have to give up animal
products. Wild game meats like venison have a significantly reduced
saturated fat content compared to modern, industrialbased sources of
meat, eggs, and dairy, and even compared with domestic grass-fed
animals. However, grass-fed domestic animals like lamb and beef have a
significantly higher concentration of a particular kind of saturated

fat, stearic acid, as opposed to conventionally raised beef. Stearic
acid does not raise cholesterol levels (not that we should be
particularly concerned with cholesterol per se, as I discussed above,
but rather the context of cholesterol) compared with the two other types
of saturated fat: palmitic and myristic acid.73 Animal livers and
shellfish (if you are not allergic!) are also low in fat but are
excellent, concentrated sources of essential fatsoluble nutrients such
as vitamins A and K.74 Since all these naturally raised meat sources are
nutrient dense, a little goes a long way in terms of their health
benefits.75 In fact, animal foods that contain saturated fat play other
important roles in human nutrition. For example, some individuals cannot
effectively turn beta-carotene, found in vegetables such as sweet
potatoes, for instance, to vitamin A (the two are not interchangeable,
contrary to popular opinion) in the body due to their genetic makeup and
other environmental factors, such as food allergies.76 Similarly, there
are two types of vitamin K.77 Vitamin K1 is found in dark green leafy
vegetables and other plant-based foods, while vitamin K2 is found in
animal products.78 Due to genetic factors, a large number of people
cannot benefit from K1 alone.79 How will the health of these individuals
fare if they reduce or eliminate all animal sources that contain
saturated fat from their diet? Indeed, since animal fats are one of our
best sources of these essential fat-soluble nutrients, how will the
health of mankind in general fare if we remove them entirely from our
diets? Not only do these animal fat sources contain essential vitamins
but they also increase the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins in other
foods, such as vegetables and fruit.80 In terms of fat-soluble
nutrients, the observations of Weston A. Price, a dentist and researcher
who spent years traveling and researching the various diets of
populations around the world, are particularly interesting. He noticed
that it did not matter what kind of foods the different people he came
across consumed, whether they ate what we consider a "low-carb,"
"high-carb," or "high-fat" diet, as long as they ate a diverse
traditional diet based on their respective locations. Yet a similar
characteristic of all the healthy populations he observed was the intake
of fat-soluble vitamins in animal foods, such as organ meats, eggs,
seafood, dairy products, and small animals and insects. Ultimately, the
exact amount of animal fat the populations ate did not matter as much as
the fact that they ate these types of foods, and therefore consumed
concentrated sources of the essential fat-

soluble vitamins needed for the maintenance of good health.81 Yet as
soon as the native populations made the "nutrition transition" to the
current Western diet of unvaried, processed, and refined foods, their
health suffered as a result, with an increase in the incidence of
chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease.82

Throwing (Polyunsaturated) Fat onto the Fire? There is also a potential
health risk in replacing dietary saturated fats with polyunsaturated
fats (PUFAs) for the long term. Most famously, the randomized and
double-blind 1969 LA Veterans Heart Study, which followed 846 elderly
veterans for up to eight years, found an increased risk of cancer over
time among the group that consumed four times more PUFAs than the
control group, who ate a typical American diet.83 Apparently,
nutritional science now tells us it is a matter of picking our demise:
Would we like a side of heart disease, or cancer, with our fat? And if
this study is not perplexing enough, the several major research projects
that are predominantly used to support an increased consumption of PUFAs
are subject to a number of scientific difficulties. Although the 1968
Oslo Heart Study found a reduced rate of cholesterol and heart disease
in the experimental group, which consumed more PUFAs, they gave this
group far more attention compared to the control. For example, the
experimental group, unlike the control group, were handed more than just
a general multivitamin: they had to decrease their added sugar
consumption, decrease their trans fat intake, increase their fish
consumption (and therefore omega-3 intake), and exchange white bread for
brown bread, among other requirements. 84 All of these changes can have
positive health effects! How much of the reduction in cholesterol levels
and mortality rates from heart disease in the experimental group can be
attributed to saturated fat alone? We don't know; all the other changes
made in their lifestyle habits could be equally important.85 At best,
this study shows that lifestyle factors can play an important role in
the risk of heart disease, as does the St. Thomas's Atherosclerosis
Regression Study (STARS) trial and the Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART
1), both of which made a number of other changes unrelated to dietary
fat (such as an increased consumption of fruit and vegetables) to their
participants' diets.86 The "background noise" of

these variables makes it impossible to draw the conclusion that reduced
saturated fat intake is healthy. The 1972 Finnish Mental Hospital Study
(1972), however, was particularly shocking for its lack of control.87
For instance, a number of the participants in the trial were on
thorazine, an antipsychotic drug that can cause heart problems such as
arrhythmia. Considering the study was attempting to find out if PUFAs
were a suitable alternative to saturated fats in terms of heart disease,
the presence of an uncontrolled variable with the potential to increase
cardiovascular disease and heart-related death is not really a clever
idea, to say the least.88 What is more, several meta-analyses that have
examined the relationship between dietary fat in general and heart
disease highlight the lack of certainty in this area of nutrition. A
2009 systematic review of randomized control trials (RCTs), the most
rigorous and reliable form of trials in medicine, for instance, noted
that there was "insufficient evidence" for a link between saturated fat
consumption and cardiovascular disease.89 Likewise, in 2012 the Cochrane
Collaboration, an independent and not-forprofit scientific research
organization whose reputation for high-quality and unbiased data is
exceptional, noted that there are "no clear effects of dietary fat
changes on total mortality . . . or cardiovascular mortality."90 The
2010 systematic analysis on dietary fat and heart health that did favor
a reduced saturated fat intake strangely included trials like STARS,
DART 1, the Oslo Heart Study, and the Finnish Mental Hospital Study
discussed above, which in all likelihood skewed their data in favor of
PUFAs.91 Anthropological data also suggests that keeping your PUFA
intake to a minimum can be beneficial in terms of heart disease. For
example, three Pacific island populations (the Pukapuka, Tokelau, and
Kitava) with varying carbohydrate, fat, and protein intakes all had
almost no incidence of heart disease, despite the fact that they did not
eat the same kinds of diets. Yet regardless of the culinary diversity
among these three populations, all of them maintained a fat ratio that
predominantly kept PUFA intake to around 2 percent of their fat intake,
while saturated fatty acids were their main source of fat. From this
observational data, it appears that the amount of fat you consume is not
as important (in terms of heart disease) as the ratio of your saturated
fat to PUFA intake.92

This Is Your Brain on Saturated Fat? It is not any more "certain" that
saturated fat intake causes cognitive decline. In 2012, the media were
quick to sensationalize a study that linked saturated fat to mental
issues. The researchers, after examining the dietary fat intake of more
than six thousand elderly women over a period of time, noted that higher
saturated fat intake was "associated with worse global cognitive and
verbal memory trajectories." Yet, once again, this study was
observational, and only examined one population group: mature women. Its
conclusions cannot be applied to the population in general.93 Most
significantly, the results are correlational in nature---this study does
not indicate cause and effect.94 You cannot say that it is now a proven
fact that eating a steak will give you heart disease and brain damage to
boot. It would be nice and simple if science worked this way, but it
does not. Higher fat intake has actually been associated with increased
mental wellbeing. For instance, in a recent study carried out by the
Mayo Clinic, there was a reduction in the risk of developing dementia
among the group that consumed a diet high in saturated fat.95 And, as I
discussed above, lower cholesterol levels have been associated with
decreased cognitive performance. Adequate amounts of "good" cholesterol
are incredibly important for healthy nerve transmission.96 Your brain
cannot communicate very well without this nutrient, a finding supported
by a recent paper published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. In
this study, dietary cholesterol intake was an important factor in the
prevention of amyloid plaque buildup, which can contribute to the
development of Alzheimer's disease.97 Considering how saturated fat is
actually one of the main components of brain cells and how significant
cholesterol is in terms of brain health as demonstrated by the studies
examined above, cutting them out of your diet may have deleterious
effects on your overall health. It is also important to remember that
eating foods high in saturated fat does not equal skyrocketing saturated
fat levels in the blood. In a 2014 study published by Ohio State
University, for example, participants who remained on a diet high in
saturated fat did not necessarily have higher levels of saturated fatty
acids in their blood. Rather, it was an increased intake of
carbohydrates that increased the level of saturated fat found in the
blood, potentially increasing the risk of heart disease and diabetes.98

Of course, the fact that this study was financially supported by the
meat and dairy industries does highlight a potential publication bias,
yet the urgent need to change our overly simplified understanding of
saturated fat and cholesterol is corroborated by several other papers.99
According to one recent Finnish study that examined the dietary habits
of children, the quality of carbohydrates consumed appears to be as
important as saturated fat intake in terms of the fatty acid composition
in our blood.100 In another study, elderly subjects were assigned to one
of two dietary groups: one group ate three eggs per day and the other
ate the same amount in egg substitutes for a one-month period. There was
a significant increase in both LDL and HDL cholesterol for those who ate
eggs, but the ratio between the two was not affected significantly. In
other words, if the LDL cholesterol went up, the HDL cholesterol did
too, thereby counteracting the effect of higher LDL levels.101 Indeed,
in an eight- to fourteen-year follow-up study of around thirty-eight
thousand men and eighty thousand women at Harvard University, there was
no statistically significant difference in risk for heart attacks and
strokes among people who ate eggs less than once a week compared with
those who ate more than one egg per day.102 Along with organ meats, eggs
contain high-quality protein and are the richest source of phospholipids
in average diets, have all the essential amino acids in the closest
thing to a perfect ratio, and are a great source of choline (a B-complex
vitamin needed for transmission of electrical charges across synapses,
thereby improving memory), while the egg's lecithin is a good "bad
cholesterol" lowering agent.103 Eggs, as long as they are treated the
way God intended (that is, the laying hens are pasture-raised without
the use of synthetic chemicals or hormones), are literally a superfood
that can lower cholesterol!

Too Many Researchers Spoil the Broth? What do all these studies on fat
and cholesterol ultimately tell us? Eating saturated fat--containing
foods like eggs can potentially raise your cholesterol, but can do so in
a way that maintains a healthy cholesterol balance in your body.
Cholesterol acts as a nutrient in the body, as does saturated fat.
Eating saturated fat, however, does not always raise your cholesterol
levels. Even if saturated fats may raise your cholesterol levels,

they can do so in a way that maintains a healthy balance of LDL and HDL
cholesterol in the body. Carbohydrates can also increase the level of
fatty acids in your blood. As Dr. Fred A. Kummerow, a leading researcher
on cholesterol, notes, "You do not need a source of cholesterol to
develop heart disease."104 Your cholesterol levels will even change
according to the amount and types of protein you consume, and the amount
of calories you consume in general--- from any food source.105 I think
it is quite safe to say that we need to reexamine the overly simplified
understanding that saturated fat will raise your cholesterol and
potentially kill you.

What Is the "Fat" of the Matter? Ultimately, Keys's diet-heart
hypothesis, much like Norman Borlaug's wheat-breeding experiments
discussed in chapter 6, was a notable, if imperfect, achievement for its
time.106 Yet it should be the start of our expeditions into the world of
nutrition, not the end of them. It should be transformed by our growing
understanding of nutritional information; it should not constrain the
way we carry out nutritional science. The diet-heart hypothesis is not
infallible. It was built on a foundation of animal experiments, the
results of which cannot be relied on as conclusive evidence in terms of
human health, and observational studies with correlations that are often
interpreted, dangerously, as cause and effect, which were supported by
physicians with little or no training in biochemistry at the time.107 In
fact, the lipid hypothesis discussed briefly above originated from an
experiment that fed animal fat to rabbits, which should also strike our
logical alarm bells, so to speak. God never created rabbits to eat meat
or dairy or any other animal products; of course they will have an
adverse reaction to eating such foods.108 Needless to say, humans are
not rabbits. We cannot merely copy and paste the results of this
experiment onto humans. Just as the absence of harm does not equal the
presence of safety (in terms of what we consume), the presence of safety
does not always equal the absence of harm in terms of real life, such as
the differences between species and types of saturated fat.109 Research
is a little bit more complicated than that.110

We essentially have to remember that nutritional science is almost
"impossible to do,"111 as we saw in part 1. By singling out lone
entities like saturated fat, we forget the context of real-life food
consumption.112 Saturated fat in real, whole foods plays an important
part in a healthy, balanced diet, as the studies above indicate, not to
mention the other health benefits of these saturated fat--containing
foods.113 On the other hand, even a small increase in saturated fat
intake may be the straw that broke the camel's back (or heart, in this
particular context) if we have grown up on the MAD diet or eat a diet
that is dominated by refined and processed foods, as one recent review
indicates. In these cases, it could possibly be wise to decrease
saturated fat intake while transitioning to an unprocessed, whole food
diet, or it could do more harm than good.114 The key is not to focus
solely on individual pieces of the puzzle like saturated fat or
cholesterol. We need to look at the bigger picture: Are you eating real
food? As a 2015 meta-analysis by the BMJ noted, official US and UK
low-fat guidelines were not supported by strong randomized control trial
evidence in the 1970s and the 1980s, and the subsequent vilification of
saturated fat has obscured the complex interplay between the human diet
and disease, including the role carbohydrates play in health.115
Ultimately, fearing fat, just like fearing carbohydrates or gluten or
sugar, is not the right way to approach a healthy diet.116 Instead, we
should fear the way our current industrial food system has transformed
our foods into foodlike products.

Artificial Trans Fats: The Real Public Enemy By avoiding the MAD diet,
we actually avoid the one fat that we cannot tolerate as human beings:
the artificial trans fatty acids found in foods such as margarine and
processed vegetable oils like canola and soybean oil.117 These trans
fats are hydrogenated fats produced by the overheating and refining of
oils, and are abundant in heavily refined and processed food-like
products such as fried and industrially prepared pastries, pizza, pies,
cookies, chips, crackers, cereals, breads, and drinks.118 In fact, they
are present in an estimated three thousand products in food
establishments today, even products with the "0g Trans Fat" label.
Government regulators allow the food industry to put minimal amounts of
trans fats in their

products, and thus "0g Trans Fat" can contain up to 0.5g of trans
fats.119 However, as many health authorities note, the only safe amount
of trans fats in the diet is no trans fats.120 On the other hand, many
of these same health authorities note that we need to avoid butter,
since butter contains not only saturated fat but also trans fats.
However, this is an oversimplification of the biochemistry of natural
versus artificial trans fats. Unlike the naturally occurring trans fats
in butter, these commercial fats have migrated double bonds, which have
created fourteen artificial types of trans fats.121 As a result, they do
not provide any nutritional benefit and are stored in the body,
inhibiting the creation of prostacyclin, which is necessary for blood
flow and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.122 In fact, trans
fats increase the amount of oxidized LDL in the blood, which can lead to
heart disease and can cause memory problems.123 And these are just a few
of the major health dangers associated with the consumption of
artificial trans fats. Again, it is not the food per se; it is what we
have done to the food. God created fat; we have changed the
wired-for-love form of God's creation. Research on the dangers of
industrial trans fatty acids, in particular their link to heart disease,
began appearing in the scientific literature in the 1950s, pioneered by
the aforementioned biochemist Dr. Kummerow.124 However, only recently
has the FDA decided to take notable, if slow, measures against the use
of trans fats in food products---predominantly due to the activist
efforts of the remarkable Kummerow, who is a hundred years old and still
doing research as I write this.125 The FDA's hesitation was in many ways
a result of the food industry, which needs trans fats to make its
products taste good and store well.126 Needless to say, it does us good
to remember that official dietary recommendations are not always
reliable, based on the latest scientific research, or bias-free---and
should never just be taken at face value.127 The bottom line: avoid
trans fats by avoiding fast foods and prepackaged foods, including
margarine and shortening. Now let's apply this same type of
research-based reasoning to a big problem in the MAD diet: sugar.

17 Sugar: The Forbidden Fruit?

Sugar: we hate to love it and we love to hate it. Today, this substance
seems to polarize the conversation as much as religion, politics, and
sports, while it is found in abundance throughout the globe, in
countless food establishments. Is it making us fat and sick? Is it
killing us? Is it harmless? Is sugar in all forms bad for us? Is sugar
the real bad guy? Yes and no. MAD sugar, the refined and processed sugar
so many of us consume today, disrupts the intricately balanced
environments in our brain and body.1 It is a powerful epigenetic
factor---for the worse. Unfortunately, processed sugar affects the brain
in many toxic ways, and the more we eat it, the worse these effects
get.2 Evidence suggests that processed sugar acts on the brain in ways
similar to well-known addictive substances such as alcohol and drugs,
where both the opioid (natural painkillers in the brain) and
dopaminergic (dopamine pathway) systems are upset, which can cause
neurophysiological and structural confusion.3 This addictive process is
part of the reward systems in your brain. Endorphins are peptide
hormones that bind to the opioid receptors in your brain and act as
neurotransmitters. Endorphins reduce the sensation of pain and affect
our emotions.4 Exorphins, on the other hand, are compounds that we can
eat that activate our opioid receptors, thereby giving us pleasure as we
consume our food.5 A growing body of research indicates that these
exorphins can be found not only in wheat and gluten-containing products
but also in meat, eggs, dairy, green leafy vegetables, chocolate, and
green tea. In fact, they may be ubiquitous in our food supply.6 They
appear to account for the desire to eat more of these foods. God wants
us to enjoy eating!

MAD sugars, however, highjack these natural reward systems, distorting
the desire for real, whole food, and replacing it with cravings for
processed and refined food-like products.7 Dr. Stephan Guyenet, a
neurobiologist and researcher, suggests that "the palatability of a
food, regardless of its exorphin content, is a major determinant of the
food's interaction with the opioid \[reward\] system."8 By manipulating
the palatability of industrial food-like products, such as calculating
the bliss points discussed in part 1, food manufacturers go to enormous
lengths to capitalize on the addictive properties of their wares.

You Are Not Your Addiction Nevertheless, sugar cravings and addictions
are actually learned behaviors. According to recent research, the
abnormal craving for sugar is not innate in children and adults; it is
the result of the massive amounts of sugar being added to highly
processed foods and drinks.9 The increasingly sweet MAD diet is driving
the desire to learn to crave more and more sugar. Although it may not
seem like it at first, this is good news! If a behavior or habit is
learned, it can be unlearned. What we wire into the brain we can wire
out of the brain, because the brain is neuroplastic, as we saw at the
beginning of this section. It can change! We choose to follow
temptation; God does not tempt us (James 1:13--15). Even though it may
be difficult to resist these foods, the mind is stronger than the body
and we can choose to overcome the craving and retrain our brains and
bodies through our minds. Yet how exactly do we learn to love sugar?
Sugar eventually ends up in the pleasure centers in our brains, such as
the orbital frontal cortex, where we consciously experience the pull of
the "sugar rush."10 If this pull is repeated enough times daily, over
about sixty-three days, a memory craving sugar will have been implanted
in our nonconscious mind (see page 97 for a reminder of how the
sixty-three days works). For example: we eat a refined, processed donut
at the office because that's what everyone does on Fridays. Over the
next couple of days we think about the donut, recalling its taste. This
process of imagining activates the same pathways in the brain as though
we were actually eating a donut. By day four we find ourselves craving a
donut. On day five we buy and eat two donuts. And so this cycle carries
on repeatedly, for sixty-three days, after which we have willfully

learned to crave donuts, entrenching this memory in our nonconscious
mind. Next time we see a donut? We will definitely battle resisting it!

The Love of MAD Sugar Is One of the Roots of Evil Of course, there are
sugars in real foods as well, such as honey and fruit. God created these
foods in such a way as to give us pleasure when we eat them, just as
eating them nourishes us and fills our body with good nutrients. In
fact, we have sugar receptors all the way down the esophagus, which
appear to be intricately linked to our appetites.11 Our taste buds in
particular are designed to help us recognize and pursue important
nutrients: we have receptors for essential salts, for energy-rich
sugars, for amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), and for
energy-bearing molecules called nucleotides.12 Not just our brains but
also our bodies show how God wants us to enjoy the pleasures of real
food. We can essentially become addicted to anything, even kale! As my
daughter Jessica often jokes, our family may have to go to kale rehab
(we each eat about two large bunches a day). Yet "the 17 teaspoons of
added sugar in a 20-ounce Coke is the same amount of sugar found in
roughly 3 pounds of carrots, 7½ oranges, 230 stalks of asparagus, or 531
cups of spinach---with none of the nutrition of those whole foods."13 We
can eat a whole bag of oranges, which have natural fruit sugars in them,
and technically consume a lot of sugar, yet these sugars are encased in
their whole-food packages and are full of fiber and nutrients that
sustain life. And, as anybody who has eaten a whole bag of oranges
knows, this is a difficult task and the end result may not be so
pleasant. MAD sugars, on the other hand, are empty calories. When we eat
these refined and processed sugars, we consume an excess of calories
because sugars (both sucrose and fructose, such as can be found in the
infamous high fructose corn syrup, or HFCS) block the signal in our
brains that tells us we have had enough.14 Highly processed sugars, just
like any processed and refined food products, actually disturb our taste
buds.15 In 2001, scientists identified the actual protein molecule,
T1R3, that detects sugar. When excessive amounts of sugar are eaten,
this protein is disturbed, contributing to the development of a toxic
sugar craving.16

Indeed, as we saw above, food corporations craft these food-like
products in such a way as to get us to consume more and more of these
empty sugars, without realizing that this will make us sick.17 It can
set up the conditions for type 2 diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease,
mental health issues, and tooth decay, to mention just a few of the
health consequences of refined MAD sugars.18 And this stuff is legally
consumed by millions and given to our children as "treats." God never
intended for us to eat foods that will kill us. As Jesus himself said,
"Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a
snake instead?" (Luke 11:11 NIV). God loves and cares for us, and for
his entire creation. He came to heal us and set us free---body, spirit,
and soul. He made us more than conquerors through him. But we have to
choose to follow his promises. We have to choose to change the way we
eat, as we have to choose to give every other part of our life to him.

Hungry as a Horse . . . on High Fructose Corn Syrup Before entering the
bloodstream from the digestive tract, sugar is broken down into two
simple sugars, glucose and fructose.19 Each type of sugar performs
different yet complementary functions. Glucose, which is produced mainly
by the breakdown of complex carbohydrates, is the type of energy our
body is designed to run on. Every living thing uses glucose for
energy.20 Fructose, on the other hand, activates the taste cells found
on our pancreas, a reaction that slightly increases our body's secretion
of insulin, which we need to move the glucose into our cells for
energy.21 This is a complementary relationship. Glucose and fructose are
metabolized differently in the body. Glucose has been found to reduce
brain activity in regions that regulate appetite and reward, but
fructose does not.22 Fructose only weakly stimulates the secretion of
insulin, a hormone that can increase satiety and reduce hunger. It also
reduces the amount of the hormone glucagon, such as peptide-1 (GLP-1),
which contributes to a feeling of satiety.23 Researchers are concerned
that fructose alone, as is found in processed HFCS, could significantly
increase hunger and eating. Similarly, research indicates that glucose
decreases cerebral blood flow in the hypothalamus, thalamus, insula, and
the striatum, but fructose increases cerebral blood flow in these

areas.24 Glucose essentially reduces activity in the hypothalamus, an
event that is associated with feelings of metabolic fullness and
satiety, whereas fructose has the opposite effect: it can make you crave
more food. Likewise, the brain's response to fructose on its own
produces abnormal activation in the nucleus accumbens, which is part of
the reward circuit. This activation increases the desire for food, just
as fructose's effects on the hypothalamus increase the desire for
food.25 In fact, one of the main functions of the hypothalamus is to
keep a handle on how much long-term energy is stored as fat---the
conversion of extra glucose into fat for a rainy day, so to speak. The
hypothalamus does this by detecting levels of the fat-derived hormone
leptin. It also carefully monitors the body's levels of blood glucose,
which as we saw impact feelings of satiety. When we eat, the
hypothalamus sends out signals that make us less hungry. When food is
restricted, the hypothalamus sends signals that increase our desire to
eat, potentially leading to weight gain, obesity, and lifestyle-related
diseases.26 Processed sugars like HFCS put these carefully controlled
wired-for-love signals into disarray. One recent study has shown how a
glucose drink can cause blood flow and activity in the brain areas
controlling appetite, emotion, and reward to decrease with a feeling of
fullness. Drinking fructose, on the other hand, continued to stimulate
the brain's appetite and reward areas, and the participants did not
report feeling full. They even said they could have easily carried on
eating and drinking.27 Now imagine how a soda with HFCS can confuse the
brain and lead to overeating. Talk about being as hungry as a horse!

It's All about Connections The brain's many structures and circuits work
on the principle of connectivity, which means all the parts work
together in an intricate and balanced way. As I have noted many times
throughout this book, this connectivity can be upset by toxic thinking
and toxic eating. In terms of connectivity between different brain
regions, glucose increases activity between the hypothalamus and the
thalamus and striatum by providing energy.28 These regions are a part of
the thinking pathway (known as the science of thought) that deals with
our state of mind, connects existing

thoughts moving from the nonconscious to the conscious mind, and
determines cognitive fluency.29 Fructose, when it is balanced with
glucose in real, whole foods, increases connectivity between the
hypothalamus and thalamus, but not the striatum, which deactivates once
a person is full.30 This means fructose gives an extra boost to the
dynamic and active regulation of what is coming into the conscious mind
(what you are choosing to eat: say, for example, cake or kale?), the
conscious evaluation of this with existing thoughts (I love this cake,
it is my comfort food, but I read how good kale is for me the other day,
so I really should choose that . . .), and the final choice made (I am
going to eat the kale!).31 Fructose is therefore more responsible for
activating hunger by creating epigenetic conditions that increase the
communication between the hypothalamus and thalamus, while glucose makes
sure you stop eating when you are full by activating all three regions,
including the striatum. Yet when the fructose-glucose love affair, so to
speak, is out of kilter, the connectivity between these regions is
compromised. This feels like fogginess and lack of clarity and slowness
in the mind. The fructose in the HFCS activates our hunger without
increasing activity in the striatum, so we do not feel that full and
continue to eat more and more of the food-like products. Similarly, the
cortical brain control area, which is activated when we think critically
and self-evaluate, is inhibited by fructose but activated by glucose.32
When we eat real food and think good thoughts, this area is activated
correctly and enables us to balance our reactions to everyday
circumstances. A healthy, connected cortical brain control area allows
us to be both excited and sharp, yet cautious and wise, truly following
Jesus's commands: "Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves"
(Matt. 10:16). MAD sugars, on the other hand, significantly affect our
critical thinking skills. In fact, since this brain control area
includes sites important in determining how our senses respond to foods,
the extent to which the public is bombarded with "eat more processed
food" messages is alarming.33 What are we doing to our poor brains?

As Sweet as Honey

God designed glucose and fructose to be eaten together, the way they are
found in fruits and honey, in small, controlled quantities and
seasonally available---that is why they are so hard to obtain in nature.
As Dr. Lustig, one of the leading experts on childhood obesity and
sugar, notes, our ancestors could only access sugary foods as fruit or
honey or another naturally occurring sweetener, and then only for a few
months of the year.34 Moreover, within vegetables and fruits, fructose
is mixed with everything it needs to make it beneficial to our bodies
and brains: fiber, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and phytonutrients, for
example. The correct amount of these sugars, in real, whole foods,
activates the nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, thalamus insula, and
striatum in a biochemically balanced way. If, for example, you have just
finished a power walk, the fructose will be turned into glycogen and
stored in the liver until you need it, while the glucose will be used
for energy.35 When sugar is eaten in fruit and honey, glucose increases
production of insulin in a healthy, wired-for-love kind of way. The
insulin enables sugar in the blood to be transported into the cells
where it can be used for energy, increases the production of leptin, a
hormone that helps regulate appetite and fat storage, and suppresses the
production of ghrelin, a hormone made by the stomach that helps regulate
food intake.36 Because of this reaction, after eating glucose, feelings
of hunger actually decrease, unlike the aforementioned effect of HFCS.
Yet today, refined MAD sugars, primarily in the form of HFCS, are widely
available and added to virtually all processed foodstuffs and drinks.
Even regular table salt now contains sugar! Lustig certainly hit the
nail on the head, observing that "nature made sugar hard to get; man
made it easy."37 Although we should be proud of many modern advances,
the production of refined sugars like HFCS should not be one of them. If
the liver is already full of glycogen from all these processed sugars,
any excess fructose will be stored as fat.38 If this fat gets lodged in
the liver it can cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, among other
health issues.39 Not every modern development should be embraced as
"progress." It is not that fructose in itself is bad. It is the
reductionist, labmanufactured, biologically inappropriate amounts of
HFCS and other refined sugars that is the problem.40 High fructose corn
syrup in particular is a cheap sweetener (it is actually sweeter than
regular sugar) and is used in most soft drinks, processed foods,
condiments, and, sadly, many baby

foods.41 It makes sense economically for food corporations to use HFCS,
yet it makes no sense biologically for us to consume HFCS, or any other
highly refined and processed sugar. As we have already discussed, not
only does it overload the liver but it also confuses the receptors on
the pancreas's cells, as well as the taste buds, and neurophysiological
turmoil ensues. However, HFCS is not the only bad guy. Any processed and
refined form of sugar is toxic. Raw, unfiltered, and unprocessed honey,
for example, contains royal jelly, bee pollen, and propolis---three
major sources of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.42 These elements
all work together in a balanced way so there will not be any negative
metabolic effects when incorporating raw and unfiltered honey into the
human diet. When heated and filtered, however, the honey loses vitamins
A, C, D, E, and K, various B vitamins, calcium, potassium, magnesium,
and live enzymes.43 It becomes toxic to our health, just like HFCS. We
are not supposed to have a lot of fructose floating about in our heads.
Molecularly speaking, fructose has the same number of calories but is
sweeter than glucose.44 Unlike glucose, however, fructose is almost
entirely removed from the blood by the liver: very little of it actually
gets into the brain if we eat a balanced diet of real, whole foods.45
When we eat excessive amounts of fructose in the MAD diet, more fructose
enters the brain than it should, and problems ensue since our brain is
not designed to handle large amounts of this processed sugar.46 The
moral of the story is that when we isolate fructose in a laboratory, we
disrupt the delicate balance of God's created foods. This is just one
more example of a theme that I have discussed throughout this book: it
is not the food per se, but what humanity does to the food. We would do
well to follow the advice in Proverbs 25:16: "Do you like honey? Don't
eat too much, or it will make you sick!" (NLT).

HFCS and AGEs: An Alphabet Soup You Won't Like The manufacturing process
for HFCS is different than that of table sugar. HFCS contains free and
unbound fructose molecules that are more easily absorbed in the body.47
These molecules do not have to go through an extra metabolic step like
other sugars.48 Fructose, as in HFCS, can cause up to seven times more
cell damage than glucose because it binds to cellular

proteins seven times faster---this is called glycation.49 It even
releases more free radicals than glucose, which can cause tissue damage
and aging.50 Normally, sugar binds to a protein under the direction of
an enzyme, forming glycoproteins that are essential to the proper
functioning of our body.51 These enzymes attach glucose to proteins at
specific sites, on specific molecules, for specific purposes.52 Sugar
and protein are not, however, supposed to bind nonenzymatically. When
they do so, say if you eat a MAD donut, the glycation of blood proteins
takes place when the levels of glucose shoot up and stay high.53 The
product of this nonenzymatic binding is a glycated protein called an
advanced glycation end-product (AGE).54 How do these AGEs come about?
Hemoglobin is found in red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout
your body. When your blood sugar is too high, sugar builds up in your
blood and combines with your hemoglobin: it has become glycated. Excess
sugar molecules that cross the blood-brain barrier combine with proteins
and fats.55 This reaction causes the proteins to fold incorrectly, and
then they become less functional and even toxic.56 These dangerous new
structures are AGEs.57 These AGEs affect how cells function, thereby
causing damage to the body, which puts a strain on the immune system.
AGEs cause inflammation, free radical damage and damage to blood
vessels, and increased oxidation---all these can create major cognitive
issues.58 This type of degeneration usually takes place over time: it
can start as minor biological disturbances or disabilities, and later
continue on to become specific disorders, contributing to major brain
degeneration and reduced mental functioning.59 Research shows that AGEs
come from fats and proteins as well, not just glucose. Our body actually
has a natural way of removing AGEs, since these glycated proteins form
inside our cells as well---not just from our food. They are dealt with
within the cell by being degraded and are flushed out by the kidneys.60
Zinc, insulin, and glutathione, acting as antioxidants, also fight the
AGEs that are produced within the cell.61 As long as our kidneys and
intestines are working properly, and our antioxidant systems are
functioning, the majority of dietary AGEs will be eliminated very
quickly---unless, of course, we are eating the MAD diet, which puts all
our bodily functions at risk by creating a toxic epigenetic environment
around our cells.

The fructose in HFCS directly affects the brain. It is believed to cause
a sensation of pleasure and trigger a craving for more HFCS, without
curbing the appetite. Essentially, it gives us a pleasurable boost
without the "downside" of feeling full, so we think we can consume more
of it, but in fact we are overconsuming empty sugar calories.62 High
levels of HFCS in the brain have been linked to brain damage and
depression.63 A number of scientists now believe HFCS to be more
dangerous and insidious to our health than alcohol!64 Although people
may feel a temporary "high" when they eat MAD foods high in processed
salt, sugar, and fat, doing so on a regular basis will eventually lead
to a learned craving that is self-destructive. Their brains have been
altered, and now they feel like they need the food-like product to
function normally. Indeed, because these foods create disarray in the
brain, we crave more and more of them to try to get order back.65 Yet
through choosing to change, this can be reversed because of the
incredible process of neuroplasticity. I really cannot say this enough:
we are not victims of our biology. We can renew our mind and remodel the
biology of our brain.66 We are more than conquerors through Christ (Rom.
8:37). What incredible hope there is when we apply God's principles and
his science correctly!

This Is Your Reward Circuit on Sugar Apart from regulating satiety, the
hypothalamus, thalamus, insula, and striatum regions of the brain act as
our "metabolic analysis team."67 They "read and analyze" our metabolic
state and, in doing so, help influence and balance motivation and
reward.68 Glucose stops us wanting to eat more, as we saw earlier, while
fructose increases our desire to eat. In real, whole foods their
respective functions complement each other. Too much fructose, out of
the context of real, whole foods, confuses this "read and analyze"
function, and we end up wanting more and more of the wrong foods to keep
experiencing these reward highs.69 In a secular sense, scientists treat
motivation and reward as though we are animals that can be trained. This
approach is essentially defeatist and mechanistic. They see brain scans
light up in the same regions as in a druguser's brain, and label the
sugar eater an addict. Indeed, as we have seen,

several leading scientists and doctors believe that food addiction and
even obesity are incurable diseases, and that they are just something
individuals have to learn to cope with---usually with significant
amounts of drugs involved.70 Yet our brains are designed to latch on to
something: God!71 The more we align our thinking with God's Word, the
more we will develop a healthy relationship with food, since we latch on
to him first and foremost. Become addicted to God, and "all these things
shall be added to you" (Matt. 6:33). In his perfect design, motivation
and reward come from the fact that we can be aware of our thinking and
eating, bring those thoughts captive to God, choose to override bad
eating patterns, and build good eating habits into our minds. Why?
Because we treasure our bodies, neighbors, and the whole of creation as
gifts from God---gifts we must steward wisely. To eat food is a
beautiful thing, because God created eating and he created food.

The Shrinking Hippo\[campus\] Dendrites are the branches on the top of
neurons and look somewhat like branches on a tree. But do not let the
simplicity of their shape fool you. Dendrites act like mini
supercomputers and play a critical role in thinking and long-term
thought formation.72 When we put our body and brain into toxic stress by
unhealthy eating and unhealthy thinking, the hippocampal neurons became
shorter and the dendrites shrink in a phenomenon called dendritic
remodeling, which means that their supercomputer functions become
compromised.73 This affects long-term memory. Furthermore, there are
fewer synaptic connections and therefore less opportunity for optimal
information flow. In turn, this affects information processing and
short-term memory. In fact, the hippocampus is involved in processing
information, converting short-term to long-term memory and spatial
memory, so any damage here means that information processing is slowed
down in all these areas, negatively impacting cognition.74 In the
synapses themselves the vesicles, which are like little bags of
excitatory neurotransmitters, begin to dry up if we do not take our
thoughts captive to Christ and if we continue to eat the MAD diet.75
Because neurons use excitatory neurotransmitters to tell each other to
increase their level of activity, fewer of these vesicles means

that fewer signals can be sent, slowing down information processing.76
Toxic food habits can break down communication pathways and short-term
processing, resulting in a compromised memory. When the hippocampus
functions like it should, which happens when we think and eat properly,
a neurotrophin (proteins that allow survival, development, and function
of neurons) called BDNF is found in large quantities in the hippocampus,
hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex.77 It is involved in neuroplasticity,
neurogenesis, and the maintenance and growth of many types of neurons.78
If there is not enough BDNF, then the thinking process and the formation
of short and long-term memories will be negatively affected, the
structure of our blood vessels will be damaged, our brain can become
inflamed, and synaptic plasticity will be reduced.79 And, according to a
recent study, it takes only three months of eating the MAD diet (high in
processed sugars, salt, and fat) to lower levels of BDNF.80 Consuming
food-like products instead of real, whole foods, actually affects
spatial memory within seventy-two hours and other types of memory within
twenty-eight to thirty days.81 Imagine what a continual lifestyle of
eating a MAD diet does!

Those MAD Sugars And the evil of decontextualized, processed,
lab-manufactured HFCS continues. Fructose in excess and out of the
context of real, whole foods reduces blood flow not only in the
hippocampus but also in other regions in the brain. This loss of blood
flow affects cognitive function.82 If you consume HFCS on a regular
basis, for instance, you compromise the anterior cingulate cortex's
ability to shift between thoughts, and you get "stuck" in your
thinking.83 Inflexible thinking, in turn, disrupts your intellect and
ability to think things through by considering all options for any given
situation. Likewise, processed and refined sugars like HFCS also reduce
blood flow to the fusiform, which is involved in visual processing and
facial recognition, thereby upsetting the visual cortex.84 When there is
reduced blood flow to these areas, the ability to recognize faces and
process visual cues is damaged. This can affect how you relate to
others.85 Simply put: eating HFCS can affect your relationships.

Yet God's mercies are renewed each morning (Lam. 3:22--23). Recent
research has shown how a shrinking hippocampus and other damages caused
by the MAD diet are reversible.86 Change your thinking and your eating,
and you can remodel your dendrites and increase blood flow! This is
truly God's grace in action.

In a MAD Rush of Insulin Eating a diet high in processed and refined
foods can also cause resistance to the anabolic hormone insulin, which
in turn can contribute to the onset of chronic diseases and even early
death. When the cells are saturated in excess insulin, such as when we
eat a lot of MAD sugars, the receptors (doorways) on our cells that let
in the insulin are desensitized. The insulin cannot deliver the sugars
to the cells, so now there is a lot of excess sugar floating about in
the bloodstream (hyperglycemia). The pancreas then secretes more
insulin, since the tissues cannot "hear" what is going on correctly, so
they feel they need more of this hormone to do the job. The body
compensates for excess insulin in the blood by developing insulin
resistance syndrome, the precursor to type 2 diabetes. This will
eventually lead to a state called hyperinsulinemia---too much insulin in
the blood. Similarly, other hormones also become affected by the high
levels of insulin in the body, and the process of metabolism is thrown
into chaos.87 Needless to say, both hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia
are bad news. In fact, they are major epigenetic factors in the
development of type 2 diabetes.88 It is therefore not surprising that
people who drink sugarsweetened beverages have up to an 83 percent
higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.89 Other health issues
associated with insulin resistance and high blood glucose levels include
blindness, obesity, heart disease, nerve damage, cancer, compromised
fatty liver (which is a precursor to cirrhosis and liver failure), and
the formation of amyloid beta plaques, the hallmark of Alzheimer's.90
Some researchers now even refer to Alzheimer's as type 3 diabetes.91 And
pure sugar is not the only culprit. There is consensus among nutrition
scientists that simple, refined carbohydrates such as white bread,
pasta, and processed cereals are not good fuel sources, since they
release sugar too quickly into the bloodstream.92 Their chemical
composition once

metabolized is not much different from that of pure sugar---they are
often referred to as "sweet poison" because of their toxic effects in
excess on the body.93 These types of food continually force the body to
compensate by making the pancreas produce excessive amounts of insulin,
leading to hyperinsulinemia.94 Like everything in the body, insulin in
and of itself is important, and not just for glucose metabolism. It can
pass through the blood-brain barrier and trigger neurological processes
that are important for learning and memory, if the environment in our
body is healthy. However, consuming large amounts of MAD sugars on a
regular basis blocks insulin's ability to regulate how our brain cells
store and use sugar for the energy needed to fuel thoughts and emotions,
thus having a negative impact on learning and memory.95 Essentially,
high blood sugar and insulin levels from eating incorrectly also upset
the brain's neurotransmitters that regulate mood, thinking, and
learning.96 The synaptic function between neurons gets disrupted, which
directly affects emotions, memory, and thinking: the brain's
connectivity is thrown into disarray, and this affects short-term memory
and thinking since the brain cells will have trouble signaling each
other.97 Indeed, hyperinsulinemia impacts the insulin receptors in the
brain, including the hypothalamus. The brain does not respond well to
the increased blood insulin, which signals the brain, along with leptin,
if we are eating too much and putting on weight. Since the brain can no
longer suitably detect excess fat production in the body, our response
will be to eat more, and therefore gain more weight---a vicious cycle.98

MAD Stress We turn now from insulin to cortisol. While commonly known as
the "stress hormone," in a negative sense, cortisol is actually an
essential steroid hormone derived from cholesterol.99 It increases
available energy by increasing blood glucose and releasing fatty acids
from fat, which, in healthy doses, can do amazing things in our brain
such as promoting attention, storing memory, and maintaining a balance
between healthy and toxic stress.100 However, when we eat MAD foods, or
think toxic thoughts, our cortisol levels are elevated and become toxic,
impairing attention and

memory, causing changes in the hippocampus (thereby affecting the
conversion of short-term memory to long-term memory), and shrinking
nerve cells (which will eventually die).101 Is it any wonder, then, that
a diet high in fructose throughout adolescence can worsen learning,
memory, and depressive- and anxiety-like behavior, and alter how the
brain responds to stress?102 The amygdala in the brain has receptors for
cortisol and insulin and is therefore also affected by excessive
consumption of refined and processed sugars.103 This structure is also
part of the aforesaid thinking pathway, working with the hypothalamus to
provide the emotional and perceptual information that puts memories in
context.104 When our amygdala is affected by MAD food-like products, we
can become reactive and impulsive, since we no longer have strong
emotional and perceptual clarity.105 To put it simply, thinking and
emotions are affected in a negative way by anything that is not real,
whole food.

The Soul, Stress, and Sugar As I discussed earlier, the hypothalamus is
a central player in how the mind (soul) controls the body's reaction to
stress and foods. The hypothalamus is actually referred to as the
"brain" of the endocrine system.106 It integrates signals from the mind
and body, sending them throughout our bodies so that we can react in an
appropriate and functional manner, "so that the whole body is healthy
and growing and full of love" (Eph. 4:16 NLT). Stress, like real food,
is not inherently bad---it depends on how we react to it.107 Stage 1 of
stress is only short term and makes us alert and ready for action.108 It
is an appropriate response to certain situations. During this stage,
corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is secreted from the hypothalamus
and stimulates the pituitary glands to produce adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH).109 ACTH travels via the blood to the adrenal glands
(above the kidneys) and stimulates them to produce the stress hormone
cortisol. On the other hand, if we react incorrectly to stress due to a
"spirit of fear" (2 Tim. 1:7), our stress reaction is prolonged and
becomes toxic. According to one study, increased stress can potentially
increase the risk of mortality by 43 percent---but only for the
individuals who believed that stress was

harmful for their health. People who didn't view stress as harmful
actually decreased their risk of dying. Over the eight years of the
study, the researchers estimated that the 18,200 people who died, died
from the belief that stress is bad for you---that is more than two
thousand deaths a year.110 This is a real eye-opener, because it shows
that how we perceive stress determines its impact on our mental and
physical health. If you change your mind about stress, however, you can
change your body's response to stress. Instead of viewing the stress
response as negative, when faced with a stressful situation you can view
it as your body being energized to help you meet the challenge---rethink
the stress response as helpful! Imagine your pounding heart preparing
you for action; if you are breathing faster, good! You are getting more
oxygen to your brain.111 If we choose to react wrongly to a challenging
situation, we will enter stage 2 of the stress reaction. During this
stage, high levels of cortisol circulate in the blood for extended
periods of time, in turn contributing to prolonged high blood sugar that
can also lead to insulin resistance, prediabetes, and weight gain, since
prolonged high levels of cortisol lead to the accumulation of fat
instead of fat breakdown. In this toxic situation, fat tends to
accumulate around the middle of the body and is a risk factor for heart
disease.112 In fact, prolonged, high levels of cortisol can in some
extreme cases lead to Cushing's syndrome, with its characteristic fat
accumulation around the middle and back of the human body, but not on
the legs, which remain thin due to muscle wastage.113 If we continue to
release cortisol, we enter stage 3 of the stress reaction, which can
lead to adrenal exhaustion and eventually death.114 So a maladaptive
stress response that arises from our perceptions of stress and from
excessive MAD sugar intake can interact to make us ill and gain weight.
Likewise, both a bad stress response and elevated insulin levels from
too much sugar intake feed back through the brain, especially the
hypothalamus. These interactions are a profound example of the
interconnected nature of the brain and body, and how both signals from
our thinking (the 80 percent) and our environment, or in this case
eating (the 20 percent), can influence our health both physically and
mentally. Yet there is good news! Since the mind (soul) controls the
brain, including the hypothalamus, the mind is the key to breaking the
maladaptive stress/sugar cycles. We can choose with our minds how we
react to the circumstances of life, including stress and the foods we
choose to eat. I will

explain in greater detail how we can overcome the stress/sugar problem
in part 3.

Is Sugar Making You Fat? The urgency of choosing good food and good
thoughts is prevalent throughout the scientific literature. The science
of thought and developing intellect has been a large part of my
research. A growing body of research examining the link between sugar
consumption and obesity, for example, has found a significant
statistical association between these two factors: thinking and
eating.115 The link is especially strong in children, where each daily
serving of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with a 60 percent
increased risk of weight gain and obesity, and thus the diet-related
diseases.116 These findings should cause us to question current business
practices. How ethical is it to use children to determine how sweet or
salty something should be, calculating "bliss points" so that big
companies can make more money? How ethical is it to market MAD foods to
children and youth? Indeed, the mental and physical health effects of
consuming MAD processed and refined foods as a child can persist into
adulthood.117 As investigative journalist Michael Moss notes in Salt,
Sugar, Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us, the food corporations are
"manipulating or exploiting the biology of the child."118 How can we
allow this to continue?

Go MAD and Lose Your Mind? With the increasing rates of not only obesity
but also Alzheimer's in our world today, allowing food manufacturers to
sell products that can affect both our physical and mental health poses
a threat to us all. The number of people with Alzheimer's disease is
projected to increase fourfold over the next forty years, reaching
approximately fourteen million by 2050.119 The MAD diet affects the
gastrointestinal (GI) system in multiple ways, including damaged memory,
as we already saw.120 The exponentially increasing obesity rates within
Western societies over the last thirty years have been a cause for
alarm, yet primarily in terms of associated health problems like type 2
diabetes and cardiovascular disease.121

However, recent research is showing how Alzheimer's disease and dementia
are an equal cause for concern in terms of the MAD diet. Considering how
over one-third of Americans today are classified as obese, there is a
strong possibility these people will suffer from cognitive decline.122
More and more studies are highlighting the frightening association
between the consumption of MAD foods, weight gain, and dementia.123 This
body of research underscores the fact that the MAD diet has dire effects
on learning and memory processes (which, if you recall, are dependent on
the hippocampus). Excessive amounts of processed and refined foods
actually accost the small intestine, which in response secretes elevated
levels of amyloid beta protein.124 This excess amyloid beta protein
moves through the blood, damaging the blood-brain barrier. The
blood-brain barrier is the brain's security system; it is a network of
blood vessels lined with endothelial cells wedged tightly together,
creating a nearly impermeable barrier between the brain and the
bloodstream.125 Every thought we have and action we take involves
precise types of communication within and between the nerve cells in our
brain. The blood-brain barrier is how the brain separates itself from
the natural chemical fluctuations that occur in the environments around
the cells, which will affect this communication and, therefore, affect
our thinking. The only things that can pass through the blood-brain
barrier are very small compounds and fat-soluble molecules. These,
unfortunately, include antidepressants, antianxiety medications,
alcohol, cocaine, and many hormones. Larger molecules like glucose or
insulin must be carried across by proteins.126 A healthy blood-brain
barrier allows essential nutrients to get in and blocks harmful
substances. So what happens if it is damaged? Some molecules, like
amyloid beta, are able to break down the blood-brain barrier. Amyloid
beta in the blood from incorrect eating breaks down the tight junction
proteins of the blood-brain barrier (it does this by reducing the gene
expression of these protein junctions), gets into the brain, and damages
the hippocampus.127 Because the blood-brain barrier has been broken
down, there is an increase in the accumulation of amyloid beta in the
hippocampus, which contributes to the development of dementia and
Alzheimer's disease (which are characterized by amyloid beta plaques
that cause memory and processing problems).128

Unfortunately, the story does not end there. The damaged blood-brain
barrier now leaves the hippocampus and the other structures of the brain
vulnerable to circulating toxins, like heavy metals and inflammatory
markers, with resultant increasing levels of cognitive damage.129 The
surrounding environment of the brain is no longer stable, and this can
occur from both an unhealthy thought life and an unhealthy diet---MAD
thinking and MAD eating! If a MAD diet becomes a lifestyle, the damage
will continue; if unforgiveness, bitterness, toxic thinking, stress, and
negative emotions become a lifestyle, the damage will continue. God
wants us whole and healthy in spirit, soul, and body. Of course, reading
all these studies can be frightening and disheartening, which is why I
am glad I can turn to God! He has given us an incredible mind, which can
change our brains---we can reverse this cognitive damage!130 We are not
victims of our biology, of the food corporations, of the government, of
our grandparents' eating and thinking habits. We are more than
conquerors in Christ. We can renew our minds. We can change our biology.

Prescribe Produce, not Prozac Although the ancient Greek physician
Hippocrates famously said that "food should be our medicine, and
medicine should be our food," only recently is the idea of food as
medicine becoming a resurgent field of research. The fields of medicine
and psychiatry are beginning to rediscover the many connections between
food and mental illness after more than a half century of depending
primarily on prescription drugs for relief.131 Steve Holt, summarizing
Dr. Bonnie Kaplan's work in this area, hit the nail on the head when he
said that "we may soon see psychiatrists prescribing produce rather than
Prozac."132 Kaplan's research, particularly in the field of learning
disabilities, shows that eating correctly is "consistently and reliably"
associated with better moods and mental health.133 These findings are
exciting, since they lay the foundation for the positive effect of a
broad-spectrum micronutrient approach to learning disabilities, as
opposed to traditional medications that have a number of unwanted and
dangerous side effects including structural and chemical changes in the
brain.134 Similarly, other researchers have found lower rates

of depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder among those who ate a
traditional, real-food diet of protein and vegetables, compared to
people who followed a modern diet heavy with processed and fast
foods---or even compared with a health-food diet of just tofu and
salads!135 We need to change the way we view nutrition science.
"Magic-bullet" methodology, where we praise certain foods and demonize
others, fits comfortably within the reductionist pharmaceutical paradigm
and traditional scientific methodology, where drugs are typically single
ingredient and independent variables are potentially manipulated one at
a time.136 What is needed is multi-nutrient real food studies showing
the impact of real whole foods, in context, on mental and physical
health, if this is at all possible within our current scientific
framework. Nutritional science, on the other hand, is almost impossible
to do, and we are far better off eating foods the way they have been
historically grown, the way God designed (with biomimicry-inspired
improvements), rather than eating the laboratory-manipulated ones we
have today. Now that we have discussed how proteins, fats, and sugars
epigenetically affect our bodies and brains, we turn to a subject that
has gotten a lot of attention recently: Should we or should we not eat
gluten? We'll see that the concern over gluten sensitivity is valid but
its solution is not what is commonly recommended.

18 To Eat Gluten or Not to Eat Gluten: That Is the Question

The current wheat-gluten debate and the epidemic of gluten intolerance
tends to say more about our modern "diet fad" psychology than what is
truly happening in our environments, food supplies, physiology, and
biology.1 By making gluten the root of all dietary evils, we once again
step into reductionist thinking, where one ingredient or chemical is
blamed for most of the woes of mankind, and where the small subset of
those genuinely afflicted is made to represent the larger population.
Research shows that one out of five people are self-diagnosing gluten
intolerance, and about one-third of the American population claim to
have gluten intolerance.2 Yet there is no solid scientific research to
back up this trend. Statistics show that a handful of people are truly
gluten intolerant, such as individuals who are allergic to wheat or
gluten, or people who have an autoimmune disorder called celiac
disease.3 And while celiac disease is a well-established entity, the
evidence base for gluten as a trigger of symptoms in patients without
celiac disease (so-called non-celiac gluten sensitivity or NCGS) is
limited.4 Indeed, the exact mechanisms by which gluten triggers the
gastrointestinal symptoms have yet to be identified.5 Scientists have
not "proven" nor do they even really understand what is exactly behind
gluten "intolerance," let alone that it is a real thing for most of the
people who claim to have it. Testimonials of how cutting out gluten
"changed my life," especially from celebrity doctors, actors, and sports
people, are in no short supply, popularizing the gluten-free fad even
more. It is not uncommon these days to blame every neuropsychological,
neurological, and learning disorder on

gluten, even though the actual evidence for this is scant. You may
certainly benefit from reducing your wheat and gluten intake, especially
the MAD variety (eliminate the MAD kind completely!), but not
necessarily because you have an allergy to gluten. No one can tolerate
the MAD diet, whether it is highly processed, refined, and industrially
manufactured meats or breads or vegetables. Eating real, whole foods,
not food-like products, will pay dividends. Our MAD food system has
dramatically changed the grains we eat and the way we eat grains. As we
saw in part 1, wheat and other grains have been bastardized through
industrial methods that have damaged their ability to nourish us.
Equally, people cannot tolerate the MAD diet in general, of which highly
processed and refined gluten is a part. Yet gluten-free eating is
financially driven by industry: if more people can be labeled as gluten
intolerant, food corporations can make more money manufacturing these
types of foods.

MAD Science In 2011, Dr. Peter Gibson, professor of gastroenterology at
Monash University, led a study that remains one of the most-cited pieces
of evidence for non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS).6 His research gave
impetus to the gluten-free diet, which is predicted to increase
gluten-free product sales to an estimated \$15 billion by 2016. Gibson,
however, has reevaluated his results and has become dissatisfied with
them, in particular due to the other variables that were not controlled
for in the study.7 Questioning the causal links between the consumption
of gluten and his subjects' reactions, he repeated the trial.8 Gibson
attempted to remove all potential dietary triggers, including lactose
(from milk products), certain preservatives like benzoate, propionate,
sulfites, and nitrites, and fermentable, poorly absorbed short-chain
carbohydrates (also known as FODMAPs), except gluten.9 Based on his
findings, Gibson came to the opposite conclusion of his original
research: "In contrast to our first study . . . we could find absolutely
no specific response to gluten."10 Gluten itself was not necessarily the
cause of the gastrointestinal symptoms under investigation. What is
known as the nocebo effect was occurring among the participants: people
suffered digestive issues when they consumed foods

containing gluten because they expected to suffer from eating gluten.11
Gluten intolerance among the participants was predominantly
psychological. The work of Gibson and his colleagues has highlighted
another dietary issue we should be more concerned about, rather than
isolating gluten and putting it in the naughty corner. According to
Biesiekierski, who worked with Gibson on the research, "some of the
largest dietary sources of FODMAPs (short-chain carbohydrates such as
oligosaccharides and sugar alcohols)---specifically bread products---are
removed when adopting a gluten-free diet, which could explain why the
millions of people worldwide who swear by gluten-free diets feel better
after going gluten-free."12 In a number of individuals, these FODMAPs
are poorly absorbed in the small intestine and could potentially be
responsible for the impetus behind the gluten-free movement. Ultimately,
however, we should not make FODMAPs the new villain just yet.
Nutritional science, as we have seen throughout this book, is a
complicated and messy business. Indeed, both Biesiekierski and Gibson
conclude that much more research is needed on NCGS, research that is as
well controlled as possible and is reproducible. This scientific rigor
is especially necessary in light of the fact that non-celiac gluten
sensitivity seems "predominantly driven by consumers and commercial
interests, not quality scientific research."13 When money is involved,
research that is already complicated gets even more complicated by
competing interests. Yet I have noticed a positive trend in the area of
nutritional science. Many researchers, like the aforementioned Gibson
and Biesiekierski, cite the need for more research, especially for
research that moves beyond the realm of animal studies. Moreover, food
needs to be looked at in the context of whole, real food, and in the
context of the whole human being. We cannot approach nutrition from a
reductionist standpoint, where we pinpoint individual "bad foods" based
on complicated correlations with a strong sense of causation. Lastly,
scientists and other sources of scientific information ought to think
carefully before making sweeping statements that claim that going gluten
free is something everyone should do because gluten is the cause of most
neurological diseases in the brain.14 These questions do not have easy
answers. I cannot write a book telling you what types of real food you
as a unique human being should and should not eat, although I can tell
you, as I have throughout this book, how eating

MAD food-like products instead of real food is always a bad idea.
Throughout this book I have tried to find as many of the scientists who
question current nutritional practices as I could. You can read their
research, books, blogs, and other materials, and then think this through
for yourself. In the end, you have to make your own dietary choices,
including whether you should go gluten free or not. Remember, the Holy
Spirit "will guide you into all the truth" (John 16:13 NIV).

MAD Wheat Gluten has played an incredibly important role in human
history.15 In the Bible alone, gluten-containing grains such as wheat
are often referred to throughout both Old and New Testaments. Wheat,
which is perhaps the most well-known source of gluten today, is an
ancient grain and incredibly nutritious when grown and prepared in the
way God designed it to be grown and prepared, according to the way his
creation works (biomimicry). It is a good source of B vitamins,
potassium, vitamin E, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc, to name just a
few of the health benefits. And it certainly is delicious too! Grains of
wheat, or wheat berries, have three layers. The bran layer is the hard
outer shell where the fiber is contained. The endosperm is the largest
part of the grain and is made up of mostly starch. The germ is the
embryo of the grain, loaded with nutrients and fatty acids and capable
of sprouting a new wheat plant. Whole grain refers to wheat that has all
three of these layers intact---the high nutrient value of wheat is only
present when all three of these layers are intact. By grinding grains
between large stones (a traditional way of grinding wheat), the flour
that is produced contains everything that is in the grain, including the
germ, fiber, starch, and a wide variety of vitamins and minerals.16
Without refrigeration or artificial preservatives, fresh stone-ground
flour spoils quickly, since the natural wheat-germ oil becomes rancid at
about the same rate that milk becomes sour; refrigeration of whole grain
breads and flours is necessary. Today's wheat, however, is far removed
from its ancestors. Modern industrial farming methods have reduced the
number of wheat varieties from thirty thousand to roughly a few
handfuls.17 In particular, most of us today consume a high-yield, hybrid
dwarf wheat variety that originated in

the 1960s (through the research efforts of Norman Borlaug, whom I
discussed in part 1). This type of wheat has fewer nutrients and is less
digestible than its predecessors, like spelt and einkorn. Yet since it
is a highyield variety, food producers have by and large adopted it.18
Even worse, the way this dwarf wheat is processed further destroys its
capacity to nourish us. The high spoilage rate of traditionally prepared
wheat makes earning large profits off the mass transportation and
distribution of thousands of loaves of bread very difficult. The modern
food industry's answer to these "problems" has been to apply faster,
hotter, and more refined techniques of processing.19 The result? Finely
ground flours that do not spoil in bread products and that can last for
months on grocery store shelves---served with a side of real health
problems. Refined wheat flour has a larger surface area than coarsely
ground wheat grains because the protective, hard-to-digest, and fibrous
outer coat that temporarily fends off enzymes from digesting the starch
inside too quickly has been stripped away.20 God designed our bodies to
use indigestible fiber to carry along partly digested food, shielding it
from immediate digestion, which can cause gastrointestinal distress and
other health issues like high blood sugar levels and an increased amount
of toxins in our bodies. Indeed, according to Walter Willett, head of
Harvard's Nutritional Department, "constipation is the number one
gastrointestinal complaint in the United States, costing more than two
million physician visits a year, and costs of \$1 billion a year on
over-the-counter laxatives. By keeping the stool soft and bulky, the
fiber in intact whole grains helps prevent this troubling problem."21
The fiber in whole wheat can save you a lot of stomach pain and social
discomfort, to say the least. Likewise, the refining process used to
prepare modern wheat increases the gluten content of flour by removing
the germ and keeping the endosperm.22 Many of us today now consume
gluten out of context of whole, real wheat, which, as I have discussed
in many places throughout this book, is a health accident waiting to
happen. Is it any wonder many of us feel we cannot tolerate gluten? As
the wheat grains are first exposed to high temperatures, moreover, the
proteins are denatured, and under the high-speed rollers, important
nutrients are nearly eliminated. The wheat grains lose up to 77 percent
of their thiamine (B1), 80 percent of their riboflavin (B2), 81 percent
of their niacin, 72 percent of their pyridoxine (B6), 50 percent of
their pantothenic acid, 86

percent of their vitamin E, 60 percent of their calcium, 71 percent of
their phosphorus, 84 percent of their magnesium, 77 percent of their
potassium, 78 percent of their sodium, 40 percent of their chromium, 86
percent of their manganese, 76 percent of their iron, 89 percent of
their cobalt, 78 percent of their zinc, 68 percent of their copper, and
16 percent of their selenium.23 The wheat grains subsequently go through
various stages of milling as they are refined even further.24 The wheat
that most of us eat today is so far removed from the wheat our ancestors
ate that it is any wonder we still call it wheat. And of course I cannot
forget to mention all the added chemicals! Conventional wheat seeds are
treated with a fungicide before they are even planted in the ground; the
crops are sprayed with pesticides and hormones in the field; after
harvest the wheat is stored in bins that have been sprayed with various
chemicals to kill insects; and, finally, the wheat is given a final
spray of pesticide to kill any "superbugs" (or bugs that have developed
a resistance to the previous chemicals) that may have made it through
the previous treatments. Unfortunately, that is not the end of the
chemical processing of wheat. As Dr. Chirag R. Patel notes in Brain
Foods: Eat Your Way to a Better Brain and Live the Life You and Your
Brain Deserve, "chlorine oxide is used to age, bleach, and oxidize the
flour."25 Chlorine oxide can react with the natural proteins in wheat
flour, thereby producing alloxan, a compound that may in turn contribute
to the onset of diabetes. Similarly, the potentially dangerous chemicals
nitrogen oxide, benzoyl peroxide, and nitrosyl can contaminate the wheat
flour as it is being milled.26 And, as if all these artificial
substances are not alarming enough, hormones are added to influence
wheat characteristics.27 What effects can all these substances have on
our bodies? MAD wheat is a BAD idea, particularly since the consumption
of processed grains can be addictive in a negative sense and has been
shown to raise bad cholesterol levels, may interfere with the body's use
of essential fatty acids, and can upset insulin levels, to name just
several of the potential health issues.28

Celiac: A MAD Problem?

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten that
affects a significant portion of the world population---an estimated 1
in every 100 people.29 Celiac disease appears to have its roots in a
preexisting infection or dysbiosis (microbial imbalance on or inside the
body).30 The immune system has to recognize that the gluten protein
fragment is problematic, so there has to be a "memory" of the
problematic protein before it is recognized. In order for a T cell of
the immune system to properly recognize the gluten protein, this little
protein fragment must first be deamidated. Deamidation involves the
removal of nitrogen from certain amino acids to produce their acidic
counterparts by an enzyme called tissue transglutaminase. For example,
the nitrogen is removed in glutamine by transglutaminase to produce
glutamate, a necessary compound for cellular metabolism. Our cells only
release transglutaminase when they are attempting to recover from tissue
damage. So, first the tissue damage occurred in some way---perhaps due
to a poor diet consisting of MAD foods---then tissue transglutaminase
was released in response to this damage to remove nitrogen from the
relevant amino acids (deamidation happened) and a "memory" of this was
formed in the immune system, in case of similar damage in the future.31
What does all this complex scientific information have to do with the
price of bread, literally and figuratively? As the nutritional
biochemist Chris Masterjohn notes, "What has the food industry decided
to do to the wheat gluten it adds to processed junk food in the last
several decades? Deamidate it! Sometimes by chemical treatment, and
sometimes by treating it with . . . \[drumroll please\] tissue
transglutaminase!"32 The MAD diet adds the very enzyme that is activated
when there is tissue damage in the body into processed and refined foods
like your average loaf of white bread. Essentially, the substances being
added to the bread are the very substances your body produces in
response to tissue damage. The epigenetic triggers that signal damage
are potentially being activated with every mouthful of this bread,
possibly leading to a rising incidence of celiac disease. Unfortunately,
little research is being carried out in this area of gluten intolerance,
which should deeply concern us.33 What other questions are not being
asked as people buy these types of MAD foods on a daily basis? How can
governmental bodies like the FDA deem a food safe, when we know so
little about the process in terms of the whole human body?

We should fear the way our current, industrial food system has
transformed our real foods into food-like products. In answer to the
question posed as the header of this chapter, "To eat gluten or not to
eat gluten: that is the question," here is my proposed answer: your diet
should be MAD free, not gluten free!

19 Sleep In, Then Move It

We close part 2 with two practices that go hand in hand with healthy
eating. God commands us to focus on the health of our triune being, as
we saw at the beginning of part 2, and this includes healthy sleeping
patterns and regular physical activity. Sleep is needed to regenerate
and protect the proper biological function of both our bodies and minds
and to consolidate memory.1 We cannot think good food thoughts without
sleep, and we can't digest the food we eat well without sleep. Likewise,
exercise is equally important. Not only does it make our blood circulate
more efficiently through our bodies, bringing the chemicals of life to
the cells and removing the debris of metabolism, but regular exercise
also benefits the mind.

Sleep Less, Eat More A lack of sleep has actually been associated with
junk food cravings, confused food desires, and weight gain. In one
study, people who were deprived of just one night's sleep spent more
money on MAD food-like products loaded with empty calories and bought
more grams of food, in a mock supermarket, the following day. The
researchers also found higher levels of a hormone that increases hunger,
ghrelin, in the blood of the participants who lost one night's sleep.2
Thus a lack of sleep can potentially make you hungrier, increasing your
risk of unhealthy weight gain. Other studies have supported this
finding, with a significant correlation between sleep deprivation and
obesity.3 Indeed, scientists widely acknowledge that sleep deprivation
impairs selfcontrol and higher levels of self-reflection, self-control,
and decision

making.4 For instance, evidence from fMRI scans shows how a lack of
sleep impacts higher-order thinking by specifically reducing activity in
the frontal lobe region of the brain, an area that is important for
controlling thinking and making complex choices.5 In fact, when you
worship, pray, and meditate, this area fires up.6 And just as worship
feeds our spirits, so food feeds our brains and bodies. The more we
focus on God and the more we sleep, the more we will be inclined to
follow a healthy diet, have healthy thinking, and have bodies and brains
that work as they ought to work. We need to be still and know that God
is God (Ps. 46:10). Indeed, social jet lag---a syndrome related to the
mismatch between the body's internal clock and the harsh realities of
our daily schedules---is also believed to be a contributing factor to
today's obesity epidemic by upsetting our sleeping patterns.7 Although
our brains like the speedy rush of modern-day life, as we saw earlier,
we need to learn to do busy well, which means sleeping well, not just
for our digestion but for our mental and physical health in general.
There is also mounting evidence that sleep issues disturb neuroendocrine
control of appetite, leading to overeating, which can decrease insulin
and/or increase insulin resistance, both pathways to type 2 diabetes.8
Our brains change after chronic sleep deprivation, which in turn
influences how much we eat and how well our metabolism functions to
digest and use the food we eat---it affects the whole body.9 Ultimately,
the combination of hunger and poor decision making can create the
"perfect storm" when it comes to our daily food choices.10 Keeping a
regular sleep pattern is therefore really important for good thinking
habits and good food choices.

Get off Your Bottom We all know we need to move. We are designed to
move, for the sake of both the brain and body. Exercise potentially
improves all areas of cognitive function, including thinking, learning,
and memory, especially with age. In children, exercise is incredibly
important for memory development. Yet the older you get, the more you
need to move on a daily basis, even if it is in short bursts or power
walking up those stairs instead of going in the elevator.11 Add worship,
prayer, and constant internal dialogue with the

Holy Spirit, and you have the winning formula: you get better and wiser
with age!12 Our overall ability to think and understand through
intellectualizing and shifting through our thoughts is improved with
exercise, regardless of our age. Physical activity increases blood flow
to the anterior cingulate cortex (deep inside the middle of the brain),
which is activated when we shift between thoughts in a flexible
manner.13 Not only are we better able to form memories when we move but
we also improve communication between these memories, facilitating deep
understanding. Adding to these benefits, certain hormones, which are
increased during exercise, help improve memory and thinking. These
hormones are growth factors called brainderived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1).14 In fact, people who exercised often improved
their memory performance and showed greater increase in brain blood flow
to the hippocampus, the key brain region that deals with converting
short- to long-term memory and is particularly affected by Alzheimer's
disease.15 In short, your brain loves exercise! A growing body of
research indicates that it is aerobic exercise such as power walking and
cardio, not just physical activity in general, which specifically leads
to improved and flexible cognition.16 Unhealthy lifestyle habits, such
as the MAD diet with little or no exercise, will actually speed up the
process of senescence (cell death), and, in turn, the release of
damaging substances from dying cells. These substances unfortunately
increase the toxic load in the body and brain and are responsible for
early aging.17 Exercise, on the other hand, can help prevent or delay
cell death.18 Physical activity essentially changes our DNA for the
better. The epigenetic pattern of genes that affect fat storage in the
body actually changes with exercise---the more we move, the better our
bodies get at using and storing fat. Remember, from chapter 15, how the
methyl groups on genes can be influenced in various ways, through
exercise, diet, and lifestyle, in a process known as DNA methylation?
Researchers have found that when we exercise, epigenetic changes occur
in 7,000 of the 20,000 to 25,000 genes, with positive changes in genes
linked to type 2 diabetes and obesity!19 Other studies have shown that
when we exercise, our body almost immediately experiences genetic
activation that increases the production of fat-busting proteins.20 So
thinking well, eating well, and physical exercise are therefore
necessary to maintain a healthy body weight and lifestyle.

Although exercise fads come and go, the main thing to remember is to
stay off your bottom as much as possible!21 Find out what works well for
your body type, and maintain a disciplined exercise schedule. The mind
dominates over everything, as I have mentioned throughout this book. So
when you exercise, put your mind behind it.

So How Exactly Do I Change? You are more than your biology. You have the
mind of Christ and are a conqueror in him. You can renew your mind. You
can change your life, including your eating patterns, so that you are a
good steward of not only your own body but the rest of creation too. Yet
with all the information presented in the past two sections, what does
this change look like in real, everyday life? Where do you even begin?
Part 3 is filled with practical tips, both physical and mental, to help
you start your journey to health---spirit, soul, and body. I've also
provided twentyone of my family's favorite recipes to get you back into
the kitchen and reignite your love affair with real, whole foods. Bon
appétit!

BEAT IT!

20 Twelve Tips to Beat It

What do I eat? Where do I buy my food? Do I ever "cheat"? What are the
foods I avoid? What foods do I eat a lot of? How do I cook my food? It
seems as if not a day goes by that I do not have someone asking me about
food. My answer is simple. It is not so much about eating or avoiding
specific foods for your mental and physical health; it is all about
thinking right and eating real food. It is a completely "renewed"
lifestyle, and it starts in your head (Rom. 12:2). As we saw in part 2,
the brain controls the body but the mind controls the brain. And for the
mind to function optimally, it needs to be controlled by your choices,
which in turn need to be led by the Holy Spirit. Eating right begins
with following the wisdom of God's Word. In this chapter, I shall
summarize the fundamental principles outlined in parts 1 and 2 into
practical, mind-driven lifestyle tips that will help you beat the MAD
food system we are all confronted with today. I have also included a
selection of my favorite recipes, twenty-one in total, to get you
started on your journey. Since it takes twenty-one days to begin
reforming neural pathways in the brain, these recipes serve as a habit
"kick-starter." They do not need to be followed to the letter---if you
want to change them, find alternatives, or create your own, go for it!
Indeed, a true love of food comes from experimenting in the
kitchen---whether the experiment fails or succeeds. If you can only do
one recipe a day, that is perfectly fine. The key is to renew the way
you think about food and thereby renew your food choices. I am not
offering an overnight, quick-fix, magic-bullet, or reductionist
solution. I am not going to tell you it will be easy and that everything
will

start going right in your life. Although the mind can change (remember
our neuroplasticity), true change requires hard work and consistent
perseverance. I can, however, guarantee that if you choose to make this
long-term commitment to changing your food lifestyle, you will be amazed
at the results. I am not going to give you a fish. I am going to teach
you to fish, so you can think good thoughts and eat real food, just as
God intended, thereby reaping long-term benefits for you, your family,
future generations, and our beautiful planet.

Tip 1: Develop a Real Food Mindset Our brains and bodies function well
when we eat real food, since it is full of the essential nutrients
needed to maintain everyday biological processes. Real food helps us
think well. Memorize the criteria for real food: 1. It is largely whole
and unprocessed, and all "processing," such as roasting, baking, or
preserving, should be done in a kitchen. 2. It is free of synthetic
chemicals, both when grown and when prepared. 3. It is predominantly
local, fresh, and varies according to the seasons. 4. It is grown in an
ecologically diverse environment, which maintains the health of the
ecosystem and thus the nutritional content of the foods. 5. It is as
wild and sustainable as possible, both in terms of produce and meat. 6.
It is processed in a way that treats both the people and animals
involved humanely and respects the way animals are meant to eat
(grass-fed beef, for instance). 7. It contains just one or a few
recognizable ingredients. 8. It does not require a complicated label or
make eye-catching health claims. 9. It can rot (with the exception of
honey and other natural foods that do not expire in a short amount of
time).

10. It is fairly traded. Food production takes a lot of work, and we
should respect the individuals who grow our food as much as we would
like them to respect us as customers. Find as many products as possible
in your pantry that fulfill these criteria, and compare them with the
products in your pantry that cannot be classified as real food. Avoid
purchasing these products in the future. Find as many products as
possible that fulfill these criteria when you go to the store, farmers'
market, or any other establishment that sells food. If they do not
fulfill the criteria, avoid purchasing them. Think about what you are
buying and make deliberate, health-based food choices rather than
following your cravings. Prepare a delicious meal, using real food!
Before saying grace, think of the way it was grown, raised, and
prepared; how it got to your plate; and how eating this food allows you
to be a good steward of God's creation. Pray with a real food mindset.

Tip 2: You Are, and You Become, What You Think Your mind controls your
brain and your brain controls your body. If you want a healthy body, you
need a healthy mind. You are, and you become, what you think.

1.  Reexamine Rather Than React The first, and loudest, unprocessed
    signal/information coming in through your five senses will dominate
    your mind if you permit it to, such as a flashing fast-food sign or
    the smell of popcorn at the movies. It is the signal that has had
    the most sensory information and the strongest emotions attached to
    it. It will dominate other signals. This loudest signal may be an
    internal existing memory or an external sensory input or both, yet
    allowing it to dominate your conscious thinking and choosing can be
    dangerous for your mental and physical health. For example, if your
    first reaction to a soda commercial is a feeling of contentment and
    desire for the good life, practice reexamining your motive for
    reaching for that soda.

As you think about, shop for, and plan your meals, become aware of what
signals and information are coming into your mind. Become aware of what
memories are popping up from your nonconscious mind in response to this
information. You may, for instance, have an existing memory such as Real
food costs too much and takes too much time. Remind yourself of the true
cost of cheap food and the true cost of convenience, discussed in part
1.

2.  Take Those Thoughts into Captivity If you randomly allow any thought
    into your mind, and do not bring those thoughts into captivity,
    damage can ensue on a mental and physical level. If you are not
    selectively paying attention to what you are thinking about when it
    comes to food and eating, then you will become reactive and driven
    by whatever thoughts (and their dynamic emotional energy) come into
    your mind. Don't allow the fast-food thought to stay in your mind,
    for example, because then you will want to eat fast food. The
    apostle Paul wrote that we have to bring all thoughts into captivity
    to Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 10:5). All means all. Never let any thought
    go unchecked through your mind. This goes for everything, including
    what and how you eat. Bring those thoughts into captivity: when you
    are about to make a foodrelated choice, ask the Holy Spirit what you
    need to buy, grow, or eat. Ask yourself whether the food choice you
    are about to make fulfills the criteria of real food. Discipline
    your mind.

3.  Take the Time to Process Sensory Information Deep critical thinking,
    which I have researched for years, involves asking, answering, and
    discussing incoming sensory information and existing internal
    thoughts as they move into the conscious mind. This means we
    consider all the options from as detached and informed a position as
    possible. This is what it means to think objectively, or in quantum
    physics terms, get into superposition. Superposition involves
    stopping, standing back, observing our own thoughts and the
    information coming in through the five senses, setting up a dialogue
    with the Holy Spirit, considering all the options, and then choosing
    which thoughts we want to implant in our nonconscious mind. This is
    discussed in depth in chapter 10.

There are a number of options we can choose, just as there are a number
of dishes we can choose to eat! These options are called probabilities.
The large group of options or probabilities we can choose from is called
Schrödinger's probability wave.1 This is a quantum physics principle
named after Austrian scientist Erwin Schrödinger.2 It is a way of
mathematically describing all the probable choices we could make, when
in superposition, about all the information we come across and every
issue we face, including what we put on our plates---even the
information offered in this book.3 We should think carefully and
deliberately about all the information we encounter and ask a lot of
questions! Just because a professional dietician or "expert" calls
something a fact does not mean it is a fact. Likewise, when you are
about to make a food-related decision, ask yourself why you are eating
and why you want to eat a particular food. Are you really hungry? Are
you just craving a snack or something sweet? Are you bored? Happy? Sad?
Why? How will you feel later if you indulge now? Do not act reactively.

4.  Choose Life Choice is single-handedly the most powerful and creative
    part of the human mind. As soon as we choose, we collapse a
    probability into an actuality.4 Schrödinger's probability wave
    therefore goes hand in hand with the observer effect, another
    quantum physics law, which states that it is the observer outside of
    the system (you and me, for example) who collapses probabilities
    into actualities. This simply means that it is through our choices
    that things happen. Nothing happens until we choose. This is the
    powerful, sound mind God has given us (2 Tim. 1:7). We set the
    observer effect in motion each time we think and make a food choice.
    We have to understand that choice is real and will have real
    consequences, which is why Deuteronomy 30:19 is so powerful: "I call
    heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set
    before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose
    life, that both you and your descendants may live" (emphasis added).
    It is imperative that we become informed, so that we do not become a
    "my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge" statistic (Hosea
    4:6). Ask yourself if your food choices will be based on health and
    life or on sickness and death. Choose life.

Tip 3: My Brain Didn't Make Me Do It Remember that the brain and mind
are separate, and the mind controls the brain. We have to take personal
responsibility for the way we think, speak, and act. We need to stop
being victims of our biology, of what happens to us, and start being
victors. A neurocentric view of thought is, My brain is in control and
made me do it, or My brain scan shows I have an overactive amygdala, so
it is hard for me to control my emotions and that is why I cannot
control my eating. Once you start down this path, you will ultimately
have to question your belief in free will, since a predominant focus on
the brain takes the control away from the individual and places the
blame squarely on the brain. I do not deny that very real changes will
happen in the brain when we lead a toxic eating and thinking lifestyle,
nor do I deny the fact that some individuals do have damaged brains
through no fault of their own. Yet for the most part our minds (our
thoughts and choices) come first and cause problems in the brain and
body, which in turn feed back into the mind, making us feel awful if our
mind is toxic. The only way weight will come off, and stay off, is
through our minds: when we plant healthy food "trees" in our heads, we
will eat healthy food in reality. To help with this I recommend my
twenty-one-day brain detox.5 Do not blame your biology: your mind
controls your brain. Regardless of your circumstances, you can change
the way you think about and eat food. This does not mean you can eat
every single type of food and not get a reaction. It does, however, mean
that you can stop eating the MAD diet, and you can choose to follow a
real food way of eating. Take responsibility for your food
choices---past, present, and future. Food addiction is not a disease.
Our brains are wired to latch on to something, and that something is
God. Any toxic addiction, whether it be food, drugs, or even a person,
is the result of misplaced choice. Yet, as a growing body of research
shows, the majority of people can quit addictions. Individuals who stay
addicts usually subscribe to the biomedical model of "once an addict,
always an addict." Yet God came to set us free, not lock us in (Luke
4:18). Do not make food your idol, nor any other created thing. It will
always disappoint you, but God never will. Never forget that you are
more than a toxic addiction. Even thinking I can't give up soda is a
toxic addiction resulting from choice. The toxic

choices you may have made in the past do not define you. Your identity
is in Christ alone (Gen. 1:27; 1 Cor. 6:17; 12:27; Gal. 3:27--28; Col.
2:9--10). The more you align your thinking with God, the more you will
find eating correctly to be both possible and sustainable. We experience
true reward when we do things God's way, for his glory, including eating
correctly. Faith is the substance (what we choose to wire into our
brains) and the evidence (the physical thought that is built as a result
of our thinking and choosing) of all that we are hoping for, which leads
to physical changes in our brains and bodies (Heb. 11:1). Have faith in
your ability to change your eating habits.

Tip 4: Change Habits over Sixty-Three Days As I discussed in chapter 10,
it takes around twenty-one days to rewire neural pathways and begin
building a new way of thinking about food and forty-two days (another
two sets of twenty-one days, for a total of sixtythree days) to
establish a new habit. The talk between the conscious and nonconscious
mind requires discipline and practice, but if you put the above tips
into action for just seven minutes a day, within three weeks you will
have removed a toxic food habit and built a new way of thinking about
and eating food---through your choices and perseverance! Here is an
example: for dinner tonight, prepare a pasture-raised chicken from the
local farmstead, farmers' market, grocery store, or your
community-supported agriculture (CSA) box instead of choosing that
convenient take-out chicken sandwich from the fast-food establishment
down the road. (One of our favorite soup recipes with chicken can be
found in the recipe section, if you want a delicious suggestion.) Think
about why you are preparing dinner, what care went into your food before
it hit your plate, the care you used to prepare it, and how thankful to
God you are to have this food and the nourishment it will provide. Think
about why you are preparing this meal and the positive eating habits you
are establishing. Think about how your brain and body are benefitting.
You are changing your epigenetics and your genetics by your choices!
Think about how wonderful God is, who has given us such magnificent
food, and the pleasure of eating well and enjoying good health. Perhaps
discuss these

thoughts with your loved ones at the dinner table and definitely enjoy
your meal! This is real grace. You will have to do this thinking at
least once a day for a minimum of seven minutes over sixty-three days,
when you are shopping, eating, or doing anything food-related, to
establish a new habit. Remember, you are rewiring commercials,
advertisements, billboards, tastes, and other sensory information that
you would on average have seen sixteen times a day, or 5,900 times per
year. It is going to take a further two cycles of twenty-one days
(forty-two more days, for a total of sixty-three days) to make these new
food choices a lifestyle habit. Practice these kinds of choices daily
for sixty-three days. You are literally creating a new eating lifestyle,
based on life, through the principle of renewing your mind (Rom. 12:2).
True change will take time and commitment. You have to choose to change.
Constantly thinking about something or listening to something creates
genetic change, and learning takes place. This happens---whether you
like it or not---when we are constantly exposed to MAD food or real
food. New thoughts become entrenched and implanted in your nonconscious
mind. Be aware of what thoughts you are planting in your mind. Do they
lead to life or death?

Tip 5: Evaluate Your Emotions and Attitude Remember, the mind and the
gut are intensely interconnected. The GI tract is very sensitive to our
emotions and works closely with the hypothalamus in the brain, which
responds to our emotions and the feeling of satiety. Yet emotional
awareness in terms of your food choices goes beyond the gutbrain
connection: a healthy emotional thought life is necessary to make every
food-related decision, including what to buy. Emotions, choices, and
actions cannot be separated, since they are part of the perfect circle
of thinking in your mind, which in turn impacts your entire body. Your
thoughts, with their associated emotions, determine what you choose to
eat: you are what you eat and what you think. Beware of how you are
feeling when you make a food choice; become a strict observer of your
emotions. Do not eat when you are upset, jealous, bitter, angry, or
experiencing any other negative emotions. These will affect your
digestion. Do not eat just because you are happy or excited. This, too,

is an emotional form of eating. Make sure that you are hungry as well,
as ridiculous as this may sound. Eat in a deliberative and intentional,
not reactive, way. Do not grab the ice-cream tub when you are stressed
or upset, for example (even if it is organic, local, and grass-fed!).
Calm down, and perhaps enjoy a bowl later with your loved one.
Deliberative, intentional eating requires that you deeply think about
your food choices and the linked emotions when shopping for, preparing,
and eating food. Make sure these decisions are based on positive
emotions: love, gratitude, hope, happiness, contentment, satisfaction,
excitement, peace, and similar emotions are the perfect condiments to
any meal. If you are stressed, view the situation as a challenge to
overcome, not a threat to overwhelm. Stress is designed to work for you
and not against you ---including in your digestion. How you view a
situation will determine this. Do not let toxic stress get the better of
you---you can control how you react by your choices. Fear of food is
also a negative emotion. Fearing fat, just like fearing carbohydrates or
gluten or salt or sugar, is not the right way to approach a healthy
diet. Instead, we should fear the way our current industrial food system
has transformed our foods into MAD food-like products. It does us good
to remember that official dietary recommendations are not always
reliable, based on the latest scientific research, or bias-free, and
should never just be taken at face value. Being obsessed about healthy
eating and panicking about what you eat will also affect your ability to
digest food---no matter how healthy it is! If you bake a chocolate cake
(with real whole foods, of course), enjoy it! As Oscar Wilde notes,
"Everything in moderation, including moderation."6 We were created to
enjoy our food, which is a gift from God. Get "dressed" mentally for
dinner. Before eating, listen to your favorite song, watch your favorite
movie, or read your favorite book. Talk to a loved one. Pay it forward
with a random act of kindness. Put on your favorite song and dance like
no one is watching. Read the Bible and think of how much you have to be
grateful for. Whatever you love, whatever makes you happy, do it; this
will get a whole host of positive chemicals running about your body and
prepare you for a great meal.

Tip 6: There Is No One Diet As we saw in part 1, there is no one
particular way of eating that works for everyone. God created fat,
carbohydrates, and proteins, as well as all the other important
nutritional building blocks that make up the food we eat--- all
perfectly and intricately balanced within the real foods we eat. Stick
to real foods, and avoid the MAD diet and diet fads. Learn to listen to
what your body needs. To help identify what your body uniquely needs,
plan to do a fast. (See chapter 12 for more on fasting.) Start with
intermittent fasting (skipping a meal), giving up a specific type of
food or drink for ten or more days, or something like the Daniel Fast.7
If you have been eating the MAD diet, your brain and body will be
confused by all the food-like products you have been consuming. Fasting
helps clear the confusion in your brain and body. When you add a type of
food back to your diet after several days, you can see how your body
responds to it. (Obviously, if you have allergies, first consult with a
medical professional.) The different types of fasting are excellent
lifestyle choices for our brain, body, and mental health, and, of
course, have many spiritual benefits. As we discipline our mind and
choose to reduce our bodily food intake as we focus on God, our spirit
develops. Jesus wants us to be integrated spirit, soul, and body (1
Thess. 5:23). Any diet that promises instant results should come under
our intellectual radar. Real, permanent change always takes time and
effort. Do not expect immediate results. Do expect difficult days. But
always remember that you are more than a conqueror through Christ, with
whom all things are possible.

Tip 7: Buying Food When purchasing any food item, make sure it is real
food insofar as possible, not a food-like product. Try to shop outside
of the supermarket: visit local CSAs, farmers' markets, and farmstead
stores, or start growing or raising your own food. Get to know the
people who produce your food: ask them questions and learn the story
behind your food. Generally avoid food producers who are

evasive about how the food is grown, raised, or made, or do not allow
visitors (such as on a farm). Ask your local and seasonal food producers
what they have a lot of, and buy it. This helps prevent food waste and
supports local businesses. Buy local, organically produced foods: they
support your community and ecosystem and they reduce fossil fuel use, as
well as ensuring that you get food that is as fresh, synthetic
chemical--free, and nutritious as possible, especially in terms of fresh
produce. Buy whole foods, such as wheat grains and whole produce, which
can be "processed" in your kitchen. You will also find that buying whole
foods and processing them at home can be a cheap way to make your diet
healthy. Potato chips, for instance, can cost \$8 per pound, where an
heirloom potato variety at a farmers' market costs less than half that.8
If you eat out, support establishments that serve local, farm-to-table,
and organically produced foods as much as possible. If you visit a
grocery store, be aware of the structured environment and how the layout
is designed to grab your attention and get you to buy and eat more
processed MAD foods. Healthier products are often put close to the
bottom of the shelves, while the healthiest foods are on the perimeter,
such as fresh produce. The center aisles are usually filled with
processed and refined MAD foods. And remember, avoid impulse buys at the
counter! Buy wild foods: these are generally more nutritious and make a
meal both exciting and impressive. This tip applies to all food types.
If you buy animal products, they should ideally be pasture-raised or
grass-fed (aim for 100 percent grass-fed, not just grass-finished),
organically raised, free of added hormones or antibiotics, and always
humanely raised. It is a good idea to buy these meats in bulk and freeze
them for future use. Often several individuals buy shares in a whole
animal from a local farm. Try to avoid purchasing too much muscle meat:
go for bone broths, organ meats, and other parts of the animal that are
more nutrient dense. Buy a diverse range of foods. If you try to shop as
seasonally as possible, you often eat a more varied diet. Farmers'
markets are particularly good places to begin. Japanese turnip and
kohlrabi with your heirloom purple potatoes, anyone? Buying bulk in
season, and freezing or preserving the foods, can save time and money.
For example, buy berries or tomatoes in the summer when

they are widely available and less expensive, and freeze or puree them
for the winter months. Try to buy whole nuts, seeds, and grains and
process them at home. For example, make your own wheat flour for your
own homemade bread, or make your own almond milk. There are countless
recipes online for free. If you buy bread, make sure it is fresh, whole
grain, with optimally a few simple and well-known ingredients---it
should start going stale after a day. Buy fats that are unrefined,
unfiltered, extra-virgin (when possible), and cold-processed. Remember,
"If it ain't decomposing in your kitchen, it ain't decomposing in your
tummy." Avoid all food that does not rot (with certain exceptions, such
as honey). Avoid MAD foods, foods with added nutrients, and/or foods
that make health claims. Think of an apple: Does it have any health
claims plastered on its skin?

Tip 8: Respect the Environment The apostle Paul declares, "Whether you
eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God" (1 Cor.
10:31 NIV). As stewards of God's creation, we glorify him when we
steward the earth's resources well and we eat food that nourishes us and
glorifies the creation of our own bodies. Before you purchase any food,
think deeply about how that food was produced. If you purchase it, ask
yourself whether you are stewarding God's creation well. Each day, make
an effort to think about how the food in your basket or on your plate
got there. Perhaps say a prayer for the people who produced it, and
thank God for the opportunity to glorify his creation with your food.
Volunteer at a local farm, farmers' market, farmstead store, or CSA, or
start a garden and begin raising chickens. By coming face-to-face with
your food, you will develop a deeper appreciation for God's creation and
the gift of life. Think of ways you can reduce food waste. Compost
leftover foods or regrow vegetables from food scraps, for example. Start
raising chickens and feed them kitchen scraps as a supplement to their
diet. See Folks, This Ain't Normal: A Farmer's Advice for Happier Hens,
Healthier People, and a

Better World by Joel Salatin and Waste: Uncovering the Global Food
Scandal by Tristram Stuart for more suggestions. Think of ways you can
vote not only with your fork but with your political vote as well. Get
involved in grassroots movements that promote local, sustainable,
agroecological farming methods. Get in touch with your local and state
representatives to fight for a better food system. Send letters to the
government officials handling dietary guidelines. There are many, many
ways you can make a more sustainable food system a reality for not only
you but every person on the planet, while stewarding God's creation well
and bringing "heaven to earth." Be a "hipster" and start an
agroecological garden, or even a farm---even if you have just one
chicken and a zucchini shrub in the beginning. As is often said, "Little
by little, one travels far."

Tip 9: How to Cook Often, diet books are so concerned about what you eat
that they do not explain how you should prepare these meals to preserve
the most nutrients possible. Cooking is not just about nutrient
preservation, however; it also entails the bioavailability of nutrients,
or how readily these nutrients can be absorbed. The following points are
cooking tips we use as a family. 1. Some vegetables are better eaten
raw, such as lettuce greens, while other vegetables are better eaten
cooked, such as carrots and tomatoes. For a full list of fruit and
vegetable preparation, see Eating on the Wild Side by Jo Robinson. 2.
Eat your produce with a type of fat, in order to absorb the fat-soluble
nutrients. 3. There are several main factors in terms of nutrient loss
and cooking: heat, duration of cooking time, amount of water, amount of
fat in the food, direct or indirect sources of heat used, and type of
fuel used.9 Be aware of this as you cook any food. For instance,
overcooking at high temperatures activates the Maillard reaction, when
glucose and protein molecules bind at high temperatures. This is toxic
because it forms AGEs (advanced glycation end products).10 In turn, this
changes the structure of a protein, potentially making it a problem for

the body to digest, assimilate, and metabolize, with negative health
effects such as the possible development of cancer.11 Most processed
foods in the MAD are heated to very high temperatures and for long
lengths of time---one more reason to stay clear of them!12 4. Ideally,
cook vegetables in a soup, sous-vide in silicone bags (a water bath
method), stew in a slow cooker, poach, or steam them.13 Occasionally
roast or sauté---although avoid high temperatures with long cooking
times. We usually roast vegetables for a maximum of twenty to thirty
minutes, or sauté them for just a minute in a small amount of fat
(coconut oil, olive oil, lard, grass-fed butter, or ghee) after steaming
on medium-low heat. We do not boil our fruit or vegetables, as the
nutrients can leech out into the water.14 5. For meat, steaming, a
sous-vide method, and cooking in soups, stews, and broths on low heat
are healthier options. Avoid direct and open sources of heat as much as
possible.15 Open-flame grills can be carcinogenic, especially if you
like your meat well done, which can produce potentially carcinogenic
levels of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), for instance.16 To get a crispy exterior, you can
quickly sauté or grill the meat, constantly turning it over the source,
after you have used one of the methods above. We have the occasional
roast chicken, ham, beef, turkey, or lamb, which will braise in an
acidic liquid such as lemon juice or wine (see below), and bake in
parchment paper or in a covered roasting dish. 6. Acids, such as vinegar
and lemon juice, also reduce the risk of unwanted cooking side effects,
so use them when cooking all types of food.17 They are also great for
flavor! 7. In terms of nuts, beans, seeds, and grains, soaking and
sprouting may be better options than regular whole grains, both in terms
of digestibility and nutrient content and nutrient bioavailability.18 We
as a family personally do not experience any additional benefit from
soaking or sprouting our quinoa. My daughters, however, do feel that
sprouted nuts and beans are more digestible. You may feel otherwise.
They can be expensive, so sprout them at home to save money (there are
many online resources showing how to do this).

8. Avoid artificial additives, seasonings, and preservatives when
cooking. Sodium in salt is a necessary nutrient, and a deficiency in
sodium can harm your health as much as an excess of sodium can, yet it
should form part of a balanced real food diet. You will find that local,
fresh, organically produced, and seasonal foods do not need salt to
replace flavor (unlike the MAD foods). Rather, salt such as Himalayan
pink salt and black lava salt, in moderate amounts, enhances rather than
replaces the beautiful flavors of these real foods. 9. Use a separate
cutting board for meat than you use for produce and grains. 10. Do not
wash your meat---this can spread germs around the kitchen. But always
wash your hands, before and after handling meat! We generally take meat
out of the package with a fork and try to handle the raw meat with our
bare hands as little as possible. 11. Thoroughly wash all your produce
items. Salad spinners and fruit and vegetable sprays are indispensable
in the kitchen. 12. Use pots, pans, and dishes that are free of heavy
metals, PFOA, and PTFE, as these chemicals can have adverse health
effects.19 We use stainless steel and ceramic cookware, or nonstick
cookware that is free of heavy metals, PFOA, and PTFE. 13. As Michael
Pollan notes, "Treat treats as treats."20 For the most part, if we crave
something sweet we will eat some fruit. On occasion, we love a good
dessert, prepared with delicious real food. For a recipe suggestion, try
our apple pie recipe---you won't regret it! 14. Of course, it goes
without saying that you should eat lots of vegetables and fruits.

Tip 10: How to Eat Our fast-paced modern lifestyles have produced the
mindset of I am too busy to sit down to a home-cooked meal. If you value
your health and your relationships, begin changing this mindset. A
home-cooked family meal has more benefits than just bodily health!
Modern technology has made it easier in many respects for us to work all
the time. Do not fall into the trap of living under an unnecessary sense
of

urgency, which can put you in chronic toxic stress and make you
ill---and give you terrible indigestion. Remember the gut-brain
connection! Eat less from a box and eat less in front of a box: avoid
TV, reading, or listening to the radio while eating. These forms of
entertainment make you pay less attention to how you are eating and how
much you are eating. The joy of preparing a meal and sharing it with
people is incredibly powerful and therapeutic. Do not view cooking as a
task; see it as a fun adventure and an opportunity to spend time with
those you love, family and friends, as much as is possible in your
lifestyle. Eat slowly. If we eat too fast we will eat more, since it
takes up to twenty minutes for our body and brain to signal satiation
and for us to realize we are no longer hungry.21 Make sure that most of
your meals last more than twenty minutes. And remember, the first two
bites of any food are the most flavorful, so take time to enjoy them!
Hara hachi bu! Take this Okinawan saying to heart: stop eating when you
are 80 percent full.22 Eighty percent is not a strict calculation per
se---it just means that if you feel quite full, you have eaten too much.
It is based on calorie restriction and, paired with fasting, can help
maintain a healthy lifestyle. The Okinawans live in one of the seven
identified "blue zones"--- areas that have the highest life
expectancy---and thus their advice is worth taking to heart. The key is
eating less, which will be different for everyone. We have somewhat
adapted this saying in our house: only seconds for salad, or you will
make a hara hachi "boo boo." Avoid snacking, as your body will not have
had time to digest your previous meals and you may end up eating too
much.23 Generally, eat when you are hungry, which requires that you
learn to listen to your body's demands. Limiting your food intake to
three meals a day is a good start. If you overeat, you will carry on
eating---the more you eat the less able you are to judge how much you
have eaten. Let your mind, not your eyes, be your guide---it is not a
good idea to decide visually how much to eat, since you will have a
tendency to finish what is on the plate rather than stopping when
full.24 Put less food on your plate or use a smaller plate. Be aware of
habits you may have developed over time, such as eating when you are sad
or excited (but not hungry), or coming home and going straight to the
fridge or pantry out of habit (even if you are not hungry).

Prepare and eat meals together as a family and/or with friends as much
as possible. Not only will this help your health but it has added
benefits for your children: research shows that family time over meals
is associated with lower drug and alcohol abuse, less depression and
suicide risk, and even better grades in school.25 Moreover, good company
is associated with positive emotions, which aid digestion and promote
mental wellbeing. Do not eat in your car and on the run. Make your
eating habits as deliberate as your thinking habits. Also, your posture
is important to digestion, whether you are at the table or going about
your daily tasks.26 Pay attention to the way you sit and stand. Whoever
cooks should not clean, if possible---divide the tasks and the work will
be finished in a shorter amount of time. You can even draw lots; it
certainly makes mealtime fun.

Tip 11: Sleep, Schedules, and Digestion The brain and the gut are
connected in many things, including sleep and schedules. Healthy
sleeping patterns contribute to healthy eating patterns. Do not go to
sleep worrying about your circumstances; this can upset your sleep
cycle, digestion, and weight. Hand all your issues over to God--- even
if unsolved---and fall asleep quoting a Scripture or thinking of all the
good things that have happened to you or anything that makes you happy
and feel at peace. Write your cares down before you sleep and read the
promises in God's Word. A good Scripture to memorize is 1 Peter 5:7:
"Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you" (NLT).
Give him your fears. Everyone has their own sleep cycle, a cycle that is
as unique as everything else about them. You have to sleep---that is a
no-brainer---but there is no agreement among scientists on exactly how
much sleep you need or when you should sleep. You will do damage to your
health if you worry about your sleep, wondering what will happen and
then panicking that you are not getting exactly eight hours of sleep and
are not going to digest your food properly and will get sick and fat and
have brain damage. These fears will cause more brain damage and worsen
your sleep pattern, so just relax, read the Bible, and pray if you
cannot sleep. Even start a discussion with the Holy Spirit about
whatever you want to talk about.

Give your eating habits over to God each night before you sleep. Ask him
to guide your food decisions. Pray over your brain and your body before
you go to sleep. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you with your schedule. You
are designed to "do busy well," but only if this "busy" is led by God.
Not doing busy well will affect your sleeping patterns and your food
choices, including how much you eat, since a lack of sleep is associated
with a greater intake of food the next day. Healthy, peaceful sleeping
patterns and balanced schedules mean you will eat well, and this will
help maintain good health.

Tip 12: Exercise Eat less, move more: we have all heard this saying at
some point in our lives. Not only does exercise make our blood circulate
more efficiently through our bodies, bringing the chemicals of life to
the cells and removing the debris of metabolism, but it can also improve
all areas of cognitive function, including thinking, learning, and
memory, especially with age. The older you get the more you need to
move, even if it is for short bursts or just walking up those stairs
instead of going in the elevator. Research indicates that aerobic
exercise in particular (such as cardio and walking) creates improved and
flexible cognition and maintains good bodily health. When you exercise,
your cognition becomes more flexible, your metabolism increases, and
great hormones flow! Remember, however, that exercise can never make up
for unhealthy food choices. Both regular physical activity and a healthy
real food diet are necessary for a healthy lifestyle. Unhealthy
lifestyle habits, such as the MAD "TV" diet with little or no exercise,
will speed up the process of senescence, or cell death. As you are
running, power walking, spinning, doing high-intensity training, lifting
weights, or whatever you choose to do, these exercises are changing your
DNA, hormones, brain, and your entire body for the better. And to
enhance your exercise routine, you can add a cup of organic, freshly
roasted, fair-trade and whole bean coffee. Coffee can change your
genetic expression in the same way exercise does---but obviously does
not replace exercise.27 Your mind makes exercise much more effective.
After all, exercise is a choice you make with your mind, so when you
exercise, put your mind

behind it! Be as deliberative about your exercise habits as you are
about your eating habits.

Avocado-Cilantro Hummus 1 med

ripe avocado, peeled and pitted

1 cup ¼ cup 2 Tbs

chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed fresh cilantro
(coriander), chopped freshly squeezed lemon juice

1 tsp pinch ½ tsp

freshly squeezed lime juice lemon zest cumin salt and fresh ground
pepper to taste clove fresh garlic, minced chili pepper, finely chopped
and seeded (optional) tahini (homemade is always the most flavorful)
nutritional yeast (optional) cayenne pepper

1 1 3 Tbs 1 tsp dash

Blend all ingredients together in a food processor or strong blender
until creamy. Add a little water if needed. Serve with fresh, seasonal
raw vegetables such as carrots, bell peppers, celery, and cucumber;
homemade pita bread (whole grain or grain free); or homemade crackers.
Serve as an appetizer or as lunch or dinner---whatever suits your fancy!
If you want a more interesting taste variation, make your own tahini:
toast raw sesame seeds on low in the oven, grind them into a smooth
paste, then add them to the other ingredients. Or, if you cannot handle
chickpeas, use 1 cup steamed cauliflower or 1 cup diced zucchini
instead. Generally, it is a good idea to experiment with vegetables that
are in season.

Tired of the flavor? Replace the cilantro with fresh chopped parsley,
mint, basil, chives, or oregano---you may have to adjust quantities
depending on your preference. Mint works especially well with preserved
lemons in a hummus. Can't handle the heat? Leave out the chili pepper
and replace the cayenne with a dash of mild paprika (smoked or regular).
Want a sweeter version? Use 1 large roasted red beet instead of
chickpeas and avocado. This version works particularly well with mint or
basil instead of cilantro. To roast beet, preheat oven to 400°F (204°C),
scrub the beet's exterior, put it in a parchment bag, and bake it for 30
minutes or until soft. Peel beet and add to the food processor with
other ingredients. Raw fennel (or anise) is particularly tasty with this
variation. Another tummy-friendly version: replace avocado and chickpeas
with two cups zucchini, chopped, and slowly pour in ¼ cup of olive oil
in a steady, thin stream on low speed (to emulsify) after you have
blended all the other ingredients into a creamy paste. Generally, a
mortar and pestle is a brilliant investment for grinding all herbs
instead of just chopping them: it brings out their flavor perfectly.

hours with the lid off) to create the Bolognese sauce. 4. Meanwhile,
preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Drizzle sweet potato slices with oil or
fat (very, very little or they will be too soggy!) and bake on parchment
paper until soft (about 20 minutes). 5. Combine 1 cup mozzarella,
ricotta, heavy whipping cream, and egg in a saucepan, and cook on
medium-low heat until mozzarella is melted. 6. Layer the lasagna in a
9x13 pan as follows: one-third of the sweet potato "pasta," one-third of
the Bolognese sauce, then half of the ricotta sauce. Repeat. For the
third layer, use remaining sweet potato and Bolognese, then top with
remaining ½ cup mozzarella and Parmesan, which will enable the top to
bake to a light golden layer. Optional: top with any leftover fresh
basil or oregano before placing in the oven. 7. Preheat oven to 350°F
(180°C). Bake the lasagna for 20 minutes, or until the top is a golden
color. In place of the sweet potato, you can use whole-grain or
gluten-free lasagna pasta sheets, or even sliced eggplant, zucchini, or
another vegetable for variation or for a less sweet taste. Experiment
with what is in season. You can use this Bolognese sauce on any kind of
pasta as well, including zucchini pasta. For a vegan Bolognese sauce,
shred carrots, onions, cauliflower, zucchini (or whatever vegetables are
in season) in a food processor to yield about 6 cups. Quickly sauté on
medium-low heat. Add tomatoes and wine and simmer for 45

minutes. For a thicker sauce, add 1 cup of drained and rinsed chickpeas
that have been made into a paste in the food processor, and simmer up to
an hour. Replace the ricotta sauce with a vegan bechamel sauce---there
are many great recipes online and in books. Our personal favorite is
Diana Sanfilippo's sauce in Mediterranean Paleo Cooking. There are many
great recipes online and in books for making and preserving your own
tomato sauces. If you have to buy store bought, aim for organic sauces
in glass jars, BPA-free cans, or boxes that can be reused or recycled.
We use so much tomato sauce that inevitably we run out and have to buy
it from the store during the colder months when tomatoes are not in
season. If you cannot tolerate tomatoes, find a tomato-free marinara
sauce online and use the same quantities. Our favorite with this recipe
is Jenni Hulet's marinara sauce, which you can find on her blog, The
Urban Poser.

Beet and Pink Peppercorn Salmon 1 sm 4 1 2 2 tsp 2 tsp 2 tsp 1 tsp 2 2 1

red beet salmon fillets whole lemon garlic cloves, thinly sliced at an
angle olive oil (or fat of choice) salt and pepper, to taste pink
peppercorns dried hibiscus leaves chickpea miso lemons, juiced shallots,
minced clove garlic, minced

1.  Roast the beet. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C), scrub the beet's
    exterior, put it in a parchment bag, and bake for 30 minutes or
    until soft. Let cool, then peel and dice.
2.  Preheat oven to 320°F (160°C). Grease your baking dish or line it
    with parchment paper. Place salmon fillets side by side in the pan.
    Cut the whole lemon in four quarters, take out the seeds, and
    squeeze the juice over the fish, then drizzle olive oil over and
    sprinkle the sliced garlic and a dash of salt and pepper evenly on
    each fillet. Cover fillets in more parchment paper and bake for
    20--30 minutes. Alternatively, you can place fillets in a parchment
    bag with the lemon quarters and bake them, or steam the salmon. If
    steaming, drizzle with oil, lemon, salt and pepper, and garlic.
    Lemon-infused water also works

particularly well when steaming. A sous vide (with reusable silicone
bags) works well too. 3. While salmon is cooking, put remaining
ingredients (roasted beet, pink peppercorns, hibiscus flowers, chickpea
miso, juice of two lemons, minced shallot, minced garlic, and a dash of
salt) into a food processor or strong blender and blend until creamy. 4.
Drizzle the beet sauce over the salmon and serve with a side dish of
choice. Fennel (anise) works well with this dish. If you are a vegan or
vegetarian, or just do not want fish, this beet and pink peppercorn
sauce pairs well with lightly steamed fennel and quinoa or another whole
grain of choice (we usually toss the quinoa in a bit of olive oil, salt,
and pepper in this recipe). Can't handle chickpeas? Try substituting the
miso with 1 teaspoon of tahini and a dash of coconut aminos (a "soy"
sauce made from coconut rather than soy).

Chicken Vegetable Soup 1 2 3 lg 1 cup 1 cup 1 cup 1 3 10 cups 1 Tbs 2
heaping tsp 1 dash 1 tsp 2 Tbs 1 Tbs 1 Tbs 1 Tbs 1 Tbs

1

yellow onion, diced leeks, chopped zucchini, diced celery, diced
carrots, diced broccoli florets turnip, diced cloves garlic, freshly

apple cider vinegar black pepper cayenne pepper celery seed parsley,
freshly chopped oregano, freshly chopped thyme, freshly chopped basil,
freshly chopped sage, freshly chopped ground coriander, to taste salt,
to taste whole chicken

1.  Add the vegetables to a large pot over medium-low heat (or slow
    cooker on low) with the water or broth.
2.  Add the vinegar, pepper, herbs, and salt to taste, and stir in.

3. Carefully add the whole chicken, and leave on low heat for 6 hours.
4. Remove chicken, let cool slightly, then clean meat from the bones and
return the meat to pot (you can save the chicken carcass to make stock
for future recipes). 5. Serve as-is or blend for a more creamy
consistency. For a vegan/vegetarian version, leave out the chicken, use
water or vegetable stock instead of chicken broth, and add an extra 3
cups of vegetables of choice. Cook for about 1 hour on simmer/low. This
soup can be changed based on what is in season. We usually use whatever
vegetables are growing or we have in our CSA box.

Mustard and Mushroom Chicken Sauté 4

chicken breasts

2 1 1 Tbs

garlic cloves, minced shallot, chopped ghee, or fat of choice

2 cups

fresh mushrooms of choice, chopped salt and pepper to taste fresh sprigs

    mixture. (We use a ceramic waffle iron.) Cook until golden.
3.  Top with your favorite fruits; spices such as cinnamon; proteins to
    make the waffles savory; fats such as nut butters, coconut cream, or
    grass-fed organic cream or butter. Be adventurous! To make the
    waffles savory, omit cinnamon and add another spice, such as cumin,
    if you want!

No-Cook Avocado Oatmeal ¼ cup

oat groats or steel-cut oats, soaked overnight in water

½ 3 Tbs

ripe avocado homemade almond milk or milk of choice

    fat for around 1--2 minutes.
4.  Whisk together egg, onion, chives, salt, and pepper, and add the
    tomatoes.
5.  Put one slice of bacon around the edge of each cupcake (so it will
    wrap around the egg mixture).
6.  Pour egg mixture into the cupcake pan, dividing evenly, and bake for
    around 15--20 minutes. Shredded cheese is a great addition on top,
    if you can tolerate dairy.

Seed Bread ½ cup

raw, shelled pumpkin seeds

    that has been lined with parchment paper. Bake for 20 minutes.
    Rotate the pan and bake for another 50 minutes to an hour. If you
    don't like stevia, replace with 1 tsp coconut nectar, whisked into
    the water and coconut oil. For a crispier toast, switch the oven
    off, slice the baked bread, and leave in the oven for 10--15
    minutes.

cloves nutmeg cinnamon coconut nectar coconut flour vanilla

For the topping:

½ tsp 1 tsp

reserved apple peels ghee or coconut oil lemon zest

3 tsp

coconut sugar

1 tsp

cinnamon

For crust: 1. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). 2. Mix the flours and salt
together. 3. Whisk oil, coconut nectar, eggs, and applesauce together.
4. Carefully add the flour mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon (but do
not overmix, as the dough can get crumbly). Keep a tablespoon or two of
water nearby in case you need to moisten the dough. 5. Line your pie pan
with parchment and pat in the dough. Evenly poke it with a fork and bake
for around 8 minutes, or until golden. For filling: 1. Preheat oven to
350°F (180°C). 2. Melt the ghee or coconut oil in a saucepan over
medium-low heat. Add the apples, spices, and coconut nectar. Mix well,
and leave on the heat for 5 minutes. 3. Mix in coconut flour and leave
on the heat for another 5 minutes. 4. Add vanilla, take off the heat,
and let the mixture cool for 10 minutes. Once cool, pour into the pie
crust and bake for around 8 minutes, until top has crisped slightly. For
topping: 1. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). 2. Toss the apple peels in
the ghee or coconut oil, lemon zest, sugar, and cinnamon.

3. Bake on a cookie sheet for around 12 minutes or until golden and
crispy. 4. When cool, crumble over the baked apple pie. We generally
bake the apple peels directly after the crust, while we are making the
filling. You can make extra pie crust dough if you want to do a more
traditional lattice topping, but bake for an extra 8 minutes or so in
the final stage.

Dark Chocolate Bundt Cake For the cake: 1½ cups

1 cup ½ cup 4 tsp ¼ tsp 5 ½ cup 1 tsp ¾ cup

whole wheat flour or other whole-grain baking flour of choice (or 1 cup
buckwheat flour mixed with ½ cup tapioca flour to make it gluten free)

For the icing: 2 2 Tbs ½ tsp ¼ cup

ripe avocados, peeled and pitted coconut nectar or maple syrup (add an
extra tablespoon if you want it sweeter) vanilla cacao

For the cake: 1. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a bundt pan with
oil of choice or line with parchment paper. 2. Blend the flour, sugar,
cacao, 3 tsp baking powder, and salt. 3. Beat the egg yolks with the
coconut oil, vanilla, and water.

4. Beat the egg whites and remaining teaspoon of baking powder until
peaks form. Add to egg yolk mixture and mix well. 5. Add the liquids to
the dry mixture and mix well. 6. Pour batter into prepared bundt pan and
bake for 25--30 minutes, or until a knife inserted in the cake comes out
clean. Allow the cake to cool to room temperature before icing. For the
icing: Blend avocados with coconut nectar (or maple syrup), vanilla, and
cacao. Spread over cooled cake. For the icing, we also use recipes from
Jenni Hulet's incredible book, My Paleo Patisserie: An Artisanal
Approach to Grain Free Baking. There are also a lot of great recipes
online using unrefined sugars. Experiment!

Conclusion

"Let food be thy medicine." We have been meditating on Hippocrates's
famous quote; it certainly is a simple yet profound way to think about
food. However, I would say that it is also only one side of the coin. We
need to "let eating and thinking be thy medicine." We will never change
our eating habits unless we change the way we think about food. True,
positive lifestyle changes, which can be both exasperating and
exhausting, are worth the effort. Science and Scripture are in sync (and
so they should be, since God gave us science to better understand
ourselves and the world we live in) when it comes to the benefits of
lifestyle change. "Think and eat yourself smart, healthy, and happy" is
a lifestyle change that draws on a formula of knowledge, attitude, and
skills. I provided the knowledge of our food systems in part 1. Attitude
was handled in part 2. And the skills to change are provided in part 3.
Knowledge, attitude, and skills---hence your lifestyle---are driven and
controlled by your thinking. If your thinking is not right, nothing else
in your life will go right, including your eating habits. Thinking
governs eating, and the two activities are inseparable. This is why I
have placed such emphasis throughout this book on the mindset behind the
meal being the 80 percent, and the meal behind the mindset being the 20
percent. If we want to see a healthier world, we need to look in the
mirror and see a healthier person, mentally and physically. It starts
with us: we have to begin thinking and eating ourselves smart, happy,
and healthy . . . and plant healthy trees not only in our gardens but
wherever we go, in the footsteps of our Lord and Savior. In the middle
of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life,
which bore twelve fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. The
leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. (Rev. 22:2)
