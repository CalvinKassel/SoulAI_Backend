How to restore your energy in 10 mins. Non-Sleep Deep Rest (backed by
science):

Dr. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist and professor at Stanford. He
coined "Non-Sleep Deep Rest" --- a technique to quickly recharge the
brain. (Google CEO Sundar Pichai swears by it). You get the beneﬁts of
sleep without actually falling asleep. The best part? It only takes 10
minutes...

Step 1: Find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed. Get into a
comfortable position (ideally lying down).

Step 2: Listen to an NSDR track. (I highly recommend this one):

You'll be guided through a series of breathing exercises and body scans.

---Why it works--- The breathing exercises put your body in a state of
deep relaxation (by slowing your heart rate). The mental body scans help
your brain waves decrease in frequency. (Your thoughts can slow from 35
thoughts per minute to 1-3)! If done right, a 10-minute session can
equate to 1-2 hours of restorative sleep.
