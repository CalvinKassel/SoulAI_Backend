This book is addressed to all manner of students and practitioners of
psychotherapy and counselling. It offers a compendium of deep
psychological and interpersonal insights and precepts that can serve as
a solid foundation for all of the diverse efforts at emotional healing
that are in vogue today. While its bias is psychodynamic, the knowledge
and principles of technique that will be espoused have a bearing on, and
can serve to illuminate, the practice of all present-day treatment
modalities regardless of their theoretical underpinnings.

The broad applicability of this book stems from its grounding in
explorations of emotional realms where humans share a set of universal
attributes that are inherent to *the emotion-processing mind* that marks
us as members of the hominid species (Slavin and Kriegman, 1992;
Badcock, 1994; Langs, 1996). Regardless of whether they are addressed by
a given psychotherapist, these psychobiological features of the human
mind are operative at all times and they exert many powerful effects on
emotional life and the therapeutic process. 3

[]{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_4}Historically, the various schools
of psychotherapy have had little to say about shared, psycho-biological
fundamentals. The prevailing trend is to stress the distinctive features
of a given theory and mode of practice, and the uniqueness of each
patient--therapist couple, to the neglect of universal features (Slavin
and Kriegman, 1992; Langs, 1998a). This attitude supports the employment
of a wide range of ill-defined techniques of therapy which are
buttressed with the use of highly abstract, uncertain, clinically
distant concepts like 'symptom relief', 'psychic defence',
'transference', 'cognitive retraining', 'inter-subjectivity' and 'the
unconscious'. This way of thinking also finds support through the
avoidance of model-making, a most important scientific tool. The few
models of the mind that have been generated tend to be naïve, static,
lacking in clearly defined entities and devoid of a precise definition
of the unconscious domain and unconscious adaptation (Gedo and Goldberg,
1973). Freud's (1923) well-known model of ego, id and superego is a case
in point (see Langs, 1992b).

The field of psychotherapy is sorely in need of a far more precise
definition of terms, theories and techniques (Little, 1951; Szasz, 1963;
Smith, 1991). It also requires the development of suitably complex,
adaptation-oriented models of the mind that take into account both
conscious and unconscious efforts to cope with the many, ever-present
adaptive challenges that humans face from day to day. It is for this
reason that this book is being written from *a strongly adaptive
perspective.* This vantage-point has heretofore been called *the
communicative approach* because the theory and techniques that it
offered were derived largely from careful investigations of the
processes of conscious and unconscious communication between patients
and therapists. The shift to the terms *adaptive or strong adaptive
approach* was made because, with time, it became clear that the most
distinctive feature of the approach is its emphasis on *conscious and
unconscious emotional adaptation* as carried out by the
psycho-biological structure that has evolved for this purpose -- *the
emotion-processing mind.* In this context, it's well to stress that the
propositions of the approach have been clinically derived and
unconsciously validated, and that they are based on a new way of
listening to and formulating the clinical material of the therapeutic
interaction and the conscious and unconscious implications of that
meterial. Throughout the book I shall refer to clinical findings that
have been developed though the methods of the strong adaptive approach.
These references allude to 30 years of unconsciously validated
cumulative clinical experience rather than any specific clinical
research study.

#### []{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_5}**Adaptation** {.h4}

We begin our pursuit of psychological fundamentals with a cardinal set
of questions: As human beings, what is our most essential task? What
activities are most basic to our very existence and survival? What are
we first and foremost designed to do? And how does this central devotion
apply to the emotional realm?

Biologists offer a clear and incontrovertible answer to these questions.
Granted that there are basic needs for boundaries, nourishment,
metabolism and excretion, nevertheless the most fundamental *task* for
all living beings including humans is that of *adapting to their
environments* -- a term used in its broadest sense to include living
conditions, interactions with other living beings, natural events, and
the state of our body organs and our inner feelings, fantasies and other
affects and thought processes (Dawkins, 1976; Plotkin, 1994; Dennett,
1995; Langs, 1996; Rose, 1997). Except for serious or life-threatening
physical illnesses, however, the latter internal events are of lesser
importance to the vicissitudes of emotional life than those that arise
and impact from reality and the external environment. Thus, fantasies
and memories, conscious or unconscious, are far less evocative of major
adaptive responses and emotional consequences than disturbing outside
incidents -- so-called *emotionally-charged traumas* or
*anxiety-provoking triggering events.*

#### **Defining the unconscious domain** {.h4}

It seems axiomatic that a fundamental and universally applicable theory
of emotional life and psychotherapy must, of necessity, include a sound
conceptualization of both the conscious and unconscious realms of
experience and coping. Current psychoanalytic conceptions of unconscious
factors in emotional life are extremely vague and poorly conceptualized.
Virtually anything that a patient is unaware of that a therapist
believes to have been expressed in the patient's behaviours, words or
feelings has been defined as operating unconsciously. This includes
patterns of thinking and acting, relational trends, self-attitudes, the
need for so-called narcissistic supplies, fantasies, memories, and many
of the implications of patients' manifest communications (see for
example, Kohut, 1971; Kernberg, 1975; Mitchell, 1988; Bacal and Newman,
1990; Orange *et al.*, 1997; Langs, 1998a). The appellation
'unconscious' has thereby been reduced to a waste-basket term that is
lacking in specificity, credence or clinical utility. Much of this
arises because the bulk of psychotherapeutic work carried out today
deals []{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_6}with conscious experiences
and, in respect to communication, with the manifest contents and the
evident implications of patients' material. From a strong adaptive
perspective, it appears that many therapists have a rather vague
conceptualization of the unconscious realm and are truly lacking a sense
of the distinctiveness and specificity of unconscious experience,
communication and processes (Langs, in press a).

This situation can be traced to Freud's (1900) abandonment of his
*topographic (map) model of the mind* in which the term *unconscious*
(UCS) referred to a system of the mind, and thus to the state of a
particular set of mental contents and to a distinctive type of mental
processes that he called the *primary processes.* This system was
sharply distinguished from the other system of the mind, the
*preconscious--conscious system* (PCS--CS) which had its own set of
contents and mode of operation, which Freud called the *secondary
processes.* These distinctions were based on the study of patients'
communications in psychoanalysis, in which attention to symbolic
unconscious expressions played a definitive role. Almost all of this was
lost with Freud's (1923) adoption of his *structural approach,* in which
the term *unconscious* no longer alluded to a system of the mind and its
modes of communication and processing. Instead, the term referred to a
quality of human experience and, thereby, soon became a secondary
consideration in formulating material from patients and in intervening.

Of importance in this regard is the realization that Freud's models of
the mind were grounded in a basically inner mental or intrapsychic
focus, with minimum attention to coping with external realities -- a
position that is sustained to this very day by virtually all forms of
psychotherapy. In contrast, the strong adaptive approach that informs
this book is based on a view of emotional life and psychotherapy that is
organized around the human need to adapt first and foremost to
emotionally-charged external events and their meanings; inner mental
issues are seen as a secondary concern. Because this adaptation-centred
approach was developed as an extension and revision of mainstream
psychoanalytic approaches, it shares features with Freud's and other
present-day thinking, yet differs in significant ways as well --
fundamentally, theoretically and clinically.

One difference of relevance to the present discussion is that, in being
stimulus-oriented, the adaptive approach views unconscious communication
as a means of conveying *encoded unconscious perceptions* rather than
*encoded unconscious fantasies and memories* -- although these may be
encoded secondarily. And because unconscious
[]{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_7}communications and processes are
evoked and organized by events that can be specified, the strong
adaptive approach has been able to define the unconscious realm in
relatively specific terms. In addition, its focus on communication has
led to an appreciation of the dramatic differences between *manifest
(unencoded) or conscious* and *latent (encoded) or deep unconscious*
modes of expression. This in turn has led to the development of a model
of the emotion-processing mind that basically is a return to Freud's
topographic model, albeit greatly modified -- that is to a model of the
mind with conscious and deep unconscious systems. And despite
differences in attributes, the adaptive model shares with Freud's model
a relative precision in defining for each system a set of clearly
identified operations, moral values, mode of expression, degree of
defensiveness, perceptive capabilities and adaptive intelligence.

#### **The weak adaptive position** {.h4}

The proposition that adaptation is at the very centre of emotional life,
as well as the psychotherapeutic process and the operations of the
emotion-processing mind, is the basis for a classification of forms of
psychotherapy into two basic groups -- *the weak and strong adaptive
approaches*. There's an in-built, natural tendency for us as humans and
psychotherapists to adopt a mind-centred, weak adaptive position. By
evolved design, the human mind tends to look away from external
realities and to think of its troubles as its own. Emotional problems
are then thought to arise when the mind thinks terrible or conflicted
thoughts or has unfounded beliefs, or when it's learned poor ways of
relating or has been conditioned to respond badly to certain kinds of
situations. It's also believed that the mind's forbidden wishes and
fantasies, and the conflicts that they cause both consciously and
unconsciously, are the root causes of emotional ills. External realities
are seen as a backdrop for the mind's struggles or as creating
coincidental events that set off inner struggles and then fall by the
wayside. Even in the case of extreme traumas, the focus is almost
entirely on how the mind is affected by and handles these situations.

These are, then, *mind-centred approaches* which are exemplified by
classical psychoanalysis and its off-shoots, self-psychology, relational
and intersubjective theories and the like, which view inner mental
conflicts, self-nurturing needs, and relational difficulties as the
primary issues in emotional life (see for example, Freud, 1923; A.
Freud, 1936; Greenson, 1967; Kohut, 1971; Kernberg, 1975; Atwood and
[]{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_8}Stolorow, 1984; Stolorow *et al.*,
1987; Mitchell, 1988; Bacal and Newman, 1990; Orange *et al.*, 1997;
Langs, 1998a, in press b). Also included here are behavioural and
cognitive approaches to the human mind and its psychotherapy. Their
basic principle when it comes to psychotherapy is: Heal the mind --
train it to think more clearly, rid it of its bad habits and poor
patterns of thinking, behaving and relating, and/or render its
unconscious tendencies and conflicts conscious -- and the patient's
emotional problems will be solved. Healing is believed to stem from
interpretations along these lines and from the patient's constructive
identifications and interactional experiences with an assumed soundly
functioning psychotherapist.

In respect to communication and listening, therapists who adopt these
approaches work with manifest contents and the purported implications
that can be extracted from these contents -- an *extraction process*
that is very different from the strong adaptive *trigger-decoding
process* described below. When unconscious contents or processes are
considered by weak adaptive therapists, if at all, it's done in three
ways:

First, by defining unconscious expressions as previously unavailable or
unmentioned mental images, thoughts, fantasies or memories that suddenly
appear or break through into a patient's awareness. This phenomenon is
understood to be the result of changes in intrapsychic defenses that
allow previously repressed or unrealized mental contents to enter
awareness.

Second, by classifying as unconscious expressions any implication of a
manifest message of which the patient is unaware. Here, the focus is on
meanings unrecognized by the patient that can be extracted from the
surface contents of his or her free associations -- that is, from the
manifest contents of their messages.

Third, by viewing unconscious expressions as any behavioural tendency,
pattern of behaviour or mode of relating that a therapist can deduce
from a patient's behaviour in therapy or his or her self-descriptive
free associations that the patient does not consciously acknowledge.

The study of these efforts from the vantage-point of the strong adaptive
approach accepts the validity of some of these weak adaptive
conceptualizations, but finds that they tend to pertain to emotional
issues that have only minimal impact on the vicissitudes of emotional
life and the psychotherapy experience. More tellingly, they appear to
serve as ways of avoiding and defending against far more powerful,
anxiety-provoking, emotionally-charged experiences and issues of a kind
that serve as the deeper sources of both emotional health and
[]{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_9}emotional suffering. These more
compelling problems have been found to stem not so much from the inner
mind as from the external world and life itself with its never-ending
traumas, large and small, including the overwhelming prospect of
personal demise.

#### **The strong adaptive position** {.h4}

To the best of my knowledge, the strong adaptive approach is the only
school of psychotherapy that has adopted a primarily adaptive viewpoint
of emotional life and its vicissitudes (Langs, 1982, 1993, 1998a; Smith,
1991). As a result, as noted by Raney (1984), it is a new paradigm of
psychoanalysis, one that illuminates all manner of therapeutic efforts.
As noted above, its basic proposition is that the single most important
function of the *emotion-processing mind* is that of adapting to
external environmental challenges, which mainly take the form of blatant
and more subtle traumas; adapting to inner mental processes and affects
is seen as a secondary function. It also proposes that the
emotion-processing mind adapts on two levels of emotional experience --
*conscious and unconscious* -- and that it's comprised of two relatively
independent, distinctive processing systems -- the *conscious system*
and the *deep unconscious system.* Reality and the two-system
emotion-processing mind are seen as equal partners in determining the
course of our emotional lives.

As for the process of cure, the emphasis is on the healing qualities of
the insights garnered through the interpretation of patients'
unconscious perceptions as evoked by current or recent triggering events
and their effects on the vicissitudes of patients' symptoms and
resistances, as well as their unconscious links to responses to past
traumas. Also salutary are a therapist's offer and maintenance of a
secured setting and ideal set of ground rules for the treatment
experience -- a reflection of the healing powers of a soundly structured
therapeutic space. And, finally, there are the curative effects of the
positive unconscious identifications patients make with their
psychotherapists when they function well and, in general, confine their
therapeutic endeavours to unconsciously validated interventions --
mainly trigger-decoded interpretations and efforts to keep the framework
of a treatment well-secured.

These modes of insight and healing enable patients to modify their
existing maladaptive behaviours and resolve their emotional symptoms,
and to develop the ability to cope favourably with future
emotionally-charged triggering events. By and large, this is a
*reality-centred approach* []{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_10}that
views the mind's efforts to adapt to actual traumatic events and their
multiple meanings as the primary issue in emotional life. It sees the
mind as continuously activated by environmental events and rejects the
idea that the mind is an isolated entity that goes off on its own to
fight its own battles.

Communicatively, this approach is grounded in the understanding that
messages from the deep unconscious system of the emotion-processing mind
are *encoded* within the manifest contents of narrative vehicles such as
dreams, conscious fantasies and daydreams, and stories that attract the
interest of a patient. These messages reflect the deep unconscious
experiences and adaptive processing efforts of this system, and they are
determined by undoing their disguise in light of their evocative
triggers. The means by which this so-called process of *trigger
decoding* is carried out involves deciphering the encoded meanings of
narrative themes in light of the unconsciously perceived triggering
events that have prompted deep unconscious processing activities. In
essence, then, trigger decoding entails using the trigger -- the
stimulus -- for an encoded narrative message as the decoding key for
undoing its camouflage or disguise. For example:

A male patient seeing a male psychologist in psychotherapy reports a
dream of being examined by a male physician in front of a group of
medical students. The doctor looks up at the students and announces that
he's discovered evidence that the patient has syphilis. The patient
tries to close the doctor's mouth so he'll stop talking.

Among the many possible meanings of this narrative, those that are
relevant to and organized by the event that triggered these disguised
themes are most pertinent to the patient's deep unconscious experiences
and adaptive processing activities. In this case, the trigger was the
therapist's request that the patient permit him to use his case material
in a presentation that he was planning for his psychoanalytic society.
The patient had agreed to the request and consciously stated that he
felt pleased and flattered -- little more. But in light of this trigger
-- which is a departure from the ideal, secured frame that guarantees
the patient total privacy and confidentiality for his treatment
experience -- the dream trigger decodes as an indication that
deep-unconsciously, the patient is experiencing the presentation as his
therapist exposing his secrets to others. The syphilis encodes the fact
that the patient is homosexual and is suffering from AIDS. The dream
also decodes as indicating that while the patient consciously acceded to
his therapist's request, deep-unconsciously he has the very opposite
[]{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_11}wish -- that the therapist not
present his case and expose him and his secrets to others.

As can be seen, I have used the trigger to select the most likely
meanings of the encoded dream and have transposed the themes in the
dream into the therapy situation, thereby undoing their disguise. This
process of decoding narrative themes in light of their unconsciously
experienced triggers is distinctive to the adaptive approach and it
accounts for its many unique findings and relevance to all
emotion-related healing efforts -- deep unconscious experiences affect
all attempts at cure.

#### **A clinical illustration** {.h4}

To illustrate the differences between the weak and strong adaptive
approaches, let's consider the following psychotherapy session:

Mrs Hall, a depressed woman, begins the hour with her male therapist, Dr
Benton, by talking about her fear of men. She ruminates a while and then
decides that she must be afraid of men because all they want is to have
sex with her. She recalls an incident in college when her psychology
professor tried to seduce her during a visit to his office. When he got
physical with her, she panicked and thought he was going to murder her.
She reacted by pulling away from him and dropping the class. It was a
disgusting, immoral thing for him to do.

Weak adaptive psychotherapists would propose a wide range of
formulations based on the manifest contents of this material. In
addition to simply addressing the evident surface messages, they would
attempt to extract from these contents a variety of *unconscious
implications* that pertain to the patient's behaviours, inner mental
conflicts and state of mind. For example, the story could be seen to
imply an undue, unconscious fear of men or as indicating that the client
has unconsciously identified men in general with this seductive
professor and therefore mistakenly mistrusts all men. Another reading of
the story might lead to the proposal that the professor is a stand-in
for the patient's father and that the incident with the professor
represents a repressed, unconscious memory of seduction or harm at the
hands of her parent. Projection of the patient's own repressed wishes to
seduce men and/or of her murderous rage at them might also be
considered, as might dysfunctional patterns of relating to or thinking
about men. Also possible is the idea that the professor is a stand-in
for the therapist and that, 'in the transference', the patient is
entertaining the fantasy that he wants to seduce or murder her -- a
purported *unconscious*
[]{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_12}*misperception* that might then be
traced to a seductive experience that the patient had endured with her
father in her childhood. On the other hand, the story might be thought
of as a projection of the patient's own seductive and murderous wishes
towards the therapist.

All of these formulations take the manifest contents of this material at
face value and considers its themes in their own right. Adaptation is
vaguely implied, but the main focus is on the inner mental world of the
patient and how her thoughts, fantasies and behaviour patterns are
disturbing her relationships with men. The search is made for possible
meanings inherent to the tale; the main technique involves *extracting
implications* from the surface story *per se* -- that is, from the
isolated narrative. No other information is needed. And there is, of
course, a degree of logic and some likely elements of truth to these
mind-centred, vaguely adaptive, arbitrarily extracted implications of
this manifest tale. Why then is there a need for something more?

The answer lies with an event -- *an adaptation-evoking, traumatic
triggering event,* a trigger that is ignored in these formulations --
something that happened in the therapy situation that calls for a very
different line of reasoning and formulating. In escorting the patient
into his consultation room, Dr Benton's arm inadvertently had brushed
against Mrs Hall's arm.

While many therapists would think of this as an innocuous event, such an
assessment reflects the naivety of, and proneness to the use of denial
by, the conscious mind. Clinical observations made in the context of the
strong adaptive approach indicate otherwise. A boundary violation of
this kind, which is often disregarded consciously, is experienced deeply
unconsciously as a highly traumatic intervention by the patient -- and
therapist as well. And the evidence that the patient had indeed
unconsciously experienced and reacted to the physical contact with her
therapist, which she ignored consciously, is found in *the encoded theme
in the narrative images that bridges from the story to the trigger* --
that of a professor who 'got physical' with her. This is how the deep
unconscious system communicates with the conscious mind: by telling a
story about someone else and some other event that is analogous and
thematically similar to a disturbing event that has taken place
elsewhere -- for patients in psychotherapy, this other locale is almost
always the treatment situation and the other person is the therapist.

It appears, then, that whatever her conscious intentions in telling this
tale, Mrs Hall unconsciously chose to tell this story to convey her
unconscious perceptions of the meanings of the physical contact that Dr
Benton made with her arm. Thus, while the narrative reflects her
[]{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_13}*conscious* attempt to understand
her general problems with men, it also reflects her *unconscious*
efforts to understand and adapt to the traumatic triggering event
created by the therapist's lapse -- the story is a twotiered,
two-meaning communication.

Once the trigger has been identified, it's no longer possible to be
satisfied with mind-oriented, weak adaptive formulations of the story
about the seductive professor. Instead, the unconscious meanings of the
story must be formulated first and foremost in light of the trigger that
evoked the recollection. But in order to do this, and to thereby
discover the *encoded level of deep unconscious experience,* the
therapist needs to have consciously noticed the physical contact with
his patient and to have kept it in mind as he listened to her material.
If the trigger goes unnoticed -- as often is the case with disturbing
interventional triggers -- then weakly adaptive, intellectualized,
intrapsychically-oriented but highly defensive formulations hold sway.
But if the trigger is noticed -- as it should be -- then strong adaptive
formulations are an utter necessity. The critical point is to appreciate
that these manifest narratives contain two stories and two sets of
messages -- one consciously fashioned and stated directly, the other
unconsciously honed, camouflaged or encoded, and indirectly stated.

To complete the picture, a strong adaptive psychotherapist would
trigger-decode this narrative about the seductive mentor who made
inappropriate physical contact with his student as conveying the
patient's unconscious perception of her therapist's physical contact
with her as being a seductive gesture on his part, and as something that
was disgusting, immoral and murderously destructive. The incident was so
damaging to the patient that she was thinking -- again, quite
unconsciously -- of leaving treatment. All of this is logical and
undistorted because the trigger, for which the therapist must bear full
responsibility, is a violation of the ground rule that precludes
physical contact between patients and their therapists. It is therefore
correctly appraised deep-unconsciously by the patient, who has
unconsciously chosen from among the many universal meanings of the
event, those that are most relevant to her mental state and emotional
history. *Selection rather than distortion* is the operative mechanism
here.

Unconscious experience tends to be raw, undefended and very much to the
point. For these reasons, the trigger-decoding of these manifest themes
does not entail formulations that propose that the patient was making
use of her imagination, engaged in expressing her fantasies or
projections, or conveying disguised unconscious distortions or
misperceptions of the therapist. Instead, the formulation is developed
in terms []{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_14}of valid unconscious
perceptions, accurate readings of the actual meanings of the traumatic
triggering event -- meanings that the patient unconsciously and
selectively experienced. Also included in this formulation are the
patient's efforts to adapt to the incident by understanding its
implications and responding accordingly. All of these cognitive
processes took place outside of her awareness, as there is no sign of
her conscious recognition of the physical contact with her therapist
(nor was there any in the remainder of the session).

It's important to appreciate the extent to which the weak and strong
adaptive interpretations of the *unconscious meanings* of this material
are at odds with each other. These differences stem from the fact that
weak adaptive approaches *extract implications from the story as such,*
while the strong adaptive approach *decodes the themes of the story in
light of their activating trigger.* In the first approach, the story is
believed to be sufficiently revealing on its own that no additional
information is needed. In the second approach, which is basically
adaptive, the trigger for the story must be identified -- without it, no
active unconscious meaning can be assigned to the narrative. In
addition, the various weak adaptive formulations of the patient's story
are propositions about her inner mental psychopathology, while the
strong adaptive formulation are propositions about her deep unconscious
strengths. Put another way, one view reflects the belief that the
material primarily reflects problems in the patient, while the other
view sees the primary problem in the therapist and in his inadvertent
boundary violation.

As for the genetic connections between this material and a likely
seductive incident between the patient and her father, the weak adaptive
position has it that the unconscious effects of the memory of that event
prompts the patient to *mistakenly believe* that the counsellor is
behaving seductively when he's not -- the past is viewed as a source of
present-day distortions. In contrast, the strong adaptive approach has
it the other way around: the link to the past takes the form of an
unconscious appreciation that the counsellor is *actually repeating* in
some form the seductive behaviour of the patient's father -- the past is
actually being re-enacted in the present.

All in all, the weak adaptive line of thought is based on the premise
that fantasy is stronger than reality, while the strong adaptive
approach postulates (and has observed) that reality is stronger than
fantasy. Furthermore, traumatic events do not fall to the wayside
leaving the mind to fight its own battles -- these events are as much a
part of ongoing inner mental conflicts as the fantasies and memories
that []{#9781403903426_07_ch1.html_page_15}they arouse. Residuals of
traumatic events continue to be processed unconsciously -- and more
rarely consciously -- for long periods of time, often for one's entire
life.

The following table summarizes the key differences between the weak and
strong adaptive approaches:

### Two Modes of Communication {.h3a}

While it's true that there are many avenues of emotional expression --
for example affects, physical symptoms, behaviours, body posture and so
on -- none is more concisely expressed and deeply revealing than the
words spoken by the participants in psychotherapy sessions. For this
reason, we turn now to a study of the verbal exchanges between patients
and their therapists. To begin this pursuit, let's look at another brief
clinical vignette:

Ms Exeter is a young woman in her early twenties who has been
hospitalized on an inpatient unit because of a serious depression. Her
therapist, Dr Frank, had inadvertently forgotten and missed the session
prior to the hour whose opening minutes I shall now briefly excerpt.

The therapist begins the session by apologizing for having missed the
previous session and for not being able to offer a make-up session. The
patient then says it's all right, she's okay with it, she knows how busy
he is these days. The unit's been very disorganized lately. It's the
kind of situation that could confuse anyone. What's really bothering her
is Eddie, her boyfriend. He promised to visit her last night, but he
didn't show up. It's just like a man to do something like that. He
doesn't give a damn about her. His saying one thing and doing another is
driving her crazy. It's what he wants to do to her. He must hate her.
Something must be wrong with him. She feels
[]{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_17}betrayed and hurt. He needs to
work out his problems with women, his hostility. Her friend Kate knows
how to deal with men like that. She once had this boyfriend, Ben, who
had tried to choke her to death while he was bombed out on alcohol. He
disappeared after the incident and showed up weeks later. She took a
knife and cut his arm just to have her revenge. A little trick with a
knife will teach Eddie to keep his promises, which is exactly what he's
got to learn to do.

#### **Perspectives on listening and formulating** {.h4}

Therapists have several tasks in respect to facilitating patients' open
and meaningful communication in psychotherapy sessions. The first is to
create the conditions and framework -- that is, to offer a set of ground
rules and boundaries -- that facilitate the unencumbered expression of
directly stated, conscious perceptions, thoughts and feelings, as well
as those that are indirectly, unconsciously stated through narrative
vehicles. The ideal or secured frame, in which total privacy and
confidentiality are assured, is optimal for this purpose. In addition,
the use of a ground rule that speaks for unencumbered communication is
of value. Thus, patients should be advised to say everything that comes
to mind without censoring their thoughts and feelings -- an application
of the so-called *fundamental rule of free-association* (Freud, 1913).
In addition, strong adaptive therapists now favour adding the suggestion
that the patient begin each session with a dream or story and associate
further stories to these initial images -- an application of *the basic
rule of guided associations,* which is designed to maximize the
communication of encoded deep unconscious perceptions and adaptive
processing activities (Langs, 1993).

A key adaptive finding is that patients' communications are at all times
under the unconscious influence of both the conditions that a therapist
sets for a given therapy experience, and his or her moment-to-moment
verbal and behavioural interventions. Thus, whatever a patient does and
does not say is based on and adaptively reactive to what the therapist
does and does not do, most of it unconsciously mediated. Clinical
studies have shown, for example, than in less than ideal conditions for
a psychotherapy experience -- for example in therapies in which reports
are sent to third-party payers -- patients are less inclined to express
themselves openly, especially in respect to their deep unconscious
experiences of the compromised treatment situation. Even so, many of
these patients will, from time to time, encode these experiences in
their narratives in []{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_18}ways that lend
themselves to trigger decoding, so meaningful communication is possible
in modified therapy frames. The point is to realize that patients'
communications are interpersonally crafted and interactionally framed.

As for listening and formulating, the therapist's goal is to identify
and take into account all of the meanings that are expressed both
directly-consciously and in encoded-unconscious form in a patient's
material. This is especially important because, as we have begun to see,
each of the two systems of the emotion-processing mind not only
communicates in its own special manner, but also adapts on the basis of
its own distinctive perceptions, values and coping strategies.
Furthermore, quite often the conscious system is processing one set of
triggering events and their meanings, while the deep unconscious system
is processing another, more powerful set. It's essential, then, for
therapists to adopt two different levels of listening and formulating
because their patients -- and all humans -- live mentally within two
very different worlds of emotion-related experience.

#### **Modes of expression** {.h4}

The first step in the listening process involves the determination of
the mode of expression that a patient is using from moment to moment in
a session. The question to be answered pertains to whether the patient
is *intellectualizing or telling a narrative tale,* be it a dream or
storied vehicle. These are two very different modes of communication.
Intellectualizations -- speculations, ruminations, analyses,
interpretations, opinions, explanations, general descriptions and so on
-- by and large are single message units that are derived mainly from
conscious experiences. They do not have substantial encoded meaning and
seldom facilitate entry into the realm of deep unconscious experience.
They may, however, be communicated by patients in the service of deep
unconscious interpretations directed to an errant therapist -- a
reflection of the remarkable ability of this system to analyse and
comprehend, within limits, some of the psychodynamic sources of
therapists' erroneous interventions.

In the above excerpt, this mode of expression is seen in Ms Exeter's
comment that her therapist's absence was all right, that she's okay with
it, that she knows how busy he is these days, and that the unit's been
very disorganized lately. The analyses of her boyfriend's behaviour is a
reflection of this same mode of expression, although here we may
postulate encoded attempts to interpret some of the dynamic sources
[]{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_19}of the therapist's lapse. Thus,
there may well be a measure of interpretive effort in her comments that
it's just like a man to forget to appear for a promised visit, that he
doesn't give a damn about her and is trying to drive her crazy, that he
must hate her, that something must be wrong with him, and that he needs
to work out his problems with women. Nevertheless, it's well to notice
that these appear to be weakly adaptive of the kind made by the
conscious mind, and they may well have been in the patient's conscious
thoughts as she mulled over her therapist's absence. At most, they are
best thought of as superficially unconscious and easily brought into the
patient's awareness. They are without the mystery and surprise that is
seen in encoded expressions of deep unconscious experiences of
triggering events.

The second type of message is narrative in nature. Because almost every
dream is configured as a story, they are the best-known example of this
mode of expression. Nevertheless, other narrative forms have comparable
structures and functions. This includes patients' daydreams, stories
that they make up, and incidents that they recall in some detail, drawn
from their personal lives, movies, novels, newspapers and the like. In
the excerpt presented above, this mode of communication is seen in Ms
Exeter's brief stories about her boyfriend Eddie's absence and her
girlfriend's cutting her boyfriend, Ben, with a knife when he returned
to her after a long absence. These narratives convey two sets of
meanings: one set is directly and manifestly stated and consciously
intended, while the other set is disguised or encoded in the same
message, and therefore indirectly stated and unconsciously intended.
Both sets of meanings convey adaptive responses to triggering events,
the manifest message pertaining to consciously experienced incidents,
while the encoded message pertains to incidents, or meanings of
incidents, that have been unconsciously experienced.

In the excerpt above, the patient's manifest story is about her
boyfriend Eddie's unexpected absence. The triggering event for her
conscious concerns is his absence, and the conscious adaptive response,
which is also manifestly developed and communicated, involves getting
angry at him, analysing the situation and arriving at a tentative
adaptive response -- namely, to harm him in order to teach him how to
behave. At the same time, the story about Eddie encodes the patient's
responses to a very different triggering event, namely the therapist's
absence -- a ground-rule violation that constitutes a failure to honour
his pledge to be present at all scheduled sessions. Encoded in the
story, which bridges to the trigger through the theme of absence in the
face of a promise to appear -- is the patient's adaptive response to the
therapist's lapse. Here, []{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_20}too, she
is feeling angry, albeit with her therapist whom she wants to harm in
order to teach him a lesson -- reactions that the patient, for good
reason, needed to experience unconsciously and encode rather that
experience consciously and enact.

Because this trigger was alluded to consciously, we can compare the
patient's conscious and unconscious responses to the therapist's lapse.
The conscious response is limited, forgiving and dismissive -- the
therapist was simply confused. But the encoded, unconscious response is
expansive and very different. To ascertain its nature, we lift the
themes from the story about Eddie and relocate them, connecting them to
the triggering event -- a process that is the essence of trigger
decoding. The story's themes are those of not giving a damn about the
patient; trying to drive her crazy; hating, betraying and hurting her;
and something being wrong with the perpetrator of the harm who has
unresolved problems with hostility towards women. The trigger-decoded,
transposed translation of these themes is that in light of the
therapist's absence (the triggering intervention), the patient
unconsciously perceives the therapist as not giving a damn about her.
The remaining themes appear to be an unconscious attempt to interpret
the underlying cause of the therapist's error, namely that he is trying
to drive her crazy; betraying, hurting and hating her; and has problems
with unresolved hostility towards women. There is also, as noted, a
responsive wish to harm the therapist for what he did and to teach him
how to keep his promises in the future.

These are the patient's personally selected, but valid deep unconscious
perceptions of the implications and sources of the triggering event,
along with her adaptive reaction to the event. The latter includes an
*encoded corrective or model of rectification* -- namely, that the
therapist should be present, as promised, for all scheduled sessions.

We can see, then, that a dream or story is an end-product -- that it's
told at the end of an unconscious adaptive processing effort that begins
with an unconscious perception of aspects of a triggering event. That
is, after a traumatic incident or some of its meanings are perceived and
processed deep-unconsciously, the system seeks out or creates a dream or
story through which it reports on these unconscious activities to
conscious awareness. Typically, patients' narratives are about events
outside of therapy and the incident is chosen because it's analogous to,
and therefore shares themes with, the unconsciously experienced trigger
created by the therapist. In the vignette, for example, the theme of
Eddie's unexpected absence is analogous to the therapist's missing the
patient's scheduled session. This is the *bridging theme*
[]{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_21}that supports the thesis that the
manifest story encodes responses to unconsciously experienced aspects of
the latent trigger.

Notice, too, the extent to which the encoded, unconscious view of the
triggering intervention is different from the unencoded, manifest view.
The conscious response is based on the evident *use of denial* -- it was
nothing. In contrast, the deep unconscious reaction is forthright and
incisive -- it conveys disturbing unconscious perceptions of the actual
implications of the triggering event that apparently had not registered
consciously. We can also see that the trigger that the patient is trying
to cope with consciously (her boyfriend's absence) is different from the
trigger that she's trying to cope with at the deep unconscious level
(the therapist's absence). This is typically the case.

Finally, we may trigger-decode the story about the patient's girlfriend,
Kate, by first noting another bridging theme -- again, that of an
absence -- and then identifying themes of an attempt at murder,
abandonment, revenge through a violent act, and teaching wayward men a
lesson so they don't disappear again. It seems clear that this story
truly encodes the patient's deep unconscious perceptions of her
therapist's absence as an attempt at murder and abandonment, while
Kate's attacking her boyfriend on his return speaks for the rage that
the patient is feeling unconsciously towards her therapist and the harm
she intends for him. There's a striking difference between the patient's
consciously bland response to the therapist's absence and her intense
deep unconscious experience and reaction to the lapse. This is an
especially important point because deep unconscious experiences have
enormous effects on patients' symptoms, resistances in therapy,
behaviours within and outside of treatment, and overall emotional life.
It's one reason why trigger decoding and adaptive interpreting is so
important for all forms of psychotherapy -- without these efforts,
there's considerable danger of harm to the patient, even as its sources
go unrecognized.

#### **Single-message units** {.h4}

In listening to patients' material, the first task of an
adaptive-oriented psychotherapist is to distinguish narrative from
non-narrative communications. If both types of expression are in
evidence, the intellectualizations, along with the manifest contents of
dreams and other narratives, are put into one bin and treated as
conscious system communications and adaptive responses. While often of
little consequence, they may indicate the status of a patient's symptoms
and []{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_22}emotional life in general, or
reflect his or her attitudes towards treatment. But they do not encode
unconscious perceptions and adaptive processing activities and therefore
do not lend themselves to trigger decoding. Attempts to extract
implications from such material is of limited value.

Narrative themes need to be separated into a second bin, their manifest
contents duly noted, and then treated as encoded reflections of deep
unconscious perceptions and processes. With the themes in hand, the
search is directed towards finding the trigger -- usually an
intervention by the therapist -- to which the themes are attached and
the patient is responding to on the deep unconscious level of
experience. It's this type of effort and the use of trigger decoding
that opens a window into the realm of deep unconscious experience and
the adaptive activities of the deep unconscious system of the
emotion-processing mind. In general, the absence of narrative material
is a sign of *communicative resistance* and, as such, should initiate a
search for the triggers that have evoked this unconsciously wrought
avoidance of encoded themes. In most cases, the answer lies with
intellectualized interventions by the therapist that have been made on
the basis of extracting implications from manifest contents -- a
surface-oriented way of intervening that unconsciously invites the
patient to communicate unencoded, intellectualized messages and to avoid
expressions of deep unconscious experience.

The recognition of a sharp distinction between, and in the functions and
meanings of, narrative versus non-narrative communications is basic to
the strong adaptive approach. Therapists who do not recognize this
distinction are generally unable to appreciate the unique role played by
encoded narrative communications. They tend to treat all messages as if
they were identical in structure and limit themselves to extracting
implications from the surface of these messages. In this way, they
confine both themselves and their patients to the realm of conscious
experience, far from the more powerful world of deep unconscious
happenings and processes.

The extraction of implications from manifest contents tends to be an
arbitrary, uncertain and biased effort, and interventions made on this
basis do not obtain patients' *unconscious, narratively encoded
validation* -- the ultimate criterion of correct formulations and
interpretations. This type of manifest therapeutic work tends to deal
with relatively weak emotional issues and therefore to have a highly
defensive function because trigger-decoded meanings are far more
powerful and disturbing than directly communicated meanings. This
applies to all []{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_23}weak adaptive forms
of psychotherapy, which can be understood to be *conscious system modes
of treatment*. This mode of therapy is dramatically different from those
based on trigger decoding, which are *deep unconscious system modes of
treatment.*

To sum up, the direct and implied meanings of all manifest messages are
vehicles of expression that reflect the operations of the conscious
system of the emotion-processing mind. Clinical research has shown that,
on the whole, these messages tend to be only minimally charged with
emotional impact, even when they involve the analysis of very damaging
incidents like earthquakes and personal assaults. They tend to take
shape as patients' highly intellectualized comments and analyses, or as
the surface meanings of dreams and stories. These manifest and implied
meanings tend to involve transparent conscious and unconscious
psychodynamics that are easily brought into awareness. These features of
manifest contents stand in sharp contrast to the encoded meanings of
narratives, which tend to deal with far more disturbing issues, to be
far from evident to the conscious mind, and to be much more difficult to
ascertain.

Despite the limitations that accrue to work with manifest contents and
their evident implications, studies based on the strong adaptive
approach suggest that a great deal of psychotherapy, including those
forms that are psychoanalytically-oriented, is conducted on the basis of
this level of communication. Questions are asked and previously unstated
thoughts and feelings are unearthed, and these are taken to reflect
previously unconscious material. In circular fashion, this kind of
therapeutic work is taken to support mind-centred, weak adaptive
approaches to treatment and their focus on the minds of patients. Mental
thoughts and feelings, viewed in isolation and on their own terms, are
the sum and substance of these efforts. Should adaptation be considered,
it's viewed in terms of conscious and manifest responses to manifestly
experienced triggering events -- notions of unrecognized triggers and
unconscious perception and processing are not invoked.

A formal research study that was conducted on the basis of strong
adaptive thinking (Langs *et al.*, 1996) provided unexpected tentative
evidence that interventions of this kind are unconsciously designed to
avoid or reduce the expression of patients' highly threatening deep
unconscious perceptions -- many of them related to errant and
unconsciously harmful interventions made by their therapists. While this
type of avoidance may bring temporary relief to both parties to therapy,
it does so on the basis of avoidance and denial -- costly forms
[]{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_24}of redress at best. I'll have more
to say about these difficult issues later in the book.

#### **Double-message units** {.h4}

As for dreams and stories, the conveyors of both manifest and latent (in
the sense of trigger-encoded) messages, it's well to first appreciate
that weak adaptive, mind-oriented therapists do at times formulate and
interpret disguised unconscious meanings that are thought to be
reflected in manifest dreams and fantasies. But in so doing, they tend
to treat the purported encoded image as a universal symbol or as an
isolated disguised content within the mind of the patient. These
readings of unconscious meaning revolve around theories of the mind
related to mental symbols and archetypes, unconscious fantasies and
unconscious memories. Thus, elongated objects are seen to symbolize the
phallus, while a rounded container symbolizes the womb.

As is the case in extracting implications from manifest messages,
determining the symbolic meanings of dream elements and other narratives
is an extremely arbitrary, theory-driven endeavour. They allow for an
almost unlimited range of possibilities and interpretations. Thus,
whatever grain of truth there is to these ideas, they nevertheless
reflect an incomplete, weak adaptive orientation in which the mind is
believed to operate relatively divorced from reality and adaptation is
given little or no consideration.

The strong adaptive approach takes a very different position in regard
to the nature and functions of storied messages. It stresses their role
as messengers from the deep unconscious system of the emotion-processing
mind and their essential connection to the unconsciously perceived
meanings of triggering events. Narratives are seen to primarily reflect
unconscious adaptations to actual events, although, secondarily, they
may also encode the fantasies and memories associated with these events.

Almost all of the triggers to which patients' deep unconscious systems
are sensitive, involve the interventions of their therapists, verbal and
behavioural, and especially their impingements on and efforts to manage
the ground rules of treatment. This places therapists at the very centre
of their patients' deep unconscious (but not necessarily conscious)
adaptive struggles. Communicatively, this natural, evolved tendency puts
therapists in a unique position to experience and know first-hand the
nature of the triggers to which their patients are
[]{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_25}responding deep-unconsciously --
that is, the triggers are constituted by their own therapeutic efforts.
And they affect the nature and flow of their patients' encoded
narratives and adaptive preferences, as well as the extent to which they
are inclined to narrate at all -- all of it interacting with the
patient's own inclinations. Indeed, every patient has a preferred style
of expressing encoded themes -- some do so extensively, while others do
so sparingly. Almost always this trait is evident in the initial
session, largely because it is inborn and virtually unmodifiable in the
course of a therapy experience.

There are, then, two dialogues going on in every treatment situation,
the first of which is an exchange of conscious, manifest messages loaded
with detectable implications. The second dialogue, however, may take one
of two forms: the first is an unwitting exchange of deep unconscious
perceptions and experiences in which neither party to therapy becomes
consciously aware of this level of transaction and its effects -- a most
unfortunate situation. But the second is a dialogue in which the patient
expresses unconscious, encoded messages without being aware of their
meanings, while the therapist trigger decodes their unconscious meanings
and brings them into the patient's awareness -- a most salutary
circumstance.

As I have been emphasizing, the deep unconscious level of experience
holds enormous power over the emotional lives of both healers and those
whom they are trying to heal. Even when a therapy is centred on manifest
contents and their implications, as seen in relational forms of therapy
or cognitive retraining, the unconscious exchange of messages between
patients and therapists will have a strong although unseen effect on
both parties to the process. Therapists of all stripes are well-advised
to tune into that second dialogue because it's exerting a profound
influence on how the treatment is proceeding and on the lives of both
participants -- spill-over into everyday life is inevitable. As the
following excerpt shows, even the smallest amount of attention to
encoded themes and their evocative triggers can go a long way towards
keeping any kind of treatment process and the lives of both participants
on an even keel, and helping all concerned move towards improved
adaptive functioning.

#### **A clinical illustration** {.h4}

Mrs Kassen, an investment advisor, was undergoing cognitive retraining
for a severe depression; her therapist was Ms Reed, a clinical social
worker. The patient had made progress initially, but had then suffered
[]{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_26}a relapse. Ms Reed was at a loss
to explain the regression, so she reviewed the case with her supervisor,
Mrs Doran, who had some knowledge of the strong adaptive approach.

Inquiry by Mrs Doran came around to the ground rules and conditions of
the treatment. The client was being seen in a clinic, and before each
session she was required to pay the fee for the training session based
on a bill given to her by the clinic secretary. It turned out that
before each of the last two training sessions, the secretary had
mistakenly given her a bill meant for another client -- and had given
the other client the patient's bill. Each time it happened, Mrs Kassen
was delayed and was late to her session, and each time she had
apologized for her lateness, while excusing the secretary's error as a
result of her being new to the job.

When Mrs Doran suggested in supervision that these errors may have
contributed to the recurrence of the patient's symptoms, Ms Reed
suddenly was reminded that Mrs Kassen had told an odd story before they
began to work on her exercises last hour. Ms Reed had forgotten the
story, but bringing up the secretary's error had brought it back to her
mind because it was about the patient's secretary at work. It seems that
the secretary had made a serious blunder, a book-keeping error that
involved depositing a large check, sent to her by one Mrs Kassen's
clients, into the wrong account. The offended client had accused Mrs
Kassen of stealing the money from him. But, worse still, as luck would
have it the secretary had put the money into the account of the client's
ex-wife. The client was enraged. He felt that his confidentiality had
been seriously compromised -- the last thing he wanted was for his
ex-wife to know that he had some surplus cash. He took his account away
from Mrs Kassen, who had been terribly depressed over the incident.

Because it was an event that had depressed her client, Ms Reed had
briefly worked over the manifest narrative and tried to reassure Mrs
Kassen that the error wasn't hers, that she had no cause for guilt, and
that she would survive quite well without this client's business. Mrs
Kassen had accepted the reassurance, but her depression continued
unabated to a point where Ms Reed began to think of referring her to the
clinic psychiatrist for anti-depressant medication.

Mrs Doran had another view of this material. The themes in the story of
the secretary's error bridged over, and seemed connected to, the error
made by the clinic secretary in two ways: first through the theme of a
monetary error, and second through the theme of a third party
inappropriately obtaining privileged information. The frame
[]{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_27}violations made by the secretary
at the clinic involved both an error with the bill and having Mrs
Kassen's name revealed to another client -- as well as the other
client's name being revealed to Mrs Kassen.

Mrs Doran trigger-decoded Mrs Kassen's story in light of the trigger of
the clinic secretary's error -- an intervention for which the client,
unconsciously and justifiably, would hold Ms Reed fully responsible. The
themes in the narrative about the incident at work indicates that while
Mrs Kassen dismissed the incident consciously, on the deep unconscious
level of experience she was infuriated by the billing error and the
violation of her confidentiality -- and her deep unconscious adaptive
recommendation was to leave treatment.

As for Mrs Kassen's depression, it evidently stemmed from the hurt and
rage at the clinic secretary and Ms Reed that she was experiencing
deep-unconsciously, even as consciously she was denying any sense of
harm. The damage was compounded by Ms Reed's failure to appreciate the
importance of these frame violations and her deafness to the patient's
encoded messages. As a result, the patient's unconscious perceptions and
rage went uninterpreted and no effort was made to rectify and secure the
frame by trying to prevent further mistakes of this kind.

To some extent, it seems likely that Mrs Kassen turned her anger at her
counsellor against herself in the form of a heightening of her
depression. At the same time, the symptom was a defeat for, and an
attack against, Ms Reed's therapeutic efforts, thereby extracting a
degree of revenge for the patient. These are typical consequences of
therapists' failures to pay attention to deep unconscious experience and
the encoded level of their patients' narratives.

It seems clear that once again, in the context of a non-dynamic
treatment arrangement, a frame violation -- that of the patient's
privacy -- evoked a naive, excuse-ridden, denial-based conscious
response. But it has in addition triggered a narrative communication
that encodes a very different and highly critical deep unconscious
reaction to consciously unrecognized meanings of the same event. As a
weak adaptive therapist, Ms Reed had all but forgotten the story and
recalled it only because of her supervisor's exploration of the status
of the ground rules of the therapy. It's quite easy for therapists who
are unfamiliar with the adaptive approach to miss the communication of a
narrative vehicle and thereby fail to realize that it's encoding a deep
unconscious reaction to a triggering event that is deeply affecting the
treatment experience and its outcome. Sensitivity to narrative
communications is essential for
[]{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_28}detecting and formulating the
vicissitudes of the deep unconscious dialogue between patient and
therapist.

In weak adaptive forms of psychotherapy, it's not uncommon to find that
therapists are unwittingly sending their patients mixed messages. On the
one hand, they're trying manifestly and consciously to train or explain
away or superficially interpret a patient's symptoms. But on the other,
they or someone affiliated with them becomes involved in ground-rule or
boundary infractions that are harmful to the patient and thereby
unconsciously promote the very symptoms that they are trying to
alleviate. Indeed, as we shall see, no matter how a therapist defines
the ground rules of a therapy situation, the patient unconsciously seeks
an ideal, universal set of ground rules that the deep unconscious mind
inherently recognizes as the optimal conditions for treatment. Patients
respond unconsciously to ground-rule management on the basis of these
deep-unconsciously sought standards no matter how a therapy is
structured.

Notice, too, that even though the therapy involved cognitive retraining,
once the unconsciously sought frame was violated, the client found a way
to tell a story. This is a psychobiological given: in response to
infringements of ground rules and boundaries, humans find or create
narrative vehicles with which to convey their deep unconscious
experience of, and adaptive response to, the frame-related triggering
event. This means that when patients narrate, therapists should pay
attention to their stories, make note of the themes, and search for the
interventional triggers to which the patient is responding. This is
especially true for negatively toned stories because harmful themes
almost always encode responses to harmful triggering events -- they are
a strong indication that the therapist has done something hurtful to the
patient. Finding the provocative trigger -- the erroneous comment or,
more often, the frame violation -- enables the offending therapist to
understand what the patient is experiencing as damaging at a deep
unconscious level and to set matters right through both interpretation
and frame-securing efforts.

A therapist may wish to work with their patients' manifest material and
make use of superficial interpretations, exercises and so on, but it's
well to keep in mind that their interventions as healers, whatever they
may be, have both conscious and deep unconscious effects. Many errant
interventions that go unnoticed by patients, as well as many
unregistered, anxiety-provoking meanings of interventions that patients
allude to consciously, do register and are processed by the deep
unconscious minds of everyone involved in the treatment
[]{#9781403903426_08_ch2.html_page_29}situation. The unconsciously
perceived harmful qualities of these interventions then have their
damaging effects on both parties to the therapy. Keeping an ear open for
narratives and their themes is vital to ascertaining their triggers and
taking proper measures to bring a damaging style of intervening to a
halt and offer the much needed interpretations and frame rectifications
that will have a healing influence on both parties to therapy.

You can ignore nature, but you can't hide from its effects. And when it
comes to psychotherapy, the most imposing experiences take place without
conscious awareness. The trigger-evoked, encoded meanings of narratives
hold the key to that realm. Therapists are well-advised to take hold of
that key and to keep opening the doors to the deep unconscious domain to
which it gives them -- and their patients -- access.

### Models of the Mind {.h3a}

As a scientist steeped in biology, Freud appreciated the need for, and
value of, models of the mind as a source of otherwise unavailable
insights. He offered two such clinically-founded models: the two-system
topographic model (Freud, 1900) which featured the systems UCS
(unconscious) and PC--CS (preconscious--conscious), and the three-system
structural model of ego, id and superego (Freud, 1923). While the
structural model prevails to this day and is inherent to all weak
adaptive approaches to psychotherapy, the strong adaptive model of the
mind hearkens back to and is an extensively modified version of the
topographic model. Let's turn now to these models of the mind to gain a
sense of how the emotion-related mind is thought to be structured and to
operate.

#### **Freud's first model of the mind** {.h4}

In *The Interpretation of Dreams,* Freud (1900) proposed the first
psychodynamic model of the mind (that is, the emotion-related mind) --
his map or topographic model. His goal was to account for the
development of neuroses in terms of unconscious conflict and warring
systems of the mind, and his essential insight was that the unconscious
structure of dreams is comparable to that of emotional symptoms. His
quest was to study the nature of unconscious contents in order to
discover how they are activated and find expression in dreams and
symptoms.

In essence, Freud proposed that *the systems of the mind are defined by
the status of their contents vis-à-vis awareness* -- essentially,
whether they're []{#9781403903426_09_ch3.html_page_31}in awareness or
potentially capable of entering awareness directly and undisguised, or
are outside of awareness and capable of entering awareness only if
sufficiently disguised. Those contents that are outside of awareness
belong to the system UCS (unconscious), while those that are in
awareness belong to the system CS (conscious) and those that can easily
enter awareness directly and undisguised belong to the system PCS
(preconscious), which is the gateway to the system CS. The defining
feature of the systems of the mind was, then, whether its contents are
conscious or unconscious, and on this basis Freud also defined a number
of distinctive properties for each system -- UCS and PCS--CS.

In developing this model, Freud described the operations of the mind in
a somewhat adaptive vein by proposing a sequence of processes that begin
with the *conscious perception* of an actual incident -- the so-called
*day's residue* of a dream, for example -- and ends with some type of
discharge, be it through a dream, action or neurotic symptom. Thus, the
consciously experienced day's residue activates unconscious wishes and
memories within the system UCS *and then falls to the wayside.* The
aroused UCS wishes, which are mainly of a primitive, infantile,
incestuous nature (aggressive wishes were added later on), seek
discharge or expression. But the search for discharge is blocked by the
censorship of the system PCS--CS, whose defences are activated by the
conscience, which also belongs to this system. The result is a
compromise such as a disguised manifest dream that satisfies or
expresses both the wish and the defence. In this light, *repression* of
the forbidden wishes is seen as the fundamental psychological defence.
And the goal in analysing a dream is to undo the mechanisms of disguise
(that is, displacement, symbolization and condensation) in order to
identify the repressed, unconscious wish or memory camouflaged in the
dream and bring it into awareness for conscious processing, renunciation
and resolution.

In addition to formulating this sequence of processes, Freud proposed a
set of properties that distinguished the operations of the two systems
of the mind. Thus, the system UCS was said to operate according to the
pleasure principle and the so-called *primary processes* that included
the search for immediate discharge by the primitive, forbidden wishes
within the system; an utter disregard for reality considerations (see
however, Holt, 1967; Noy, 1969); the timelessness of its wishes; the
absence of logic or rational thinking; and a fluidity of representations
(one thing standing for another) through the mechanisms of
symbolization, condensation and displacement.

[]{#9781403903426_09_ch3.html_page_32}In contrast, the system PCS--CS
was said to operate with the so-called *secondary processes* that
included a strong capacity to delay the discharge of its relatively
mature wishes and needs; is in close contact with, and shows respect
for, reality; is logical and sensible; and operates with direct
representations of its thoughts and their meanings -- an image or
thought stands for itself alone.

Freud's model stressed the role of intrapsychic conflict between the two
systems of the mind in both dreams and symptom formation -- essentially,
he postulated a battle between unconscious wishes and conscious
sensibilities. Thus, a symptom was viewed as a compromise like a dream
-- it was seen as an emotional disturbance that unconsciously expressed
or represented both the forbidden wishes of the system UCS and the
defences of the system PCS--CS. The model is based on an inner mental,
weak adaptive viewpoint, which, in turn, supports thinking along those
very lines -- the classical idea that theory drives observation and
theory-driven observations drive the creation of models that are then
used to sustain the theory. Breaking out of this vicious cycle is no
easy matter.

#### **Freud's structural model** {.h4}

Over the years that followed his creation of the topographic model of
the mind, Freud discovered several seemingly intractable problems with
his vision. His centrepiece for psychoanalytic theory was the concept of
unconscious intrapsychic conflict, but he began to realize that his
patients tended to be unaware of their resistances and of their use of
psychological defences like repression. This meant that the defences of
the system PCS--CS often operated outside awareness -- that is, that
they were part of the system UCS. It was inconceivable to Freud that
both the forbidden wishes and the defences erected against their
expression -- the warring parties -- could be in the same system and,
thus, on the same side of the conflict.

Freud also discovered a critical problem with his view of the
conscience, which he had located in the system CS. He became aware that
a great deal of guilt is experienced unconsciously -- that is, that his
patients acted in self-punitive ways without realizing that they were
doing so. So here too an element of his proposed system CS was also to
be found in the system UCS.

All in all, then, Freud's conflict theory was at odds with his model of
the mind. He became convinced that he had to abandon one or the other.
He chose to preserve his conflict theory and give up topography
[]{#9781403903426_09_ch3.html_page_33}(Freud, 1923;Arlow and Brenner,
1964), and did so by introducing his structural model of the mind -- the
three-system configuration of ego, id and superego. In this model,
neuroses and dream formation were conceived of primarily in terms of a
conflict between the superego (conscience) and the id (forbidden
instinctual drives), as mediated by the ego in light of reality
considerations.

The hallmark of psychoanalysis -- the existence of unconscious contents
(and processes) -- suffered badly from this change in models. The term
*unconscious* was no longer the defining feature of the systems of the
mind. Instead, it was reduced to a quality of mental contents and
operations, which could be either conscious or unconscious.*The defining
feature of a system of the mind was now the nature of its functions.*
Thus, the ego was seen to be responsible for executive functions,
relating, tension regulation, psychological defences, and so on; the id
was the seat of the instinctual drives of sex and aggression; and the
superego was seen as the conscience and ego ideal.

While the structural model has been the basis of advances in egoand
self-psychology, the study of object relations and much more, it also
has significant drawbacks (Langs, 1992b). In particular, once 'the
unconscious' lost its status as a system of the mind, it became a
waste-basket term that had lost its clarity and explanatory powers. It
was used to refer to anything that a patient seemed to be unaware of --
be it a pattern of thinking or behaving, an opinion or need, a fantasy
or memory, or a way of relating. In addition, many conscious
communications from patients were treated as if they reflected
unconscious contents and processes -- that is, the concept became
confounded. Also lost was the small adaptive element found in the
topographic model -- considerations of reality became a relatively minor
function of the very busy ego. All in all, the new model spawned a
variety of competing, weak adaptive, mind-centred theories of neurosis,
such as ego- and self-psychology, and relational, intersubjective and
constructivistic theories, none of which is dominant today. The
resultant contradictions in viewpoints and confusion speaks for problems
in the basic model of the mind (see also Gedo and Goldberg, 1973;
Goleman, 1985).

#### **Comparing topographic models** {.h4}

Clinical observations made from the vantage-point of the strong adaptive
approach speak for the greater utility of a two-system topo-graphic
model of the mind in which the basic configuration is that of
[]{#9781403903426_09_ch3.html_page_34}a conscious and deep unconscious
system -- the latter being so-called in order to distinguish it from
Freud's view of the unconscious domain (Langs, 1986, 1987, 1995). Taking
the formation of a dream as our framework, the adaptive model of the
mind postulates that mental processing begins with a triggering event
comparable to Freud's day's residues. However, in contrast to Freud's
position that the event and its meanings may be innocuous and always
consciously perceived, the adaptive model claims that *many of the most
critical and anxiety-provoking aspects of the event are not perceived
consciously, but unconsciously or subliminally.* (In a footnote added to
*The Interpretation of Dreams* in 1919, Freud acknowledged the new
researches of Potzl \[1917\] who had demonstrated the phenomenon of
unconscious perception in the formation of dream images, but Freud never
applied it to his dream theory.) Further, while Freud suggested that the
day residue drops by the wayside and the aroused unconscious fantasies
and memories take over the situation, the adaptive approach proposes
that the day's residue, and especially its traumatic and unconsciously
perceived aspects, continues to be processed by the emotion-processing
mind -- and that this processing activity is reflected, however
disguised, in the resultant dream. Thus, where Freud detached the mind
from reality and formulated an isolated intrapsychic process, the strong
adaptive approach formulates a continuing tie to reality and an ongoing,
inner mental processing of this reality as well.

This strongly adaptive position has a number of additional distinctive
features that are missing from the Freudian topographic model.
Unconscious adaptive processing requires the use of intelligence, and
thus requires postulating the existence of a *deep unconscious wisdom
system* -- an attribute that is absent in Freudian thinking where the
processing of unconscious wishes are matters of seeking discharge and
expression. In addition, the adaptive model recognizes the ever-present
use of unconscious perception in coping with emotionally-charged
traumas. Thus, contrary to Freud's position that the system UCS is out
of touch with and disregards reality, the adaptive view is that the deep
unconscious system is exquisitely in touch with reality -- far more so
than the conscious mind. Indeed, it's the conscious system that's denial
prone and out of touch with real events and many of their meanings --
this too is the very opposite of Freud's thinking (see also Holt, 1967;
Noy, 1969).

To continue, the Freudian picture of an illogical system UCS is revised
by the adaptive approach into a system that engages in sound, logical
and quite brilliant adaptive processing efforts. Once
[]{#9781403903426_09_ch3.html_page_35}more, it's the conscious system
that's seen as inclined towards illogic and false reasoning -- it is
strongly inclined to make use of denial and of rationalizations for
aberrant behaviours. Similarly, while both models recognize the use of
primary process mechanisms of disguise and encoding, the Freudian view
applies these processes to unconscious wishes, while the strong adaptive
approach applies them to unconscious perceptions. Thus, where Freud
strives to decode unconscious fantasies, the adaptive therapist seeks to
decode unconscious perceptions. Finally, it's well to note that the
Freudian decoding of unconscious fantasies and memories is an arbitrary,
theory-driven effort, while the decoding activities of the adaptive
therapist pertain to and are organized by the nature of the
unconsciously perceived trigger and therefore has more structure and
definition than its forerunner.

All in all, the two views of the emotion-related mind and the principles
of therapy derived from them are diametrically opposed. The Freudian
model takes a therapist into an isolated inner mental world of
unconscious memories and fantasies, while the adaptive approach takes
him or her into a world in which traumatic events activate an inner
mental world in which the adaptive unconscious processing of the most
painful meanings of emotionally-charged events dominates the scene. The
former is entirely mind-centred, while the latter sees the mind as
actively coping with reality.

#### **A clinical vignette** {.h4}

The following vignette illustrates the main differences between the
ramifications of Freud's topographic model and the one developed by the
strong adaptive approach:

Mr Arkin, a single man in his early thirties who is suffering from
severe episodes of anxiety, is a salesman for a manufacturer of sporting
equipment. He's in psychotherapy with Dr Gregory, who is a male
psychologist.

About a year into the therapy, the patient enters Dr Gregory's
consultation room, hands him a cheque, sits down in his (the patient's)
chair, mumbles something about how annoying it is to have to spend so
much money for therapy, and begins the session by saying that he'd had a
dream the previous night. In the dream, he's in his boss's office at
work and his boss, Harvey, is holding a gun to his head and robbing him
of his wallet. Harvey pulls the trigger of the gun, but it doesn't fire.
Mr Arkin awoke from the dream feeling extremely anxious.

[]{#9781403903426_09_ch3.html_page_36}Associating to the dream, the
patient says that Harvey looks like his friend Ernie whom he ran into
during lunch on the day of the dream. Ernie talked about how well he was
doing in business. Somehow, Mr Arkin took umbrage over what he was
saying and how he was saying it, and he felt annoyed. But that's one of
his problems, isn't it, he's never at peace with other men. The fact
that Ernie is a furniture salesman and Mr Arkin's father was in the
furniture business must have something to do with it, but it shouldn't
affect him like that. Harvey also is annoying; Mr Arkin has a tense
relationship with him. Harvey's a lot like his father, very cheap and
demanding, and ready to deduct an expense from Mr Arkin's salary at the
drop of a hat. He's a crook.

Mr Arkin then pauses. Being robbed now brings to mind a nasty incident
from his adolescence -- something he hadn't thought about in years. His
family was always under financial pressure, but he managed to get a job
as a stock clerk in a supermarket and saved up his salary and some gift
money until it came to over a thousand dollars. The money was in a joint
savings account that had his father's name on it and, one day, he
discovered that his father had withdrawn the money to pay some very
pressing bills that were long overdue. Mr Arkin flew into a rage and
confronted his father with his thievery and began to shake him. He never
got the money back and he guesses that he never forgave him either.

To discuss the vignette to this point, the identified day's residue or
trigger for the dream appears to be Mr Arkin's lunch with Ernie and his
sense of annoyance at him. This is a relatively innocuous event and it
lends itself to the Freudian theory of dream and symptom formation --
it's a consciously experienced day's residue that seems to have prompted
the creation of the dream of Harvey and being robbed of his wallet. The
associations to the dream reveals the use of condensation (for example
Harvey represents both himself, Ernie and Mr Arkin's father),
displacement (for example the shift from the father to Harvey; from Mr
Arkin's home to the boss's office at work; from the money taken by the
father to the money in Mr Arkin's wallet), and symbolization (for
example the gun may symbolize Mr Arkin's wish to murder his father; its
failure to fire may symbolize Mr Arkin's helplessness in the situation
with the father).

Everything seems to fall neatly into place. The incident with Ernie,
which was registered consciously and is of little consequence, activates
a series of memories and fantasies in Mr Arkin's system UCS and then
[]{#9781403903426_09_ch3.html_page_37}falls to the wayside. The aroused
memories and fantasies mainly involve being robbed by his father, having
the fantasy of murdering him, and being helpless to do so. At the behest
of his conscience, the defences of the system PCS--CS seem to have moved
into action and insisted on forging a compromise. Instead of dreaming of
being robbed by his father and then murdering him, Mr Arkin dreams of
being robbed by his boss with a gun that fails to fire. The
primary-process mechanisms of the system UCS and the defences of the
system PCS--CS seem to have done their jobs.

It takes associating to the dream to discover the underlying fantasies
and memories. They do, however, provide insight into Mr Arkin's
relational problems with men -- unconsciously, men are viewed as
stand-ins for his much-hated father. This includes the therapist, Dr
Gregory, so it's likely that Mr Arkin's annoyance at having to pay his
fee is the tip of an iceberg, under which is the client's distorted
belief that he's being robbed of his money by his therapist. The patient
also seems to be entertaining the unconscious fantasy of murdering his
therapist, as he once wished to do with his father. The past is
distorting Mr Arkin's view of, and feelings towards, men in general and
his therapist in particular.

We can see, too, that although the Freudian model works quite well, it
does so only up to a point. The conscience does indeed seem to be acting
unconsciously, as are the client's defenses. But rather than discarding
the model on this basis, as Freud decided to do, the model could have
been preserved by acknowledging that the conscience and psychological
defences have both conscious and unconscious components -- that they do
indeed belong to both the system UCS and PCS--CS -- and revising the
model accordingly. Nevertheless, the model seems to work very well and
the formulations could easily be restated in terms of the structural
model by proposing that the patient's id wish to murder his father had
evoked unconscious objections by his superego that activated his ego's
mechanisms of defense to produce a dream that disguises this unconscious
drama.

In this light, we may ask, once again, why there's a need for anything
more? And, once again, the answer lies in a consciously denied, but
deep-unconsciously registered trigger. To clarify this point, let's
return to the vignette.

In the session, Dr Gregory offers an interpretation along the lines
discussed above -- about Mr Arkin's murderous wishes towards his father,
how these wishes are affecting his relationships with men, and how
[]{#9781403903426_09_ch3.html_page_38}they are coming into play 'in the
transference'. Mr Arkin pauses, nods in agreement and then says that he
has another association to his dream. Yesterday, which was the day of
the dream, while reading the newspaper, he came across a story about a
doctor who was found guilty of Medicare fraud in an amount close to half
a million dollars. The weird thing about it is that his picture was in
the newspaper and he looked a lot like Dr Gregory.

At first, Dr Gregory takes the emergence of this fresh material as
supportive of his intervention. After all, the material has become more
powerful and the distorted transference fantasy that has Mr Arkin
believing that he's being robbed of money by his therapist has obtained
a clearer representation in the disguised story about the doctor. But as
he's mulling this over, he suddenly remembers something that he'd
completely forgotten. During the previous month, he had called Mr Arkin
at work in order to cancel one of his sessions because he (Dr Gregory)
had developed an acute phlebitis of his leg and needed immediate medical
care. When writing out Mr Arkin's bill, he'd forgotten about the
cancelled hour and had charged his patient for the session. And he'd
accepted Mr Arkin's cheque with the over-payment as well -- his patient
seemed to have also missed the error.

Recognition of this interventional triggering event sheds entirely new
light on Mr Arkin's material in this session. Everything that was
interpreted from the Freudian vantage point as unconscious fantasy must
now be seen as unconscious perception. But even before we spell this
out, we should realize that many therapists who work with weak adaptive
approaches would not discover this missing trigger -- they'd have no
reason or motivation seek out a trigger of this kind and strong
unconscious motives for not doing so. Indeed, in this situation both the
therapist and patient had made use of denial and repression to
obliterate the conscious registration of this triggering event. Dr
Gregory over-billed his client, and for his part Mr Arkin accepted the
error and over-paid the fee. If the imagery and themes of the story
about the fraudulent doctor hadn't jarred Dr Gregory into suddenly
realizing consciously that he'd made a mistake, it's entirely possible
that the error would have been sustained and never consciously noticed
by either party to this psychotherapy. The use of denial precludes the
conscious recognition of this kind of trigger. Alertness to patients'
themes in the context of thinking of them as conveying encoded
perceptions of a triggering event, and searching for the evocative
trigger, are the only known means by which this kind of shared denial
can be uncovered and rectified.

[]{#9781403903426_09_ch3.html_page_39}As for trigger decoding this
material, we need first to dismiss the Freudian theory of innocuous
day's residues as the stimuli for dreams and realize that confining
oneself to such events serves as a defence against consciously
recognizing the existence of traumatic triggering events. We also must
forgo thinking of these images and themes initially as disguised
reflections of aroused fantasies. They are serving first and foremost as
Mr Arkin's means of encoding his unconscious perceptions of a traumatic
interventional trigger that did not register in his conscious awareness,
although it did register deep-unconsciously. It's this trigger more than
the lunch with Ernie that aroused the client's memory of his father's
financial treachery -- again, not as part of a string of fantasies and
wishes, but as an expression of a past reality that was being relived
again in the relationship with the therapist.

To be specific, Mr Arkin's dream of being robbed by his boss encodes his
unconscious perception that he is, in fact, being robbed by his
therapist. This is not a transference fantasy, but an accurate
perception of the therapist's behaviour regarding his bill. It's a clear
example of a patient's conscious system denial and obliteration
accompanied by a sound unconscious perception. The error is also
unconsciously perceived as an attempt to do violence to the patient --
as an attempt at murder. In this light, the memory of being robbed by
his father expresses Mr Arkin's deep unconscious experience that, by
over-billing and robbing him, the therapist is repeating the
exploitative act of theft that Mr Arkin's father had perpetrated on the
patient when he was an adolescent.

When Dr Gregory offered a weak adaptive transference interpretation
involving a purported unconscious source within Mr Arkin for his
relational problems with men, the patient responded with a powerful
story. But the responsive communication of power themes is not in and of
itself a sign of validation -- whether that is the case depends on the
nature of the themes. Thus, positively-toned themes generally speak for
validation, while negatively-toned themes, as is the case here, do not
-- they speak for an erroneous intervention. Thus, in serving as an
unconscious commentary on the therapist's interpretation, the patient's
unconscious message is that, in light of what he just said, Dr Gregory
is robbing him of a lot of money. This unconscious response is very
different from Mr Arkin's conscious reaction, which was to simply nod in
agreement.

In this situation, the new story served a second function. It's another
story of theft, but this time the images are far less disguised than
they were in the stories about Mr Arkin's boss and father -- they allude
to []{#9781403903426_09_ch3.html_page_40}a doctor who, in addition, is
said to have looked like Dr Gregory. These representations of the
therapist are called *close derivatives* -- that is, is they are
minimally disguised images. Thus, it seems likely that, quite
unconsciously, the patient was making an unconscious attempt to get his
therapist to consciously realize the existence of a critical triggering
intervention by the therapist that he (the patient) was unable to bring
into his own awareness. And the effort proved to be successful -- the
image did, indeed, enable Dr Gregory to forgo his use of his denial and
repressive defences to the point where the missing trigger finally
dawned on him. Remarkable encoded, trigger-evoked dramas of this kind go
on in psychotherapy every single day -- their recognition depends on how
a therapist listens and formulates.

#### **Summing up** {.h4}

I have in this chapter used Freud's topographic approach and his
structural model of the mind as representatives of weak adaptive
approaches. My aim was to show the logic of Freud's thinking and its
seeming support in well-chosen clinical observations. But, in addition I
have tried to show how this line of thought appears to serve conscious
system denial because the focus on the conscious registration of
relatively innocuous day's residues serves to obliterate and avoid the
deep unconscious registration of far more powerful, emotionally
disturbing triggering events. There's a strong, in-built tendency for
therapists to ignore or obliterate compelling, anxiety-provoking
triggers and to work with far lesser issues and meanings -- and to do so
in terms of fantasy formations and unconscious wishes. But, as the
vignette shows, these seeming fantasies actually serve to express valid
unconscious perceptions that are invisible to weak adaptive therapists.
Recognizing this kind of unconscious experience as expressed through
encoded narratives would take them and their patients to the dark side
of human emotional life where issues of therapists' errors, unconscious
guilt and needs for self-punishment, and life and death hold sway and
unconsciously direct the course of our lives. It has been wisely said
that doing adaptive psychotherapy asks a lot of the therapist -- but it
gives even more in return.

### The Conscious System {.h3a}

We turn now to a detailed study of the emotion-processing mind, which is
comprised of two operating systems -- *the conscious and deep
unconscious systems* -- along with several supplementary systems. As I
indicated in the first chapter, this mental module -- that is,
collection of mental faculties -- is an evolved, biological organ of
adaptation. As such, it has a set of inherent, universal features and
capabilities shared by all humans; variations on this basic
configuration depend on biological genetics/inherited factors, as well
as life experiences -- especially those that are death-related (Langs,
1995, 1997, 2002).

The conscious system, which is the main subject of this chapter, is that
part of the emotion-processing mind with which we are familiar
subjectively. It's the system that receives inputs of which we are
directly aware and which we use each day to cope with consciously
perceived emotionally-charged events and their meanings. Thus, it's the
source of our conscious thoughts, feelings, coping strategies and
behaviours. Nevertheless, the system operates under considerable
unconscious influence which is of a different order from the deep
unconscious, adaptive processing system that will be described in the
following chapter. In addition, it is greatly affected by two
supplementary systems that receive all emotionally relevant, incoming
information and meaning before conscious registration takes place. Let's
begin our study of the emotion-processing mind with a look as these two
entities.

#### []{#9781403903426_10_ch4.html_page_42}**The synthesizing and message analysing centres** {.h4}

In order to fully understand the operations of the conscious system, we
must take a closer look at the details of the architecture of the
emotion-processing mind (Goleman, 1985; Langs, 1986, 1987, 1995). There
are at least two unfamiliar postulated systems in this mental module
that play a crucial role in what we, as humans, are and are not aware of
in the emotional realm -- and, thereby, in how we adapt to environmental
impingements. In this regard, the first step in the mental processing of
all types of emotionally-charged, sensory/perceptive experiences is
carried out by a Synthesizing Centre (SC) which transforms raw sensory
data -- for example forms, shapes, sounds and so on -- into meaningful
components such as physical objects, living beings, words, and so forth.
Even here, at the very moment of sensory impact, unconsciously
determined errors may be made in the form of misperceptions and the
like. Nevertheless, most incoming raw stimuli are faithfully and
extremely rapidly transformed into meaningful elements for further
processing. These elements are then forwarded to an extremely critical
component of the emotion-processing mind called the Message Analysing
Centre (MAC).

The MAC is an autonomous, psychological sorting system that operates
automatically and unconsciously, again with great rapidity and under
considerable unconscious influence (Langs, 1986, 1987, 1995). It is the
'choice point' of emotionally-charged human experience in that the
system has the 'responsibility for deciding' which events and which
meanings of events can enter awareness, and which cannot. It has a
variety of evaluating capabilities that allow it to respond to emergency
situations in one way, and non-emergencies in another. Thus, when faced
with an immediate threat to life or limb for which prompt action is
called for -- for example being attacked by someone wielding a knife --
the MAC passes on to awareness many meanings of the situation that,
under less threatening conditions, it would bar from consciousness. In
essence, then, the recognition of an immediate threat lowers the MAC's
threshold for the entry of information and meaning into the conscious
system -- denial is reduced to a minimum.

In situations without a present threat to one's life, the MAC
unconsciously receives and recognizes both an emotionally-charged
trigger in its entirety, and all of its detectable universal and
personal meanings and implications -- that is, it determines incoming
meanings in context. It then responds to this concatenation of events
and meanings []{#9781403903426_10_ch4.html_page_43}on the basis of a
complex gradient that measures the potential of each of these incoming
elements to activate feelings of anxiety and depression, and their
likelihood of disrupting conscious-system functioning -- an assessment
that is measured against the sensory intensity and significance of the
elements themselves. In this way, the MAC 'decides' which events, and
which of their meanings, can move on to conscious registration and which
are to be shunted to the deep unconscious system for unconscious
registration and processing -- all of this in nanoseconds of time.

Surprisingly, the decisions made by the MAC appear to involve mutually
exclusive choices. Events and meanings of events are forwarded to only
one of the two systems of the emotion-processing mind -- conscious or
deep unconscious. As a rule, then, some meanings of an
emotionally-charged triggering event will be sent on for conscious
registration, while other meanings will be barred from awareness and
passed on to the deep unconscious system for registration there. The
remaining adaptive processing efforts are carried out by the two
receiving systems without crossover from one system to the other -- that
is, relatively independently.

The processing activities of the MAC indicate that when we speak of
conscious registration, we are describing a second-order mental event
and are referring to contents whose ramifications have been evaluated by
the MAC and allowed to enter awareness. And when we speak of
conscious-system defensiveness and denial, including perceptual denial,
we are actually alluding to the protective shield and defensive
activities of the MAC as it bars access of contents to awareness.
Similarly, when we speak of unconscious or subliminal perception, we are
referring to events and meanings that have, throughout, been perceived
and processed in the absence of awareness -- at first, by the MAC and
then by the deep unconscious system.

The MAC is by no means a simple cognitive apparatus. Its activities and
screening choices are governed by the nature of incoming reality events,
as well as complex unconscious, psychodynamic processes and anxiety and
other gradients. Sound nurturance and positive emotional experiences
tend to have salutary effects on the operations of the MAC and help to
keep its thresholds of anxiety low. Under these conditions, the
appearance of conscious-system denial is kept to a minimal level and
many anxiety-provoking events and meanings are allowed to enter
awareness and to be processed consciously. On the other hand, clinical
evidence shows that significant traumatic experiences, especially those
that evoke intense levels of death anxiety, lead
[]{#9781403903426_10_ch4.html_page_44}to an increase in the MAC's
threshold for the entry of contents into awareness and thereby increase
the mind's use of perceptual defences and conscious system denial. This
type of increased conscious system defensiveness, which interferes with
effective emotional adaptation, is often difficult to modify clinically.

There are two basic types of emotionally-charged events -- *emergency
and non-emergency experiences* -- and the MAC is designed to handle each
class in a different manner.*Emergency-related perceptions* involve
immediate dangers to life and limb. Under these circumstances, no matter
how painful and anxiety-provoking the triggering event may be, the
perceived danger is almost always directed to conscious awareness for a
rapid response. In the more usual, *non-emergency* type of perceptive
situation, the process described above -- the MAC's default position, so
to speak -- prevails.

As noted, the processing activities of the MAC take place at an
incredibly rapid rate so it can deal with the continuous and unrelenting
flow of unfolding events and shifting meanings that we, as humans,
experience each day. But these screening activities are vital to
survival because they spare the conscious mind an enormous amount of
distressing information and meaning that might otherwise lead to system
overload and cause serious dysfunctions and maladaptations.
Nevertheless, the resultant conscious-system denial and obliteration
have many detrimental consequences: they deprive us of a great deal of
critical information and meaning about ourselves and our environments,
limit our knowledge-base for adaptive responsiveness, restrict the
development of our adaptive capabilities, and stultify our emotional
growth and development. The operations of the MAC appear to reflect an
evolutionary trade-off in which the protection afforded by
conscious-system denial and ignorance is pitted against unrestricted
vision and knowledge. Indications are, however, that natural selection
has favoured the use of denial and our consequent ignorance over
perceptiveness and understanding, which is a most unusual outcome in the
evolutionary history of living entities.

The 'decision' as to which events and meanings are 'allowed' to reach
awareness and which are barred from doing so is a complex one. Some
enormously painful aspects of traumatic events do enter awareness, but
others do not. The nature of the trauma and its meanings, the ability of
a given individual's conscious system to tolerate disruptive inputs, and
his or her prior emotional history, especially as it pertains to
death-related traumas, all play a role. Nevertheless, in all cases
*unconscious perception precedes conscious perception* -- this is an
inherent and []{#9781403903426_10_ch4.html_page_45}universal property of
the human emotion-processing mind. In situations where conscious
registration is bypassed entirely, the result is termed *perceptual
denial,* the basic human form of denial and obliteration. This type of
denial is supported by behavioural forms of denial, actions that
interfere with conscious perceptions of traumatic events, and by mental
forms of denial that are applied to repressed contents that are thereby
blocked from reentering awareness.

#### **Some key features of the conscious system** {.h4}

#### *Mode of expression* {.h4a}

Turning now to the conscious system, clinical study has shown that while
its operations are under unconscious influence, much of it related to
death anxiety and deep unconscious guilt, its operations as an adaptive
system are quite apart and different from those of its counterpart --
the deep unconscious adaptive system. Communicative expressions from
this system come forth as manifest, directly stated messages that are
generally without disguise. The conscious system's perceptions,
processing activities and adaptive preferences are conveyed through two
kinds of communications: single-message intellectualizations and the
surface or manifest contents of double-message narratives. Manifest
contents that are not in awareness at any given moment, but are
potentially or easily made conscious -- so-called preconscious contents
-- also belong to the conscious system.

Quite apart from the deep unconscious system, then, the conscious system
has its own unconscious reservoir of memories, thoughts and feelings
which we call the *superficial unconscious subsystem of the conscious
system.* This subsystem houses two kinds of thoughts, fantasies,
perceptions, memories and the like: those that are easily brought into
awareness in total -- that is, manifestly and directly, without
disguise; and those that are dynamically repressed within the conscious
system and that are allowed into awareness in thinly disguised form. The
hallmark of these repressed, superficial unconscious contents is the
simplicity of their encoded representation and the ease with which the
image is decoded -- their disguised meanings are relatively transparent.
Such unconscious contents are relatively unempowered -- they do not deal
with the most compelling triggers and the most anxiety-provoking aspects
of emotional life. That role belongs to the more heavily disguised,
encoded messages that are emitted by the deep unconscious system. To
offer a simple illustration of conscious-system disguise, following a
moment when a male therapist became annoyed
[]{#9781403903426_10_ch4.html_page_46}with his female patient and spoke
harshly to her, an incident came to the patient's mind. It was a
situation in which one of her male teachers suddenly became unreasonably
annoyed with a question she asked in class and nastily put her off. The
trigger and disguised meaning of the image is relatively transparent and
easily decoded.

Many of the present-day versions of psychoanalysis, as well as all
non-analytic forms of treatment, appear to be *conscious-system forms of
therapy.* Their practitioners deal with patients' manifest material and,
at times, their seeming unconscious implications, extracting hidden
meanings from manifest themes and interpreting easily decoded disguised
images. They do not, as a rule, engage in the strong adaptive process of
trigger decoding themes and images in light of their evocative
triggering events which often involve their own interventions. This
means that their therapeutic endeavours are confined to relatively weak
conscious-system issues and that they have no means of realizing the
existence of, and dealing with, the far more powerful and difficult to
negotiate realm of deep unconscious experience and conflict. This kind
of therapy is limited by its unavoidable acceptance of patients'
conscious-system denial and obliteration, features that are inherent to
the system with which they work.

##### *A basic commitment to defence* {.h5}

While the conscious system has a wide range of capabilities that enables
us to negotiate the difficult waters of emotional life, a second basic
feature of this system of the emotion-processing mind is *its overriding
commitment in the emotional domain to adapt to emotionally-charged
triggering events primarily by means of psychological defences.* In this
connection, exploratory research has shown that, in all likelihood,
natural selection has orchestrated the evolution of the conscious system
on the basis of a template or set of selection pressures that are
comparable to those that served for the design of the immune system
(Langs, 1996). This is of importance because it supports the thesis that
the immune system has evolved to deal defensively with microscopic
predators, while the conscious system of the emotion-processing mind has
evolved to deal defensively with large predators, primarily other
humans. Defence against threat is the main shared feature of the two
systems.

Because the conscious system is basically designed to adapt to perceived
events in the external world, and to some extent the inner world as
well, the fundamental mental defences used by humans are *denial* and
*obliteration*. These are our primary reality-directed defences,
[]{#9781403903426_10_ch4.html_page_47}much as *repression* is our main
inner-directed defence against the conscious realization of unconscious
fantasies and memories. As noted above, the means by which these
fundamental reality-obliterating defences are effected is through the
screening activities of the MAC, and thus a great of denial takes place
on the perceptual level. This is an expensive defence and the source of
considerable emotional pain, largely because denial prevents us from
dealing with events and individuals who are causing us harm -- we are
simply unaware that this is the case. In addition, we have no conscious
means of realizing that we're making use of denial -- that is, we cannot
be aware of what we're not aware of. The use of this defence can,
however, be detected by searching for and finding encoded themes that
suggest the existence of an unrecognized trigger and using the themes as
a guide in searching for the obliterated trigger event that has evoked
them -- for example stories of someone who is nude in a public setting
which suggests that the therapist has revealed something personal about
himself to the patient. Short of that, an individual needs a
well-informed observer to detect the use of this mechanism.

The psychotherapy situation is an ideal place in which to detect the use
of denial and obliteration by patients -- and for the careful adaptive
listener, the therapist as well. This arises because therapists'
interventions are, as a rule, the triggers for the adaptive responses of
the deep unconscious systems of their patients' emotion-processing
minds. It follows, then, that therapists who keep track of their
interventions and are fully cognizant of their implications are in a
position to identify when a patient has or has not alluded directly and
consciously to a strong triggering intervention. In order to do this,
therapists themselves cannot make use of denial, lest they too fail to
consciously recognize a traumatic trigger that they have created for a
given patient. This is by no means an easy task because
adaptation-oriented clinical observations reveal that conscious-system
denial is far more pervasive than is generally recognized.

In the vignette offered in the previous chapter, the patient, Mr Arkin,
seemed to make use of a combination of perceptual denial and repression,
in that he knew that a session had been cancelled, but did not see or
realize consciously that he'd been overcharged for the month. He did,
however, perceive the error unconsciously, as witnessed by his encoded
themes. For his part, Dr Gregory knew of his absence from a scheduled
session, but had obliterated its memory while writing his patient's bill
-- here, too, both repression and denial appear to have played a role in
the failure to recall.

[]{#9781403903426_10_ch4.html_page_48}Denial is a costly defence. It
reduces a person's information about the world, about him or herself,
and about one's own inner state of mind and body. The events and
meanings that we obliterate are not available for conscious processing,
a problem that is made all the more difficult by our not having an easy
means of being able to realize that we're making use of these
obliterating defences. Indeed, it's only by consistently attending to
the themes in one's own stories and maintaining a vigilance for triggers
to which these themes may apply that a patient or therapist has any
chance of discovering what he or she has denied and obliterated. The
conscious mind is, however, not inclined to engage in activities that
involve the search for denied events and meanings. It seldom, if ever,
will examine narrative themes in a search for a missing and therefore
denied triggering event, much as it is disinclined to engage in
trigger-decoding and accessing deep unconscious experiences and
processes. As a result, the conscious mind tends to operate in a vast,
generally unrecognized sea of ignorance -- taking us along with it.
Reducing a patient's use of denial and obliteration is one of the
healing goals of psychotherapy and, with severely traumatized patients,
this is no easy task.

##### *The nature of unconscious influences on the conscious system* {.h5}

Clinical study indicates that the conscious system is impervious to
certain, largely constructive, unconscious influences, yet strongly
affected by unconscious motives that are seemingly disadvantageous and
self-defeating. Thus, the extremely profound and wise wisdom of the deep
unconscious system does *not,* by and large, affect conscious-system
adaptations. This arrangement evidently arises because deep unconscious
intelligence is built around triggers and perceptions that are
unbearable to awareness when experienced, and thus all output
communications from that system enter awareness in encoded form.
Decoding these messages in light of their evocative triggers is the only
means through which the conscious mind can take advantage of deep
unconscious intelligence -- it is not accessible through any direct
means. This point is also illustrated in the vignette offered in the
previous chapter, where we saw that Mr Arkin's conscious system was
unaffected by the perceptiveness, knowledge and sound adaptive
recommendations of his deep unconscious mind regarding his therapist's
overcharge. Deep unconscious perceptions and adaptive processing
activities are not intuited by the conscious mind, nor do they break
through in complete form into awareness, while their encoded
[]{#9781403903426_10_ch4.html_page_49}representation in narrative
vehicles does not allow for conscious usage. This is another unfortunate
consequence of the denial-prone design of the conscious system of the
emotion-processing mind.

On the other hand, there appear to be two major sources of unconscious
influence on the adaptive operations of the conscious system: death
anxiety and deep unconscious morality and ethics. The former has mixed
effects in that predatory death anxiety -- the fear of being harmed by
others -- tends to mobilize conscious-system resources, but it also may
activate denial mechanisms when the offending party is someone on whom
one is dependent. Existential death anxiety -- the fear of the
inevitability of personal demise -- tends to solely promote the
conscious system's use of denial mechanisms. The third form of death
anxiety, predator death anxiety -- the fear of being harmed in response
to having harmed others -- is connected with deep unconscious guilt and
needs for punishment. It affects the conscious system by orchestrating
self-defeating decisions and self-harmful actions. The sole positive
note in this regard is the finding that helpful acts are also perceived
by the deep unconscious system of morality and ethics and create
unconscious motives that support adaptive functioning and making wise
decisions.

##### *Attitudes towards ground rules and boundaries* {.h5}

Rules, frames and boundaries play a crucial role in emotional life and
in the process of psychotherapy (Langs, 1998b). The position taken by
the two processing systems of the emotion-processing mind on this aspect
of the human condition tend to be radically different and often
diametrically opposed. The deep unconscious system is centred on this
dimension of everyday life and psychotherapy, and through its encoded
messages, it advocates and supports an ideal and universal set of ground
rules that hold us well, are inherently healing, and enhance emotional
adaptations. In contrast, the conscious system tends to be insensitive
to this dimension of human experience and to be inclined towards
departures from the ideal frame -- that is, to favour frame
modifications which it supports with a wide variety of justifications
and rationalizations. Thus, in psychotherapy, conscious minds tend to
accept or prefer alterations in ground rules such as changes in the time
of sessions, reductions in fees, and violations of privacy and
confidentiality -- even though these rule infractions tend to be highly
maladaptive and emotionally harmful. This preference is partially
explained by the finding that frame violations are action forms of
[]{#9781403903426_10_ch4.html_page_50}denial and that they are, as well,
typically self-harmful -- that is, they satisfy unconsciously driven,
conscious-system needs for punishment.

When it comes to the ground rules of psychotherapy, then, the natural
proclivities of the conscious mind render it a very unreliable if not
treacherous source of guidelines. Nevertheless, weak adaptive forms of
therapy tend to be constructed on the basis of the conscious-system
thinking of both patients and their therapists. Doing so puts both
parties to therapy at risk with little or no way of appreciating the
harm that's being done by accepting conscious-system frame preferences.
This is one more reason that psychotherapists of all kinds should
seriously consider the framework findings derived from strong adaptive
clinical studies. They would do well to appreciate the frame preferences
of the far more reliable and constructive deep unconscious system -- a
subject to which we now turn.

### The Deep Unconscious System {.h3a}

The world experienced by the deep unconscious system of the
emotion-processing mind is very different from the world experienced by
the conscious system. There are notable differences in the events and
meanings of events encountered by each system, much as they differ in
needs, defensive alignment, adaptive preferences, intelligence and moral
position. Indeed, the world of deep unconscious experience is quite
unfamiliar to the conscious mind. Therapists who trigger-decode the
remarkable messages emanating from the deep system consistently are
impressed by the beauty, purity, creativity and inordinate wisdom
possessed by this entirely unconscious, adaptive system of the mind.
Most striking is the finding that while the conscious system often acts
against our best interests, the deep unconscious system is unfailing in
its efforts to heal our emotional wounds and to point to the most
optimal adaptive solutions to our emotionally-charged environmental
challenges and traumas. In a true sense, the deep system has many of the
attributes of a loving, caring inner God.

As noted in the previous chapter, the deep unconscious system is the
receptor site for all events and meanings that are deemed by the MAC to
be too potentially disruptive to be experienced consciously. These
emotionally powerful contents therefore never enter awareness directly
-- they're unconsciously perceived, registered and processed adaptively
without the least conscious sense that these experiences and processes
are taking place (Dixon, 1971, 1981; Smith, 1991; Langs,
[]{#9781403903426_11_ch5.html_page_52}1995, 1996; Haskell, 1999). Thus,
the deep unconscious system silently copes with some of the most painful
and forbidding emotional experiences with which we, as humans, are
compelled to deal. And it does so using its two basic subsystems -- one
devoted to evaluating and adaptively responding to environmental
impingements, and the other devoted to assessing and responding to
issues of morality and ethics. The operations of each of these
subsystems are based on a mixture of evolved, naturally selected design
features, personal heredity, and personal conscious and, more
importantly, unconscious experiences and learning.

#### **Deep unconscious wisdom** {.h4}

The *deep unconscious wisdom system or subsystem* is the
knowledge-based, adaptive processing component of the deep unconscious
mind -- a superb operational intelligence that carries out its functions
without awareness interceding. This subsystem is living proof that
intelligence and adaptation are activities that do not depend on
awareness. But, in addition, studies have shown that deep unconscious
intelligence is far superior to conscious intelligence, indicating that
in respect to emotionally-charged events, we cope better in the absence
of awareness than we do in its presence -- unconscious perceptions are
far better informed than conscious perceptions, which are restricted by
the extensive use of MAC-based denial.

The operations of the deep unconscious wisdom system are logical and
highly sensible, and based on a large number of considerations that
involve past, present and future events. The system also tunes in on and
evaluates the implications of the multiple meanings of a given
triggering event, weighs the pros and cons of various possible adaptive
responses, and arrives at the best possible adaptive solution to each
environmental challenge or traumatic trigger. And once, all things
considered, an adaptive solution has been reached, the entire process
from unconscious perception to adaptive recommendations are encoded in a
dream or story -- there's no direct access to these transactions. As a
result, access to deep unconscious adaptive activities can be made
solely by trigger-decoding communicated narrative themes in light of
their evocative triggering events. This is the only known means that we
have at present to bring the world of deep unconscious experience into
the conscious realm.

The deep unconscious wisdom system operates on the basis of perceptions
that are undistorted and quite accurate. The particular meanings of
events that are perceived and processed unconsciously by
[]{#9781403903426_11_ch5.html_page_53}a given individual are selected
from the universal meanings of the event in the context of personal
sensitivities. These meanings are experienced in frank and raw terms,
with an incisive understanding of the many implications of each
triggering event. The knowledge-based pool of memories available as
perspectives and the level of comprehension of the wisdom system far
exceeds the capabilities of the conscious system in these areas -- our
UQ (unconscious intelligence quotient) is much higher than our IQ
(conscious intelligence quotient). In addition, deep unconscious
adaptive preferences reflect a total basic devotion to the emotional
healing and best interests of the individual. The main exception to the
incisiveness and lucidity of the system is seen in some instances of
extreme trauma, during which *deep unconscious denial* holds sway. This
defence, which tends to be short-lived, is seen when a patient responds
to a blatantly harmful triggering event with positive narrative themes.
In time, these themes give way to those that are devastatingly damaging,
reflections of the true nature of the triggering event.

While the conscious system looks at many aspects of human experience,
deep unconscious intelligence is sharply focused on three areas, a
finding that is most clearly visible in the psychotherapy situation. For
both patients and therapists, the most intense concentration is on the
therapist's impingements on and management of the rules, frames and
boundaries of the treatment situation -- and on the patient's
frame-related preferences and activities as well. Patients' deep
unconscious wisdom systems monitor the level of listening and
intervening that a therapist adopts, and along different but related
lines their systems accurately assess the validity of each intervention
made by a therapist -- behaviourally and verbally. In this regard, the
deep unconscious wisdom system consistently validates the offer and
enforcement of an ideal set of secured ground rules and boundaries for
the treatment experience, supports therapists' listening to the encoded
level of communication, and endorses trigger-decoded interpretations.
The system universally disconfirms -- subjects to non-validation -- all
departures from the ideal frame and all interventions made on the level
of manifest contents and their implications.

In the vignette presented in [Chapter
3](#9781403903426_09_ch3.html_ch3), Mr Arkin's deep unconscious system
generated two encoded narratives -- his dream and his associations to
the dream. Each story conveyed aspects of his unconscious perceptions of
his counsellor, Dr Gregory, in light of the consciously denied, but
unconsciously recognized overcharge that the therapist had made.
Together, the stories reflect a raw, accurate, undefended picture of the
therapist in light of the triggering event -- the overcharge -- as
[]{#9781403903426_11_ch5.html_page_54}someone who had committed fraud
and was stealing money from his patient and who deserved to be punished
for his crime (the contribution of the deep unconscious moral system).
There's no distortion here and no sign of denial, only a frank and
incisive encoded unconscious view of the triggering event and its
perpetrator.

#### **Deep unconscious morality and ethics** {.h4}

The deep unconscious subsystem of morality and ethics evaluates every
thought we think, word we say, and deed we perform, and it does so on
the basis of a very strict, ideally suitable, universal moral code. The
system also has enormous powers of enforcement in the form of
unconsciously orchestrated rewards and punishments. These issues come to
the fore in psychotherapy largely because clinical studies of thematic
responses to modifying and securing the frame have shown that *on the
deep unconscious level, the ground rules of psychotherapy are
experienced as ethical and moral precepts by both parties to treatment.*
Thus the nature of the frame conditions that a therapist offers to a
patient speaks for the therapist's moral position and his or her
integrity -- or its lack. Much the same applies to the patient -- the
ground rules that he or she accepts or rejects, or tries to modify
unilaterally, speak for his or her moral position as well.

While conscious-system morality is highly individualized, variable among
and within individuals, and easily corrupted, deep unconscious morality
is based on a universal set of standards that speak for compassion and
caring for others and for personal integrity as well. Similarly, there's
an ideal set of deep-unconsciously sought ground rules and boundaries
for all forms of psychotherapy -- a ground-rule archetype, if you will.
Adherence to these rules -- for example establishing a set fee, time and
place for the therapy, and maintaining total privacy and confidentiality
-- provides a patient with a strong sense of safety, holding, and a
positive sense of the moral turpitude of the therapist, whom it also
holds and heals. On the other hand, departures from these optimal ground
rules are unconsciously experienced as immoral and harmful to both
participants to treatment, and as compromising the safety and holding
qualities of the therapeutic relationship. In principle, then, all
ground-rule transactions and interpretations raise moral issues that are
unconsciously processed by the deep unconscious system of morality and
ethics with the aid of deep unconscious wisdom.

In addition to responding to the vicissitudes of the ground rules of
therapy, the deep unconscious system of morality and ethics is
[]{#9781403903426_11_ch5.html_page_55}activated whenever a therapist
offers an erroneous intervention -- one that is not validated
unconsciously by the patient. Most of these interventions cause harm to
the patient and evoke unconscious perceptions in both parties to therapy
related to what is experienced unconsciously as the immorality of the
hurtful healer. Given the fact that most therapists offer their patients
modified frames and interventions that fail to obtain unconscious
confirmation, we can appreciate that unconscious guilt is the primary
occupational hazard of weak adaptive psychotherapists.

Similar moral issues arise when patients work over situations in which
they have harmed others -- at times the therapist, but most often people
outside of treatment. To cite one such example, patients who have been
involved in elective abortions tend to show strong resistances against
exploring their deep unconscious reactions to such events, much of it
based on predator death anxiety. When these resistances diminish and the
related unconscious issues emerge in sessions, themes of guilt and
suicide tend to emerge -- reflections of the demands of the deep
unconscious system of morality and ethics for self-punishment for a deed
that is unconsciously experienced as murder. It takes a great deal of
working through and repentance before this persistent moral system shows
indications of forgiveness.

As noted, therapists who work on the basis of weak adaptive principles
and who tend to offer modified frame conditions and non-validated
interventions to their patients are well-advised to be mindful of these
issues. Such interventions, which unconsciously are experienced as
harmful predatory acts, tend to create predatory death anxiety in the
patient and are often an unconsciously mediated way of providing
patients who are guilt-ridden with a measure of the punishment that they
are unwittingly seeking. The therapist in turn will unconsciously
experience him or herself as predatory to the patient, suffer from
predator death anxiety and deep unconscious guilt, and engage in
self-punitive behaviours. As a result, both parties to therapy suffer
unknowingly. Securing the frame and making unconsciously validated,
strong adaptive interventions is, as far as I know, the only known
antidote to these harmful situations.

#### **Comparing the conscious and deep unconscious systems** {.h4}

The two systems of the emotion-processing mind, conscious and deep
unconscious, operate on the basis of very different perceptions,
[]{#9781403903426_11_ch5.html_page_56}premises, needs, adaptive
preferences, intelligence, and so on. The following sums up the
differences between the two systems:

1[]{.pad}Deep unconscious adaptive processing is, as a rule, undefended
and unencumbered. In contrast, conscious efforts to cope are greatly
hampered by the continuous use of the defence mechanisms of denial and
obliteration which limit the adaptive choices available to the system.

2[]{.pad}The knowledge-base for deep unconscious processing, which is
not restricted by denial, is far superior to that used by the conscious
system. Adhering to encoded, deep unconscious choices is far more
salutary than adhering to choices made by the denial-prone conscious
mind.

3[]{.pad}Deep unconscious processing is fully committed to sound
adaptive choices, reasonable consideration for others, and self-healing.
Conscious processing, which is compromised by the influence of death
anxiety and deep unconscious guilt, often leads to self-harmful choices
and behaviours.

4[]{.pad}Deep unconscious processing is based on incisive moral and
ethical evaluations and the system's choices are always morally strong.
Conscious processing often neglects such considerations and the system's
choices are often morally compromised.

5[]{.pad}Deep unconscious processing is highly focused and concentrates
primarily on frame impingments, the validity of a therapist's
interventions, and the level at which he or she listens and intervenes.
In contrast, conscious processing entails an exploration of many
different dimensions of life and the therapeutic process, many of them
of little emotional consequence. It also tends to avoid ground-rule
issues, to refrain from examining emotionally-charged triggering events
in depth, and to steer clear of trigger-decoding.

6[]{.pad}The results of deep unconscious processing reach awareness
solely through encoded narratives, while the outcome of conscious
processing is conveyed through manifest contents and their implications.

7[]{.pad}In regard to responses to interventions, encoded forms of
validation -- for example the emergence of positive narrative themes --
tend to offer highly reliable guidelines in respect to an intervention's
accuracy and healing effects. In contrast, conscious support for an
intervention may, or as is more often the case, may not be reliable and
therefore may speak for a patient's need for errant and harmful
therapeutic work. To be considered valid, a conscious affirmation of an
intervention must be accompanied by encoded support as well.

[]{#9781403903426_11_ch5.html_page_57}As humans, then, we experience and
adapt to the world of emotional impingements with minds that are
naturally and deeply divided. The lives we lead and the therapies we
conduct are dramatically different depending on which system we listen
to and take as our guide for understanding and intervening. While deep
unconscious wisdom is wiser, more trustworthy and more healing than
conscious wisdom, the human mind is not naturally inclined to seek and
heed it's advice and directives. The principles of the strong adaptive
approach can take therapists a long way towards rectifying the
disadvantages that nature has wrought in naturally selecting many
defensive and self-defeating features for the conscious system of the
emotion-processing mind.

#### **Deep unconscious sensitivity to therapeutic interventions** {.h4}

With the sole exception of rare, extremely severe outside traumas, once
a patient enters psychotherapy, his or her deep unconscious perceptions
and processing activities are focused on their therapists'
interventions. This is, of course, another difference from the conscious
system which will address events both outside and within therapy, most
often the former. In addition, patients in therapy tend to process
outside traumatic events consciously rather than deep-unconsciously --
the experienced unconscious ramifications of these events tend to be
superficial rather than deep.

This finding indicates that most trigger-decoded interpretations will,
of necessity, pertain to a therapist's own interventions, broadly
defined to include everything of significance that a therapist does and
does not do. The illumination of the unconscious meanings of emotional
problems and symptoms in the everyday life of the patient is carried out
by exploring these within treatment issues. This work is supplemented by
discovering connections between a patient's deep unconscious responses
to a therapist-evoked triggering event and the patient's symptoms and
behavioural problems outside of therapy.

Among the evident reasons for this deep unconscious focus by patients on
the efforts of their healers is the innate tendency of living beings to
concentrate their adaptive efforts on immediate adaptive challenges --
for patients in therapy, then, these are their therapists'
interventions. The deep unconscious system carries forward this
biological tradition in virtually all instances, while the conscious
system does so only intermittently. In addition, this deep unconscious
concentration seems to be based on the role of the psychotherapist as
[]{#9781403903426_11_ch5.html_page_58}a healer of human suffering, much
like shamans, priests, ministers, rabbis and physicians. Finally,
therapists are responsible for establishing the conditions of a therapy
situation, including its rules, frames and boundaries, and for
intervening in this regard as well. These are fundamental aspects of
relatedness and efforts at healing that have enormous effects on
patients and greatly influence the course of their therapies and their
lives. Patients' deep unconscious systems therefore quite wisely pay
careful attention to their therapists' words and deeds, while in general
the conscious minds of patients are inclined to deny the pervasive
effects that their therapists have on them and tend to look elsewhere
for such authority.

#### **The output centre** {.h4}

Having considered the intake and operating systems of the
emotion-processing mind, a few words are in order regarding its Output
Centre (OC) -- the unconscious system that receives all incoming
information and meaning and their adaptive processing, and 'decides' on
what is to be suppressed and what is to be expressed -- and how this is
to be done (Langs, 1986, 1987). The OC receives both conscious and deep
unconscious impressions, evaluations, links to past experiences and
adaptive responses, and then organizes them into a unity. It also has
access to a wide variety of output modes of expression -- affects,
conscious thoughts, vehicles of encoded communication like dreams and
stories, physical and psychological symptoms, and behaviours -- many of
them, like gross behavioural resistances in the form of frame
violations, directed at the therapist and therapy.

All in all, the OC amasses an enormous amount of information and meaning
and then 'chooses' an expressive response to each incoming emotional
stimulus or trigger -- especially those that are perceived and processed
deep-unconsciously. Perhaps the most basic consideration involves the
choice between a verbal or behavioural response -- that is, a conscious
thought or comment, or an encoded narrative message on the one hand, or
a physical reaction such as a bodily healing or illness or a behavioural
response on the other.

Factors in making these choices include the patient's preferred mode of
output response -- mainly, whether it's bodily or via action versus the
use of verbalized messages and imagery; the nature of the triggering
event to which the patient is responding -- mainly, whether the
therapist has intervened by acting out though frame violations or has
secured the frame and is also making use of verbal-affective
interventions like
[]{#9781403903426_11_ch5.html_page_59}interpretations; the power of the
interventional triggers in respect to their death-related connections
and other sources of anxiety; the conditions of the therapy -- mainly,
whether they favour acting out versus verbal expression; and the overall
status of the patient's psychological resources. The role that the
therapist plays in the patient's choice of output vehicle is of great
importance.

#### **An illustrative vignette** {.h4}

Mr Turner was driving his car when he inadvertently went through a stop
sign and was hit by another car. On impact, his 10 year-old son, Martin,
who was in the passenger seat, struck his head against the side of the
car and suffered a fractured skull. He was comatose briefly, but
eventually recovered, although there was some minor residual brain
damage.

In his psychotherapy with Dr Sparks, a male psychiatrist, it was
discovered that following the accident, Mr Turner repeatedly made poor
business decisions and suffered from many seemingly 'bad breaks'. His
marriage inexplicably turned sour and his wife divorced him; a promising
business venture in which he had invested heavily somehow failed.

With the frame well-secured for several years, themes of harming others
and of accidental murder began to emerge in Mr Turner's material. Almost
always, they were accompanied by themes of self-harm and suicide.
Repeated interpretations were made to the effect that Mr Turner's
unconscious view of his having damaged his son was that he had, in
effect, murdered him. Also interpreted was his conscious and unconscious
guilt over the incident, and his inner wish to punish himself in kind by
taking his own life or by finding ways to suffer socially and in
business. Encoded, unconscious validation usually followed these
interpretations, but it took many years of therapy before the imagery
became less punitive and more forgiving, and Mr Turner was able to
straighten out his life.

This vignette illustrates the powerful effects of predator death anxiety
and deep unconscious guilt on conscious decisions and behaviours.
Morality and ethics are often matters of life and death -- in and
outside of psychotherapy.

### Ground Rules and Boundaries {.h3a}

Clinical studies within the framework of the strong adaptive approach
have made it unmistakably clear that the management and status of the
ground rules, boundaries and physical setting of psychotherapy -- its
*frame or framework* -- are highly complicated and critical aspects of
the treatment experience and important factors in its outcome (Langs,
1982, 1997, 1998b; Smith, 1991; Gabbard and Lester, 1995). This aspect
of therapy affects the nature and meanings of the communications
exchanged between patient and therapist, and in addition has a large
number of psychological meanings and behavioural effects.

The main reason that these ideas are unfamiliar to weak adaptive
therapists lies with the finding that the conscious system with which
they work is frame-insensitive. Indeed, the deep unconscious system
alone shows a profound appreciation for this dimension of treatment and
life itself. And it's solely through trigger-decoding patients'
responses to therapists' frame-related interventions -- for example
their managing the ground rules and interpreting their implications for
patients -- and thereby gaining access to the relevant deep unconscious
experiences and frame preferences of the deep unconscious system that
the importance and range of effects of this dimension of therapy can be
appreciated. These ideas find ready support as soon as a therapist
begins to attend to his or her patients' encoded responses to
frame-related efforts. With utmost regularity, one finds validation for
frame-securing interventions (that is, adhering to the set of
deep-unconsciously sought, ideal ground rules) and non-validation for
frame modifying endeavours (that is, departures from these ideals).
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_61}Unlike the highly variable
frame-related attitudes of the conscious system, the deep unconscious
system is extremely consistent in this regard.

#### **Two approaches to the functions of frames** {.h4}

The clinical propositions and beliefs that therapists develop about a
given aspect of psychotherapy depend entirely on the means by which they
listen to, formulate and validate (if at all) the meanings that they
ascribe to patients' behaviours and communicated material. There are,
then, two basic approaches to formulating the functions of the setting,
ground rules and boundaries of psychotherapy, and they lead to very
different viewpoints on this subject.

The first is called the *conscious-system approach* -- the exploration
of the manifest thoughts and communications from patients and their
therapists. On this level, we find that conscious minds vary greatly in
respect to their attitudes towards rules, frames and boundaries, and
that they tend to ignore this dimension of therapy and lean towards
loosely defined frames that are replete with departures from
deep-unconsciously sought ideals. The handling of ground rules is
generally thought of as a matter of personal choice, open to all types
of opinions and possibilities, without clear underlying principles, and
as having minimal and unpredictable effects on the treatment experience.
These attitudes appear to be accounted for by the two primary
unconscious influences on conscious thinking -- death anxiety and guilt.
This is the case largely because departures from the ideal frame
unconsciously tend to function as ways of offering maladaptive and often
self-punitive protection against the entrapping, existential death
anxieties and conflicts that arise under secured frame conditions (see
also below).

The second type of perspective on the ground rules is called the *deep
unconscious system approach*. This type of listening and formulating is
based on trigger-decoding patients' narrative themes in response to
frame-related triggering events -- for example the set of ground rules
that therapists propose for therapy in the initial session, frame lapses
by therapists, as seen when they begin a session late or make an error
in billing. Clinical studies have shown that the deep unconscious minds
that are reflected in the encoded responses have remarkably uniform
attitudes towards frame conditions, with little or no variation among
patients. The encoded narratives consistently support and speak for a
*deep-unconsciously sought set of ideal ground rules,* and just as
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_62}consistently reject as
inappropriate and harmful all departures from these ideals. This
uniformity speaks for an evolved, archetypal, universal set of
unconsciously preferred, deeply needed and healing, rules, frames and
boundaries -- a significant finding that is quite alien to conscious
thinking. Indeed, trigger-decoding also confirms that the management of
the ground rules of treatment has extensive effects on virtually every
aspect of the therapy experience.

#### **The basic ground rules** {.h4}

Years of clinical study have enabled adaptive therapists to define a
basic set of unconsciously validated, ideal ground rules and boundaries
that pertain to the deep unconscious needs of all patients and
therapists. These rules demarcate so-called *secured frames* and
*secured frame therapies,* while treatment situations that are
structured without one or more of these ideal precepts are called
*deviant* or *modified frame therapies.*

Adhering to the ideal or optimal ground rules is the means by which both
participants to a treatment situation are afforded safety, holding,
caring and inherent support. A therapist's ability to hold to this frame
also has unconsciously mediated healing powers. Conforming to theses
rules also helps to set limits on the extent of damage that one party to
therapy can cause the other party. Thus, these codes of behaviour tend
to preclude or minimize patients' conscious and unconscious inclinations
to do psychological damage to their therapists, and, likewise,
therapists' inclinations to psychologically damage their patients.
There's a measure of harm for all concerned in every frame modification,
no matter how necessary. That said, it's also important to realize that,
nevertheless, it's quite feasible to do effective psychotherapy under
frame-modified conditions. This is especially true when the departures
from ideal conditions are an utter necessity, although much of the
success depends on the use of proper techniques.

The tried and tested ideal framework of psychotherapy includes:

1[]{.pad}A single, professional locale with a suite that is used by the
therapist alone and that has a sound-proofed consultation room.

2[]{.pad}A group of relatively stable ground rules including a single,
set fee, and a set time, length and frequency of sessions -- the
so-called *fixed frame.*

3[]{.pad}Full responsibility for both parties to be present for all
scheduled sessions.

[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_63}4[]{.pad}The patient's fiscal
responsibility for the time and, therefore, for all scheduled sessions.

5[]{.pad}The therapist's prerogative and responsibility to take
occasional vacations that are announced well in advance.

6[]{.pad}Total privacy, with no access to the therapy in any form by
outside (third) parties.

7[]{.pad}Total confidentiality, with no note-taking or recording of the
transactions of sessions by either party and no release of information
of any kind.

8[]{.pad}The relative anonymity of the therapist, with no deliberate
self-revelations, advice, opinions, directives, extraneous comments, and
so on.

9[]{.pad}The fundamental rule of *free association,* with the patient
directed to say whatever comes to mind, generally supplemented with the
rule of *guided associations* that advises patients to communicate
dreams and other forms of narrative expression, and to seek narrative
associations to these so-called *origination narratives.*

10[]{.pad}The therapist's obligation to intervene as called for by the
patient's communications and behaviours, basing interventions entirely
on the material from the immediate session.

11[]{.pad}The therapist's offer of (neutral) interventions that are
likely to obtain encoded, deep unconscious validation -- in effect, the
use of appropriate silences, trigger-decoded interpretations, and
efforts to secure the ideal conditions of treatment at the behest of the
patient's encoded narrative material.

12[]{.pad}The absence of physical contact between the two parties to the
therapy.

13[]{.pad}Confinement of the contact between the patient and therapist
to the time and place of the sessions.

14[]{.pad}A group of less well-defined, implicit rules such as the
therapist's full dedication to the therapeutic needs of the patient.

It's quite evident that in today's world of psychotherapy, very few
therapists offer, or indeed are able to offer, their patients these
ideal conditions for treatment. While there is, as noted, a measure of
harm meted out to both patient and therapist under these circumstances,
both parties also have an unconscious perspective as to the necessity
for frame modifications when such is the case -- for example patients
whose finances are such that they can be seen only if there are
third-party payers, and patients who can only afford a clinic-type
therapy. In addition, strong curative interventions are feasible under
deviant []{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_64}conditions because
patients tend to repeatedly encode their deep unconscious perceptions of
the implications of the modified frame elements. In response, then,
therapists can offer trigger-decoded interpretations that, if properly
formulated and unconsciously validated, provide patients with healing
insights and often lead to the rectification of those aspects of the
ground rules than can be secured.

In addition to social and financial necessities, there are many reasons
for the almost universal laxity in therapists' approaches to the
framework of psychotherapy. Much of it stems from the aforementioned
effects of death anxiety and guilt that unconsciously motivate the turn
to modified frames. Another factor is the natural preference of
conscious minds for denial-based defences, a tendency that is
well-served by modified frames -- violations of ground rules serve to
unconsciously convince participants that they also are exceptions to the
existential ground rule that life is inevitably followed by death. To
support these denial-based tendencies, conscious minds tend to prefer
relatively unprincipled approaches to therapy, loosely defined frame
conditions, and the use of intuitive interventions that lack support
from unconscious validation. These trends are buttressed with highly
defensive, essentially misguided conscious-system criticisms of more
defined, adaptive approaches to psychotherapy as unduly rigid and
insensitive to patients' therapeutic needs. The alternative deep
unconscious view is quite to the contrary in that it's been clinically
found that unconsciously validated, circumscribed precepts of technique
and well-defined prescriptions for the frameworks of therapy not only
serve patients' deep therapeutic needs, but also enhance a therapist's
sensitivity to the implications and meanings of patients' material.
Well-articulated, strong adaptive precepts also facilitate sound
empathic responsiveness, safeguard the effectiveness of a therapist's
interventions, and inherently protect the patient from the unintentional
harm caused by most undisciplined, so-called intuitive interventions.

As for the role of economic factors in the neglect of frame conditions,
there are motives in both patients and therapists that fuel wishes for
modified frames and the denial of their detrimental qualities. There
are, of course, many patients who cannot afford the standard fees
charged by psychotherapists. These individuals must therefore be seen
for reduced fees, find insurance coverage, or be treated in low-cost
treatment settings like clinics. In most of these situations, however,
unneeded frame violations abound, and with them, the potential for
unnecessary harm to the patient and deep unconscious guilt in the
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_65}therapist. The attempt to deny
this guilt motivates therapists to consciously deny the harmful
consequences of modified conditions for treatment, even as they
unwittingly punish themselves for their frame violations. In addition,
financial pressures prompt therapists to sanction and offer patients all
manner of frame violations so they can collect fees from third parties
like insurance companies. Money corrupts, even in psychotherapy.

Along different lines, the existential death anxieties of therapists
evoked by secured frames unconsciously motivates them to ignore frame
conditions and to prefer to work in modified frames. The ideal, secured
frame is temporally limiting and, in a sense, creates an entrapping
closed space, much as human life goes on for a limited time and is
confined to our planet. Death looms unconsciously in both situations,
thereby evoking unconscious anxieties that are in need of processing and
resolution. Doing psychotherapy in deviant frames is a way of acting out
the denial of death -- rules, including those about death following
life, do not apply to all concerned. Typically, frame breaks are invoked
to gain temporary but costly relief from underlying anxieties in lieu of
searching for their insightful resolution.

In addition, for most therapists their own therapeutic experience is or
was based on a conscious-system, weak adaptive approach and was
therefore likely to have been replete with departures from the ideal
ground rules. Such therapists have not personally experienced
frame-related interventions, secured frame conditions, or
trigger-decoded interpretations of their deep unconscious perceptions of
frame conditions. In addition, because of their natural tendencies to
identify with their own therapists, these practitioners are inclined to
offer ground-rule conditions that are similar to those that had been
offered to them by their own therapists. In this way, their therapists'
frame-related denials and avoidances become their own frame-related
denials and avoidances -- a vicious circle that's very difficult to
interrupt.

#### **Frame-related interventions** {.h4}

Insight-oriented therapists are accustomed to think of themselves as
offering a variety of verbalized interventions that are ultimately
designed to offer patients insights into various unconscious aspects of
their personal psychology -- interpretations of meaning and of genetic
connections between the present and the past chief among them.
Frame-related interventions, which are seldom considered, are however of
a different order than the usual verbal efforts of a therapist.
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_66}While they may involve
interpretations of meaning, there is in addition a second, very
distinctive component to these efforts -- the actual management of the
rules that define the conditions of treatment and the behaviours of the
participants. When a frame issue arises, therapists are obliged to not
only interpret the relevant encoded material, they must also take a
position: they have no choice but to either sustain the use of the
ground rule in question or to not do so.

In conscious-system forms of therapy, this decision is left to the
therapist and is arbitrarily defined as a matter of his or her 'good
judgment'. In deep unconscious system forms of therapy, however, the
decision is made by the patient's deep unconscious wisdom system and
imparted in encoded form to the therapist for his or her use. Thus, it's
been found clinically that whenever a ground-rule issue arises, patients
virtually always encode the proper response that should be adopted by
the therapist -- *and it's always in the direction of securing the
frame*. In principle, then, the ground rules of therapy are managed by
adaptive therapists at the behest of patients' encoded, frame-securing
directives. While these needs exist in the deep unconscious minds of
both participants to treatment, the patient serves as the guide to how
and when to intervene because he or she is obliged to free associate and
narrate. Properly trigger-decoded, these narratives and the deep
unconscious wisdom that they embody and disguise are the most reliable
healing force in the psychotherapy experience.

All in all, frame-related interventions are unique in a number of ways.
Their action component -- the actual position that the therapist takes
-- is in and of itself a message to the patient, one that is far more
powerful than the therapist's verbal comments. In general, however,
there's a tendency for therapists who offer insightful trigger-decoded
interpretations to also be inclined towards frame-securing attitudes and
interventions, while those who tend to use interventions based on
manifest contents and their implications generally lean towards
frame-modifying therapeutic choices. The importance of a therapist's
position on these matters is seen in the finding that frame-related
attitudes unconsciously reflect the therapist's moral code and, in
addition, speaks for his or her preferred mode of adapting to
emotion-related events and anxieties: deep understanding and frame
securing is one choice, and the lack of deep insight and the use of
frame violations, and thereby acting out, is the other.

While patients and therapist generally are not consciously mindful of
these distinctions, they are very sensitive to them at the deep
unconscious level. Thus, even when financial need requires that a
patient []{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_67}be in a low-fee therapy or
in one covered by insurance, these frame-deviant conditions activate
strong unconsciously-driven tendencies in both parties to the therapy to
act out and modify frames far beyond the necessary minimum. Patients
often tend to be late to these therapy sessions, to arbitrarily miss
sessions, to fail to pay their fees, and to frequently request changes
in the time of their hours. For their part, these conditions prompt
therapists to be inclined to make frame-violating 'deals' with their
patients that are designed either to help the patient avoid their
coinsurance responsibilities, or to earn a larger than the contracted
fee for themselves. They also tend to go along with most of their
patients' requests for additional frame modifications and introduce many
unnecessary frame changes themselves. For the conscious system of the
emotion-processing mind, deviation begets deviation and it becomes not
only an unhelpful way of doing therapy, it is soon an unhelpful way of
living one's life. A shift by the therapist towards securing the frame
to the greatest extent feasible, and his or her ability to process and
interpret patients' requests to alter the frame, are the best antidotes
to these inclinations.

To cite a brief example, when all options are open, securing a ground
rule or alternatively modifying it are very different ways of coping
with secured-frame, existential death anxieties -- successfully in the
first case and unsuccessfully in the other. A therapist who
unnecessarily advocates or invokes a frame modification unwittingly
speaks for his or her own unresolved, unconscious existential death
anxieties and for coping by means of frame-deviant acts rather than
through holding frames secured and seeking deep insight. In addition,
these frame modifications are harmful to all concerned, and therapists
who gratuitously offer less than ideal conditions for treatment are
expressing their unconscious need to damage their patients -- and
themselves as well. No amount of words can undo these telling, enacted
messages from therapists to their patients, nor can words lessen the
impact of their acts. Technically, this means that proper frame
management is a top priority in psychotherapy. It should entail the
offer of sound trigger-decoded interpretations of patients' unconscious
perceptions of secured and modified frames (the meaning aspect); and in
the case of rectifiable ground-rule deviations, the interpretive effort
should be accompanied by actual, frame-securing efforts (the action
aspect).

Another unique feature of frame-related interventions is that their
management and interpretation influences all other transactions between
the parties to the treatment situation. This includes the mode
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_68}of communicative exchange, the
meanings of what is expressed, the unconscious perceptions that each
party to the therapy has of the other party, and the prevailing mode of
'cure' or symptom relief -- be it through frame modifications that bring
temporary but costly emotional relief to the patient (frame
modifications always cause a measure of emotional harm), or through the
healing powers of the secured frame and the deep adaptive insights that
can be developed under those conditions.

It needs to be stressed that while the conscious minds of the
participants in a treatment experience may or may not be mindful of
ground-rule conditions, the deep unconscious mind continuously monitors
and responds to this dimension of the situation. Thus, even in therapy
settings where the ground rules are entirely neglected, loosely
constructed or subjected to continual change, the deep unconscious
system's need for a secured frame persists in both parties to treatment
and they are adversely affected by the deviant aspects of the frame
conditions. Patients -- and often their therapists as well -- may
develop new symptoms because of their unconscious perceptions of being
harmed by their therapists' frame modifications. They may also become
quite resistant to their therapists' ministrations and begin to act out
in frame-deviant ways themselves -- both within the therapy and in their
outside lives.

Despite the belief of most conscious minds that therapists are in a
position to define any reasonable set of ground rules that they deem
advisable, the deep unconscious system does not accept arbitrary rules
as the best possible conditions for the treatment experience -- it
sustains its insistence for a more ideal set of ground rules for the
therapy. The deep unconscious system has a fixed blueprint in mind and
it assesses the conditions of every therapy and every life situation
accordingly, much as it takes the measure of all concerned in light of
the frame conditions that they propose, accept or reject. The conscious
mind must be reminded again and again of the deep unconscious need for,
and belief in, a single set of ground rules -- an ideal frame for a
therapy experience. It's an unchanging requisite for emotional health
that's quite alien to conscious thinking.

In this light, we can see why it's incumbent upon all therapists to be
aware of the existence of this dimension of therapy and to develop a
sense of the ideal frame. It's also of value to learn how to work well
in both secured and modified frames (the latter is especially
challenging) and to develop the ability to listen to the communications
from patients for encoded frame-related messages. Most importantly, it's
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_69}important for therapists to
mistrust their own and their patients' conscious opinions in respect to
rules and boundaries, and to have a strong sense of the unconscious
ramifications of both secured and modified frame conditions. With the
goal of fostering the development of these skills and insights, let's
look more closely at the ideal, deep-unconsciously sought frame.

#### **Secured frames** {.h4}

Therapies in which the ideal ground rules are offered and adhered to in
their entirety are called *secured-frame therapies.* In addition, in
treatment situations in which the basic ground rules include departures
from the ideal frame, there may be *secured-frame moments.* These are
interludes in which a modified ground rule is challenged by a patient,
usually through a request to further alter the rule, and the therapist,
using the patient's encoded directives, adheres to the ground rule in
question. To cite a brief example:

Mr Adams, a low-fee clinic patient, asks his therapist, Mr Bell, for a
fee reduction because he (the patient) has taken on some extra debt.
When the therapist encourages him to continue to say whatever is coming
to mind, the patient then tells a story about his mother's
over-indulgence of him with food and money, which sent him down the path
to drug abuse -- she should have known better than to have done that.

With the narrative in hand, the therapist interprets that if he were to
reduce his fee, the patient would unconsciously perceive him as
over-indulgent and inviting him to become addicted again to drugs. His
comment that his mother should have known better than to do that kind of
thing clearly advises the therapist to know better and not offer a fee
reduction. The patient responds by recalling the only business customer
he ever worked with who refused to get involved with him in a kick-back
scheme he had dreamt up. He then adds that it feels stuffy in the
therapist's office today.

This last segment contains an encoded, unconsciously validating image
(the customer's refusal to violate the law), as well as an indication of
secured-frame anxieties (the stuffiness of the office). A similar
sequence is seen in private psychotherapy when circumstances change so
as to permit the therapist to secure a deviant ground rule -- for
example, when it proves possible to eliminate insurance coverage for
treatment because a patient has developed the financial means to pay for
treatment []{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_70}on his own. The
rectification of the frame is followed with the patient's encoded,
validating imagery and then indications of secured-frame anxieties tend
to emerge.

Secured frames have, then, two opposite basic effects on both parties to
a therapy situation. On the one hand they create a sense of safety,
support and tolerance, and are deeply holding and healing, but on the
other they evoke severe forms of existential death anxiety -- much of it
because of the limits that they set on the patient's -- and therapist's
-- behaviours and options, and the feelings of restraint and entrapment
that they evoke. This combination of healing and unconsciously mediated,
terrifying existential death anxieties is reminiscent of life itself in
that the gift of life comes wrapped in the package of death. Thus, the
paradox for all forms of psychotherapy is that the conditions of
treatment that are most ideally healing are the very conditions that
evoke the most frightening forms of existential death anxieties in both
parties to therapy. Communicatively and adaptively, then, secured-frame
conditions evoke a striking mixture of positive encoded themes of
care-taking, safety, reliability, strength, devotion and, at the same
time, negative themes of entrapment and annihilation.

It's been found that, in principle, efforts at therapy that are intended
to be deeply healing should include one or more secured-frame moments.
Patients need to experience, process and resolve their existential death
anxieties to have a fully effective, insightful cure. This is needed
because these anxieties exist in all humans and their unconscious
component tends to be unresolved and to disrupt their lives. Although as
humans we are all aware of the inevitability and finality of personal
death, we have little conscious faith in our ability to cope with the
deep unconscious anxieties and the unconscious conflicts with which they
are connected. There is, then, a strong conscious-system preference to
avoid secured frames despite their unmatched healing qualities. Rather
than confronting and processing their existential death anxieties
towards personal insight and resolution, both patients and therapists
prefer to deal with these issues through denial mechanisms. Violations
of the ideal ground rules serve this function because, as noted, they
are action forms of the denial of death.

Another disturbing feature of secured frames is that they are the
conditions under which a patient's own predatory acts and deep
unconscious guilt are most vividly activated and reexperienced. Modified
frames place the therapist in the role of the primary predator, thereby
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_71}enabling the patient to cover over
and avoid expressions of his or her own predatory history. But this is
not the case with a secured frame because the therapist is not, in fact,
behaving in predatory fashion -- conditions under which the patient's
predatory acts and issues come to the fore. As a result, patients with
predator death anxiety and deep unconscious guilt have mixed reactions
to secured frames. On the one hand they unconsciously experience these
frames as offering them a unique opportunity to process and work through
their devastating deep unconscious guilt, but on the other hand the
activation of this guilt and, with it, fresh demands from the deep
unconscious system of morality and ethics for self-punishment that
typically reach suicidal proportions make these patients enormously
fearful of such conditions for therapy. They experience a strong
unconscious dread of self-harm and entertain the unconscious belief that
their therapists, in pursuing these issues in light of their encoded
material, are trying to murder them. This creates powerful unconsciously
driven resistances against the treatment experience and verbal assaults
on the therapist are not uncommon -- even as these patients continue in
therapy with an unconscious appreciation of what the therapist is
actually trying to help them accomplish. Carefully-dosed trigger-decoded
interpretations often enable this group of patients to work through
their resistances and make their peace with their existential and
predator death anxieties.

Finally, we may note that under secured-frame conditions, patients
generally work over all three types of death-related anxieties and
experiences -- predatory (fears of being harmed by others), predator
(fears connected with having done damage to others), and existential
(fears linked to the inevitability of personal demise). This means that
patients with histories of highly traumatic death-related incidents,
such as the loss of loved ones or being ill or injured themselves,
suffer from especially severe forms of secured-frame death anxieties.
They tend to avoid ideal frames and make repeated attempts to modify the
secured frame when it's offered to them. They're also inclined to flee
secured-frame therapies soon after entering them, an inclination that
challenges a therapist's frame management and interpretive skills.
Keeping these fragile and anxious patients in therapy is crucial for
their future lives because they tend to get involved in self-punitive
and death-denying forms of acting out and to live severely constricted
and disappointing lives which they naively accept as their fate.
Consciously, they have no awareness of the deep unconscious,
death-related motives []{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_72}that account
for their plight. Consistent use of adaptive principles of listening and
intervening is the best means of enabling these long-suffering
individuals to remain in and benefit from the frame-securing, insightful
therapies that they so sorely need.

#### **Deviant frames** {.h4}

A deviant- or modified-frame psychotherapy situation is one in which one
or more of the ideal ground rules are not offered to the patient. All
such therapies have a set of shared features, and in addition there are
effects that are specific to the particular rule or rules that have not
been invoked. Examples include therapies in which a low fee is set,
there's a cancellation policy that forgives the patient's fee for a
given session, make-up sessions are offered when a patient misses an
hour, insurance forms are completed -- the list is almost endless.

In principle, deviant frames offer a trade-off with uninsightful,
denial-based protection from existential death and other anxieties on
one side, and unconsciously mediated psychological damage on the other.
Thus, for both patients and their therapists, the modified frame, no
matter how necessary, is experienced deeply unconsciously as a predatory
act by the therapist, one that is psychologically harmful and
exploitative, and at times inappropriately seductive. These frame
modifications are important interventions -- that is triggering events
-- to which the deep unconscious system is exceedingly sensitive.
Patients will, from time to time, allude to them directly or in encoded
fashion, and offer narratives that encode their deep unconscious
experience of the deviations in the frame. Therapists have the
responsibility to interpret this thematic imagery in light of the
frame-related triggers that have evoked them, and, at the behest of the
patient's encoded directives, secure any modified ground rule that can
be rectified. Being on the alert for this kind of material from patients
is essential, largely because, on the conscious level, both patient and
therapist tend to accept modified frame conditions for treatment with
little direct thought. In contrast, the deep unconscious system
consistently addresses these frame issues and incessantly encodes
frame-related and frame-securing messages -- often in the form of early
memories in which family and other frames were less than ideal and
needed securing.

These early memories do not, however, reflect unconscious sources of
distorted pictures of the therapeutic situation or mistaken views of
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_73}the therapist -- that is, they do
not indicate that the past is confounding the present as an unconscious
form of transference. Instead, they are indications that the past is
actually being repeated in some form in the present -- that is, that the
frame-deviant behaviour of the therapist is a repetition in some way of
past acts of frame-deviant harm suffered by the patient in the past,
often at the hands of his or her parents. While it is unconsciously
mediated, the harm, which may be psychological or physical in nature, is
quite real and has damaging effects on both parties to treatment.
Indeed, frame violations often lead to emotionally-founded, somatic
symptoms and harmful forms of acting out by both patients and their
therapists -- both within and outside of the therapy.

Whenever a therapist offers a patient an altered frame, the conscious
experience of both parties to the therapy tends to be naive and bland,
and very much denial-based. But the deep unconscious experience of all
concerned is that the therapist is acting in a predatory fashion and the
patient has taken the role of the willing victim of his or her
predation. Thus, the frame-modifying therapist deeply unconsciously
perceives that he or she has acted in predatory fashion, suffers from
deep unconscious predator death anxiety and guilt, and is unconsciously
driven to act in a self-punitive fashion. So despite the fact that most
frame violations are sanctioned consciously by the various weak adaptive
approaches to psychotherapy, the unconsciously mediated, untoward
consequences of these acts of predation make doing psychotherapy and
counselling personally hazardous for the uninsightful but well-meaning
healer.

Why, then, does the conscious mind tend to prefer modified to secured
frames? The basic answer is that deviant frames enable both parties to a
therapeutic situation to avoid secured frames and the existential and
other forms of death anxiety that they evoke. As noted, modified frames
also create an unconscious illusion or delusion of invincibility against
death -- the rule-breaker unconsciously believes that breaking a rule of
any kind implies that he or she can also defy the existential rule that
death follows life. Clearly, as humans we tend to prefer deviant to
secured frame conditions. That is, we'd either rather be victimized,
harmed and suffer from predatory death anxieties, or be predators and
suffer from predator death anxieties and deep unconscious guilt, than
deal with and resolve our existential death anxieties -- an opportunity
that is possible only in secured frames.

#### []{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_74}**A clinical excerpt** {.h4}

Let us turn now to a clinical vignette that will help to clarify some of
the points made in this chapter:

Ms Benson is in psychotherapy with Dr Wall, a woman psychologist,
because of her poor relationships with men. Referred to Dr Wall by her
internist, in the consultation session Ms Benson, who's an editor for a
trade magazine, brings up the fact that she has insurance coverage for
50 per cent of the fee for her sessions. She offers Dr Wall the form
that must be completed in order to initiate coverage for the therapy,
but the therapist suggests that the patient hold on to it until they
have time to explore its meanings for her. She then advises Ms Benson to
continue to say whatever comes to her mind.

Ms Benson explains that she has no problem with using the insurance,
even though it means that the financial people at work will know about
her being in therapy -- and who knows who else. Money isn't the issue,
she earns enough to pay for the therapy. It's that she paid dearly to
have the coverage and she wants to use it.

Dr Wall remains silent and the patient goes on to talk about the doctors
who have been treating her various physical ills, especially her recent,
recurrent bouts of diarrhea. Most of them seem to have no idea how to
treat her illness, but she now thinks of one who did. He medicated her
and spent time talking to her about her problems, and her symptoms had
disappeared. But when he suddenly died, her symptoms recurred and she
still suffers with them from time to time.

An incident from her childhood, from around age 12, comes to mind. She'd
fallen ill with a fever one Sunday afternoon in the middle of a family
gathering. Her mother called their doctor who came to the house to see
the patient. She was lying on the couch in the living room and the
doctor decided to examine her there, in front of everyone. She was
utterly humiliated when he began to undress her and she became furious
with the doctor and refused to cooperate. When he persisted, she vowed
to never see him again.

Dr Wall intervenes. She points out that the patient's story is about
being examined in front of others by a doctor. It (the story) seems to
be connected to her (Ms Benson's) request that she (Dr Wall) fill out
the patient's insurance form which would, as the patient said, bring the
financial people and others into her therapy. The story indicates that,
while consciously, she (Ms Benson) wants the insurance form to be
completed, unconsciously she would experience her (Dr Wall's) doing so
as exposing Ms Benson to others in an inappropriate way that would
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_75}be utterly humiliating to her. Ms
Benson would be furious with her for doing it and would not want to come
back for further treatment.

To comment briefly, this is a trigger-decoded, frame-securing
intervention that begins by alluding to a theme that bridges from the
narrative of the incident in the past to the therapy situation in the
present -- that of public exposure. The trigger-decoding effort is
centred around the patient's deep unconscious perceptions of the
anticipated trigger of the therapist completing the insurance form and
then attempts to secure the frame -- that is eliminate the third-party
coverage -- at the behest of the patient's encoded themes. To continue
the vignette:

Ms Benson pauses for a while, and then recalls that she actually did see
that doctor again -- the one who tried to expose her -- once, at his
office. She insisted that she be seen by his associate who was a kindly,
elderly woman physician who was able to understand her being so upset
over having been treated so badly. She was someone whom the patient
could trust.

Dr Wall points out that this last story seems to be saying that her last
intervention shows that she understands the issue with insurance
coverage and that she (the patient) feels that she can trust her (the
therapist). Ms Benson responds that this doctor also died on her, so
what's the point of trusting someone? So despite her stories and what
they're saying, she still wants to use her insurance. She isn't going to
continue to see Dr Wall unless she agrees to take the form and fill it
out.

With time running out, Dr Wall agrees to do as her patient asks, with
the proviso that she (Ms Benson) continue to explore the meanings of her
(Dr Wall) doing so. She then spells out the other ground rules of the
therapy -- that it would be once weekly at this time and in this office
for 50 minutes; that their contact would be restricted to this time and
place; that the time was set aside for the patient, who had to assume
full responsibility for her part of the fee, which should be paid for
each month's sessions in the first session of the following month; that
the patient had to assume full responsibility for the fee if she missed
a session since the insurance did not cover missed sessions; that for
now at least, other than her (the therapist's) reports to the insurance
company, which the patient would be given to read, the therapy would be
confidential and private; and that the patient should do as she did this
session, continue to say whatever comes to mind and that she (the
therapist) would comment from time to time when it seemed
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_76}advisable to do so. Ms Benson
accepts these conditions for treatment, makes a few nondescript
comments, and the session comes to a close.

To comment further, Dr Wall usually structured a new therapy situation
about half-way through a consultation hour. She delayed doing so until
late in this session because she wanted to see if the proposed
frame-modifying trigger of her completing the insurance form would evoke
narrative imagery that would lend itself to interpretation and to likely
rectification -- the patient's decision to forgo the insurance coverage.
At issue were the ground rules related to the total privacy and
confidentiality of the therapy and the patient's assumption of the full
responsibility for the fee. As we saw, the themes did coalesce around
the frame violation of confidentiality and privacy, and they did indeed
point to the need to secure the frame. Dr Wall then offered a
trigger-decoded interpretation along these lines and the intervention
obtained encoded, interpersonal validation through the story of the
trustworthy elderly woman physician. When this was pointed out to her,
the patient nonetheless refused to accept the secured frame. She was
therefore taken into therapy under frame-modified conditions.

This is a generally workable arrangement that enables the patient to
enter treatment and offers her the opportunity to explore and understand
the deep unconscious meanings of her conscious need for a third party
presence. The deep unconscious system is focused on such issues and we
can be quite certain -- it's a psychobiological given -- that from time
to time the patient will encode narratives that reveal the unconscious
sources of the patient's need for the frame modification -- and with
them will come themes that will also again call for frame rectification.
Properly interpreted, these fresh interventions could provide the
patient with insights that would enable her conscious mind to support
the secured frame sought by her deep unconscious system.

Even when a patient can't afford therapy on their own, defensive and
self-punitive deep unconscious needs of some kind are usually served by
a deviation of this kind. In Ms Benson's case, financial need was not at
issue consciously, but the unconscious sources of her secured-frame
anxieties -- that is, the early trauma or traumas that prompted her
conscious rejection of the secured frame -- did not emerge in her
manifest material. The only hint of deep need was the allusions to the
deaths of two care-giving physicians, but Dr Wall was unable to decode
these themes in light of the deviant frame trigger of completing the
insurance form, nor was she able to use these themes in her
interventions.

[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_77}Technically, however, it's well to
note that Dr Wall nevertheless should have mentioned these two powerful
themes -- power themes should always be alluded to in intervening. For
example, she could have indicated that the patient's need for the
presence of third parties to her therapy seems to have something to do
with death and loss, noting that the patient had alluded to the death of
a doctor twice in the session. An intervention of that kind, which is
called a *playback of encoded themes,* would have implicitly encouraged
the patient to express additional encoded images related to the
underlying basis for this frame-modifying, *gross behaviour resistance*
(engaging in a frame deviation is an act of resistance because it is a
substitute for and interferes with work directed towards deep insight).
Fresh encoded themes from the patient might have enabled Dr Wall to
interpret the traumatic, unconscious, genetic basis for the patient's
deviant need. (It's advisable to think that the therapist's avoidance of
the death-related themes was based on her own unresolved death anxieties
-- a thesis that I won't pursue here except to note that death-related
issues are not only difficult for patients to process, they also are
problematic for therapists as well.)

As for the material of the session, we see again the naivety, proneness
to denial, seemingly self-harmful proclivities, and preference for
modified frames that are so characteristic of the conscious system. The
patient consciously denies any problem with using the insurance, but
then encodes a story in which the presence of third parties to a
treatment situation is humiliating and infuriating, and reason to stop
seeing a doctor. At the very moment that the patient's conscious mind is
saying that therapy can continue only if there's inappropriate exposure
of the patient to third parties, her deep unconscious mind is saying
these conditions are hurtful and reason to not see this therapist again.
And in typical fashion, the patient heeds her conscious adaptive choice,
which seems to be self-defeating, and is quite unable to follow her own,
far wiser, deep unconscious counsel to the contrary. Even when the
patient's deep unconscious advice is interpreted to her, she refuses to
accept it consciously. Once more we see that the emotion-processing mind
has evolved in a seemingly dysfunctional and self-defeating manner.

The watershed session, which occurred some three months into the
therapy, was triggered by a request from the insurance company that Dr
Wall forward a detailed description of the treatment experience and
present an elaborate treatment plan. Dr Wall informed the patient of
these requests and indicated that she would not respond to
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_78}them until Ms Benson had ample
time to explore the meanings and consequences that this would have for
her.

Ms Benson begins the session following this announcement with a dream in
which she's in her childhood home, lying in bed with her mother. A man
with a knife breaks into the room and her mother slips away, leaving the
patient unprotected. The man calls the patient a murderer and begins to
stab her in the chest and abdomen. She begins to bleed heavily; she's
convinced that she's going to die. She woke up frightened and in a
sweat.

She's been having trouble sleeping at night. The request for information
from the insurance company was bothering her, but she still doesn't want
to give up the coverage. Being in bed with her mother brings to mind
something she hasn't mentioned before. She had an older sister named Kim
and they slept in the same room. When Kim was seven and the patient
five, Kim fell ill with meningitis and died. Their mother blamed the
doctor for her death because initially, he had missed the diagnosis and
didn't give her the antibiotics she needed to survive. Her parents had
worried that the patient would also become ill and she was treated with
prophylactic antibiotics. Being the only child left, her parents also
began to worry about losing her and took her into their bedroom to sleep
with them at night. The patient became fearful of close relationships,
withdrew from her friends and became a loner. When she did make friends,
it was always in pairs. Somehow that doesn't work with men, so she's not
been close to a man in years.

Dr Wall interprets that the dream portrays how the patient would see her
(the therapist) if she were to comply with the request from the
insurance company. Like her mother in the dream, she'd be seen as
abandoning the patient to a murderous assault by the intruding insurers.
Complying would also be seen as making a mistake -- as missing the
diagnosis and not offering the proper curative measure -- and as harming
the patient in some fatal manner. These themes speak unmistakably to the
harm that would be done by sending further material to the insurance
company -- harm that would unconsciously be experienced as killing the
patient much as the family doctor was felt to have murdered her sister.

Ms Benson pauses for a while, then laughs and says that it sure as hell
looks like the time has come to stop using her insurance to pay for her
therapy. Dr Wall goes on to say that the patient's dread of being alone
and her fear of losing someone close to her are based on a belief
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_79}that she won't survive such
situations -- that she'll be murdered. It's also evident that she tries
to protect herself from losing others by having two friends at any given
time, so if one died, she'd have the other one left. This dread of loss,
which was based on the death of her sister, must be behind her need for
the insurance company's presence in the therapy. These same anxieties
are one reason that she doesn't get involved with men: her dread of loss
-- the fear of a repetition of the loss of her sister -- has prompted
her to avoid these relationships. And, finally, the accusation made by
the man in the dream -- that the patient is a murderer -- indicates that
the patient somehow feels responsible for her sister's death and has an
unconscious need to be punished in kind. Her insistence on having a
murderous third party involved in her therapy was in the service of
these self-punitive needs.

Ms Benson pauses again and then thinks about Al, a man at work who's
been showing an interest in her lately. He's attractive, but she's been
keeping him at bay. Now that she thinks of it, she was very provocative
towards him this week: she'd talked to people he knew about his
weaknesses and when he found out about it, he was very angry with her.
She had also failed to pass a memo on to him and her oversight had put
him in a bad light. Maybe that's similar to what she did with Dr Wall --
had she completed the insurance forms so she (the patient) could feel
alienated from her (the therapist). She sure overdoes the protection
from loss stuff. Then, almost as an after-thought, she mentions that as
far back as she can remember, she wished that she would die, but she
never knew why. In the years after her sister's death, she had had many
bouts of illness. She had fallen ill with a cold the week before her
sister contracted her fatal meningitis -- does she feel responsible for
her death? With that, the session came to an end -- as did the insurance
coverage for this therapy.

Technically, the material following Dr Wall's trigger-decoded
interpretations and efforts to secure the frame is a good illustration
of *cognitive validation* -- affirmation through the emergence of fresh
material that significantly adds to the insights that have just been
offered. As for our discussion of the ground rules of psychotherapy, the
violence done by frame violations is well-portrayed in the dream of
being stabbed to death by an intruder. While the patient's conscious
mind entertained the idea of giving more information to the insurance
carrier, her deep unconscious mind was telling the patient that she was
arranging for her own destruction -- her own self-punishing murder. The
insurance people -- and the therapist in joining in with
[]{#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_page_80}them -- were both the patient's
protectors from loss and her punitive executioners, the latter in
response to her deep unconscious guilt over the unconscious belief that
she had caused the death of her sister. Deeply unconsciously, then,
there was both a need for protection from loss and a need for punishment
-- the modified frame satisfied both of these pathological needs, albeit
at great cost to the patient. A history of an early death-related
experience and loss is common among patients who unnecessarily insist on
third-party coverage -- it often is indeed a costly unconscious effort
to protect against further loss. So goes the unconscious ramifications
of frame-related issues and behaviours -- and the reasons why therapists
need to pay attention to the ground rules of psychotherapy.

### Death Anxiety and the Evolution of the Mind {.h3a}

By adopting a new way of listening and formulating the material of the
therapeutic interaction, the strong adaptive approach has come upon a
vast array of new clinical and theoretical findings and ideas that hold
great promise to advance both the theory and practice of psychotherapy.
Notwithstanding these advances, adaptive therapists also came upon a
number of seemingly inexplicable or unsolved clinical puzzles (Kuhn,
1962) which engendered theoretical and therapeutic uncertainties that
challenged the tenets of the approach. While this was a frustrating
state of affairs, we also took our ability to recognize our limitations
and uncertainties as a sign of the viability of the adaptive position.
And because the solution to these puzzles did not emerge with repeated
clinical investigations, it proved necessary to turn to new avenues of
study in the hope of resolving these dilemmas using ideas drawn from,
developed outside of, the therapeutic arena. As we shall see, these
ventures proved to be quite rewarding.

#### **Some unsolved puzzles** {.h4}

Clinically, perhaps the most daunting problem was the finding that some
patients who were offered an ideal, secured set of ground rules for
their psychotherapies, and who unconsciously validated and confirmed the
positive holding and healing qualities of these frames, nonetheless
abruptly terminated their treatments. Interpretation of
[]{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_82}their underlying secured-frame
anxieties, most of them death-related, obtained unconscious validation,
yet the resultant insights did not enable them to remain in therapy. The
mystery lay with why these patients abandoned a therapy that they so
strongly validated at the deep unconscious level. Efforts to find the
answer clinically failed to provide a satisfactory answer.

Still another set of unsolved puzzles arose from the clinically-derived
insights that were unfolding in respect to the architecture and
operations of the emotion-processing mind. Why, for one, does the
emotion-processing mind appear to be organized in a way that locates our
wisest and most adaptive emotional intelligence in a deep unconscious
system whose adaptive recommendations are not available to conscious
awareness and adaptive use? And why are both patients and therapists
reluctant to decode the invaluable encoded messages sent forth from this
deep system? The consequent loss of adaptive capabilities is staggering.

There was more. Why is it that we have an unconscious component in the
emotion-processing mind in the first place? Why don't we adapt
emotionally entirely within awareness, as so many of our evolutionary
predecessors appear to do? Why, too, do we have a deep unconscious
system of morality and ethics with such pristine values and an
unconsciously mediated enforcement policy that is so strict and
unrelenting? Why aren't conscious morals sufficient standards and
constraints for human behaviour -- and why are conscious values so
easily compromised? And, finally, why have we been saddled with a
conscious mind that is so strongly protected by -- so bent on -- the use
of denial and obliteration? Why have humans evolved an adaptive system
in which knowledge reduction -- a diminution of contact with and
sensitivity to the environment -- plays such a significant role? This
attribute runs counter to the usual evolutionary history of living
species for whom the trend has been to evolve organ systems that are
capable of greater rather than lesser contact with, and knowledge of,
environmental conditions, stimuli and events. Why has this trend been
reversed in humans? There was a lot that needed explaining.

#### **Searching far and wide for answers** {.h4}

The unanswered questions raised by adaptive theory and practice seemed
to be intractable despite extensive clinical efforts over many years.
This vacuum motivated a turn to science and biology that, after many
blind alleys, eventually led to the development of a formal
[]{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_83}science of psychoanalysis based on
the quantitative study of emotionally-charged communication within
psychotherapy and, later on, in everyday life (Langs 1992a, 1999b, Langs
*et al.*, 1996). This work, which was based on the distinction between
the narrative (double-message) and non-narrative (single-message) modes
of expression, produced many significant findings. Chief among them was
the discovery of a series of well-defined, universal, biological, laws
of communication -- laws of the mind, if you will -- that are to be
found in all humans, and in chimpanzees as well. These research studies
differentiated the strong adaptive approach from other approaches to
psychotherapy on many different measures, with findings that put the
adaptive position in a highly favourable light. The work also generated
a series of clinically meaningful quantitative results, including
several apparent quantitative indicators of countertransference problems
in the therapist.

Despite the richness of these findings, they did not help to resolve any
of the clinical and theoretical dilemmas that had initiated this journey
into science. Yet the research did make clear that the
emotion-processing mind has universal features and is a lawful
biological entity -- our findings generalized across all cases studied.
And, in time, this led to the realization that, as such, this mental
module must have an evolutionary history, especially in respect to its
adaptive preferences -- and its evident failings. This insight prompted
a turn to the science of biology and its most fundamental subscience,
*evolutionary biology* -- the study of the present-day adaptations of
living organisms and of the long-term histories of these adaptive
capabilities as they pertain to the history of the living beings that
have populated and still populate this earth.

With good reason, evolutionary biologists claim that it's not possible
to fathom the nature of a biological entity without a full knowledge of
its adaptations and their evolutionary story. Nevertheless, with few
exceptions (Glantz and Pearce, 1989; Lloyd, 1990; Nesse, 1990a, b; Nesse
and Lloyd, 1992; Slavin and Kriegman, 1992; Badcock, 1994)
psychotherapists have seen little reason to turn to the science of
evolution for insight -- much of it because their models and
understanding of the emotion-related mind do not lend themselves to such
pursuits. In contrast, the adaptive approach's emphasis on emotional
adaptation, and its formulations regarding the mental module with which
this is accomplished, seem to establish a natural pathway that led
directly to evolutionary thinking and research -- it was simply a matter
of realizing that the path was there, ready to be traversed. Studying
the []{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_84}current adaptations of the
emotion-processing mind and their evolutionary history seemed, then, to
be a promising way of shedding new light on the clinical quandaries
confronting the strong adaptive approach. These efforts did not
disappoint.

#### **Key factors in evolution** {.h4}

In brief, present-day evolutionary theory, so-called neo-Darwinism,
states that living organisms naturally compete for the limited amounts
of available space, supplies of nutrients, and opportunities to
reproduce found on our planet. As they do so, they naturally undergo
random mutations which are passed on to their offspring, thereby
altering their ongoing gene pool and adaptive resources. In the face of
threats caused by drastic changes in environmental conditions -- caused
by nature and/or by other living entities -- those organisms whose
natural mutations enhance their adaptations to these new dangers tend to
survive best and to be favourably reproduced. Other, less suited
competing organisms eventually become extinct, which has been the fate
of over 98 per cent of the organisms that have populated this planet
(Dawkins, 1976; Slavin and Kriegman, 1992; Plotkin, 1994; Dennett, 1995;
Langs, 1996; Rose, 1997).

Environmental conditions that test organisms' adaptive resources are
called *selection pressures,* and they implicitly determine whose
adaptive resources and random genetic alterations fit best with the new
situation and thereby survive and are favourably reproduced. Selection
pressures include adverse changes in the physical environment, as well
as modifications in predators that enhance their dead-liness and thus
more seriously challenge the physical defences of their prey -- the
so-called evolutionary predator--prey battle for survival. Then, too,
the acquisition of especially favourable faculties by other organisms --
and at times by an organism itself -- may affect the survival of all of
the entities within a given ecosystem and affect reproductive success
for all concerned.

As part of living nature, the emotion-processing mind has inevitably
evolved in response to a variety of selection pressures. Identifying
these factors and understanding how they affected the development of
this mental module and led to the natural selection of its present
architecture promised to take us a long way towards understanding the
present-day features of this adaptive entity and the clinical dilemmas
that they were causing.

#### []{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_85}**Language acquisition** {.h4}

The hominid species, of which we, as *homo sapiens sapiens,* are a
member, is about six million years old. In its struggle for survival,
hominids have had to face both powerful predators and stark,
life-endangering environmental conditions. These threats and selection
factors have led to the natural selection of spontaneous mutations that
facilitated the favourable reproduction of abilities like the upright
stance, opposable thumbs, long-distance vision, and the expansion of
brain size which sponsored the development of new brain structures and
mental capabilities.

Supported by changes in the structure of the pharynx that facilitated
the use of sounds that allow for the spoken word (Lieberman, 1991),
about 100,000 to 150,000 years ago, advances in the size and
configuration of the hominid brain eventually led to the acquisition of
language capabilities. This ability, which evidently was built from
mimetic forms of communication, developed slowly but surely and may well
be the single most fateful event in the evolutionary history of living
beings. Indeed, language acquisition has had countless consequences for
humans, as well as for the earth's ecosystem and all life on this planet
-- many of them favourable, some of them enormously unfavourable.
Everything from philosophy and science to toxic gases, from antibiotics
to atom bombs, from child-rearing practices to social structures, and
from morality to abstract thinking, has come from language acquisition.
This achievement was also a watershed accomplishment for the emotional
side of human existence and for the development of the
emotion-processing mind (Bickerton, 1990, 1995; Corballis, 1991; Pinker,
1994).

Among the many developments that appear to have been fuelled by the
attainment of language capabilities in humans was the ability to
represent and process events within their minds, thereby creating the
capacity to work over danger situations and traumas mentally while away
from the scene of an untoward incident. Other animals, including apes,
are confined to event-perception and can work over traumatic events only
when approaching or present at the scene of former or pending harm.
These new human mental adaptive processing efforts appear to have been
carried out entirely within awareness, but over time and under the
influence of strongly traumatic selection pressures, the ability to
engage in unconscious processing was also developed and favourably
selected (Donald, 1991; Mithen, 1996).

[]{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_86}Language usage also facilitated
the development of a strong sense of personal identity as distinct from
other living beings, and in addition led to an ability to think about
and develop expectations regarding the future. This in turn led to the
realization of the inevitability of death for all humans, and to the
explicit recognition that death implies non-existence and that it may
arise from harm caused by others as well as by one's own body and mind
-- as in suicide. Thus, language capabilities created an unprecedented
set of capabilities, but also a unique set of dangers and unusual
threats to survival -- selection factors -- many of them configured
mentally.

Another uniquely human, language-based problem can be seen in the fact
that other living species have, by and large, had to deal solely with
physical predatory threats from other living beings and to some extent
within their own bodies. But in addition to these physical threats,
humans are also called on to deal with psychological dangers caused by
others -- for example, forms of mental torture and ways people drive
other people crazy or to suicide -- as well as dangers that arise from
their own disturbing thoughts and fantasies which may involve harming
others and/or themselves in the past, present and/or future. The most
serious of these inner mental dangers takes the form of thoughts of, and
intentions to commit, suicide or murder.

A fateful human form of mentally experienced danger involves the
anticipation of the death of others and especially of oneself. For most
humans, the specific source and cause of this inevitability is uncertain
for much of their lives. Death may come from within one's own body, from
the mental decision to commit suicide, or from mental processes that so
weaken the body as to cause it to deteriorate and die. Death may also
stem from external causes in the form of deadly actions by other humans,
devastation caused by other living organisms -- for example, animals and
microscopic predators like viruses and bacteria -- and from accidents or
natural disasters. Above all, it appears that the awareness of the
certainty of personal death has been one of the most critical selection
factors for the evolved architecture of the emotion-processing mind.
That is, minds that were able to cope successfully with the actual
threat of the eventuality of personal demise, with its future certainty,
and with the death anxieties that these realizations evoked, tended to
survive better than those who did not cope as well with these threats
and tended to be favourably reproduced.

#### []{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_87}**The three forms of death anxiety** {.h4}

Evolution, with its stress on adaptation and survival, and on life and
death, brought with it serious considerations of the problem of death
and death anxiety -- issues that held the key to solving our unsolved
mysteries. There are three basic forms of death anxiety (Langs, 1997, in
press); each has had a profound and distinctive effect on the evolution
of the emotion-processing mind, and each affects its present-day
operations in major ways. And while some of these concerns occupy the
conscious mind, it's been found clinically that most of the anxieties
caused by the threat of death operate outside of awareness, as does most
of their effects. Thus, death anxiety tends to have a profound
unconscious influence on human adaptations and it appears to be the
basic underlying source of all emotional maladaptations -- and of all
human creativity as well. With this in mind, let's examine the three
forms taken by human death anxieties.

##### *Predatory death anxiety* {.h5}

Predatory death anxiety (broadly defined as responsiveness to a threat
of harm) is almost as old as living organisms -- it emerged as soon as
organisms found it necessary to compete for living space and
nourishment. All living entities possess some type of capability with
which to detect external dangers and mobilize defensive responses. In
the earliest unicellular organisms, reactions to threat took the form of
flight, while later-developed organisms were also able to react by
freezing or fighting (LeDoux, 1996). Over the eons, there was also a
broad shift from total organismic responses to predatory threats to the
development of well-defined organ systems, like the immune system, whose
main defined function was to cope with such threats -- a shift from
non-specific to specific modes of adaptation (Beck and Habicht, 1996).
In time, with the development of brains and then minds, the mental
registration of danger and ways of coping psychologically were added to
these physical alerting and responding systems. Fear responses in
complex organisms played a notable role in this regard (LeDoux, 1996;
Langs, 1999b).

Over millions of years, as part of the arms races between predators and
preys, the level of predatory threat escalated, while the means of
coping with such dangers became more and more sophisticated and
effective. Thus, on the one hand humans have experienced an increasing
number of predatory threats to life, limb and mind, but on the other
hand they have developed increasingly effective means of
[]{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_88}detecting and responding to these
dangers. The latter include the creation of elaborate fear and anxiety
signals of danger -- fear as a response to physical threat and anxiety
as a response to emotional threat. Both signals promote the rapid
development and use of effective physical and mental reactions to
predatory threats.

Predatory death anxiety is, then, a response that arises in humans by
virtue of the presentation of a danger situation and through our
ever-present knowledge of death itself -- that is, existential death
anxiety is a special class of predatory death anxiety. Any event that
presents a threat to the life or integrity of an individual, whether it
takes a physical or psychological form, is treated emotionally as a
predatory danger and dealing with predatory threat is one of the main
specific adaptive functions of the emotion-processing mind -- it is a
danger-oriented organ of coping.

Predatory danger situations have also served as selection factors in the
evolution of the emotion-processing mind. Environmental threats -- for
example, natural disasters and living predators -- appear to have
created selection pressures that favoured individuals whose minds were
linked to and capable of strong perceptive capabilities and had high
levels of conscious-system intelligence. These threats also selected for
minds that could mobilize a variety of effective bodily responses to
external dangers -- activities that involved the brain and nervous
system, as well as the hormonal, immune and muscular systems. The
ability to rapidly mobilize mental and physical resources was, then, the
key to surviving *predatory physical dangers.*

The effects of *predatory psychological dangers,* which are uniquely
human threats, are, however, somewhat more complicated than those that
arise from physical threats. On the one hand, in a manner similar to
dealing with physical threats, survival in the face of psychological
dangers is favoured by conscious minds with effective perceptual
abilities -- that is, minimal use of conscious-system denial and
obliteration -- along with a high degree of conscious emotion-related
intelligence. High levels of these endowments enable individuals to
consciously assess the extent of the danger at hand and to minimize its
potentially disruptive psychological and physical consequences.

But, on the other hand, there are indications that psychological
predatory threats also selectively favoured the reproduction of minds
that use perceptual denial and the related capacities for unconscious
perception and deep unconscious processing. Denial is needed because
many of the psychological threats experienced by humans are created by
people on whom the predatory victim is dependent for survival.
[]{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_89}It is dangerous and mentally
disruptive to experience murderous impulses from people who provide
care, nurturance and other vital forms of support, as seen with the
parents of infants and children. In order to maintain these
life-sustaining relationships and avoid states of anxiety and panic over
their rage and threats of abandonment -- situations that would add to
the threat of survival -- aspects of the danger situations created by
these predators need to be obliterated and therefore relegated by the
MAC to unconscious perception and processing. However costly in loss of
knowledge of the environment and in the impairment of effective,
conscious coping skills, this use of denial would actually enhance
rather than diminish chances of survival. This is not the case, however,
with threats of bodily harm, where conscious registration and the full
use of consciously mobilized resources is vital to surviving the threat.

The contradictory selection pressures created by psychological danger
situations help to account for some of the more puzzling and seemingly
disadvantageous features of the emotion-processing mind. They include
the extensive human use of conscious-system denial as a means of
protecting the individual from anxiety-provoking conscious perceptions
of their caretakers at moments in which they behave in predatory
fashion. And these opposing pressures also help to account for the
evolution of unconscious perception and deep unconscious wisdom --
possibly as ways of storing threatening information from the environment
for future access.

##### *Predation death anxiety* {.h5}

Predation death anxiety arises when an individual causes physical and/or
psychological harm to others. The extent and power of this anxiety is
proportional to the amount of harm caused to the victim. In all
instances, however, predatory acts directed against others, whether
psychological or physical, are unconsciously experienced as acts of
murderous violence. Thus, predation death anxiety is both the anxiety
caused by having, in some real or imagined sense, killed another person,
and also the fear of death as punishment in kind for the harm done to
other living beings.

Causing harm to others may, at times, be recognized consciously and the
sense of guilt it evokes may also be in awareness, along with conscious
fears of retribution. But most often some or all of the harm is denied
consciously and, instead, registers deep-unconsciously. There, the deep
unconscious system of morality and ethics recognizes
[]{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_90}the full measure of the damage
done to the other person and metes out punishments for the deed through
a series of unconsciously orchestrated self-punitive decision and
actions that are the result of deep unconscious guilt. In situations
where extreme harm has been caused, themes of suicide are the rule. The
guilt and self-punishing acts of self-harm tend to persist for many
years, although processing these events in an adaptive psychotherapy
may, with extended working through, eventually lead to repentance and
deep unconscious forgiveness -- and a diminution of the self-punitive
behaviours. Nevertheless, the activation of this constellation, which
most often takes place under secured-frame conditions, is extremely
anxiety-provoking for patients and it evokes strong resistances that are
difficult to resolve.

As with predatory death anxiety, predator death anxieties are anchored
in reality -- in causing actual physical and psychological harm to
others. The power of the deep unconscious mind over emotional life does
not lie with wishful fantasies of a sexual or aggressive nature.
Instead, it lies with actual moments of destruction and with the
memories of these events.

The natural selection of minds capable of experiencing deep unconscious
guilt and of unconsciously orchestrating acts of physical and
psychological self-harm as punishment are major consequences of predator
death anxiety. While at first glance this arrangement seems to work
against personal survival, further thought suggests that having both
conscious and unconscious deterrents to harming others actually favours
individual survival -- and the survival of our species. These deep
unconscious pressures are likely to motivate individuals to refrain from
future acts of violence against others. That said, there are many
indications that these evolved and selected deep unconscious restraints
have not fulfilled their mission very well -- violence against others is
the world's most devastating problem today.

The human need to do violence to others seems to have played a
significant role as a selection pressure that favoured the development
of conscious and deep unconscious guilt and self-punitive tendencies.
The urge to act violently has many sources, such as being physically
harmed by others; insufficiencies of food, shelter and/or space; being
subjected to narcissistic and other psychological wounds; emotional
deprivations; jealousy and envy of others; efforts to magically deny the
inevitability of personal death -- and much more. Effective restraints
against violence towards other humans have been, and still are, sorely
needed.

[]{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_91}But here, too, design problems
arose because on the one hand conscious knowledge of the wish or
intention to harm or murder another human being may serve as a vital
deterrent, but on the other hand conscious awareness of this urge can
disrupt conscious-system functioning because of the guilt it evokes.
Here, too, natural selection was pulled in opposite directions -- both
for and against the conscious registration of acts of harm against
others. This seems to have been another factor in the development of the
deep unconscious system -- the need to be unaware of one's own violent
intentions and acts, especially those that are psychologically harmful,
as a way of avoiding the experience of conscious guilt. This
inner-directed denial is also a form of knowledge reduction that has
proven costly to human life.

All in all, natural selection has not been able to solve the problem of
human violence; neither conscious nor deep unconscious deterrents seem
to have curtailed these urges. The denial of psychologically damaging
acts has proven to be costly in the long run because it causes
considerable harm to both the perpetrator (via deep unconscious guilt)
and the victim (via the harm that he or she suffers). A case in point is
the consciously unappreciated finding that every violation of a ground
rule or boundary in a relationship, including that between patients and
therapists, is experienced at the deep unconscious level as an act of
predation. When enacted by a psychotherapist, the patient suffers
emotional damage and the therapist must endure deep unconscious guilt
and self-punishing behaviours. The use of interventions that are
unwittingly harmful to patients, and the deep unconscious guilt and
self-punitive inclinations they orchestrate, stand as one of the most
insidious occupational hazards of being a psychotherapist.

##### *Existential death anxiety* {.h5}

The third form of death anxiety is existential -- the dread of the
inevitability of death for all living humans, especially oneself, and
for other multi-cellular creatures. Existential death anxiety is a
severe form of dread of non-existence and evolution has favoured minds
inclined towards but one mechanism in dealing with this form of anxiety
-- *denial in its many forms and incarnations* (Becker, 1973; Langs,
1997; Liechty, 2002). This automatic use of denial is an evolved, fixed
feature of the conscious system -- a basic defence that is, as noted in
[Chapter 4](#9781403903426_10_ch4.html_ch4), a consequence of the
evolved sorting preferences of the MAC. The explicit, conscious
awareness and anticipation of personal death which resulted from
language acquisition was therefore a significant selection
[]{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_92}factor for the design of the
emotion-processing mind. And it fostered the selection of minds that not
only made extensive use of conscious-system denial, but also possessed
deep unconscious systems so that death-related issues could be processed
mentally without conscious awareness and without disrupting
conscious-system, adaptive functioning.

The intensity of existential death anxiety and the concomitant need for
an abundance of responsive denial mechanisms seems to be based on a
number of factors. For one, there's the awareness that, religious
beliefs aside, death is the end of life and the termination of an
individual's existence. *The basic existential ground rule of life
states that it ends in death.* And this rule is the prototype and
deepest unconscious meaning of all secured ground rules and boundaries.
Thus, all frame-securing events remind us, however unconsciously, of
this basic rule of life and death. It's largely for this reason that
most conscious minds tend to favour denial-serving rule violations over
adhering to ground rules. Unconsciously, frame modifications are efforts
to establish the claim -- the illusion or delusion -- that the person
who defies or violates a single ground rule thereby becomes an
individual who is an exception to all rules, the existential ground rule
in particular.

Another factor that renders this form of anxiety especially unbearable
is that most humans do not know when and how the final blow will come --
be it from one's own body or from an outside event such as a natural
disaster, an accident, or an attack by another living being. It is this
uncertain yet certain expectation of eventual harm that renders
existential death anxiety a special case of predatory death anxiety.
Another notable reason for the intensity of this anxiety is the fact
that, in the end, there's absolutely nothing we can do to overcome this
danger -- we cannot defeat it; it will always defeat us. We can fight
predators and win; we can control our inclination to predate others, and
be successful at it; we can struggle against illness and adverse
environmental conditions -- but, at best, all we can do is postpone the
inevitability of our demise. In this light we can appreciate why, in
dealing with existential death anxiety, nature has favoured minds that
use denial in one form or another -- it's all we have available to us to
maintain a relatively peaceful state of mind. And, as is the case with
frame violations, most forms of denial operate unconsciously and are not
appreciated for what they are. Regardless of other considerations, all
religious belief systems are denial-based, as are extremes of
celebrations, the distractions of sports and most other forms of
entertainment, manic states, the urge to accumulate excessive amounts of
[]{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_93}money and to gain extremes of
power, acts of violence directed against others ('they die and I live'),
and similar behaviours.

All in all, the explicit, conscious awareness of the inevitability of
personal death has the potential to destabilize conscious-system
functioning. Thus, within limits, the denial of death safeguards our
conscious adaptive capabilities. Nevertheless, because existential death
anxieties are so discombobulating, we tend to overuse denial mechanisms
to an extent that significantly reduces the availability of much-needed
information about our environments and the threats that they often pose
to our lives -- for example denial of illness and of harmful
sadomasochistic relationships. Paradoxically, then, the denial of death
generally both protects and harms the denier. This principle applies not
only to everyday life, but to the psychotherapy situation as well.

#### **The unconsciously mediated effects of death anxiety** {.h4}

It needs to be emphasized that most of the effects of the three forms of
death anxiety are mediated outside of awareness. We are not usually
cognizant of the role that these anxieties play in our lives and in
psychotherapy, and in the development of emotional maladaptations.
Indeed, only adaptive forms of psychotherapy have been able to track the
sources and define the consequences of these anxieties -- in extended
forms of adaptive psychotherapy, death-related issues appear in
virtually every session. One or another form of death anxiety is a
factor and an unconscious motivating force in virtually every important
decision we make -- including, for us as therapists, our preferred way
of doing therapy -- and these anxieties also underlie virtually all
symptomatic disturbances experienced by ourselves and our patients.

Predatory death anxieties unconsciously motivate defensive assaults
against others, unexplained moments of fight or flight, other kinds of
untoward belligerent acts, and, in regard to psychotherapy, a preference
for confrontational and assaultive modes of treatment. Predator death
anxieties unconsciously motivate uncalled for self-destructive decisions
and actions, masochistic types of surrender to the harmful acts of
others, inexplicable forms of depression, suicidal thoughts and acts,
and a preference for manipulative, highly exploitative forms of
treatment. Finally, existential death anxieties unconsciously motivate
many dysfunctional behaviours that serve conscious-system denial, such
as extreme violence against others, frame violations of all kinds,
maniacal quests for power and wealth, a wide range of religious beliefs,
and therapies that are extreme in their obliteration of psychological
factors. []{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_94}That said, these death
anxieties may also, paradoxically, motivate human creativity and, in
rare individuals, a deep need to fathom deep unconscious experience --
to know, instead of deny and not know.

The principles of technique advocated by the strong adaptive approach
enable therapists to detect and track the unconsciously mediated effects
of these three forms of death anxiety. Thus, therapists should be on the
alert for allusions to death-related traumas and to death-related themes
in patients' material. Once recognized, the themes can be explored and
interpreted in terms of, first, their triggers within the therapy as
created by the therapist's interventions, mainly in regard to frame
management efforts, and, second, the early death-related experiences
that are being activated by these triggers.

For example, when the frame is secured, the patient's images are likely
to involve themes of entrapment -- for example being trapped in an
overturned automobile or in a room that's on fire. In these cases,
existential death anxieties are at issue. In contrast, when a ground
rule has been modified by the therapist, themes of violence and murder
tend to appear in the narrative material -- a reflection of the
patient's predatory death anxieties. At the same time, the
frame-modifying therapist will find him or herself dreaming about people
who harm others and who act in self-destructive fashion. For them,
predator death anxiety has reared its guilt-ridden, self-punitive head.

Death anxiety casts a shadow over every emotional moment of our lives.
From time to time it is visible and conscious, and a moderate cause for
concern. But in the face of powerful death-related triggering events, it
may cause panic or extremes of denial as seen in experiences of
derealization. At other times, the effects of death anxiety operate
outside of awareness in ways that are so telling that it is incumbent on
every therapist to identify the encoded expressions of this mighty
force, interpret their sources and nature, and manage the framework of
treatment towards its securement as guided by patients' encoded
directives.

#### **Solving the unsolved puzzles** {.h4}

The scenario that was postulated for the evolutionary history of the
emotion-processing mind and the discovery of the likely death-related
selection pressures that shaped its design took the adaptive approach a
long way towards solving its unsolved mysteries. It became clear, for
example, that patients who flee secured-frame therapies which they
validate unconsciously tend to have suffered significant
[]{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_95}death-related traumas at some
point in their lives. Examples include the early loss of a parent or
other family member, the suicide of a family member or loved one at any
time in their lives, and personal experiences with severe illness and
injury that brought them close to death. As a result, these patients are
especially sensitive to, and terrified of, entrapping frames no matter
how healing they may be. Because of these anxieties, a therapist should
move slowly but surely towards securing the frame with these patients.
Tolerance of one or more modified ground rules is quite necessary, but
if the therapist maintains his or her sense of reserve, the patient
will, when ready for a secured-frame moment, encode the necessary
directives to accomplish this change. Supplemented with trigger-decoded
interpretations of the existential death anxieties and their unconscious
sources, these efforts enable many of these patients to remain in
treatment -- much to their personal benefit.

Patients who cling to deviant frame therapies that are unconsciously
perceived as harmful and predatory, and therapists who unnecessarily
offer such conditions for treatment, tend to do so because they're
attempting to defend themselves against the experience of secured-frame,
existential death anxieties. Deviant frames are also embraced by
patients with deep unconscious needs for punishment caused by their own
prior acts of predation. At times, the deviant-frame therapist may
provide enough unconsciously mediated suffering for a patient that he or
she experiences temporary relief from their deep unconscious guilt. But
such 'misalliance cures' are temporary and they inherently encourage the
patient to seek emotional relief through further punishments in their
daily lives.

As for the architecture of the emotion-processing mind, the various
forms of death anxiety seem to have created competing and contradictory
pressures regarding the ideal design of this mental module. Predatory
death anxiety leads mainly to a favouring of highly perceptive and
effective conscious systems, with minimal use of denial and deep
unconscious processing. In stark contrast, existential death anxiety
seems to have favoured minds steeped in conscious-system denial and able
to process severe traumas deeply unconsciously, entirely without
awareness. Finally, predator death anxiety may well have biased natural
selection towards denial-based conscious minds that were also capable of
experiencing deep unconscious guilt and evoking self-punishments. All in
all, in response to these competing selection pressures, natural
selection seems to have favourably reproduced minds that lean towards
knowledge reduction *vis-à-vis* the
[]{#9781403903426_13_ch7.html_page_96}environment, far more than sharp
perceptiveness. In addition, it has favoured conscious minds that use
denial more rather than reasonably limiting its use. This design feature
is supported by avoidance forms of psychotherapy, while adaptive forms
run counter to these natural inclinations.

The unavailability of deep unconscious wisdom for conscious-system
coping, and the requisite that all communications from the deep
unconscious system emerge in encoded form, seem to be accounted for by
the fact that deep unconscious wisdom deals with extremely
anxiety-provoking, death-related unconscious perceptions. Thus,
awareness of the activated wisdom requires an awareness of the very
experiences and meanings that were deemed by the MAC to be too
disruptive to enter awareness in the first place. These same factors
also account for the evolutionary development of encoded messages.
Finally, the strong influence exerted by deep unconscious guilt on
conscious-system adaptations is accounted for by the need to deter
humans from harming other humans.

\*      \*      \*

Humans are unique in having to continue to deal with the competing
selection pressures that have made the rendering of an ideal evolved
design of the emotion-processing mind all but impossible. With
environmental conditions, including a host of language-based
developments, pressing the mind towards contradictory configurations,
it's small wonder that the emotion-processing mind is in a state that
promotes maladaptations as much as, or more often than, sound coping
responses when it comes to emotionally charged triggering events. For
good reasons, then, this mental module is one of nature's most
compromised creations; and this is why humans suffer so much emotional
pain and so many psychologyically-based dysfunctions. It's also why we,
as therapists, must find the means to deeply and accurately understand
the evolutionary history and present design of the emotion-processing
mind, so we can do as much as possible to undo and rectify the mental
chaos and psychological pain that nature and natural selection have
wrought.

### Indicators: Symptoms and Resistances {.h3a}

While many schools of psychotherapy advocate a loose, intuitive approach
to doing therapy (see for example, Kohut, 1971; Mitchell, 1988), the
strong adaptive approach has found that clear-cut principles of
technique are an absolute necessity for a sound, deeply insightful
therapeutic experience and outcome. These contrasting viewpoints stem
largely from the differences between the conscious and deep unconscious
systems and the contrasting ideas about how to do therapy.

The adaptive approach has discovered clinically that left to its own
devices, the conscious mind of a therapist will naturally adopt a
conscious-system approach, one that deals with superficialities rather
than more powerful, deep unconscious issues, and will offer a therapy
that is conducted in a frame-deviant context. Given the great
variability of conscious-system thinking in the emotional realm, these
forms of therapy are inevitably quite variable in their techniques and
they tend to lack well-defined principles of listening and intervening.
The additional absence of a sound means of testing the reliability of
interventions makes it all but impossible for conscious-system modes of
therapy to come up with definitive rules of technique. In addition, as
I've tried to show, the conscious choices that a therapist makes
regarding his or her approach to psychotherapy are greatly influenced by
unconsciously driven conscious-system needs for punishment, denial and
other interfering defences -- forces that move treatment away from ideal
forms of healing. The natural aversion of the conscious mind to
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_100}trigger-decoding also severely
limits the scope and healing powers of these types of therapy. All in
all, the absence of unconsciously validated guidelines renders
conscious-system forms of treatment very risky undertakings. Yet these
are problems that conscious-system therapists have no way of recognizing
and correcting.

In contrast, the deep unconscious system is highly organized and
operates on the basis of well-defined, universal rules and processes.
The system is quite consistent in its approach to psychotherapy and the
therapeutic frame, and is a reliable guide to healing interventions --
verbal and frame-related. Gaining access to the contents and operations
of this most important system therefore requires a highly organized
approach to treatment. This is possible because, with remarkable
regularity, the system emits encoded messages that validate
well-structured, definable, therapeutic work and fails to support work
that is loosely structured -- work it sees as harmful not only to the
patient, but to the therapist as well. Highly principled forms of
technique are the only answer to the potential damage that less
consistent approaches may -- and often do -- cause.

In this light, it's well for us to pause and question the basis for
seemingly favourable therapeutic outcomes of vaguely defined, weak
adaptive psychotherapies (Langs, 1985). While deep insight clearly
cannot play a role in these results, therapists' support for their
patients' denial-based defences may be one way that these treatments
bring a measure of relief to patients, doing so by helping them to avoid
issues they dread to explore. The same denial mechanisms may also prompt
the parties to therapy to overlook the hurtful consequences of errant
interventions, and unconscious idealizations of the therapist may prompt
the patient to report a favourable outcome of treatment without alluding
to residual difficulties.

Along different lines, paradoxical positive reactions to damaging
interventions are not uncommon, as is gaining a measure of temporary
symptom relief on the basis of focusing on highly intellectualized,
relatively unimportant material and the lesser emotional issues to which
they pertain. Then, too, some relief may come from non-validated frame
modifications that enable all concerned to avoid secured-frame,
existential death anxieties. Other maladaptive forms of relief come from
interpretations that unwittingly sanction patients' inclinations toward
action-oriented, frame-violating means of discharging emotional
tensions, and from unprincipled interventions that unknowingly punish
guilt-ridden patients, thereby temporarily reducing their superego
pressures.

[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_101}Some weak adaptive therapies
appear to bring relief to patients by overriding deep unconscious
influences and training the conscious mind to think or behave in a
manner that enables patients to unlearn particular symptoms, like
phobias. But, as a rule, there are hidden costs in overlooked, untouched
symptoms and personality disturbances that tend to be denied by all
concerned. Then, too, there are unconsciously mediated means of relief
such as a process called *cure through nefarious comparison* (Langs,
1985), which alludes to a patient's unconscious realization that his or
her therapist is behaving in a dysfunctional manner, an insight that
reassures the patient that he or she is far less disturbed than their
therapist. Similar unconscious mechanisms underlie relief through
bountiful gratifications (for example providing patients with food
and/or drink, gifts, job leads, helpers, and so on), therapists'
sanctions of inappropriate acts and maladaptive forms of sexual and
aggressive satisfactions (such as, inappropriate affairs, and attacks on
others), the offer of punitive interventions (overt criticisms and other
assaultive comments), and the like (see Langs, 1985, for details).

All in all, given the intricacies of the emotion-processing mind, it's
fair to say that evident symptom relief in a patient reveals little or
nothing about the *unconsciously mediated* means by which this relief
was achieved, nor does it in any manner stand as testimony to the
validity of a therapeutic approach or the theory on which is it based.
In contrast, encoded validation creates a viable framework within which
insights into modes of cure can be soundly assessed and usefully
developed. With this in mind, let's turn now to the clinical arena and
to the development of sound principles of listening, formulating,
intervening and validating all manner of offered interventions. We begin
by exploring the kinds of information that we can obtain by attending to
the manifest contents of patients' communications.

#### **The manifest level of listening** {.h4}

The listening process developed by the strong adaptive approach
considers the implications and meanings of both the conscious-manifest
and deep unconscious-encoded messages from patients. Broadly speaking,
the manifest level of communication is assessed for indications of a
patient's current emotional status, adaptive preferences, conscious
thinking about the therapy experience, the extent of his or her
conscious integration of the therapist's interpretations and
frame-management efforts, and the presence of surface resistances. Thus,
therapists should, from session to session, consistently monitor
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_102}the status of a patient's
*symptoms* -- a term that I shall use all-inclusively to allude to all
emotionally and psychologically founded disturbances of behaviour and
affect, interpersonal and relating difficulties, certain physical
disorders, and other emotionally-founded maladaptions and dysfunctions.
Also in need of monitoring is the status of a patient's *resistances* or
obstacles to therapeutic progress, including negatively-toned attitudes
towards the therapist and treatment. These two areas -- symptoms and
resistances -- are the ultimate targets of therapists' trigger-decoded
interpretations and frame rectifications. The overall goal is to explain
their immediate basis in both conscious and deep unconscious experience,
and their past sources as well. Because they constitute cause for a
therapist to intervene, disturbances in these areas are called
*indicators* -- that is, they are indications that a patient is in need
of a frame-rectifying and/or trigger-decoded interpretation in the
session at hand.

#### **Symptomatic indicators** {.h4}

Psychotherapy is an informed effort to favourably modify patients'
emotionally-founded maladaptations. These disturbances take two basic
forms: symptoms and resistances. In psychodynamic, insight-oriented
therapies they are the target of efforts to illuminate the deep
unconscious basis for patients' maladaptations.

Symptomatic emotional problems take a wide range of forms, including
disorders of affect (such as excessive anxiety and depression),
behaviour (compulsions, addictions, excessive acts of sexuality or
violence, and so on), relating (for example withdrawal, excessive
dependency, provocativeness, masochistic submission), personality (for
example character disorders), style of living (withdrawal, constriction,
excessive involvement with others), contact with reality (the psychoses,
for example), and bodily functioning (for example psychosomatic
disorders). A manifest allusion to a particular symptom in a given
session is a patient's way of presenting a maladaptive problem as an
indicator -- that is, as a target for intervening.

The adaptive approach has shown that once a person enters psychotherapy,
the *deep unconscious basis* for the continuation of a patient's
symptomatic complaints and for the development of a fresh symptom is a
product of the bipersonal, interactive field created by each patient and
therapist. In general, these disturbances in patients are responses to
errant interventions by their therapists, although occasionally they may
follow an unconsciously validated interpretation or frame-securing
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_103}effort -- secured-frame
existential death anxieties and deep unconscious guilt play a role in
these responses which tend to be short-lived. Thus, while factors
outside of therapy may contribute to symptom formation, the illumination
of the deep unconscious structure of patients' emotional problems must,
of necessity, be made through trigger-decoded interpretations developed
around their therapists' interventions -- frame-related and otherwise.

The key principle is that patients' symptoms are interactional products
of the bipersonal therapeutic field (Baranger and Baranger, 1966), and
that their interpretation should be interactional as well -- that is,
should be organized around patients' unconscious perceptions of their
therapists' interventions (Langs, 1976, 1999a). The main exceptions to
this rule are found, first, at times of extremely traumatic external
events like major disasters, and, second, in long-standing secured-frame
therapies in which the patient's early-life, death-related traumas --
especially incidents in which he or she behaved in predatory fashion --
are activated by the backdrop of security. In these situations, the
death anxieties that are fuelling the patient's symptoms are either
externally or intrapsychically evoked, and the triggers created by the
therapist play a secondary role. Nevertheless, these are unusual moments
in therapy; at all other times, the happenings within treatment are the
deep unconscious motivating factors in the patient's dysfunctions.

All in all, then, emotional problems are triggered by real events, and
once a patient enters psychotherapy, except for major disasters, these
events are constituted as the interventions of their therapists --
mostly in the realm of managing the setting, ground rules and boundaries
of the therapy. Responses to errant interventions are, then, the most
common unconscious basis for the activation or sustenance of a patient's
symptom. This means that a therapist's interpretation of the deep
unconscious sources of an active symptom will, as a rule, begin by
alluding to the patient's unconscious perceptions of the relevant
triggering event and then address the patient's particular symptomatic
ways of dealing with that trigger. If genetic material is also present
in some form, the connection to past life events also is delineated.

#### **Resistance indicators** {.h4}

Resistances in psychotherapy are broadly defined as any obstacle to
therapeutic progress manifested by a patient. They, too, are
interactional phenomena, products of the bipersonal field (Baranger and
Baranger, []{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_104}1966; Langs, 1976) in
which both patient and therapist play a role. Thus, resistances are
triggered by therapists' interventions and their unconscious basis must
be understood and interpreted in that light. Of note, too, is the
realization that resistances are defined and identified within the
framework of a given theory and practice of psychotherapy. Thus, there
are many situations in which a patient would be seen by a weak adaptive
psychotherapist as resisting therapy, while a strong adaptive therapist
would disagree -- and vice versa. For example, a patient who
intellectualizes about a subject introduced by a therapist would be seen
as cooperating by the weak adaptive therapist, but as communicatively
resistant (that is, not encoding as needed) by the strong adaptive
therapist. Because the approaches of these two basic schools of
psychotherapy are so different, there are countless examples of this
kind.

##### *Gross behavioural resistances* {.h5}

As understood and defined by the adaptive approach, there are three
forms of resistance seen in psychotherapy situations. The first type is
called *gross behavioural resistances* -- actions taken by patients that
interfere with the forward movement of the treatment. These acts tend to
involve departures from the ideal framework of therapy -- that is, they
are violations of the ideal therapeutic contract. Examples include a
patient's lateness to a session, leaving the session before time is up,
extended silences and premature terminations. Whenever these resistances
appear, the therapist is obliged to attend to the patient's material in
order to identify the interventional trigger that has evoked the enacted
resistance. Most often the trigger is some type of frame violation,
although on rare occasions it may be an unconsciously validated
interpretation or a frame-securing effort. These paradoxical responses
are identified by the nature of the activating trigger, the patient's
encoded themes which tend to reflect secured-frame death anxieties, and
by their generally rapid resolution.

Technically, gross behavioural resistances are directly observed by the
therapist and the key problems lie, first, with verifying that the
observed behaviour is truly an obstacle to therapeutic progress, and,
second, with identifying the contributing trigger. Resistances are not
confronted or thought of as solely the patient's responsibility.
Instead, they are interpreted in light of activating triggers and the
decoding of the patient's narrative themes in order to ascertain the
patient's unconscious perceptions of the therapist that are the deep
unconscious []{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_105}source of the enacted
resistance. When a frame modification is a contributing unconscious
source of a resistance, frame rectification, if at all possible, should
also be carried out using the patient's encoded directives to do so.

It is, however, crucial to appreciate that while most gross behavioural
resistances reflect maladaptive responses to therapists' interventional
errors and frame modifications, some of these seeming resistances are
quite appropriate and adaptively sound in light of a therapist's
interventional efforts. In simple terms, some therapeutic work is
harmful to patients -- for example unneeded frame violations and
erroneous, assaultive or seductive verbal interventions. It is, then,
actually maladaptive for patients to continue in therapy with therapists
who intervene in this manner -- that is, the absence of resistance is a
sign of disturbance in the patient. On the other hand, leaving a therapy
of this kind is adaptive, so that the apparent resistance is actually
appropriate and healthy. Nevertheless, in almost all instances, extended
silences during, and lateness for, sessions are maladaptive resistances
because even a therapist's errant ways should be explored in therapy
rather than handled through frame violations.

In sum, the assessment of the adaptive and maladaptive aspects of a
gross behavioural resistance depends on a full appreciation of the
nature of the interventional triggers that have evoked the seemingly
resistant response in the patient.

##### *Communicative resistances* {.h5}

The second class of obstacles to therapy are called *communicative
resistances* -- a type of resistance whose definition is built around
adaptive understanding of the role and nature of manifest and encoded
communication in psychotherapy. These resistances take two forms. The
first are *patients' silences,* which are gross disruptions in
communicating; and the second involves *a patient's failure, in the
presence of a disturbing intervention by a therapist, to generate an
interpretable and, if need be, frame-rectifying encoded communicative
network.* In brief, in the face of an activating trigger, communicative
resistance is seen when the patient fails to generate the material
needed for sound intervening by the therapist.

Patients' extended silences are both gross behavioural resistances --
violations of the fundamental rule of free association -- and a form of
communicative resistance. On the other hand, the failure to generate a
complete communicative network is solely a communicative resistance.
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_106}Its definition is based on the
strong adaptive finding that there is an ideal, resistance-free
communicative network that fulfils what's called the *recipe for
intervening* -- the ingredients needed by a therapist in order to offer
a trigger-decoded interpretation or engage in a frame-securing effort
when such is called for. Ideally, this recipe includes the following
ingredients or elements:

•[]{.pad}First, a manifest allusion to an active triggering event --
that is, a direct mention of a critical and recent intervention made by
the therapist.

•[]{.pad}And, second, a rich pool of encoded themes, replete with two
ingredients: *bridging themes* that connect the disguised narratives to
the triggering event -- for example a story about exposure that deals
with a therapist's personal self-revelation, and *power themes,* which
are allusions to violence, illness, injury, death and so on. The latter
are essential because the deep unconscious system deals solely with the
most anxiety-provoking and traumatic aspects of emotionally-charged
triggers -- it's domain is that of powerful issues.

Communicative resistances take a variety of forms. The triggering event
may obtain encoded rather than manifest representation -- for example a
therapist's reducing a patient's fee may be represented in a story about
a patient's friend who voluntarily agreed to a salary cut. A more severe
form of this resistance is seen when an active trigger is not
represented in any detectable form. Along different lines, the pool of
themes may be lacking in bridging themes and/or power. As always, these
communicative resistances need to be understood and eventually
interpreted in light of active triggers -- they are interactional
products. Technically, in the presence of communicative resistances, the
therapist must refrain from intervening in the expectation that,
eventually, the patient will generate an interpretable network. At
times, a playback of the available themes related to an unmentioned
trigger will facilitate the patient's doing so.

Most often, communicative resistances are unconsciously activated by
non-validated, harmful therapeutic interventions such as frame
modifications and erroneous or irrelevant verbal comments. But on
occasion the resistance is a response to unconsciously validated efforts
at frame securing and interpreting -- that is, they are the result of
secured-frame death anxieties. These resistances may also arise because
an unconsciously validated interpretation or frame-securing intervention
has activated painful, anxiety-provoking and guilt-promoting
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_107}genetic material which often
pertains to a patient's past predatory acts and is a consequence of his
or her predator death anxiety. It is essential, then, that a therapist
keep track of his or her recent interventions and the patient's deep
unconscious issues, death anxieties and traumatic early life
experiences. This kind of deep understanding is helpful in enabling the
therapist to wait patiently for the emergence of the material that he or
she needs to intervene. It also fosters therapists' tolerance of
extended communicative resistances, which patients need to sustain until
they can gather the strength to offer the therapist an interpretable
communicative network of trigger and themes related to terribly painful
deep unconscious memories and issues.

##### *The conscious refutation of unconsciously validated interventions* {.h5}

The third class of communicative resistances emerge after an
unconsciously validated interpretation -- that is, after the patient has
generated positive encoded images in response to the therapist's
intervention. These resistances reflect an extreme, defensive split
between the conscious and deep unconscious systems in that the patient
deep-unconsciously supports the therapist's intervention, recognizes the
encoded confirmation in his or her material, but nevertheless
consciously refutes the insights so generated.

As noted, the conscious mind is naturally unaware of deep unconscious
contents and processes, and the anxiety-provoking meanings so contained.
When such meanings are interpreted to a patient, he or she will, as a
rule, consciously accept and work over these fresh insights. In so
doing, however, the trend is for the conscious mind to rapidly repress
its awareness of the meanings involved. While sporadic conscious working
through may occur in subsequent sessions, most of the healing that is
activated by these interpretations tends to continue on the unconscious
level alone. It's not uncommon to find that this week's trigger-decoded
insight is no longer in the patient's awareness in the following week's
session. This is a major reason for the need for an extended working
over and working through of deep unconscious experiences and their
implications for a patient's symptoms. All in all, then, this
phenomenon, which has resistance attributes, is so universal that it may
be thought of as a resistance caused by the architecture of the
emotion-processing mind.

In certain patients, however, there's a different kind of resistance
response which, as noted, takes the form of an immediate conscious
rejection of the very interpretation that a patient has just moments
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_108}earlier unconsciously validated.
This rejection often extends to the therapy itself in that, despite
abundant unconsciously validated interventions, both interpretive and
frame-securing in nature, these patients repeatedly insist that nothing
has happened in their treatments. Strikingly, this belief does not
obtain encoded support -- the deep unconscious system continues to
validate the therapeutic work whose existence is being denied by the
conscious system. This deep unconscious support is the main reason why,
despite their unending conscious protests, these patients tend to remain
in treatment for long periods of time. Most often the unconscious motive
for this type of defence, in which the therapist is repeatedly subjected
to verbal attacks and abuse, appears to be predator death anxiety and
unbearable deep unconscious guilt for past predatory acts. These issues
cause these patients to dread the experience of deep unconscious meaning
and insight, and meaningful therapy -- the confrontation with the harm
that they've caused and the conscious experience of guilt -- is horribly
painful for them.

#### **Some additional aspects of resistances** {.h4}

Implicit to this discussion is the realization that *resistances are
conscious-system phenomena* -- albeit, under considerable unconscious
influence. Throughout treatment -- and life -- the deep unconscious
system speaks only for open communication, insight, healing and
adaptation to extremely painful events and inner thoughts and impulses.
It is solely the conscious system that speaks for denial, falsifications
of reality and inner wishes, untoward actions such as unreasonably
harming others and/or oneself, the use of inappropriate defence and
resistances, and the like. And the unconscious needs and motives that
drive these tendencies stem from a *deep unconscious influencing system*
-- a system that largely favours the use of denial *vis-à-vis* sources
of unconsciously experienced death anxieties, and sustains the
unconscious need for punishment caused by deep unconscious guilt. Under
these influences, the conscious system is the main source of human
suffering and the main enemy of the self and its best interests, while
the deep unconscious system is the main source of inner emotional
healing.

A special class of resistances involve patients' wishes to modify or
sustain unneeded alterations in the ideal ground rules or boundaries of
the therapy situation. Such behaviours are unconsciously motivated as
ways of avoiding secured frames and secured-frame moments, and the
existential death anxieties that they arouse. And while these
resistances []{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_109}produce a measure of
temporary relief, they do so at great cost in that these psychologically
damaging frame modifications are likely to become a patient's preferred
mode of coping with, and defending against, secured-frame death
anxieties. In addition, because of the nature of the resistance, the
patient who persists in these efforts is deprived of the chance to
discover and work through the deep unconscious basis of these anxieties
-- an essential part of the healing process. Here, too, triggers --
contributions from the therapist -- must be considered. Quite often
patients' frame-modifying resistances are modelled on the
frame-modifying, counter-resistance-based behaviours of their
therapists. On rare occasions, a frame-modifying resistance arises as a
response to a sound intervention that threatens to activate the
patient's most disturbing unconscious issues, but these resistances tend
to be linked to images reflecting secured-frame, existential death
anxieties and they are quickly resolved.

Along different lines, it's well to realize that while patients vary in
the extent to which they show gross behavioural resistances,
communicative resistances are inevitable -- what varies is the form that
they take. They, too, are the result of the evolved design of the
emotion-processing mind and stem from conscious-system needs for defence
-- that is, denial and obliteration -- because of the system's inherent
dread of deep unconscious experiences and meaning. Every patient has a
favoured means of obstructing access to these deep unconscious
experiences, and their style of resistance is so inbuilt that it seldom
lends itself to modification despite all efforts by therapists to
confront the resistance and interpret its unconscious motives. Thus,
some patients will consistently fail to generate powerful encoded
themes, others will almost never manifestly represent an active trigger.
Still others avoid engaging in trigger-decoding, while others will tend
to ruminate intellectually rather than report dreams or tell stories. As
noted above, a most trying group of patients will generate a full
communicative network with representations of triggers and abundant,
powerful themes that enable a therapist to offer a trigger-decoded
interpretation. They will then deep-unconsciously validate the
interpretation (or frame rectification), but will quickly repudiate
consciously the therapeutic effort in its entirety.

In response to these various forms of communicative resistance, the
therapist should wait for illuminating, trigger-evoked encoded imagery
before pointing out the nature of the patient's communicative resistance
and interpreting its deep unconscious basis. Because these
communicative-style resistances reflect the patient's preferred
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_110}mode of defence against both
deep-unconsciously derived insights and secured frames, they create
valuable opportunities for patients to appreciate the very design and
operations of their emotion-processing minds and to grasp the nature of
the psychological defences that they invoke to avoid deep unconscious
meaning.

Another valuable principle of technique requires that the therapist
gauge the strength of a patient's symptomatic and resistance indicators
in each session in order to determine the extent to which the patient is
in need of an intervention. The strongest symptomatic indicators are
suicidal and murderous thoughts and impulses and acutely distressing
emotionally-founded symptoms, while thoughts of terminating therapy and
the request for ground-rule modifications head the list of gross
behavioural resistance-indicators. The strength of the indicators is
then measured against the extent to which the patient's material fulfils
the recipe for intervening. In the presence of very strong indicators,
the therapist is obliged to make the best available trigger-decoded
interpretation and/or frame rectification effort possible, even in the
presence of a poorly represented trigger or weak network of encoded
themes. On the other hand, when the indicators are weak, the decision to
intervene largely depends on the extent to which the patient has
fulfilled the recipe for intervening. In adaptive forms of therapy,
working with patients' resistances occupies the bulk of the time in
sessions. The processing of the deep unconscious meanings of a patient's
core emotional problems is a rare and fleeting event. Fortunately, the
interpretation of the unconscious sources of resistances is itself a
meaningful and healing part of the therapeutic experience.

#### **Conscious thoughts about the therapist and the therapy** {.h4}

Another reason for observing a patient's conscious thinking and
behaviour is to determine his or her feelings about and view of the
therapist, and the extent to which the patient has absorbed, accepted
and consciously processed the trigger-decoded, deep unconscious insights
and frame-related interventions that have been offered to him or her. A
notable part of these efforts involves comparing the patient's deep
unconscious insights and frame-related attitudes with his or her
conscious position on these same matters. These conscious attitudes
range from patients' openness to, and tendency to accept, deep
unconscious insights and to incorporate them into their conscious
understanding, to those patients who, as noted above, are continually
critical of unconsciously validated therapeutic work.

[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_111}It is, however, incumbent on a
therapist to assess the validity of conscious criticisms of his or her
interventions, although in this regard the deep unconscious system is
far more reliable than the conscious system, which often fully accepts
harmful therapeutic work and not infrequently rejects unconsciously
validated therapeutic efforts. Valid conscious criticisms of a
therapist's efforts are supported by deep unconscious, encoded
criticisms as well. In the absence of such support, the patient's
conscious reproaches may be taken to be conscious-system resistances
whose triggers and unconscious motives need to be determined.

#### **Further perspectives** {.h4}

To sum up, there are many notable unconscious motives for resisting
therapeutic progress. They include the unconscious dread of the secured
frame and the activation of secured-frame, existential death anxieties;
deep unconscious predator death anxieties and the wish for punishment;
the wish for uninsightful, frame-deviant, action-oriented relief from
deep anxieties; and the dread of deep unconscious meaning and of
repressed memories of traumatic events. Virtually every patient has
suffered from death-related experiences in his or her childhood or later
life. The activation of the memory and meanings of these events is the
source of enormous amounts of death anxiety -- which is why these events
and meanings have been obliterated and repressed in the first place.
Both gross behavioural and communicative resistances are evoked to
preclude the emergence of these painful repressed and denied incidents
and their meanings. Nevertheless, it must be stressed again that the
processing and interpretation of these resistances reflect the patient's
usual modes of defence, so that the interpretation of their deep
unconscious sources is highly therapeutic. In addition, the analyses and
momentary resolution of resistances clear the way for the occasional
watershed session in which the unconscious core of a patient's symptoms
is expressed meaningfully around a triggering event and is available for
interpretation and working through.

Along different lines, it's well to appreciate that at the core of every
symptom and resistance is a death-related trauma and issue. This may
involve the death, serious injury or illness of someone close to the
patient, which arouses predatory and existential death anxieties. Or it
may stem from the death of or harm to someone close to the patient for
which the patient bears some responsibility and which evokes
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_112}predator death anxiety and deep
unconscious guilt. Along different lines, it may involve harm suffered
by the patient at the hands of others, as seen with congenital defects
or illnesses, as well as later-life harmful incidents that involve
serious injury, illness, damage caused by others, or natural disasters
-- events that evoke both predatory and existential death anxieties.
Given both the pervasiveness and scope of the death-related threats with
which humans must deal and the dysfunctional design features of the
emotion-processing mind, we can appreciate why virtually every human
walking this earth experiences a measure of emotional dysfunction and
why every patient who has entered a psychotherapy situation shows some
form of resistance -- much as every therapist who offers this treatment
must deal with his or her own symptoms and counter-resistances as well.
Such is human nature -- and life itself.

#### **A clinical illustration** {.h4}

To illustrate aspects of this discussion, let's look now at a clinical
excerpt:

Mr Arp, a man in his late twenties, recently began once-weekly
psychotherapy with Dr Wren, a psychiatrist, for problems in relating to
women and controlling his anger. He begins his third session by saying
that he has to go to an out-of-town business meeting the following week
and that he won't be able to make his session. He then asks Dr Wren if
he could see him on a different day so he wouldn't miss a week of
therapy.

To comment, Mr Arp's intention to miss a session is a frame-violating,
gross behavioural resistance because it interferes with the progress of
the therapy and violates the ground rule that the patient should be
present at all scheduled sessions. No matter how seemingly necessary,
most plans of this kind are either driven by or satisfy deep unconscious
needs that involve both a triggering intervention of the therapist's and
the patient's deep unconscious responses to the trigger. Thus, all
intended or actual absences should be seen as psychologically-determined
resistances until proven otherwise.

There is, in addition, another gross behavioural, frame-violating
resistance here, namely the patient's request for a make-up session.
This appeal asks the therapist to respond to the patient's frame break
with a frame break of his own -- that is, to violate the ground rule
that pertains to the specified, agreed-upon, fixed time of the patient's
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_113}sessions. Indeed, even when a
school or job change makes it mandatory to change the time of a
patient's sessions -- a move that always should be made on a permanent
basis -- the alteration in the schedule is a frame modification. Thus,
even though the change must be effected in order to ensure the
continuation of the therapy -- and therefore is also a way of securing
the frame -- the frame-violating aspect will register unconsciously and
evoke encoded responses. Themes pertaining to the mixed nature of this
trigger -- breaking the frame to secure it -- will emerge.

While on this subject, let's be clear that changes in the time of a
single session, no matter what the reason and who initiates the change,
is an unjustifiable frame violation. Patients who need to miss an hour
must be allowed to have a secured-frame experience in this context, and
not be made exceptions to the rules of therapy -- and, by inference, of
life itself. Similarly, the therapist who must, of utter necessity,
cancel a session should not offer make-up hours to his or her patients
-- this, too, is a violation of the basic ground rules of treatment and
an indication of unresolved secured-frame, existential death anxieties
in the healer.

Returning to our discussion of the case material, we can see that
technically, Dr Wren has no choice but to respond to his patient's
frame-modifying request. Eventually, he must either comply or not do so.
Even saying nothing is a meaningful response because it implies not
changing the time of the session. Whatever the decision, though, it
should be based on the directives contained in the patient's subsequent
encoded themes and not made unilaterally or arbitrarily. Thus, if the
therapist were to deny outright Mr Arp's request, doing so would be
improper technique. This is the case, firstly, because he would be
answering the patient's question directly, and thereby addressing
manifest contents and implicitly encouraging the patient to avoid
encoded messages; secondly, he would interfere with the patient's
communication of the trigger and related encoded themes that account
unconsciously for this frame-modifying request; and, thirdly, he would
have failed to wait for encoded directives with which to fashion his
frame-securing intervention (which is what the encoded themes inevitably
would express) -- a response that violates his neutrality because the
intervention does not rely on the patient's material in the session at
hand.

The ideal response, then, is to not answer the patient's question when
asked and to wait for subsequent material. If the patient does not
continue to free associate, the therapist could simply remind him
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_114}of the fundamental rule and
indicate that he should continue to say whatever is coming to mind. The
therapist can be quite certain that the patient will then encode a
directive to hold the frame secured by not changing the time of the
session. The universal secured-frame needs of the deep unconscious
system virtually guarantees that encoded themes of this ilk will be
forthcoming.

Dr Wren asks Mr Arp to continue to say whatever comes to mind, and with
some annoyance, the patient does so. He says that his job has become a
burden for him, that he's been there only a year and already there's
more pressure than he can tolerate. His trip involves seeing a major
buyer of their products and, if the sale falls flat, he'll be in a lot
of trouble. But that's how his life has gone lately -- he'll catch a
break and then something will screw it up. Maybe he's masochistic, maybe
he likes to suffer. In his childhood, he was always the one who was
blamed for everything that went wrong. It's like he's suffering from a
repetition compulsion -- wasn't that what Freud called it?

To pause for further discussion, we may note that this material is
intellectualized and without the specific narratives that are the means
by which the deep unconscious system expresses itself. It's ruminative,
lacking in detailed story-telling or the report of a dream, and is laced
with self-interpretations. They are typical of the offerings made by the
conscious system, in that they are non-narrative and allude to
tendencies and conflicts within the patient without an allusion to a
trigger or an adaptive cast. They're reminders that many therapists
believe that their patients are as good at interpreting their material
as they are -- that interpretations cannot be the source of 'cure'. This
is certainly the case with so-called interpretations of manifest
contents and their implications, but far from the case when it comes to
forging interpretations that are trigger-decoded -- an effort patients
rarely, if ever, engage in.

Mr Arp is, then, showing strong communicative resistances. At least one
of his active triggers has been manifestly represented -- the
*anticipated trigger* (that is, the expectation) that Dr Wren will
comply with his request and change the time of his session. Undoubtedly,
there are other active triggers, including those that have unconsciously
motivated Mr Arp's request for a frame modification in the first place
-- and possibly his planned, frame-violating absence as well.

It's well to appreciate that changing the time of a session is a frame
violation, regardless of whether the therapist has explicitly
established the ground rule that specifies that the time and day of all
sessions is []{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_115}fixed and should not
be modified. This precept is one of the basic, healing and holding ideal
ground rules of therapy that is sought for and supported by the deep
unconscious system of the emotion-processing mind -- it's a rule that is
set and enforced by its system of morality and ethics. Thus, the deep
unconscious mind sets the ground rules of treatment -- the conscious
mind may or may not agree or comply, but deep unconscious standards and
needs should prevail.

In any case, before the therapist can get to and deal with any other
active trigger, he must obtain the encoded imagery that will direct his
immediate frame-management activities -- that will, without question,
advise him to hold the frame secured. Once he has secured the frame
based on his patient's encoded themes, two things are likely to happen.
First, the patient may be expected to encode his deep unconscious
response to the frame-securing intervention -- and we have every reason
to expect that it will be validating in nature and arouse existential
death anxieties. Second, the patient is likely to bring up -- manifestly
or in encoded form -- the other triggers that he's processing at a deep
unconscious level, the unconscious sources of his frame-deviant request
for a make-up session. If this is the case, he will also encode fresh
themes that pertain to his deep unconscious perceptions of these
additional interventions and indicate how they are motivating his
request to modify the framework of his therapy.

All in all, we're looking at a situation in which both gross behavioural
(the planned absence and request for a make-up session) and
communicative resistances (the absence of bridging and power themes)
have surfaced. The immediate goal, then, is to discover the deep
unconscious, trigger-related stimuli for these resistances, and to be in
a position to interpret the deep unconscious needs and historical
factors that are shaping Mr Arp's resistances and his choice of
obstacles. Patient waiting is the therapist's best resource in this
regard.

To be clear about the communicative resistances, we need to look at the
communicative network for encoded reactions to the anticipated trigger
and for clues to the background or unknown trigger -- the earlier
intervention -- that prompted these gross behavioural and communicative
resistances. Recall that the communicative need is for a workable
representation of the triggers -- manifestly or in thinly disguised
(encoded) form -- and for a strong pool of themes -- or as it's called,
a *full and powerful derivative network* -- that would reflect the
patient's unconscious perceptions and processing of the triggers in
question. To this point in the session, then, the patient has given the
anticipated trigger a manifest representation in his request for
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_116}a make-up session, but he has not
as yet generated a strong and meaningful pool of themes related to that
expected trigger. As for the background or unknown trigger, as far as we
can tell the patient has not given it a manifest or workable encoded
representation and the weakness of the thematic pool applies to that
trigger as well.

Communicative resistances abound. One reason for this may be that, for
the moment, instead of working over the two triggers at issue with
encoded communications that would lend themselves to interpretation,
they are being dealt with through the patient's own planned modification
of the ground rules (his intended absence) and by means of his request
that the therapist further deviate as well (by offering a make-up
session). Maladaptive actions of this kind relieve underlying anxieties
and often substitute for and impede verbal-communicative processing
activities.

The patient's frame-modifying act and request are therefore resistances
in two ways. First, a missed session precludes therapeutic work, and
second the frame modifications are being used as an action-based,
maladaptive means of attaining relief from the patient's underlying,
trigger-evoked anxieties and conflicts -- an act that, as an alternative
pathway to relief, bypasses the mental and verbal processing of the
issues involved. Were Dr Wren to support these resistances in any
manner, he would be unwittingly supporting the patient's
frame-modifying, pathological mode of symptom relief, be encouraging the
avoidance of deep insight and also promoting further acting out by his
patient.

All in all, then, Dr Wren's silence -- his intervention at the moment --
seems to be appropriate and wise. The silence is an implicit way of
letting Mr Arp know that he (Dr Wren) does not intend to engage in
making manifest content-oriented, intellectualized interventions and
that before he can intervene properly, the patient must communicate more
meaningful material, including powerful encoded themes -- an example of
the complex implications of a simple listening attitude by a therapist.
Dr Wren is, then, waiting for his patient to spontaneously forgo his
communicative defences and turn to the encoded, narrative mode of
expression -- a highly likely prospect in light of the formal research
finding that patients do indeed spontaneouly cycle in and out of this
mode of communication (Langs *et al.*, 1996). Should this not occur, the
therapist could point out the lack of narrative material as a way of
confronting the patient's communicative resistances and implicitly
encouraging, or explicitly asking, the patient to generate encoded
thematic material. Returning to the vignette:

[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_117}Dr Wren decides to intervene and
points out that something is prompting Mr Arp to ruminate instead of
telling stories -- his material is quite flat. The patient then says
that, well, he did have a dream the previous night. In the dream, he was
in a high-school classroom, taking an examination. He felt panicky
because he was unprepared for the exam.

The dream brings to mind his growing up in a poor neighbourhood in New
York City. But his father's manufacturing business did well and he sent
the patient to a private high school. Mr Arp felt out of place there and
insisted that he be transferred to the public high school in his
neighbourhood, even though he was in the middle of the term and the kids
in the public school were known to be nasty and dangerous. His parents
agreed to his request and on the first day that he attended classes
there, he lost one of his textbooks and stole a copy from a classmate.
The boy found out about the theft and beat him so badly he had to be
hospitalized for a week. He really regretted changing schools. His
parents never should have acceded to his stupid wishes.

Dr Wren intervenes again and points out that at the beginning of the
session, the patient had requested that he (Dr Wren) also change
something for him (the patient). The story about changing high schools
seems to be connected to his request that he (Dr Wren) change the time
of his (Mr Arp's) session the following week. But the story indicates
that making the change would be against his (Mr Arp's) best interests,
that in some way it would do violence to him. And his comment that his
parents shouldn't have agreed to do it clearly indicates that he too (Dr
Wren) should not accede to the patient's request. In keeping with his
(Mr Arp's) advice, he (Dr Wren) will keep the time of his sessions as
arranged and not offer a different time for the session next week.

Mr Arp pauses for a moment and remembers that his sister was the only
one in his family who was against his leaving the private school. She
had predicted that he'd be attacked in the public school. She had a good
head on her shoulders; she wasn't like his parents, she had sound
judgment and she was the only one in his family whom he could trust. It
suddenly occurs to Mr Arp that he was in the private high school when
his brother died. The anniversary of his death happens to be next
Thursday, the day of his scheduled session. He really should be with his
parents that day because they took his brother's death so hard. It
occurs to him now that he probably can change the day of his out-of-town
meeting to the following Monday. He must have been running from the
whole sordid scene with his
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_118}parents in making the appointment
on the same day as the anniversary of his brother's death. 'And from
me', Dr Wren, points out, 'You were running from me too'. 'Yes, from you
too', agrees the patient, who then adds that he'll be able to make his
session as scheduled.

With time running out, Mr Arp now recalls that Dr Wren had suggested in
the previous session that some kind of dark memory seemed to be encoded
in the dream he had reported in that hour. All he could remember about
the dream at the moment was that his brother was in it and there was a
twisted steel structure of some kind. The dream must have had something
to do with the anniversary of the death of his brother. He and his
brother were in a car that his brother was driving when he lost control
of the car and it slid into a ditch and turned over. His brother wasn't
wearing a seat belt and was killed; the patient had noticed it, but
hadn't said anything even though he had his own belt on. The twisted
steel reminds him of the horrors that confronted him when he regained
consciousness after being knocked unconscious by the accident. With that
the session came to an end.

To comment again, the patient's report of his dream -- the turning point
in the session -- emerged only after the therapist did not join the
patient in his intellectualizations, which were weak and trivial, and
eventually pointed out the absence of narrative material. The dream and
associations, which yielded a bridging theme to the anticipated trigger
and many power themes, including the death of the patient's brother, led
to the clarification of the unconscious basis for the patient's gross
behavioural and communicative resistances. The deep unconscious motives
behind these resistances appear to have been, in part, the patient's
secured-frame death anxieties -- essentially, the fear of dying in a
closed or secured space, much as his brother had died and as the patient
had nearly died in the car accident. There also seems to be a wish to be
harmed by the therapist as punishment for his deep unconscious guilt
over his belief that he had contributed to the death of his brother by
not insisting that he use his safety belt -- a wish encoded in the story
of being severely beaten when he committed the crime of stealing the
book at school.

The session aptly demonstrates the emotional weakness of manifest
ruminations when compared to the death-related traumas that were related
to the patient's dream and his storied associations -- this is typical
of the difference between the emotional world accessed by the weak and
strong adaptive approaches. There is as well a vast difference in
emotional impact when a patient ruminates about the loss of a sibling
[]{#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_page_119}as compared to when the loss is
worked over in the context of a patient's deep unconscious experience of
that loss.

Additional motives for the patient's resistances evidently include the
wish to avoid the arousal of manifest memories of the death of his
brother in a setting where the deep unconscious conflicts caused by his
loss were likely to materialize. Thus, the triggers for the patient's
gross behavioural and communicative resistances were, first, the secured
frame, and, second, the interpretive interventions by the therapist
which were moving the patient towards images that were connected with
his conscious and deep unconscious processing of the death of his
brother. Notice, too, that eventually it was revealed that the patient
did not need the frame change because he was in a position to change the
day of the conflicting out-of-town appointment. In many situations of
this kind, it does indeed turn out that a frame-modifying request is
frivolous and not the result of events beyond the control of the
patient.

In respect to technique, the therapist correctly maintained the secured
frame -- the agreed-upon time of the following session -- on the basis
of the patient's directive as reflected in his encoded themes. In
response, he obtained encoded, deep unconscious, interpersonal
validation from the patient through the story of the patient's sister
who wisely spoke out against the change in schools and could be trusted.
In addition, cognitive validation appeared through the emergence of
fresh material, mainly about the death of the patient's brother, that
illuminated aspects of the patient's resistances not previously
communicated.

All in all, then, given the design of the emotion-processing mind, the
processing of resistances is bound to occupy the bulk of
psychotherapeutic work, and serve as the source of many frustrations and
yet profound insights for both patients and their therapists. There is
no other gateway to accessing the deep unconscious core of a patient's
symptoms and therefore to lasting, insightful symptom relief. Therapists
need to be patient with these obstacles to effective treatment and to
maintain their therapeutic stance despite the assaultive effects of
these momentary barriers. Doing so is richly rewarding for all
concerned.

### Triggers and Themes {.h3a}

As we have seen, the emotion-processing mind is an adaptive module
geared primarily to coping with traumatic environmental events, broadly
defined. These adaptive efforts are carried out by both the conscious
and deep unconscious systems, and they are evoked by triggering events.
On the deep unconscious level, the result is the generation of narrative
themes that reflect the events and meanings that have been perceived and
processed deep-unconsciously. Thus, triggers and themes -- the subject
of this chapter -- are the key to understanding and interpreting the
powerful emotional issues that we, as humans, process outside of
awareness and that lie at the heart of patients' emotionally-founded
symptoms and resistances. Reduced to its basics, then, the optimal
intervention that can be fashioned in order to reach into the deep
unconscious realm and obtain deep-unconscious encoded validation
involves, first, correctly identifying the trigger to which the patient
is responding deep-unconsciously and, second, decoding the narrative
themes in light of that trigger. This is done by relocating or
transposing the themes from their manifest context in a dream or story
into the situation with the triggering event, and treating the resultant
imagery as reflecting the patient's valid, unconscious perceptions of
the meanings and implications of the triggering event.

To cite a brief illustration:

With the permission of his adolescent patient, Frank, Dr Hall, a male
psychologist, has a session with Frank's mother in which they discuss
some of her issues and problems with her son. In the session after the
[]{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_121}contact with the mother, Frank
asks about the therapist's meeting with his mother, is told about it in
broad terms by Dr Hall, and then Frank tells his therapist that his
seeing her seems to have been helpful -- his mother settled down after
the meeting. He then tells a story about his best friend, Walter, whose
mother has been listening in on his telephone conversations with his
friends. When Walter complained to his father about what his mother was
doing, the father sided with the mother, saying that they didn't trust
Walter's friends. It was a dumb thing for him to say. The fact is that
Walter is the one who can't trust his parents. The other day Frank and
Walter laughingly plotted to kill Walter's parents with rat poison so
Walter could have a life.

The trigger here is the therapist's session with the patient's mother.
Even with the patient's permission, this is a violation of the
deep-unconsciously sought ideal ground rules pertaining to total privacy
and confidentiality. Typically, the patient consciously sanctions the
frame violation, but objects vigorously at the deep unconscious level.

The trigger is alluded to manifestly. The story of Walter's mother's
eavesdropping is the first encoded narrative theme. We lift the theme
from the story and recognize that it's a frame violation -- an invasion
of privacy -- that bridges over -- is analogous -- to the trigger of Dr
Hall's talking to Frank's mother, an intervention that invited her to
listen in on Frank's therapy sessions. So we bring the theme to the
triggering intervention and use it to tell the story of Frank's
unconscious perception of the trigger. The read-out is that Dr Hall had
invited Frank's mother to violate the privacy of her son's therapy -- to
eavesdrop. This is a personally selected, valid perception of a
universal meaning of such a contact -- there's no sign of distortion or
misperception.

The theme of sanction by Walter's father is also lifted from the
narrative and transposed into the triggering situation. In translation,
it says that the mother's request to see Dr Hall was based on a mistrust
of her son and that Dr Hall's agreeing to see her, and thereby
supporting her request to eavesdrop on her son, was a dumb thing for him
to do -- and, through the mechanism of condensation, the same applies to
Frank's giving her permission as well.

As for the two boys plotting to murder Walter's parents, we lift that
theme from the manifest story and bring it to the triggering situation.
This narrative also allows for two translations. First, it seems to
express Frank's deep unconscious rage at both his mother and therapist
for having had an eavesdropping session together. And, second, it may
also []{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_122}convey the unconscious
perception that the session in some way murdered or did violence to both
Frank and Dr Hall -- that is, that it destroyed the therapy. In
addition, the storied theme of Walter's not being able to trust his
parents is transposed into the therapy as a valid deep unconscious
response to Dr Hall's session with the mother -- it has destroyed
Frank's trust of his therapist.

*Triggers and transposed, decoded themes* are at the heart of every
strong adaptive formulation of deep unconscious experience and of every
unconsciously validated trigger-decoded interpretation and frame
management effort.

#### **The search for triggers** {.h4}

It seems evident that sound formulations of patients' material begin
with the identification of the most powerful triggers or meanings of
triggering events that are active in a given therapy session. As noted,
these triggers are usually the interventions of therapists, or, more
rarely, extremely traumatic outside events that have evoked the adaptive
activities of patients' emotion-processing minds and their deep
unconscious systems in particular. While the existence and some meanings
of a given trigger may be perceived and registered consciously, the most
critical triggers and/or meanings are perceived unconsciously and
processed by the deep unconscious system. It's these experiences that
are the unconscious roots of both symptoms and resistances, and they
often take the form of an intervention that seems innocuous consciously,
yet has a profound deep unconscious impact on the patient -- and
therapist as well.

Consciously registered triggers and meanings of triggers evoke conscious
adaptive responses. They may involve the interventions of therapists,
but, most often, they pertain to all manner of events outside of the
therapy, and as such they are relatively unempowered *vis-à-vis* a
patient's symptoms and/or resistances. It is important to appreciate
that, as a rule, the most anxiety-provoking meanings of consciously
registered triggers tend to be perceived and processed at the deep
unconscious level.

When triggers are alluded to manifestly, it is incumbent on a therapist
to attend to the patient's themes for relevant unconscious perceptions
and their ramifications. But it's also important to search for other
active triggers because there is often an additional repressed or denied
trigger that may be of greater importance to the patient emotionally.
These triggers usually obtain encoded representation and are therefore
[]{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_123}more difficult to identify than
those that are directly mentioned. The search for unmentioned triggers
usually begins with a therapist's review of his or her conscious
knowledge of existing, active triggers -- the therapist's trigger list.
It also entails listening to the themes in the patient's material for
clues to possible unidentified triggers -- themes always reflect the
triggers that have evoked them. In this context, it's well to note that
a session in which a patient is dealing with but one trigger is
extremely rare, although there are many sessions in which a single
trigger is by far the most powerful environmental stimulus at the moment
-- the key is in correctly identifying which one, among several active
triggers, it is.

In principle, then, therapists should be ever-mindful of the need to
search for triggers that patients do not allude to directly -- they may
be of great importance. This is often the case when a patient has been
subjected to a highly traumatic intervention by the therapist -- often
in the form of a frame modification. The very fact that the therapist
has intervened in a harmful manner makes it especially difficult for the
patient to allude to the trigger directly, and even in encoded fashion,
much as it makes it difficult for the therapist to recognize
communicated encoded clues to its existence. Both patient and therapist
tend to repress and/or deny the experience of destructive interventions
by therapists.

There are several safeguards against this type of blocking by a
therapist. First, there's the examination of the patient's material for
signs of non-validation after an intervention has been made --
unconfirmed triggers are likely to be both harmful and repressed by both
parties to the therapy. Second, there's the therapist's self-examination
of his or her interventions for signs of error and harm caused, while a
third safeguard involves maintaining an up-to-date trigger list of one's
active interventions and extended silences. A fourth protector entails a
monitoring of the negative themes in patients' narratives -- they
usually imply that the therapist has intervened in error and caused harm
to the patient. Such themes call for a reexamination of the therapist's
trigger list, and if the negative themes cannot be accounted for through
known interventions, the search for a missed errant intervention should
be undertaken. Lastly, the therapist should monitor the themes in the
patient's material for bridging imagery -- themes that could represent a
missing trigger. For example, themes of being robbed suggest a
fee-related overcharge, while those of exposure and nudity suggest a
modification of the privacy and confidentiality of the frame. Themes are
invaluable clues to missing triggers.

[]{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_124}There are several variations on
who is and is not aware of a powerful triggering event at any given
moment in a session -- the patient and/or therapist. For one, there are
many situations in which both parties to therapy are so informed. This
usually means that the patient has manifestly alluded to the trigger,
the therapist has noticed the allusion, and now waits for a cluster of
powerful encoded themes in order to intervene. But there are also
sessions in which the patient is aware of a trigger that the therapist
has missed when the patient mentioned it. These situations are reminders
that therapists need to be open to hearing and consciously registering
patients' passing allusions to triggers and to be cognizant of times
when they themselves have been traumatized and are likely to intensify
their use of denial and miss patients' references to powerful triggering
interventions.

Actually, matters are even more complicated when the therapist is aware
of a trigger that the patient is consciously unaware of and has not
mentioned. In these situations, the patient's communicative resistances
are strong and the trigger is in all likelihood quite powerful and
traumatic. The therapist is obligated to work only with what the patient
communicates and therefore should not unilaterally introduce the
trigger. Instead, he or she is restricted to doing a playback of the
relevant encoded themes as they become available for intervening, doing
so in the hope of eliciting from the patient a direct allusion to the
missing trigger -- after which a full interpretation can be offered.
This arises most often when there are signs of illness and other severe
impairments in the therapist.

Finally, in situations in which neither the patient nor the therapist is
consciously aware of an important trigger, the only hope for recovering
it lies with the therapist's monitoring the themes in the patient's
material for images that suggest unnoticed triggering interventions.
This search is very much called for in the presence of unexplained gross
behavioural and/or communicative resistances, as the trigger that evokes
these obstacles to therapeutic progress is usually a highly traumatic
intervention by the therapist -- here, too, signs of serious physical
illness in the therapist often serve as the evocative trigger.

All in all, then, the search for missing triggers is an ever-present
challenge for the psychotherapist. They may be identified directly by a
therapist who carefully monitors his or her interventions and keeps
track of those that seem especially powerful. And they can also be
discovered by monitoring patients' narrative themes for clues to
triggers of which the therapist him or herself is unaware. Themes cannot
be interpreted and proper rectifications of the frame cannot be carried
[]{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_125}out without knowing the
accountable triggers. The ability of therapists to forgo their denial of
errant and hurtful triggering interventions is vital to the avoidance of
misalliances with their patients in which powerful, traumatic
interventions are obliterated by both parties to therapy -- and, as a
result, never identified, processed, interpreted and worked through.
This kind of shared blind-spot is an ever-present danger, often the
source of many unexplained symptoms and resistances in patients and
symptoms and counter-resistances in their therapists.

#### **The conscious recognition of active triggers** {.h4}

As noted, therapists should consciously be in touch with and monitor
their most recent interventions, and when power themes appear in
patients' material they should be prepared to organize and identify
their most likely encoded meanings in light of these triggering stimuli.
Strongly evocative triggers must be distinguished from those that are
relatively inconsequential, and consciously registered triggers and
meanings of triggers need to be differentiated from those that are
registered deep-unconsciously. Because of the pervasive use of denial by
the conscious mind, the two classes of events and meanings -- that is,
those that are registered consciously as compared to those that are
registered deep-unconsciously -- are not at all alike, and the
processing activities of the conscious and deep unconscious systems deal
with two very different constellations of meanings and handle them very
differently. The distinction between manifest and encoded contents is
crucial here.

A great challenge for the therapist, then, is to be aware of the
significant, active, traumatic triggering interventions, or rare outside
catastrophes, that a patient has not alluded to manifestly and that the
therapist's own conscious mind may be inclined to ignore as well. To
carry out this task effectively, therapists must overcome their own
denial-based defences so they can be fully cognizant of their
interventions and their most telling implications. It's especially
important, as I've been stressing, to develop the capability of
detecting erroneous interventions and other possible ways that a
therapist has traumatized a patient -- for example, through a sudden
lapse in anonymity or by appearing to be ill or injured. Keeping track
of frame-related interventions is especially helpful in these efforts.

#### **Identifying triggers by monitoring narrative themes** {.h4}

In addition to conscious monitoring, the second way of identifying
missing triggers is carried out by listening to the themes in the
[]{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_126}patient's narrative material and
keeping an ear open for themes that might well bridge over and point to
an overlooked triggering intervention. This effort is carried out by
keeping in mind the four main areas of intervening that might be
especially traumatic for a patient:

•[]{.pad}first, the mismanagement or violations of the ground rules of
the therapy which are inherently harmful;

•[]{.pad}second, the validated securing of the therapy frame which
evokes secured-frame anxieties;

•[]{.pad}third, erroneous verbal interventions which are also
intrinsically harmful; and

•[]{.pad}fourth, the validated interpretation of disturbing deep
unconscious meanings and their connections to past traumas as stirred up
by adaptation-evoking triggers -- interventions that stir up a dread of
deep unconscious meanings.

As we can see, both validated and non-validated therapeutic efforts may
evoke anxieties and resistances in patients. It is helpful, then, in
searching for overlooked triggers to appreciate the kinds of situations
in which these disturbing triggers are likely to be missed. The
therapist's unconsciously validated explorations of a patient's
activated, anxiety-provoking, repressed or denied, death-related events
and their meanings is both vital to the healing process and is one
source of considerable anxiety for the patient. This issue is strongest
when the ground rules of treatment have been secured or stabilized so
that distracting frame violations no longer occupy the patient's deep
unconscious mind. The patient's deep unconscious experience of this type
of therapeutic work is fraught with emotional dangers. With patients who
have acted in a predatory fashion against others, a therapist's pursuit
of these efforts tends to be experienced unconsciously as tantamount to
trying to murder the patient. This is not a distortion or transference
manifestation, but a true reflection of the patient's fear of suicidal
fantasies and impulses when his or her deep unconscious guilt is
activated in the treatment situation. Interpretation of the patient's
trigger-evoked themes must be shaped in a way that takes this factor
into account.

Predatory, death-related early traumas may also create similar fears of
the therapeutic work and therapist. This arises, for example, in
instances when there's an activation of conscious and unconscious
memories of violent acts by a parent towards the patient when he or she
was an infant or child -- for example, attempts at abortion, acts that
[]{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_127}have severely harmed the child,
being born with a congenital defect, and so on. The dread here is of the
reexperience of the danger situation along with the related predatory
death anxieties and of murderous rage against the parent or other person
involved in the damaging incident. It's well to appreciate, then, that
the therapeutic pursuit of repressed or denied traumatic, death-related
memories is experienced by patients as persecutory despite its ultimate
critical healing qualities -- it's not a readily welcome curative
effort. Work of this kind may be quite difficult for both the therapist
and patient, who often tends to become resistant and, at times,
psychologically assaultive towards the therapist even though -- or
because -- the patient unconsciously validates the therapist's
interpretations and reconstructions. This anxiety-driven opposition
occurs despite the therapeutic benefits accrued by the patient.

Technically, therapists should not attempt to force interventions on
their patients by introducing ideas that extend beyond the
trigger-decoded meanings of the encoded narratives available in a given
session. Interventions that are consciously refuted by, or confusing to,
a patient should not be repeated by the therapist -- instead, he or she
should sit back and await further encoded material from the patient to
see where the problem lies. There's no need to hurry this kind of work,
especially when the therapist is intervening in an appropriate and
unconsciously validated manner, and neither frame violations nor
interventional errors are involved. Both tact and caution are called for
-- neither backing away from the available encoded material nor pressing
one's interpretations beyond the patient's tolerance. The
anxiety-provoking insights so derived are vital to a restructuring of
the patient's adaptive resources, but they come at the cost of
considerable guilt and anxiety as well.

Along different lines, the search for missing triggers requires that
therapists strive to become aware of every nuance of their management
and impingements on the ground rules of treatment -- be they
frame-securing or frame-modifying. Because frame violations are harmful
to patients and often register deep-unconsciously rather than
consciously in their minds -- and in the minds of the therapists so
involved as well -- there's a need to continually monitor patients'
narrative themes for frame-related imagery. Each ground rule is mirrored
by a particular set of themes and emergence of these themes in a
patient's material -- and they fall into a small and manageable number
of areas -- calls for a careful search for a missed trigger in respect
to the ground rule to which the themes point. The following list of
ground rules and []{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_128}related themes
can serve as a general guideline to the kinds of themes that should
alert a therapist to the presence of a missing frame-related trigger:

1[]{.pad}The single, set fee -- themes of money, greed (a fee increase),
stealing (an overcharge), charitable donations (an undercharge), salary
decreases and harmful overindulgences (a reduction in the fee), and
earning one's due through benign trickery (increasing a low fee to a
reasonable one -- that is, breaking the frame to secure it).

2[]{.pad}The locale, which should be a professional setting -- themes of
exposure and bizarre or dangerous places and structures (for home-office
arrangements), or those of new, safe places (for a shift from a
home-office to a professional setting).

3[]{.pad}Confinement of contact between the patient and therapist to the
time and place of the sessions -- themes of seduction, loss of
boundaries, being followed or pursued (inadvertent meetings outside of
the therapist's office), and themes of rape and exploitation (arranged
meetings outside of the therapist's office).

4[]{.pad}A single, set time, length, and frequency of sessions -- themes
of harmful overindulgence, chemical addiction, seduction (for a change
in the time of a session), and themes of safety and trust, keeping
appointments, and so on (holding the frame in these areas).

5[]{.pad}Full responsibility for the therapist to be present for all
scheduled sessions -- themes of loss, death, illness, disappearance,
abandonment or irresponsibility (the therapist misses or unexpectedly
cancels a scheduled session).

6[]{.pad}Total privacy, with no access to the sessions by third parties
in any form -- themes of intruders, invaders, spies, third parties to
various situations, exposure or exhibitionism (the therapist speaks with
a patient's relative or friend, or completes an insurance form), or
themes of safety and ensuring the safety of someone's secrets (the
therapist does not speak to a third party who tries to contact him or
her or does not complete a presented insurance form).

7[]{.pad}Total confidentiality, with no note-taking by the therapist and
no release of information in any form -- themes of leakage, exposure of
secrets, and themes similar to those that emerge when the therapist
violates the rule of total privacy (for violations of this ground rule),
and themes of keeping matters private and safeguarding secrets (for
keeping to this ground rule).

8[]{.pad}The relative anonymity of the therapist, with no deliberate
self-revelations, advice, opinions, directives and extraneous comments
-- []{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_129}themes of nudity, exposure,
exploitation, controlling others, manipulation or infantalization (when
a therapist reveals personal information or tells a patient what he or
she should or should not do), themes of illness and death (when a healer
therapist appears to be ill or injured), and themes of modesty and
allowing others their autonomy (when the therapist adheres to these
tenets).

9[]{.pad}The absence of physical contact between the two parties --
themes of physical harm and sexual contact (inadvertent brushes between
patient and therapist) and of rape and violence (deliberate physical
contact between patient and therapist).

In addition to these particular bridging themes, which point to a
particular frame-violating trigger, all frame-violating acts by
therapists evoke predatory themes of harm and seduction. As for
frame-securing interventions, they tend to generate a mixture of themes
-- those of safety and trust, along with themes of entrapment and
annihilation related to the existential death anxieties activated by
secured frames.

#### **Other helpful clues to triggers** {.h4}

Another helpful tool for identifying triggering events is the various
ways that they can be classified. First, there's the important issue of
the level of awareness at which a trigger has been perceived and
registered by the patient -- consciously or unconsciously. There may be
full conscious registration of the major meanings of an interventional
triggering event, but, more typically, the overall traumatic triggering
event registers in awareness, as do some of its lesser meanings, while
its most disturbing meanings register at the deep unconscious level.
Another scenario entails the unconscious perception and deep unconscious
processing of the entire traumatic incident and its meanings -- an
instance of extreme perceptual denial. This type of response is much
more common than generally realized because, as humans, we have no way
of knowing that we've completely obliterated a strongly traumatic
triggering event -- as a rule, these situations can be recognized only
if the denied incident is identified by an outside party such as an
adaptive-sensitive psychotherapist.

In psychotherapy, then, the therapist may be aware of a traumatic
intervention or outside event that the patient is processing
deep-unconsciously, of which the patient has absolutely no conscious
awareness. In this regard there are two possibilities: first, that the
trigger was consciously experienced by the patient and has been
[]{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_130}repressed, or, second, that the
trigger was subjected to perceptual denial and registered
deep-unconsciously. In the first instance, the trigger can eventually be
recovered, mostly with the help of the therapist's playback of encoded
bridging themes. But in the second instance the trigger is unrecoverable
-- patients cannot become aware of a memory of an event that has
registered deep-unconsciously because memory traces that eventually can
be brought into awareness require conscious registration at the time of
the incident. Since, technically, the therapist should not override the
patient's denial and introduce the trigger to the patient, therapeutic
work with this kind of triggering event is carried out solely on the
encoded level of the patient's communications. Indeed, should a
therapist inadvertently mention the trigger to the patient, he or she
will have no idea what the therapist is talking about.

Another helpful insight stems from the finding that the conscious mind
works over consciously-registered triggering events and meanings, while
the deep unconscious mind works over unconsciously-registered events and
meanings. As a result, there are many situations in which the conscious
system is processing and adapting to one set of trigger events and
meanings (those that have been perceived at the conscious level and are
weak emotionally), while the deep unconscious system is working over a
very different set of triggers (those that have been perceived at the
deep unconscious level and are powerful emotionally). Recognition of the
triggers that the patient has alluded to consciously should not lull the
therapist into turning away from the task of identifying all of the
active triggers and meanings that the patient has perceived and
processed deep-unconsciously.

Another classification of triggers to keep in mind is their source --
that is, either within or outside of the therapy. In keeping with the
tendency of the conscious system to scan all manner of triggering
events, patients' consciously perceived triggers usually pertain to
events outside of therapy, although at times they may concern the
interventions of their therapists. In general, however, short of a
dramatic intervention by a therapist, for patients in treatment the
conscious mind is focused on triggers outside of therapy and, in
addition, almost all triggering events outside of the therapy situation
are worked over and adapted to by the conscious mind with little or no
deep unconscious activity. The exceptions to this rule are, as noted,
extremely traumatic triggering events that involve personal and public
disasters.

In contrast, it bears repeating that patients' deep unconscious minds
are focused almost entirely on their therapists' interventions. These
[]{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_131}triggering events may register
consciously, while their more disturbing meanings register
deep-unconsciously, or they may register deep-unconsciously in their
entirety. The therapist works with them accordingly, making certain to
interpret the most powerful themes and the aspects of the patients'
emotional problems and genetic history that they touch on. Therapeutic
work with unconsciously registered triggers is extremely difficult
largely because, first, the patient or client is unaware of the trigger,
and, second, the trigger itself is severely anxiety-provoking -- which
is why it was not allowed to register in awareness in the first place.
Examples of this kind of trigger include inadvertent indications that
the therapist is physically ill or injured, but it may also involve
disturbing personal information about the therapist that a patient
obtains either directly from the therapist or from third parties who
know the therapist personally -- especially non-professional information
that involves illness in the therapist or a family member, the death of
someone close to the therapist, and references to other kinds of
personal life crises.

Still another way of classifying triggers involves the aspects of
emotional life that they touch on. As I have indicated, the deep
unconscious system is a highly focused system that is sensitive to only
a small number of classes of intervention and events. Keeping these
areas of experience in mind helps therapists scan patients' material for
missing triggers that are being processed by the deep system. As you may
recall, the most important group of triggers touch on transactions that
involve the rules, frames and boundaries of the therapy situation. The
other aspects of interventions made by therapists that are monitored by
and responded to by the deep unconscious system are the therapist's
level of listening, formulating and intervening -- be it manifest
contents and conscious material, or encoded and deep unconscious -- and
the validity of the therapist's interventions. Essentially, the deep
unconscious mind validates sound therapeutic work with encoded meanings,
but does not affirm work with manifest contents and their implications.
Therapists can therefore use the encoded narrative communications from
the deep unconscious system as a reliable guide to sound and effective,
deeply insightful psychotherapy.

#### **The pool of encoded or derivative themes** {.h4}

The narrative thematic material from a patient in a given session
collates into what has been variously called a *pool of encoded themes,*
a *narrative pool* or a *derivative complex* -- derivatives are
disguised themes []{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_132}that are
'derived from' a meaning of a triggering event. There are several useful
principles that apply to listening to and formulating the unconscious
meanings of this kind of narrative material. For one, themes that are
expressed in intellectualized material are either weak or not pertinent
to the most compelling, deep-unconsciously active triggers at any given
moment in a session. In contrast, themes that are expressed in a dream
or story that the patient creates or recounts generally encode
unconscious perceptions of important meanings and implications of
active, traumatic triggering events.

Another useful concept pertains to the distinction between powerful and
weak thematic material. Power themes are reflections of intensely
anxiety-provoking unconscious perceptions that are the substance of deep
unconscious experience and processes. Such themes include allusions to
death, injury, illness, harm, violence, natural disasters and so on, and
they should alert the therapist to the existence of a major triggering
event. In the absence of power themes, the deep unconscious mind is not
being represented. A strong, meaningful and workable derivative (that
is, encoded/disguised) network must include at least several power
themes; indeed no pool of themes is complete without frame-related and
power themes. Nevertheless, there's a strong human tendency to
consciously avoid power imagery and dwell on less-empowered
emotion-related themes. Sexuality or concerns with self-esteem and
relating are substituted for death-related issues. Patients tend to
emphasize and self-interpret these relatively weak themes and issues,
and therapists need to struggle against their inclinations to follow
suit.

In formulating the meanings and implications of active triggers that
link to a pool of themes, it's important that the therapist recognize
all of the power themes and account for and use them in his or her
interpretation or frame-securing efforts. If this appears to be
unfeasible, it's well for the therapist to consider the likelihood that
he or she has overlooked a critical trigger, one that would better
account for the unexplained powerful imagery -- a fresh trigger search
should follow (see above). A useful clue in this regard is the finding
that power themes always touch on one of the three forms of death
anxiety, so a therapist is well-advised to first search for a trigger
capable of arousing these concerns.

Therapists should listen to the themes in patients' narrative material
with one basic question in mind: 'What intervention have I made that
this theme encodes a valid unconscious perception of me in light of what
I've said or done?' A patient's conscious view of a therapist
[]{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_133}and his or her interventions is
unreliable, and generally defensive and deceptive, but deep unconscious
views are extremely dependable and well worth listening to. This is
because narrative themes encode selected, valid unconscious perceptions
of a therapist in light of his or her interventions -- frame-related and
otherwise. Encoded themes are a rich source of deep unconscious,
adaptive wisdom and a very reliable guide on how to do effective insight
psychotherapy.

In addition to power themes, the pool of themes should, as a rule, also
have *bridging themes* -- themes that encode the identity of the
triggering event and therefore facilitate moving the disguised themes
within the narrative into alignment with the triggering event. For
example, the trigger of a fee increase evokes a story about getting a
dishonest kick-back from a customer -- the theme of getting money in a
dishonest, frame-violating manner is the bridging theme (the fee should
be set at the outset of a therapy and remain as agreed-upon). Or, a
trigger of filling out an insurance form with information about a
patient evokes a story of a spy giving the enemy secret information; the
inappropriate, frame-violating revelation of what should be kept secret
bridges from the story to the trigger. Themes of this kind tend to be
frame-related and they provide convincing evidence that the encoded
imagery is indeed connected with the evocative trigger. Such themes are
called *close derivatives* because their degree of disguise allows for
ready decoding. They stand in contrast with *distant derivatives* which
are far more difficult to unravel.

The build-up of a strong and usable pool of derivative themes is a vital
feature of every meaningful session, and there are several types of
interventions that help patients to generate this kind of thematic
material. First, there's the *basic rule of guided associations* alluded
to earlier -- the adaptive precept that advises the patient to begin
each session with a dream or a spontaneously made-up story and to then
associate fresh stories to the elements of this initial narrative -- the
so-called *origination narrative* (Langs, 1993, 1999a). This precept is
usually introduced in the first session because patients need to be
informed that certain types of material facilitate the therapeutic
process by helping them to gain access to their deep unconscious
experiences and adaptive solutions. Left to their own devices, the
conscious minds of patients, with their strong inclination for denial
and defence, will avoid generating narrative material, especially
stories replete with power themes. The directive to generate as much
narrative material as possible is offered to counter this in-built,
natural tendency. Thus, while dreams serve well in and of themselves as
a conveyor of thematic imagery, they serve
[]{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_134}even better as the source of
fresh associated stories, many of them pertaining to events in the life
of the patient. As a rule, these associated narratives tend to have more
powerful themes than those found in the dream itself.

Other useful interventions that favour patients' generation of narrative
imagery include the therapist's use of silence when a patient is
building a strong pool of themes, and when the patient is
intellectualizing or generating weak themes. Another helpful
intervention involves gently confronting the patient with the absence of
narrative material when such is the case. Finally, the offer of
validated trigger-decoded interpretations implicitly encourages the
patient to communicate further meaningful encoded, powerful narrative
imagery.

#### **Factors in overlooking important triggers and themes** {.h4}

As humans, we are naturally-born encoders, but just as naturally we are
also poor decoders who are inherently disinclined to learn about and
engage in trigger decoding. This avoidance arises because we tend to
encode perceptions that are emotionally painful and intolerable to
awareness -- and by evolved design the emotion-processing mind is
configured to keep it that way. This means that trigger decoding, which
requires the identification of an unconsciously perceived trigger, is a
process whose use goes against human nature -- even when it applies to
decoding the imagery of someone other than ourselves.

The difficulties in bringing ourselves as therapists to engage in
trigger decoding stem from a number of additional, specific sources. The
first is the evident fact that, as therapists, we are restricted to
using our conscious minds in our work with patients. The cognitive
design of the conscious system, the weak triggers and meanings to which
it is drawn, its overuse of denial, the relatively simple emotional
issues with which it's concerned, and its view of the world is far
different from the more effective design and powerful concerns of the
deep unconscious mind. But in addition to the natural weakness of
conscious cognitive processing in the emotional realm, for the conscious
mind the world of deep unconscious experience is unfamiliar, alien,
puzzling and dangerous, thereby making it inherently difficult for
therapists to tune in to patients' deep unconscious communications and
experiences.

Along different but related lines, the contents and meanings of
unconscious perceptions are quite disturbing for therapists to decode
and bring into awareness for both their patients and themselves.
[]{#9781403903426_16_ch9.html_page_135}These images tend to be focused
on therapists' errant and harmful interventions, qualities of their work
that therapists are often unaware of and are disinclined to search for
-- or to recognize in patients' encoded material. There's a dread in
therapists of experiencing conscious guilt, although deep unconscious
guilt and predator death anxiety cannot be avoided through these
defensive efforts.

Another deterrent to engaging in trigger decoding stems from the finding
that the deep unconscious system copes with and processes perceptions
that are always linked to death and death anxieties -- areas of concern
that therapists strive to avoid for reasons of personal anxiety. There
is also the disquieting realization that the consistency with which
patients react deep-unconsciously to their therapists' interventions
speaks for the enormous influence that they have on the emotional lives
and treatment experiences of their patients -- this too mitigates
against engaging in trigger decoding. And given the extent to which
humans experience similar traumas and share common anxieties and
conflicts, especially those that are death-related, triggers that evoke
undue personal anxieties in patients often have similar effects on their
therapists. As a result, therapists unconsciously activate their own
conscious-system denial mechanisms to defensively protect themselves
from being overwhelmed by these concerns, and avoiding efforts at
trigger decoding serves this purpose quite well. Finally, triggers and
themes that point to the need for therapists to intervene by securing
the therapeutic frame tend to activate their existential death anxieties
and prompts them to avoid recognizing the triggers and encoded models of
rectification to be found in their patients' disguised narrative
material.

This outline of factors mitigating against the adaptive approach to
psychotherapy, and to the recognition of active triggers and of encoded,
unconscious responses to these triggers, helps us to appreciate why so
few therapists engage in this process and why those who do find it so
arduous. It asks a lot of therapists to work this way, but, as I have
been emphasizing, doing so gives back far more to themselves and their
patients than is possible through any other means. In their dread of
death and the experience of death anxieties, of unconscious meaning and
secured frames, therapists fail to appreciate the enormous amount of
healing and personal creativity that comes from dealing with and
mastering these most disturbing and ever-present concerns.

[]{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html}

### []{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_ch10}[]{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_136}10 {.label}

### Three Classes of Intervention {.h3a}

The strong adaptive approach has found that only those interventions
that obtain encoded, unconscious validation are truly and deeply
healing. In testing out all manner of interventions, it has also found
that there are very few types of intervention, correctly applied, that
meet this criterion. In turning to therapists' interventions, I shall,
then, confine myself to those that meet this stringent but clinically
supported criterion. And as for the definition of the term
*intervention,* I shall use it to refer to everything that a therapist
says and does that is at all connected with a given patient's
psychotherapy. This includes everything that touches on the means by
which a therapist has arranged to and actually obtains referrals; all of
the therapist's direct transactions between him or herself and the
patient, in both words and deeds, including extended silences and
contacts within and outside of the therapist's office; and any contact
or absence of contact after the treatment has been completed.

#### **Types of intervention** {.h4}

The following are the main classes of interventions that have been found
to consistently obtain encoded validation:

1[]{.pad}Appropriate silences in the absence of interpretable material.

2[]{.pad}Managing the setting, rules, frames and boundaries of the
treatment situation towards their securement.

3[]{.pad}Verbal comments:

[]{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_137}(a)[]{.pad}the playback of
selected derivatives -- that is, encoded themes -- organized around an
encoded representation of an active triggering event -- usually in the
form of a prior intervention by the therapist;

(b)[]{.pad}trigger-decoded interpretations and, more rarely,
reconstructions;

(c)[]{.pad}interventions like questions and confrontations solely
designed to increase the extent to which a patient communicates encoded
narrative imagery.

4[]{.pad}Behaving in a manner that respects the patient's human and
therapeutic rights, physical and interpersonal boundaries, and needs for
a secured set of ground rules of treatment.

In contrast to these unconsciously validated efforts, there are many
classes of interventions made by therapists that consistently fail to
obtain encoded validation; they include:

1[]{.pad}Managements of the setting and ground rules of therapy that do
not comply with the patient's unconsciously sought and validated ideal,
secured framework for treatment, and

(a)[]{.pad}additional frame-deviant behaviours such as touching the
patient or filling out an insurance form, or answering the telephone
during a patient's session.

2[]{.pad}Comments that are not based on or intended to facilitate
encoded communication and trigger decoding:

(a)[]{.pad}so-called interpretations that are not based on trigger
decoding;

(b)[]{.pad}questions, clarifications confrontations, and reconstructions
that are not in the service of increasing or clarifying encoded
expressions from the patient;

(c)[]{.pad}all directives, personal opinions, self-revelations and so
on;

(d)[]{.pad}interventions that include material from sessions other than
the one at hand.

From the vantage-point of a therapist accustomed to working on the
manifest level of listening and formulating, the restrictiveness of the
list of viable interventions may seem limiting and rigid. Nevertheless,
these are clinically tested precepts and they hold true -- nature is
nature, and []{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_138}what heals is what
heals. This handful of interventions are the only efforts by therapists
that the extremely wise deep unconscious system of the
emotion-processing mind affirms and finds insightful and deeply
curative. None of the other types of interventions are afforded such
support and many are unconsciously deemed to be overly-defensive and
even harmful to the patient. Adherence to the ideal ground rules of
therapy and making exclusive use of other interventions that are likely
to obtain encoded validation are safeguards that protect the patient
from harm -- and the therapist as well.

#### **Modes of healing** {.h4}

Sound, unconsciously validated interventions are healing in three
interrelated ways. First, through the offer of trigger-decoded
interpretations that provide the patient with profound insights into the
deep unconscious and historical basis of their emotional issues and
their influence on their resistances, behaviours, life decisions, modes
of relating and symptoms. Second, through the establishment and
maintenance, to the greatest extent feasible, of the ideal unconsciously
sought setting and ground rules of the psychotherapy -- an offer of
inherent support, emotional holding and frame-related healing. And,
third, through unconscious, positive, healing identifications with a
therapist who is capable of securing the ground rules of treatment and
making unconsciously validated interventions. With this in mind, let's
take a closer look at three types of interventions that, properly
formulated and timed, regularly obtain encoded validation.

#### **Therapists' silences** {.h4}

Therapists' extended silences -- silent listening and formulating -- are
one of a therapist's most basic interventions. They are fraught with
meanings and effects on the patient, effects whose nature depends on the
status of the patient's material *vis-à-vis* the therapist's failure to
intervene actively. On the one hand, a therapist's silence may reflect a
failure to understand a patient's material -- an erroneous use of
silence -- or, on the other, may be a response to the patient's not
having communicated material that can sponsor an intervention -- a valid
use of silence. As is the case with a therapist's active interventions,
silences are the therapist's adaptive or maladaptive responses to
patients' material and they are, in turn, adaptation-evoking triggering
events for the patient as well. Consciously, and especially
deep-unconsciously, their use and misuse influence what a patient does
and does not communicate.

[]{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_139}When properly used and
unconsciously validated, a therapist's silence implies that an active
intervention is not called for because the patient has not fulfilled the
recipe for intervening -- that is, has not represented the most
compelling trigger manifestly or in encoded form, and/or has not
generated a pool of encoded themes with power and bridging imagery that
is relevant to a trigger at issue at the moment. Indeed, a therapist
should remain silent until the patient has fulfilled this recipe -- at
which point an active intervention is called for.

In principle, whenever a therapist has been silent for an extended
period of time, he or she should study the patient's encoded, narrative
material for his or her deep unconscious perceptions of the essential
qualities of the silence. Is the silence being unconsciously validated
through positive imagery, or is it being refuted through themes of
blindness, error, missing the point, and so on? This question touches on
the need to differentiate two basic forms of silence: *appropriate
silence,* which is validated deep-unconsciously, and *inappropriate
silence,* which is not. The latter silence actually is an erroneous
intervention because the material from the patient evidently is
sufficient for an interpretive and/or frame-securing intervention by the
therapist -- and the patient's deep unconscious system knows that this
is the case, while the therapist's conscious system does not. The
emergence of negatively toned themes during a therapist's extended
silence should therefore alert him or her to the need to reassess the
patient's material in order to discover the unrecognized ingredients
that make intervening actively possible. Such a search usually begins
with a review of currently active triggers and then turns to a
reassessment of the decoded meanings of the narrative themes. If the
reevaluation indicates that there is, indeed, sufficient material for
intervening, the therapist should do so as soon as possible.

In a sense, then, a therapist's valid silence serves as a trigger that
indicates to the patient that he or she needs to generate additional
meaningful material before an intervention can be made -- ingredients
are missing from the recipe for intervening on the deep unconscious
level. It also indicates that the therapist is not going to intervene on
a superficial level with relatively weak or intellectualized material.

On the therapist's side, valid silences are effective efforts to adapt
to the incomplete material from a patient, and, in general, to the role
of and tasks inherent to being a healer. Given the general need among
therapists to be active and to offer something palpable to their
patients, sustaining appropriate periods of silence tends to be a
difficult task. Nevertheless, the patient should be granted the basic
[]{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_140}right and prerogative to
unconsciously orchestrate the course of each session by unconsciously
indicating when he or she does or does not need, or is able or unable to
tolerate, a trigger-decoded interpretation or frame-securing
intervention. Therapists should follow their patients' implicit
directives in this regard. They should also keep in mind that valid
silences are deeply effective healing interventions, and that speaking
up when silence is called for is harmful to the patient.

#### **Managing the ground rules of therapy** {.h4}

In [Chapter 6](#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_ch6), I explored in some
detail the nature and management of the setting, rules, frames and
boundaries of psychotherapy. This relatively unappreciated dimension of
treatment brings up some very crucial aspects of intervening. Indeed,
managing the ground rules and frame-related interventions take
precedence over interpretations of meaning, and they tend to be the
grounding for effective interpretive efforts -- recall the extreme
sensitivity of the deep unconscious system to frame conditions. Thus,
regardless of whether or not a ground rule can be secured or otherwise
managed, most trigger-decoded interpretations will, of necessity, centre
around the patient's deep unconscious responses to the prevailing frame
conditions of a therapy and to the prior frame-related interventions of
the therapist. For a therapist new to this approach, it is quite
surprising to discover the extent to which these issues and their
interpretation and management illuminate a patient's symptoms and
resistances, and bridge over to the emotional concerns in his or her
everyday life.

As I have been emphasizing, the management of the frame should be
directed at all times towards maintaining or securing, to the greatest
extent possible, the ideal and deep-unconsciously sought ground rules.
With the exception of the first session, in which the therapist must
unilaterally establish the most ideal conditions for treatment possible
for a particular patient, all efforts to manage the ground rules of
treatment should be carried out at the behest of the directives that are
encoded in the themes to be found in the patient's narrative material --
their appearance is assured by the evolved design of the
emotion-processing mind. In the presence of an activated ground rule
issue, the therapist should engage in two activities: first, securing
the frame at the behest of the patient's encoded imagery, and, second,
interpreting the meanings of the patient's encoded themes in light of
the therapist's prior and/or anticipated ground-rule interventions.

[]{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_141}If a patient requests a frame
modification, the initial themes are likely to convey the patient's
unconscious perceptions of the therapist if he or she were to comply. If
the therapist then agrees to modify the ground rule, additional themes
related to the deviation will be forthcoming from the patient. If, on
the other hand, the therapist intervenes to keep the frame secured, the
subsequent themes from the patient will usually reflect the patient's
sense of safety as well as his or her secured-frame existential death
anxieties. In any case, secured frames or secured-frame moments are a
necessary and vital feature of a sound, insightful and relatively
complete therapy experience. They activate the patient's secured-frame
existential death anxieties, and the patient's genetic history of death
and loss, and enable the patient to work through this constellation of
issues. In the absence of secured-frame interludes, the patient's
secured-frame issues will not materialize because there's no
secured-frame trigger to activate them. This is a reminder that
patients' material in sessions depends greatly on the interventional
triggers created by their therapists.

Therapeutic work in situations in which the basic ground rules are
compromised from the outset -- so-called *deviant-frame therapies,* as
seen in clinic settings or with the use of insurance cover for treatment
-- tends to be focused on the patient's deep unconscious perceptions of
the relevant frame modifications. It follows from this that the
therapist's interpretations, which supply insights into the patient's
deep unconscious experiences, will usually involve frame-deviant
triggering events. The material will be concerned with the patient's
trigger-evoked, predatory death anxieties because modified frames are
experienced deep-unconsciously as psychologically damaging. Deviant
frame forms of entrapment, such as being jailed illegally, will abound.
This work should, if at all possible, be supplemented with
frame-securing moments and their interpretation and working through.

Secured-frame therapies tend to be focused on the patient's
secured-frame, existential death anxieties, and on the death-related
traumas that he or she has suffered in the past. With the therapist
safely holding the patient and not causing him or her physical or
psychological damage, patients who have significantly harmed others will
also experience predator death anxieties, deep unconscious guilt and
needs for punishment. Because secured frames are safe, calming and
growth-promoting, and also evocative of existential and predator death
anxieties, they tend to be reacted to ambivalently by both patients and
their therapists. In addition, when frames have been secured and stable
for an extended period of time, the ground rules
[]{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_142}tend to recede into the
background and the patient's genetic history of traumas and
death-related incidents come to the fore. It's important to stress that
the critical therapeutic work with these issues must continue to be
conducted on the deep unconscious level and with triggers and encoded
themes -- exploring conscious feelings and issues is insufficient for a
truly insightful cure.

In sum, therapists should be ever-mindful of the state of the framework
of treatment in each session with each of their patients. They also need
to maintain an ear for frame-related issues and themes. Unexpected
frame-related themes should alert a therapist to the presence of an
unrecognized ground-rule issue and prompt a search for the missing
trigger. Managing and interpreting the meanings of ground-rule-related
events in a given psychotherapy is a substantial part of the therapeutic
process and essential to the healing that takes place on the deep
unconscious level of experience and adaptation.

#### **The playback of selected encoded themes** {.h4}

There are many clinical situations in which the patient's indicators --
his or her symptoms and resistances -- are strong, but there's no
manifest allusion to the causative triggering event. Thus, there's a
considerable therapeutic need in the patient for an intervention, but
there's no manifest representation of the trigger -- an essential
ingredient in the recipe for intervening. In some of these sessions, the
patient fails to generate a workable encoded representation of the
activating trigger -- a close derivative expression -- and intervening
is either impossible or extremely difficult. But in a majority of
sessions in which the trigger is not alluded to directly, a viable
encoded representation of the triggering intervention is communicated
and a partial intervention is possible. What's needed from the patient
for this effort is a strong and complex pool of encoded themes and a
non-specific bridge to therapy -- a passing allusion to the therapist or
the therapy. This last element serves as a way of tying the disguised
themes to the treatment situation and enables the therapist to intervene
in that vein.

If all of these elements are available in the patient's material, an
intervention called the *playback of selected encoded or derivative
themes* is made. Its purpose is to offer a partial, trigger-decoded
interpretation in the hope that the patient will then recover and allude
to the repressed trigger so that a full and complete trigger-decoded
interpretation can be made. Regardless of the outcome, these playbacks
of themes allow therapists to do effective quasi-interpretive work on
the []{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_143}encoded level. They also are
a way of therapists letting their patients' deep unconscious minds know
that they have heard and understood their messages and are aware of the
triggers with which these encoded communications are concerned.

To cite a brief example, consider the sudden appearance of pallor on a
female therapist's face, (unknown to the patient, she's had an episode
of vaginal bleeding). In the course of the session, her male patient
suddenly announces that he's thinking of terminating the treatment -- a
very strong gross behavioural resistance indicator. He makes no mention
of the pallor, but tells a story about a friend who has cancer whom he
can't bear to be with, as watching her die is so painful; she's been
bleeding a lot lately and looks terribly pale and ashen.

In this situation, the patient's thought of terminating therapy -- a
strong resistance indicator -- signals a great need for an interpretive
intervention. The material strongly suggests that the unconscious
perception of the therapist's pallor is evoking existential death
anxieties in the patient, and that this is his unconscious motive for
wanting to quit treatment. The therapist cannot bypass the patient's
defensive denial or modify the frame by pointing out in self-revealing
fashion that she herself is pale and/or reveal that she's been ill.
Thus, she cannot offer a trigger-decoded interpretation of the
unconscious source of the patient's resistance -- a direct allusion to
the trigger is needed for that type of intervention. Nevertheless,
intervening is imperative.

Under these circumstances, a playback of selected, trigger-related
encoded themes is the optimal intervention. The intervention should
begin with the bridge to therapy, allude next to the best encoded
representation of the trigger (the bridging image), then allude to the
remaining themes, organizing them around the encoded triggering event.
Thus, the therapist might have said the following to the patient:

'You've mentioned thoughts of leaving therapy \[the general bridge to
therapy\], so treatment is on your mind. And in this connection, you're
thinking about someone with pallor who looks pale and ashen \[the best
representation of the trigger\] and who is seriously ill with cancer and
bleeding \[the additional encoded themes\]. Something going on here must
be prompting the appearance of these themes, something about me, and
whatever it is, it must also be what's causing you to think about
leaving therapy \[using the themes to suggest the unconscious basis for
the indicator\].'

[]{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_144}The ideal validating response
would be the patient's sudden realization that the therapist looks pale,
which would be a direct representation of the repressed or possibly
denied trigger. In the latter case, it would require that the patient
suddenly become aware of the trigger which happens to be visible at the
moment -- once its time has passed, there would be no undoing his use of
perceptual denial. A full trigger-decoded interpretation could then be
made. Short of that, validation could take the form of further encoded
themes pertinent to the triggering event. For example, the patient might
next recall that his mother died of a stomach cancer, thereby providing
a previously unmentioned genetic link to the trigger -- one that helps
to explain the patient's need to repress or deny the observed pallor and
his wish to flee the therapy in order to not experience a repetition of
the traumatic loss of his mother.

Not infrequently, because the triggers that evoke this kind of response
in patients are extremely traumatic and anxiety-provoking, the entire
working through of the unbearable event -- the intervention -- will take
place on the encoded level. There will be no direct mention of the
trigger and not the least indication that the patient is or was aware of
the stimulus that he or she is so intensely processing on the deep
unconscious level. The failure of the patient to manifestly mention the
active trigger is a communicative resistance and, as noted, it tends to
occur when the triggering event is especially disturbing for the
patient. At such moments, the trigger may be subjected to perceptual
denial and not register consciously at all. Or it may register
consciously and be immediately subjected to repression.

In the first case, where obliteration has occurred, the trigger is lost
to potential awareness and will not be recoverable. Under these
circumstances, the therapeutic work remains on the encoded level, even
in the face of repetitive encoded representations of the trigger. In the
second case, where there's been conscious registration but immediate
repression, the trigger may eventually be rescued from repression and
emerge in the patient's awareness. The playback of selected derivative
themes is designed to facilitate this type of recovery of the repressed
experience.

In principle, then, a playback of encoded themes should begin with the
bridge to therapy. This alerts the patient to the idea that the
intervention pertains to happenings and triggers within the treatment
situation. An allusion to the best available encoded representation of
the trigger should come next. This is done by reiterating the theme --
simply repeating or playing it back to the patient -- without decoding
its underlying meanings. Finally, the remaining encoded themes are
[]{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_145}played back to the patient in a
way that organizes the themes as conveying unconsciously perceived
meanings of the unmentioned but encoded triggering event.

The intervention is offered as an encoded but compelling narrative
statement. That is, it takes shape as a stimulus -- response tale that
is told using the encoded thematic idiom -- essentially implying that
the therapist did this or that and that the patient responded
unconsciously with that or this unconscious perception. The tale is also
constructed as a story of valid perceptions, rather than as a product of
the patient's imagination or tendency to misperceive or distort. It's
critical, too, for the therapist to respect the denial-based defences of
the patient that have prompted him or her to deny or repress the
existence of the trigger. These defences operate automatically to
protect the patient from being overwhelmed by a traumatic triggering
experience. The patient alone should be the one to decide, however
unconsciously, when and if the anxiety-provoking trigger can enter his
or her awareness if it is available to do so.

As is the case for all interventions, the themes used by the therapist
in offering a playback of selected encoded themes must have been alluded
to in the session at hand. There are two reasons for this rule: first,
this material is all that the patient can deal with at the moment, and,
second, it's been found clinically that when a therapist brings past
material into an intervention, it almost always detracts from the
interventional effort and reflects a defensive or other kind of
inappropriate, countertransference-based need in the healer.

A few additional points. The intervention should, if possible, include
all of the communicated power themes and make use of other themes in the
form and on the level that they have been generated by the patient.
Playbacks should be used only when an active trigger related to the
themes has not been manifestly alluded to. If the patient has mentioned
the trigger, a full trigger-decoded interpretation is called for. In
addition, once the intervention has been made, the responsive encoded
thematic material must be assessed for validation -- or its lack. The
ideal validating response entails the patient's conscious recovery of
the missing trigger so that he or she alludes to it manifestly. If this
happens, the therapist should then make a trigger-decoded
interpretation.

Alternative kinds of encoded validation include allusions to wise and
helpful figures (interpersonal validation) and/or fresh themes that move
the patient closer to identifying the missing trigger and its more
powerful meanings (cognitive validation). In these cases, the
therapeutic work is taking place on the deep unconscious level without
conscious insight, []{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_146}but with deep
unconscious understanding. This phenomenon is not uncommon in the
presence of powerful interventional triggers and such work does have
healing qualities. Indeed, in extremely traumatic situations this kind
of encoded processing persists for as long as the trigger is being
worked over -- at times, for an entire therapy experience. This happens
largely because the trigger was denied access to the conscious system
and never registered in awareness. As noted, triggers that involve signs
of illness in the therapist or the revelation by someone else of a
death-related trauma in the life of the therapist are often dealt with
by patients in this manner.

Finally, in the absence of the conscious recovery of the missing trigger
or of encoded validation, the therapist should reassess his or her
formulation of the patient's material. This effort should be focused on
the search for another trigger that better organizes and gives clearer
meaning to the encoded themes -- a trigger that the therapist has
overlooked, one that's likely to have evoked his or her unresolved death
anxieties.

#### A clinical illustration {.h4}

The following excerpt illustrates the application of the playback
intervention:

Mrs James, a woman in her early forties, is in psychotherapy with Dr
Keller, a psychiatrist, for episodes of depression. Three years into her
therapy, the patient finds employment for the first time in many years.
In her sessions, she begins to encode themes that reflect her deep
unconscious view that Dr Keller's fee, which is 50 dollars per session,
is extremely low, self-sacrificing and seductive. When the themes also
point to the need to rectify the low fee, Dr Keller increases it to 75
dollars per session. Validating themes follow this intervention, as does
a mixture of images that portray this intervention -- modifying the
frame to secure it -- as both frame-modifying and frame-securing.

Mrs James begins the session after the fee increase with a dream in
which she's walking arm in arm with both her father and her uncle Ted.
They're going to buy a drill so her father can repair a broken railing
for the stairs that lead to the basement of their home. Associating to
the dream, Mrs James recalls that her father hated to spend money; he
still has the first nickel he earned. He'd find ways to trick his
employer into giving him a raise, things like falsifying his sales
reports. He'd kill for a dollar. Her uncle Ted was the opposite. He knew
how to handle money and was honest to a fault. He worked for the same
[]{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_147}company as her father and got
raises when he deserved them, like when he did better than his quotas.
Looking at her therapist, she then adds that Dr Keller reminds her of
her uncle.

When Mrs James begins to ruminate, Dr Keller decides to intervene. He
points out that the patient has referred to him, which seems to be her
way of connecting the themes in her dream and associations to himself
and to the therapy in some way. The images are about spending money,
getting a pay raise under false pretences, being ready to kill for a
dollar, but also getting more money because it's deserved. Mrs James
laughs and says that this must be all about Dr Keller's fee increase.
She then thinks about her father again. He did pay for her tuition for
college. He was a thief, but he could do good things with money when he
wanted to.

Breaking off the vignette at this point, we may note that the use of a
playback of encoded themes was called for here because the patient had
not alluded manifestly to the activating trigger -- the fee increase.
The therapist correctly respected the patient's denial and repressive
defences and did not introduce the missing trigger on his own. Having
obtained a strong encoded representation of the evidently repressed
trigger and a workable pool of themes that addressed the fee increase as
a frame-modifying way to secure the frame, he also correctly waited for
a non-specific bridge to the therapy before intervening. In so doing, he
made good use of the bridge to therapy and organized the themes around
the best encoded representation of the fee increase trigger -- namely,
getting a pay increase. The therapist also made sure that he alluded to
the only available power theme -- the reference to the patient's
father's readiness to kill for more money. Notice, too, that even though
he told the story of his patient's adaptation to the triggering event
using encoded themes, he did so with the idea that the themes reflected
deep unconscious perceptions rather than unconscious fantasies.

The intervention brought into play themes that encoded both the positive
and negative aspects of the fee increase -- as is the case when the
frame is modified to better secure it. The frame-deviant aspects of the
fee increase are conveyed in the story of the father finding dishonest
ways of getting money and in the violence behind his actions. No matter
how justified and necessary a fee increase may be, the basic position of
the deep unconscious system is that the agreed-upon fee should be
sustained for an entire therapy experience -- to which it adds necessary
perspectives as well. It's for this reason that frame-violating
[]{#9781403903426_17_ch10.html_page_148}themes of dishonesty appear
under these circumstances. Nevertheless, the deep unconscious system
also realizes that the low fee also has frame-modifying qualities in
that it is not the therapist's usual fee and it therefore has a
seductive aspect to it. For this reason, the fee increase is also at the
deep unconscious level seen as well-deserved and frame-securing --
aspects that are conveyed in the story of the uncle who deserved the
raises he got.

In all, the intervention evoked a validating response from the patient
in the form of a manifest reference to the unmentioned trigger. After
the therapist had intervened, there was also a validating story about
the patient's father that again speaks for the mixed picture of the fee
change -- helpful in one sense, selfish in another. Dr Keller could now
wait for fresh encoded material -- there's a need for more power themes
-- and be prepared to offer a subsequent trigger-decoded interpretation
when further encoded images would permit.

\*[]{.pad}    \*      \*

The selected playback of encoded themes is an invaluable intervention
because patients often obliterate or repress one or more important,
active triggers. Quite often, the use of this intervention enables
patients to modify their use of repression and to consciously refer to
the unmentioned trigger. Nevertheless, it bears repeating that if the
triggering event is especially disturbing and has been obliterated
perceptually, the therapeutic work may be confined to encoded
communications from the patient, and playback interventions by the
therapist will prevail without the trigger ever finding manifest
representation by the patient. While it is trying for a therapist to
maintain restraint when he or she is aware of a traumatic trigger to
which a patient is responding on the encoded level of communication,
it's absolutely essential that the therapist not violate the patient's
defences and become self-revealing. To do so is experienced as both
frame-modifying -- that is, a violation of the rule of relative
anonymity -- and as an unconscious assault on, and/or seduction of, the
patient. Such an intervention would also shift the patient's deep
unconscious focus away from the repressed or denied trigger to the
therapist's self-revelation, and this would be a most unfortunate and
harmful development. In contrast, the judicious use of playback
interventions typically has unconscious healing effects, even in the
absence of a patient's conscious recognition of the triggering event
with which they are trying to cope unconsciously. Such are the ways of
the emotion-processing mind.

### []{#9781403903426_18_ch11.html_page_149}[]{#9781403903426_18_ch11.html_ch11}11 {.label}

### Trigger-Decoded Interpretations {.h3a}

Trigger-decoded interpretations are the most comprehensive means by
which a therapist can bring into the conscious awareness of a patient
his or her contemporary, trigger-evoked, deep unconscious perceptions
and adaptations as they relate to his or her symptoms and resistances.
These interventions can also illuminate the unconscious connections
between adaptive issues within the therapy with those in the outside
life of the patient, including their links to early life experiences and
traumas. Trigger-decoded interpretations are, then, the basic means by
which the fullness of a patient's world of deep unconscious experience
and his or her emotion-related maladaptations are illuminated through
genuinely healing, deeply derived insights. And they are offered to
patients when they fulfil the *recipe for intervening*: a manifest
allusion to an active trigger, and a rich complex and powerful pool of
derivative or encoded themes replete with a clear bridging image.

Patients are, at times, capable of consciously recognizing and alluding
to an emotionally-charged trigger to which they are responding
deep-unconsciously. They may also be able to generate dreams and other
types of origination narratives, and guided associations to their
elements, and to thereby create strong pools of themes that encode their
deep unconscious reactions to a given triggering event. But, with
remarkably few exceptions, they are not able to connect the triggers to
their themes in a manner that reveals the nature of their deep
unconscious experiences of these triggers. It appears, then, that
[]{#9781403903426_18_ch11.html_page_150}patients are unable to overcome
the natural resistances to trigger-decoding built into their
emotion-processing minds. This task therefore falls to the
psychotherapist.

The job of adaptive psychotherapists is, then, to offer their patients
the trigger-decoded insights that they are unable to generate on their
own. By evolved design, patients are disinclined to engage in trigger
decoding and, when and if they do make the effort, they tend to do so
crudely, very simply, badly or erroneously. Furthermore, their
unconscious opposition to trigger decoding often quite unknowingly
motivates a variety of gross behavioural resistances against, and
conscious objections to, the trigger-decoded interpretations of their
therapists and the therapies in which they are offered. While their deep
unconscious minds and the encoded stories that they create will
consistently validate correctly formulated trigger-decoded
interpretations and frame rectifications, patients find a variety of
ways to justify their many conscious objections to these very same
efforts.

The most insidious of these objections take shape as a sudden,
uninsightful abandonment of the therapy. Because their unconscious fear
of deep unconscious meaning and secured frames is so intense, these
patients find ways to avoid a termination session in which they might
discover their deep unconscious reasons for wanting to end their
treatment. Another difficult group of patients will repeatedly voice
outright objections to the very interventions that they have
unconsciously validated, a gross behavioural resistance that is, as a
rule, motivated by severe forms of death anxiety -- most often predator
and existential in nature. Another inbuilt, natural type of resistance
to the conscious integration of validated trigger-decoded interventions
is reflected in the finding that even when a patient consciously affirms
and absorbs a trigger-decoded interpretation, their understanding
disappears very quickly from conscious thinking. The conscious mind does
not sustain most trigger-decoded insights for very long -- their
half-lives can be measured in minutes and sometimes in seconds.
Nevertheless, these validated interpretations do initiate a healing
process -- much of it operating unconsciously -- that has strong
constructive effects, including favourable adaptive and behavioural
changes.

All in all, then, the same inbuilt resistances in patients that are
directed against effective trigger decoding and adaptive forms of
psychotherapy are the very reasons why patients need the services of
adaptive psychotherapists in the first place. Paradoxes of this kind are
commonplace when it comes to the emotion-processing mind and its two
often diametrically opposed operating systems.

#### []{#9781403903426_18_ch11.html_page_151}Some basic precepts {.h4}

The decision to make a trigger-decoded interpretation is based on two
considerations: first, the intensity of the patient's indicators, and,
second, the extent to which the patient's material fulfils the recipe
for intervening. Recall that indicators -- resistances and
emotionally-founded symptoms -- are the manifest signs of therapeutic
need in a patient. Here, too, the more pressing the indicators, the more
compelling the need for the therapist to intervene. Thus, for example, a
patient who is threatening suicide or who is thinking of abruptly
quitting his or her therapy is expressing very strong indicators. Under
these circumstances, the therapist should at some point in the session
intervene as best he or she can -- optimally, with a trigger-decoded
interpretation. Serious indicators are driven by unconsciously perceived
traumatic triggers, and the interpretation of a patient's unconscious
perceptions of these triggers can provide much-needed deep insight into
the deep unconscious motives behind a pressing symptom or resistance and
resolve the problem insightfully.

To cite a brief example, a patient's suicidal feelings may be triggered
by an unnecessary, frame-violating personal self-revelation by the
therapist that is at the deep unconscious level perceived by the patient
as seductive, abusive and damaging -- and as cause for despairing
thoughts of wanting to end his or her life. The interpretation of the
patient's deep unconscious perceptions of the trigger and a pledge by
the therapist to not violate the frame in the future is clearly the most
salutary way of dealing with such a threat.

On the other hand, when the level of indicators is low, as seen when
there are no notable resistances or acute symptoms, the need for
intervention is small and the therapist should intervene only if the
recipe for intervening has been fulfilled. This recipe, as spelled out
for a trigger-decoded interpretation, begins by requiring a *manifestly
represented triggering event.* That is, the patient must allude
directly, even if in passing, to an active trigger, which is most likely
to be a recent intervention by the therapist. For example, a patient
notices that the therapist is wearing a bandage, and then drops the
subject, or he mentions that the present session is a make-up session
and goes on to talk about other matters. These are manifest allusions to
active, frame-related triggers.

The second requisite for the recipe is a *rich pool of encoded themes.*
Ideally, this includes a *bridging theme* that connects the storied
images to the triggering event. Because frame-related triggers are the
rule, bridging themes tend to involve *framework and ground rule
images,* so it's []{#9781403903426_18_ch11.html_page_152}important for
the therapist to be on the alert for thematic elements of this kind in
the narrative material; they serve as markers for the trigger at hand.
Also needed is a rich variety of other themes, including *power themes*
-- allusions to death, illness, injury, harm, violence and so on. As a
rule, sexual themes lack power and usually function as a way of denying
harm and death, although they may allude unconsciously to a frame
violation, as seen in stories of infidelity.

Technically, in offering a trigger-decoded interpretation, it's
generally best to mention the trigger first. After all, the trigger is
the event that has activated the operations of the deep unconscious
system and it therefore organizes and gives meaning to the encoded
thematic material -- and its decoded interpretation. The reference to
the trigger prepares the patient for the remainder of the therapist's
intervention. It also enables the patient to readily appreciate the
connection between the trigger and the themes -- and thereby to
understand his or her unconscious perceptions of the triggering event
and its meanings.

After identifying the trigger, the themes are *organized into a
narrative tale* that recounts the patient's unconscious perceptions of
the triggering intervention and how he or she has unconsciously
processed its implications. Thus, all trigger-decoded interpretations
are delivered as stories of a patient's deep unconscious experience of,
and adaptations to, a triggering event. Next, the insights that have
been generated are used to explain the deep unconscious sources of the
patient's indicators -- his or her resistances and/or symptoms. The
connection is made on the basis of the understanding that indicators are
interactional products -- an aspect of the patient's adaptive or
maladaptive responses to their therapist's interventions. In addition,
if present in the material, connection to events in the patient's
outside life, recent and past, are also identified.

The model of an ideal trigger-decoded interpretation, which is always
based on material from the immediate session, goes like this:

'I \[the therapist\] said or did such and such \[the trigger aluded to
by the patient\], which you \[the patient\] unconsciously perceived in
this and that manner \[the patient's selected, but valid unconscious
perceptions\], and as a result, you responded by doing or feeling that
and this \[the patient's indicator response\], all of which is connected
to this or that past experience in your life.'

The stress is on the specific unconscious perceptions automatically
selected by the patient for representation and response -- images that
[]{#9781403903426_18_ch11.html_page_153}are chosen by the patient from
the universal and personal meanings and implications of the triggering
event for him or her.

#### A clinical example {.h4}

The following material will serve to illustrate the use of
trigger-decoded interpretations:

Mr Forrest, a man in his early thirties, is in private psychotherapy for
potency problems with Mr Parks, a social worker. About three months into
the therapy, the therapist decides to place a framed picture of himself
and his wife on his desk where it's visible to his patients. Mr Forrest
begins the following session by ruminating and complaining about his
continued difficulties sustaining his erections during attempts at
intercourse with his wife. He looks at the picture of Mr Parks and his
wife and says that his wife is almost as attractive as Mr Parks' wife,
so there's no reason he should be having problems sustaining an
erection.

His thoughts then turns to his friend, Sammy, who's sexually
uninhibited. He's outrageous. He'll be talking to a woman at work and
expose his penis to her. The other night, he did a really weird thing:
he called the patient on the telephone and told him that he had the cure
for his potency problem. He was in bed with his wife and invited the
patient to come over and join them. Invitations like that are out of
line, crazy. Sammy doesn't know a thing about decency and privacy. He
needs to clean up his act. If he doesn't do it, Mr Forrest will stop
being his friend.

At this point, Mr Parks intervenes. He points out that Mr Forrest has
alluded to the picture of himself and his wife on his desk. He (the
patient) then went on to talk about his friend, Sammy, who exposes
himself sexually to others and who had invited the patient to join him
and his wife in bed. He was a man without a sense of decency or privacy.
These themes must reflect Mr Forrest's unconscious view of Mr Parks in
light of his placing the picture on his desk. He (the patient) evidently
sees this as a way of his (the therapist) exposing himself sexually to
Mr Forrest and as a sexual invitation to join him and his wife in bed.
Sammy is being used to convey his (the patient's) view of him (the
therapist) as someone who doesn't know a thing about privacy and proper
boundaries. And his remark that Sammy needs to clean up his act is also
addressed to him (the therapist), as is the threat to stop seeing him if
he doesn't do it. His (the patient's) point is well-taken. Mr Parks then
takes the picture and places it in his desk drawer.

[]{#9781403903426_18_ch11.html_page_154}Mr Forrest pauses and then says
that for some reason he's thinking about another friend of his who is
also named Sam. Only this Sam has a good head on his shoulders and knows
where to draw the line -- he's a stickler about privacy and won't even
watch porno movies when the guys get hold of some. People like that are
rare these days.

At this juncture in the session, Mr Forrest suddenly recalls an incident
he hadn't thought of in years. Once, when he was a late teenager, he'd
gotten involved in some sex play with his early adolescent sister. At
the very moment that they were exposing their bodies to each other in
his bedroom, their father came into the room. His father lost control
and started beating Mr Forrest and didn't stop until the patient passed
out. After the incident, he discovered that for the first time in his
life he couldn't get an erection no matter how he tried to arouse
himself.

To comment: Mr Parks' picture of himself and his wife on his desk is
personally self-revealing and violates the ground rule relating to his
relative anonymity; it also brings a third party into the therapy
situation, thereby violating the ground rule related to total privacy. A
therapist with a weak adaptive orientation might well hear this material
as a reflection of the patient's inner fantasies about his therapist,
his memories of his sister (which are manifest and conscious), and his
intrapsychic sexual conflicts. If such a therapist accepted sexual frame
violations as non-pathological and as part of life (a view that would
not be shared by his or her own or his patient's deep unconscious system
of morality and ethics), he or she might even see Mr Forrest's
reluctance to join his friend Sammy in a menage-à-trois as a sign that
the patient was sexually inhibited -- a view that also could be used to
explain his impotency. These possibilities reflect the arbitrary
qualities of weak adaptive approaches to psychotherapy.

Focusing on the mental state of the patient detracts from looking at the
therapist and his need to violate the framework of this treatment
situation. This is the prime mover of the patient's deep unconscious
experience of the therapist at the moment -- and his narrative material.
Formulations of this material should begin, then, with this frame
violation and with the realization that it undoubtedly is
countertransference-based. The self-revelation speaks for active
intrapsychic and interpersonal sexual conflicts in the therapist that in
all likelihood have been activated by one or more triggers in his
therapeutic work, his daily life and his own personal therapy. Indeed,
[]{#9781403903426_18_ch11.html_page_155}his therapist had placed a
picture of his wife and children on his desk a week earlier -- a not
uncommon source of frame breaks among psychotherapists.

The therapist's need to expose himself and his wife, and to bring her
into his office, is a traumatic triggering event of great power. The
inappropriate exhibitionistic and perverse qualities of this event will
have strong effects on the emotional lives of both the patient and the
therapist, and gravely affect the therapeutic situation -- as seen in
the patient's encoded threats to quit treatment. The patient's deep
unconscious view that the picture represents the therapist's sexualized
exposure of himself, and a sexual invitation as well, are not
distortions or unconscious fantasies, they are valid unconscious
perceptions of actual, personally selected unconscious meanings of the
trigger -- themes of this type are universal responses to this kind of
trigger, and they will appear again and again in the imagery of patients
following this kind of triggering event. Deep unconscious experience is
raw, sensitive to the implicit, unconsciously mediated instinctual-drive
meanings of frame-deviant behaviours, and focused on powerful issues --
that is, on the kinds of meanings and experiences that empower emotional
life.

Technically, there was a passing but direct allusion to the
frame-deviant trigger and it served as its manifest representation -- a
key ingredient for the recipe for intervening. The interpretation
offered by Mr Parks correctly took the themes and organized them as a
narrative story of the patient's valid unconscious perceptions of the
actual implications of this triggering event. It began, as it should,
with a reference to the trigger, alluded next to the main power themes,
and then transposed these themes into the therapy situation as
unconscious perceptions of the meanings of the triggering event. In
substance, the essence of the interpretation followed the model:

'I \[the therapist\] broke the frame -- you \[the patient\]
unconsciously perceived that I did so -- and you \[the patient\]
experienced the frame break as a sexual exposure and invitation to join
me \[the therapist\] and my wife in bed. You see this as my \[the
therapist\] not knowing how to maintain privacy and it prompts you to
think of stopping therapy \[the indicator and its unconscious basis\].'

Mr Parks also rectified the frame break at the behest of the patient's
encoded directive to clean up his act, doing so by putting the picture
into his drawer. He correctly adhered to the principle
[]{#9781403903426_18_ch11.html_page_156}that interpretations must be
supported by available frame rectifications and that the guidelines to
rectification are to be taken from the patient's encoded narratives.

The patient unconsciously validated Mr Park's trigger-decoded
interpretation and frame-securing effort both interpersonally and
cognitively. Interpersonal validation came forth in the allusion to the
wise Sam who knows how to draw proper boundaries. The cognitive
validation was conveyed in the recovery of a previously repressed memory
that touches on the theme of inappropriate exposure and illuminates the
onset of the patient's main symptom. The symptom-promoting unconscious
equation between Mr Forrest's sister and his wife had not come up
previously in the therapy and was a revelation of great importance in
helping the patient to insightfully understand and resolve his potency
problem.

This interlude also serves as a reminder that effective therapeutic work
can unfold in response to therapists' errors in technique and frame
violations. But this can happen only if the errant trigger is identified
and properly interpreted -- and the frame is rectified if that too is at
issue.

Summing up, a trigger-decoded interpretation can and should be made
whenever there's a manifest representation of an active trigger and a
rich and strong pool of encoded themes. If a frame modification is
involved, the interpretation should be supported by frame-securing
efforts when feasible. Such interventions uniformly obtain deep
unconscious, encoded validation, and they shed light on the deep
unconscious sources of a patient's maladaptations. They are a vital part
of the insight-oriented healing process and bring a measure of emotional
health to the patient -- and, secondarily, to the effective therapist as
well.

[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html}

### []{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_157}[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_ch12}12 {.label}

### The Validating Process {.h3a}

The strong adaptive approach endorses as salutary and healing only those
interventions that obtain encoded unconscious validation. While
conscious minds vary greatly in respect to the interventions that they
accept or confirm directly and manifestly, the deep unconscious mind
shows an enormous degree of consistency in this regard. This, too, is
evidence for the diversity of conscious-system operations and the
universal attributes of deep unconscious processing. Thus, narrative
responses to the great variety of consciously fashioned interventions of
therapists tend to uniformly encode validating imagery for
trigger-decoded efforts, be they interpretive or frame-securing, and
non-validating imagery for almost everything else that a therapist says
or does that is not in the service of securing the frame or promoting
narrative expression.

As described in the previous chapters, the lexicon of unconsciously
validated interventions includes appropriate silences in the absence of
interpretable material, properly formulated trigger-decoded
interpretations, playbacks of encoded derivative themes, management of
the ground rules towards their securement, questions and confrontations
solely designed to enhance the patient's communication of a rich pool of
narrative themes, and on very rare occasions reconstructions from the
encoded imagery that pertain to the early life traumas of relevance to
the patient's symptoms and resistances. In addition, as noted, all
validated interventions draw their material from the session at hand.

All other types of intervention fail to obtain encoded confirmation
because they do not properly deal with the patient's empowered deep
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_158}unconscious experiences. This
includes departures from the ideal frame of treatment and a wide variety
of weak adaptive interventions, most of which are in common use today.
These manifest content-oriented interventions are compromised efforts
that serve in part to avoid working with deep-unconsciously experienced
triggers and their meanings. They tend to be laced with denial and other
defensive qualities, and are often harmful to the patient. The relief
that they may bring is not based on genuine deep insight, but mainly on
the punitive aspects of these efforts and the means by which these
interventions help patients to avoid secured frames and their evoked
existential death anxieties.

#### The validating process {.h4}

The basic principle of the validating process is that the material from
a patient that comes after an intervention of any kind made by a
therapist should be explored for confirmation of the intervention -- or
its lack. This effort begins on the manifest-content level by listening
for conscious responses, albeit keeping mind that these reactions are
not, as a rule, a reliable guide to an intervention's accuracy or
helpfulness. The far more certain means of validation pertain to
affirmations from the deep unconscious system and are determined by
attending to the patient's narrative responses which encode and convey
the patient's *valid deep unconscious commentaries on, and adaptive
responses to, the therapist's efforts.* This imagery is studied in two
ways: first, for themes that are positive and affirming, or negative and
disconfirming; and, second, for fresh encoded meanings that further
illuminate and extend the unconscious insights conveyed in the
intervention just offered.

There is perhaps no more important time in a therapy session than the
minutes following an intervention. Whatever else is being communicated,
the therapist must evaluate the material from the patient in order to
determine the validity and other effects of his or her immediately
preceding therapeutic effort. And, in doing so, it's critical to
maintain a humble and open ear for non-validating responses --
refutation is every bit as important as confirmation.

Technically, after intervening the therapist should allow the patient
ample time to respond. It's generally inadvisable to elaborate on an
intervention that seems to consciously puzzle or confuse the patient.
Instead, judicious silence and waiting is called for, but if the patient
becomes hesitant or falls silent, the best intervention appears to be
advising the patient to continue to say whatever is coming to mind.
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_159}In most instances, even when
patients ruminate for a while -- a likely sign of pending non-validation
-- some type of anecdote or dream will eventually emerge. Most of these
narratives will materialize spontaneously in the patient's mind, as if
they came from 'nowhere'. This and all subsequent stories must be taken
as encoded deep unconscious assessments of the therapist's most recent
effort.

#### Conscious validation {.h4}

In using the strong adaptive approach, patients' *manifest and direct
reactions to interventions* are attended to, taken with a grain of salt,
understood for what they say about an intervention, but are not
considered to be the ultimate basis for determining the accuracy and
validity of an intervention. In adaptive forms of therapy, patients
generally do not make direct comments about an intervention after it is
made. If they do so, the therapist listens and learns, but nevertheless
waits for narrative responses before deciding how the patient has truly
and deeply received the therapeutic effort.

Conscious acceptance of an intervention is reassuring, but is of little
if any value unless followed by encoded confirmation as well. Conscious
affirmation speaks for a cooperative attitude in the patient, but says
nothing about the deep unconscious basis and motives for this
cooperation. Caution is necessary in evaluating this kind of affirmation
because it is often based on conscious-system denial and needs for
punishment -- in essence, an unconscious need to support erroneous and
harmful therapeutic work. The nature of the themes in subsequent
narrative communications, when and if they appear, facilitate the
differentiation between a genuine conscious affirmation of an
intervention -- as seen with positively toned narratives -- and
conscious affirmation that serves the defensive and punishment needs of
the patient -- in which case the narrative themes will be negatively
toned and disconfirming. Because weak adaptive forms of psychotherapy do
not address these distinctions and tend to accept conscious responses at
face value, they are inherently arbitrary; conscious responses to
interventions may be valid or quite invalid and deceptive, and there's
no way of telling which are which in that type of therapy.

The manifest rejection of an intervention tends to be supported by the
subsequent absence of encoded validation; negatively-toned surface
reactions tend to speak for therapist error. In addition,
intellectualized ruminations following an intervention and the absence
of narrative expressions are considered to be non-validating responses.
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_160}They often arise when the
therapist has made an intellectualized comment of his or her own. All in
all, in attending to conscious reactions to interventions, it's well to
keep in mind the fundamental commitment of the conscious system to
defence and denial, and the strong influence on conscious-system
responses exerted by deep unconscious guilt and needs for punishment.
These needs often unconsciously prompt a patient to accept or support a
deeply harmful intervention -- as measured by deep unconscious standards
and subsequent encoded themes. Overall, then, the conscious system is by
no means the kind of system on which to rely as a guide as to how to
intervene in the future, or as a judge of the qualities and effects of
an intervention already made.

#### Encoded validation {.h4}

Once a therapist has intervened verbally or behaviourally, including
periods of silence, he or she is obliged to listen to the subsequent
narrative material and themes from the patient as an incisive deep
unconscious commentary on the qualities of the intervention. Deep
unconscious responses to intervention are, as a rule, non-defensive,
highly perceptive and quite dependable -- they reflect a wisdom that
stands far beyond anything the conscious mind can muster. This means
that it's incumbent on the therapist to determine if there's a narrative
response, and, if so, to then carefully assess its nature and meanings.

Given therapists' natural tendencies to seek affirmation of their
efforts, it is as well to carry out the search for encoded validation or
its lack with not only an open mind, but with a sensitivity for
non-validating responses. Non-confirmation is a narcissistic blow. But
in a field in which it's all too easy to fossilize one's thinking, aside
from sound personal therapy, non-validation is perhaps the single best
means through which a therapist can make fresh discoveries and engage in
a learning process that enhances his or her emotional growth and mental
health. Recognizing encoded, non-validating responses is also a vital
means of identifying and correcting harmful interventions so as to
prevent their repetition. They're also an invaluable way of keeping a
therapy experience on an even keel and moving it ever forward on the
basis of unconsciously confirmed, deeply insightful, healing
interventions.

In evaluating the implications of encoded themes, we must reject the
thesis that the emergence of fresh or previously repressed material is,
*per se,* a form of validation. The themes in the material must be
examined for their encoded commentary, which may be affirming or
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_161}disconfirming. Beginning with
Freud, therapists who work within weak adaptive frameworks have
suggested that the very emergence of previously unreported incidents and
memories speak for the accuracy and helpfulness of an intervention. But
adaptive clinical studies have shown that this is not at all the case.
Many newly-recovered memories with powerful themes come to the minds of
patients following seriously harmful and erroneous interventions --
these narratives are replete with non-validating, negative imagery. The
true nature and functions of these images can be appreciated only in an
adaptive context and by recognizing that, in these instances, the themes
convey valid perceptions of the hurtful qualities of the therapist's
efforts. It is equally true, of course, that if the recovered memory is
positively cast, it can then be taken as an encoded, deep unconscious
validating response to the intervention at issue.

#### Validating themes {.h4}

There are two forms of deep unconscious, encoded validation. The first
is called *interpersonal validation* because it reflects a positive view
of the therapist in light of the offer of a sound intervention. It's
conveyed through stories with themes about people who are insightful or
wise, rewarding or offering gifts, supportive or caring, or helpful in
any number of other ways. It may also emerge as an allusion to rewarding
events, accomplishments, moments of satisfaction and gratification, and
other positively-toned images. This is seen, for example, when following
a trigger-decoded interpretation a patient recalls the smartest person
in their high-school class -- or his or her best teacher, a wise
religious leader, a competent physician, or even something that they did
well themselves.

The second type of encoded affirmation is called *cognitive validation*
because it reflects the operations of the deep unconscious wisdom system
as it endeavours to add new insights to those just provided by the
therapist. It's conveyed through encoded stories that reveal fresh
aspects of the patient's resistances and symptoms -- historical,
contemporary, psychodynamic and so on. The encoded material is truly
fresh and provides unforeseen insights for both the patient and
therapist.

We saw an example of this kind of validation in the vignette offered in
[Chapter 8](#9781403903426_15_pt2.html_ch8). It arose after Dr Wren had
kept the frame of Mr Arp's therapy secured by using the patient's
material as a basis for not changing the day and time of the following
session. The patient suddenly realized that he was asking to change a
session that fell on []{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_162}the
anniversary of his brother's death. This new cognitive material was
crucial to understanding the patient's current deep unconscious issues
and the deep unconscious motives for his wish for a frame change.
Cognitive validation through the recovery of an important genetic
experience also emerged in the vignette presented in [Chapter
11](#9781403903426_18_ch11.html_ch11), when Mr Forrest responded to his
therapist's frame rectification -- Mr Parks putting the picture of
himself and his wife in his drawer -- by recalling an impotency-causing
incident of discovered sexual play with his sister during his teenage
years.

#### Non-validating themes {.h4}

Themes that reject the validity of an intervention tend to be negatively
toned. *Interpersonal non-validation* is conveyed in three ways: first,
through the absence of narrative material; second, by default through
the absence of positively-toned, validating imagery; and, third, through
negatively-toned themes such as people who are blind, deaf, insensitive,
unwise, defensive, wrong about something, off the mark, unhelpful, and
so on. *Cognitive non-validation* is conveyed through the absence of
freshly illuminating encoded material. Patients' non-validating
responses call for the reformulation of known triggers and existing
imagery and guidance from the patient's subsequent narrative material.
The best way to begin this corrective effort is by engaging in a search
for an interventional trigger that has been overlooked. Efforts at both
direct recall and the use of the patient's narrative themes for clues to
the missing trigger are called for, and a reassessment of the encoded
meaning of the thematic material should follow.

#### Follow-up efforts {.h4}

Technically, when a patient responds to an active intervention with
encoded validating themes, the therapist should simply continue to
listen. He or she may then make one or both of two further
interventions. The first is an attempt to underscore the patient's
validating response so he or she is fully aware that they have indeed
confirmed and supported the previous intervention. To do this, the
therapist will usually review the patient's responsive themes, showing
how they affirm the prior intervention. This should be done tactfully
and entirely for the patient's benefit. An important use of this
intervention is seen with a validated frame-securing intervention where
it's essential to help the patient appreciate his or her own deep
unconscious needs and wishes for this type of framework for their
therapy -- and their lives.

[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_163}The second supplementary
intervention involves interpreting any fresh encoded material that the
patient communicates after the initial intervention. Encoded cognitive
validation always offers new insights that need to be identified and
imparted to the patient through further trigger-decoded interpretations.
After they are offered, it is especially important for the therapist to
listen to the patient's subsequent material for indications of the
validation of the new interpretation -- or its lack.

Matters are quite different when a patient has responded to an active
intervention with non-validating imagery. In these situations, the
therapist's main responsibility is to reformulate the material and his
or her thinking. There are two types of issues here. The first arises
with non-validated extended silences, as seen with negative themes such
as people who are in a fog, asleep, not listening, missing the point,
and so forth. These images indicate that an active intervention --
interpretive or frame-securing -- has been missed. The therapist's
search is therefore directed towards finding the evocative trigger that
he or she has overlooked, and finding the bridging and power themes that
connect to it. Once these elements have been identified, a
trigger-decoded interpretation and/or frame-securing intervention can be
made.

It is quite uncanny to see how often the deep unconscious mind of a
patient is incisively aware of a missed intervention. As I've been
saying, deep unconscious intelligence is a resource to be envied and
respected by the less-intelligent conscious mind. The deep unconscious
system is a superb guide to when and how to intervene -- an inner
supervisor, if you will. Remember, too, that each session is its own
creation as orchestrated by the patient's deep unconscious system, and
that interventions must be based on the material available in the
session at hand.

The second type of situation arises with non-validated verbal
interventions and frame-management efforts. If the invalidated
intervention was a verbal comment or frame-related decision by the
therapist, it's again incumbent on the therapist to reformulate the
material. If the refuted intervention was frame-violating, there's a
need to both rectify the frame break if at all possible, and to
interpret the patient's deep unconscious perceptions of the therapist in
light of the frame modification. If these efforts prove to be feasible,
they become fresh triggers that need to be subjected to the patient's
subsequent deep unconscious assessments. On the other hand, if the
intervention was frame-securing, non-validating themes suggest either
the presence of []{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_164}a frame
violation regarding a ground rule other than the one that has been
secured, or that the therapist has actually not secured the frame as he
or she thought -- the patient's deep unconscious mind is a lot wiser
than the therapist's conscious mind in this regard.

With invalidated verbal interventions that have not been based on
trigger decoding, there should be an attempt to reformulate the material
using the adaptive approach so that a sound trigger-decoded formulation
and intervention can then be made. Along different lines, with rejected
interventions that were based on trigger decoding, the effort to
reformulate the patient's material should begin, as I said, with a
reconsideration of the trigger that was used to organize the thematic
material and to render its decoded meanings. The most common error in
this regard lies with the therapist's selection of the wrong trigger
with which to organize the decoded meanings of the available themes. In
most instances, a less-important trigger has been used for the
interpretation, while a more powerful and often more harmful triggering
intervention has been overlooked. If such a trigger is discovered and
seems to give cogent, integrated meaning to the encoded themes, the
therapist should offer a fresh interpretation or frame rectification. He
or she should do so using the newly recognized trigger to decode and
organize the meanings of the thematic material, or to direct his or her
frame-securing activities. Once this intervention has been made, it's
necessary, of course, to listen to the patient's further material for
validation or its lack -- and to proceed accordingly.

#### Validating planned interventions {.h4}

The validating process is the basic means by which therapists can, to
the greatest extent humanly possible, ensure the accuracy and
helpfulness of their efforts. It's a continuous process that should be
invoked not only after an offered intervention, but also during an
ongoing session as a therapist develops *silent hypotheses* about, and
formulations of, the unfolding material before imparting them to the
patient. As a rule, these silent formulations are made in the form of a
narrative, trigger-decoded interpretation, frame-securing effort, or
playback of themes -- they are privately considered practice runs.

The key to this effort involves the *silent validation* of a tentative
intervention -- an initial test of the correctness of planned comment.
Thus, once a formulation has been settled on, the therapist attends to
the subsequent material from the patient to observe if the intervention
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_165}that he or she is thinking of
offering is being validated by the patient's fresh imagery and themes.
When the new encoded material supports and extends the proposed
intervention, the therapist is well-advised to intervene. In contrast,
when the fresh material seems to be discordant with the potential
intervention, it's wise to reformulate. Here, too, the effort begins
with the search for a new trigger with which to organize and understand
the material to that point in the session. The outcome is likely to be
the development of a fresh proposed intervention, which can then be put
to its own test of silent validation.

#### An illustrative vignette {.h4}

Ms Wohl, an advertising executive, is in once weekly psychotherapy with
Dr Bart, a psychologist, because she's been having problems relating to
her clients and men friends -- she blushes easily and feels terribly
self-conscious and embarrassed when she does. About eight months into
the therapy, she begins her session with a dream in which she's walking
along a dark street, exposing her breasts to several men who are walking
past her. The dark street brings to mind a movie she saw the previous
weekend in which prostitutes were walking up and down a dark street
trying to solicit customers. One of the women was married and when her
husband found out what she was doing, he felt betrayed, flew into a rage
and murdered her.

When she was a child, Ms Wohl's father would parade around their house
naked and she'd feel embarrassed for him. She has a memory of her mother
yelling at her father that he shouldn't be exposing his body to his
daughter like that. The patient speculates that her father's exposing
himself like that must have something to do with her shyness with men
and her blushing.

Dr Bart responds by pointing out that her dream supports this idea. She
seems to have unconsciously thought of her exposed father as a male
prostitute. She also seems to have identified with him and to feel like
a prostitute herself when she's with men and her clients -- which is why
she blushes and feels embarrassed around them.

Ms Wohl pauses and then says that all of that makes sense, even though
it's kind of dumb of her to identify with her father because he really
is a very stupid man. He'd do something wrong and then deny he'd done
it, and when that didn't work, he'd blame someone else for what he'd
done. Like once, when Ms Wohl was about 10 years old, he was driving his
car and was pulled over in town for speeding. He got into an argument
with the police officer, denied that he'd been
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_166}speeding even though he'd been
clocked by radar, and made such a fuss that he was briefly jailed. The
incident was reported in the local newspaper and was a great
embarrassment to her entire family. Her father blamed the officer for
the ruckus, not himself. Ms Wohl couldn't look any of her friends in the
eye for months afterwards and she found it especially difficult to look
at or talk to her father after what he'd done. With that she falls
silent.

Dr Bart interprets that Ms Wohl, who's in face-to-face therapy, has now
stopped talking to, and is looking away from, him. In the transference,
then, she seems to reacting to him as if he were her father and in her
confusion imagining that he (Dr Bart) is prostituting himself. This must
be similar to what happens with the eligible men she meets -- in her
mind, they must also be identified with her prostitute-father.

Ms Wohl blurts out a question: 'How can an idiot have so much effect on
a person?' With that the session comes to an end.

To comment, Dr Bart conducted psychotherapy and intervened based on a
psychoanalytically-oriented, weak adaptive model of the mind. He had,
however, as we shall see, recently begun supervision with an adaptive
therapist. Nevertheless, at the time of this session his deeply
ingrained weak adaptive approach was the basis for his interpretations.
In this regard there was a predominance of themes of exposure and
prostitution, and a clear genetic link to the patient's father. The
interpretation of the patient's identification with her father is
reasonable, but it's based on a model of the mind that accounts for
emotional maladaptations -- here, the patient's blushing -- in terms of
intrapsy-chic conflicts and inner identifications. These formulations
are also based on readings of the manifest material, their implications
and their links to the patient's early life. The interpretation does not
in any way attempt to formulate the material in terms of efforts to
adapt to an emotionally-charged triggering event. Indeed, an adaptive
therapist would be asking him or herself what intervention he or she has
made to trigger these themes.

The therapist's transference interpretation speaks for the same weak
adaptive model of the mind in which the patient's unconscious
misidentifications play a role in the development of untoward behaviours
and in misperceptions of the therapist. Here the idea is that,
unconsciously, the patient identifies both the therapist and men with
her father. As a result, they inappropriately fall victim to perceptions
and reactions that belong to the father rather than to themselves.

[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_167}It can be seen, then, that
repression, unconscious memories and fantasies, and memory-driven
distortions are the central dynamics inherent to these interventions.
The patient consciously accepts and agrees with the therapist's initial
interpretation. In weak adaptive approaches, this would be taken as
confirmation, all the more so because fresh material of some import
follows. But the negative nature of that material and it's likely
non-validating encoded meanings are not considered. Thus, the patient's
conscious agreement with her therapist's comments is contradicted by the
non-validating encoded themes that follow.

As noted, in principle the encoded stories that follow an intervention
should first and foremost be explored for indications of encoded deep
unconscious validation or refutation -- that is, assessed for positive
and negative themes. In this case, the initial interpretation is
followed by stories about the patient's father and his many faults --
his stupidity, use of denial, tendency to blame others for what he
himself did, and his doing something that embarrassed his entire family.
These are negative themes and strongly suggest that the patient's deep
unconscious perception of the therapist in light of his interpretation
was that he's all of the above -- stupid, uses a lot of denial, blames
others for his errant ways (here, the therapist is evidently blaming the
patient and her father for problems that he himself has caused --
whatever they may be), and he's a source of embarrassment for the
patient. Essentially, then, this is a clear example of a non-validating
encoded response to an interpretation that was affirmed consciously.

In the absence of deep unconscious validation, a therapist is
well-advised to reformulate. Many therapists working with weak adaptive
approaches would see no need to reassess; even if they somehow felt that
something was amiss, they may be at a loss to detect why. In contrast, a
therapist working with a strong adaptive approach would immediately
recognize that Dr Bart had made no allusion to a trigger or to
unconscious perceptions, and that trigger decoding was not involved in
making this evidently invalidated intervention. The search for a trigger
-- an intervention of the therapist's -- that has evoked this imagery
would begin in earnest.

Dr Bart, however, believed that his initial interpretation had found
support from the patient because new material had emerged, and paying no
attention to the thematic content of this new material, he pressed
forward and added a transference interpretation. The patient's terse
allusion to an idiot is well-taken as an encoded, non-validating
response. Nevertheless, without knowing the trigger for this material,
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_168}an adaptive therapist would be
at a loss to say what exactly is needed here. Weak adaptive therapists
tend to bury active triggers under a mountain of non-validated
interventions.

It is worthy of note, too, that the therapist did not interpret the most
powerful theme in this material -- the murder of the prostitute by her
husband. This avoidance of death and other power themes is common in
weak adaptive approaches, largely because they have not established a
hierarchy of emotional traumas or thematic contents. Such therapists
also do not appreciate that powerful encoded themes should alert them to
the existence of strong and emotionally important triggers constituted
as their own damaging interventions.

Also overlooked are the allusions to frame violations -- the father's
exhibiting himself to his daughter, his speeding, the prostitution and
the murder -- themes that speak for some kind of deviant ground-rule
issue and trigger. This oversight arises because therapists who use weak
adaptive paradigms are relatively insensitive to frame references and to
the critical role played by the ground rules and boundaries of
psychotherapy in the unfolding therapeutic experience. To continue the
vignette:

Dr Bart presented this material to his supervisor in his supervisory
hour. The supervisor, Dr Lester, was, as mentioned, a strong adaptive
psychotherapist. He identified the themes in the patient's dream and
associations, and pointed out that the images in the patient's
associations were more powerful than those in the dream -- a typical
clinical finding and a reminder of the importance of getting patients to
generate guided associations to their dream elements. Then, using a
Socratic-like, questioning method, he elicited from Dr Bart the main
themes in the patient's material: the power themes of exposure,
prostitution, incestuous-like nakedness, betrayal and murder, and the
frame-related themes alluded to above.

Dr Lester asked Dr Bart how these themes might connect to the therapy
and what the evocative trigger might be -- what intervention he had made
that could account for these encoded thematic threads. Dr Bart thought
for a while and said that he could see that the themes spoke to and
evidently encoded some kind of frame violation in the therapy, and that
the violation seemed to have to do with his having exposed himself
inappropriately to the patient -- but he had no idea what he had done to
deserve this picture of himself. His patient's unconscious mind (and his
own deep unconscious mind as well) knew the answer, but their conscious
minds did not. Dr Lester pointed
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_169}out that this was all the more
reason to not intervene until the trigger was unearthed and represented
in the patient's material. Dr Bart's erroneous interventions were moving
the patient away from unconsciously working over and getting to the
missing trigger and it must be the key to the patient's material and her
achieving deep insight.

Taking notice of what Dr Bart had left out, Dr Lester also pointed out
that the trigger -- Dr Bart's frame-violating intervention -- was not
only self-revealing, but also seems to have involved prostituting
himself and doing violence to the patient. Furthermore, the patient
evidently feels betrayed by what he's done and is ready to murder him
because of it. Dr Lester also indicated that these are the kind of
powerful themes that the conscious minds of therapists tend to overlook
and deny -- after all, they speak for a powerful indictment of the
therapist as an exhibitionist, prostitute, criminal and murderer. Much
to the detriment of themselves and their patients, therapists readily
defend themselves against recognizing interventional triggers that fully
justify this kind of picture of themselves.

After making several other observations, largely about the patient's
non-validating responses to Dr Bart's interpretations, Dr Lester again
asked the key question: What, then, is the trigger for this imagery? The
themes, he reiterated, are encoding a valid deep unconscious perception
of one or more of Dr Bart's interventions, and in raw uncompromised
language they are characterizing its seductive and murderous qualities.
What had Dr Bart done to deserve these encoded perceptions of himself?
What intervention has the patient perceived and processed
deep-unconsciously in this manner?

Dr Bart still could not find an answer to these critical questions. He
accepted the idea that he was dealing with a missing trigger and
realized that he must have known and repressed its nature. He also
understood that his repressing the trigger had made it impossible for
him to decode the themes in his patients material or to think in
adaptive terms as he was being taught to do. Indeed, even a playback of
these themes would require that he consciously know the nature of the
trigger so he could properly organize the thematic elements. It was a
very frustrating situation.

Dr Lester extended these realizations by suggesting that harm was being
done to the patient by some intervention that Dr Bart, unwittingly and
at present unknowingly, had made. If Dr Bart remained unable on his own
to consciously identify the missing trigger, he needed to turn to his
patient's deep unconscious system for help -- the best and most reliable
resource he has. He should listen carefully to the patient's encoded
narrative imagery in the next session and take
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_170}the themes as clues to the
missing trigger -- and to continue to do so until he discovers what it
is. In the meantime, he'd be wise to avoid intervening, especially if he
was inclined to do so without having the missing trigger in hand.

Ms Wohl begins the following session with another dream. She's watching
a television advertisement for a salve that stimulates hair growth and
she has the thought that the promoter, a middle-aged man, is lying --
that he's a fraud. The night of the dream, she'd been surfing her
television set, going from channel to channel, when she noticed an ad
for a massage parlour. They must be lying about giving massages, was her
thought, this must be a way that prostitutes solicit customers. You
can't trust ads these days. She also watched a made-for-television movie
about a salesman who kept promoting himself by lying and cheating; he
ended up being murdered by an investor from whom he stole a lot of
money. It was like a small morality tale: crime doesn't pay, be honest,
earn less, but live to see another day. She gets a lot of phoney ads and
promotions in her email -- there's also a lot of deceptive advertising
on the internet. Everyone's out to make a dollar no matter what they
have to do to get it. Dr Bart may be the only person on earth whom she
can trust.

At this point, Dr Bart, who was monitoring these themes for clues to the
missing trigger, was jarred into realizing what it must be. He was
stunned by the fact that he hadn't thought of it earlier, but about two
months prior to these sessions, he'd arranged to have a web site created
for himself. On the site, he offered articles on mental health, gave
advice on common emotional problems, and indicated that he was available
for on-line, telephone, and direct consultations and psychotherapy.
Several of his colleagues had done something similar and had gotten
referrals -- it seemed to be the way to build a practice these days. Was
it possible that Ms Wohl had seen the web site? Her encoded themes sure
as hell fitted that trigger like a hand into a glove.

To comment, assuming that he is correct in his silent hypothesis, we may
note here that Dr Bart is dealing with a self-revealing, frame-violating
trigger that has not been mentioned manifestly by the patient. Instead,
she has in this session given it a strong or close (thinly disguised)
encoded representation through the mention of the solicitous television
advertisements and of the deceptive ads to be found on the internet. The
proposed trigger also organizes the material in the present and previous
session in a very meaningful fashion. But the absence of a manifest
representation of the trigger means that according to the
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_171}rules of intervening, in
speaking up, Dr Bart should not introduce or allude to it directly -- he
should respect the denial-based defences of the patient. Alluding to the
trigger would also modify the ground rules of the therapy because it
would be personally self-revealing and therefore a violation of the
ground rule pertaining to his relative anonymity. The fact that the
therapist could be wrong about the trigger is also relevant to this
point, but it's not the primary issue.

In sum, then, in the absence of a manifestly represented trigger, Dr
Bart needs to offer a quasi-interpretive playback of these encoded
themes organized around the best encoded representation of the
hypothesized trigger. Validation, ideally, would take shape as the
patient's direct mention of the trigger -- the lifting of her veils of
denial and repression -- and were this to occur, further interpreting
would be feasible. Let us return the session:

Dr Bart prepares to intervene. He realizes that the reference to himself
is a non-specific bridge to therapy that connects the themes to the
treatment situation and that this bridge opens the door to a playback of
the themes in a way that links them to himself and something he's done.
He therefore points out that Ms Wohl has just mentioned him and in that
way has connected her earlier images to the therapy situation and
himself. And while she consciously alludes to trusting him, the themes
are about mistrust, especially when it comes to ads on television and on
the internet. There are also themes of solicitation, prostitution,
dishonesty and deception. There must, then, be a trigger -- something
he's done -- that has elicited this imagery, something that he's done
that is self-promoting, dishonest, deceptive, and in some way
exploitative of the patient as seen in the story of the salesman --
something she'd like to murder him for.

Ms Wohl laughs nervously and says that she'd completely forgotten to
mention something that happened a couple of weeks ago. Her friend Tom,
who's an avid internet surfer, had told her that he thought he'd come
upon a web site set up by her therapist. She really didn't want to check
it out, but soon found herself doing just that. It was a little
upsetting, seeing Dr Bart hustling for and soliciting new patients. But
she figured that these days therapists need to find new ways to get
patients and she'd let it go at that. Was all that stuff last week about
prostitution and her father exposing himself also about seeing the web
site?

Dr Bart says that it certainly was. The web site is being unconsciously
experienced by her as his way of exhibiting himself inappropriately,
much as her father had done in her childhood -- he was in fact
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_172}repeating in this way her
father's seductive behaviour. The site had also prompted Ms Wohl to see
him as deceptive and lying about what he had to offer her. While
claiming to be honest, the web site was a way of making him into a liar
and a cheat because it was a way of soliciting patients for what Ms Wohl
saw unconsciously as a seductive, sexual encounter -- he was
prostituting himself. In addition, she felt victimized by his behaviour
and wanted to murder him for it. She had also mentioned that criminals
like him are better off having less and surviving longer, which
indicates her view that he would be well-advised to remove the web site
and clean up his act. It was advice well worth his taking.

Ms Wohl suddenly remembered that she had also had a dream fragment last
night about a male prostitute. She had once met a man who had been a
male prostitute. What was really strange about him was that he also was
a genius designer of women's clothes. She hadn't thought about it in a
long time, but once when she was a teenager and her mother was away
visiting her own mother in another city, her father had tried to lure
her into bed with him. Maybe she has, after all, been blushing in
embarrassment for her father all these years. And no wonder she doesn't
trust men.

To comment further, let's first note that Ms Wohl's conscious comment in
this session, after she had encoded a powerful deep unconscious
indictment of her therapist, was to the effect he's about the only
person she can trust. This is, of course, a clear instance of conscious
system denial in the face of deep unconscious perceptions of the
therapist as a murderer and prostitute. Similarly, when the evocative
frame-violating trigger finally comes to her mind, she consciously
excuses Dr Bart for the very same act for which she unconsciously feels
justified in murdering him. Let the consciously flattered and
consciously excused therapist beware!

Dr Bart needed to resolve his own conscious-system defences before he
was able to offer a sound intervention to Ms Wohl. Therapists need to
stay in touch with all of their deliberate and inadvertent
frame-modifying and frame-securing interventions, including those that
are not directly conveyed to their patients in sessions, but are open to
patients' discoveries. Whatever a therapist's personal secrets may be,
as long as they might be found out by or known to others, whenever
themes begin to emerge that touch on one of these secrets, the
therapist's suspicion and silent hypothesis must be to the effect that
somehow the patient has found out about it in some manner -- on their
own or through a third party.

[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_173}The predator death anxiety and
deep unconscious guilt evoked in therapists by frame-violating and other
types of secrets are particularly troublesome. They prompt strong
degrees of conscious-system defensiveness that will, of course,
interfere with their doing sound therapeutic work. The secret motivates
the use of self-protective, errant interventions that cause therapists
additional deep unconscious guilt and intensifies their efforts to
punish themselves. It also prompts the therapist to unwittingly turn a
deaf ear when patients begin to encode their knowledge of this kind of
trigger -- typically, patients are as fearful of the conscious
acknowledgment of these triggers as are their therapists so they resort
to encoding rather than direct confrontations. All of this transpires
without either party consciously knowing what's going on. These
situations are a frequent cause of major resistances and symptoms in
patients, and counter-resistances and symptoms in therapists. The best
available resource in these situations is the patient's thematic
material which may, if the derivatives become strong and close enough to
the nature of the trigger, wake up the therapist to what is going on
beneath the surface of the therapeutic situation.

This brings up another important therapeutic principle, namely, that
deeply understanding the encoded meanings in patients' material depends
on therapists' abilities to meet patients' themes half-way. It is as if
therapists have to have their antennae set in the proper direction to
pick up and decode the encoded signals coming from their patients. Sound
listening and formulating requires both generating well-defined silent
hypotheses about the meanings of a patient's material -- without which
the therapist often misses or is severely delayed in making necessary
interventions -- and an openness to unexpected themes that call for
reformulating the hypothesis at hand -- without which a therapist will
often fail to recognize a critical trigger. Therapists must know and yet
not know and be open to learning at one and the same time.

Dr Bart's playback of derivatives or encoded themes was properly
organized around the best representation of the unmentioned trigger --
the allusion to internet solicitations. Ms Wohl responded with the ideal
validating response for such a playback -- a manifest allusion to the
missing trigger. The frame violations involved in this trigger include
modifications of the ground rule that restricts contact between patient
and therapist to the therapist's office and the appointed time of the
sessions; the implicit ground rule that asks therapists to accept only
professional or neutral referrals and to not solicit patients; and the
relative anonymity of the therapist, through
[]{#9781403903426_19_ch12.html_page_174}professional self-revelations
that range from the articles offered on the web site to the information
as to how to reach him.

Once the trigger had been manifestly alluded to by his patient, Dr Bart
correctly offered a definitive trigger-decoded interpretation of the
patient's material, using the themes that were available in the session.
He included some material from the previous hour because the patient had
mentioned it in the current session. It's critical to note that this
intervention included indications that Dr Bart would be rectifying his
frame violation. If rectification is at all possible, it must be agreed
to and added to the interpretive effort. If the frame is not rectified,
the interpretation is belied by the failure to rectify, and much of the
therapeutic effect is lost. As a result, there will either be a failure
to validate the fresh trigger-decoded interpretation no matter how
correct it may be, or a mixture of validating and non-validating
responses that reflect the patient's experience of the therapist's
confusion. The curative effects of the interpretation will also be
either diminished or entirely lost.

Dr Bart's interpretation obtained both interpersonal and
cognitive-encoded validation. The former was conveyed in the allusion to
the genius qualities of the male prostitute. The latter was conveyed in
the recall of the previously repressed dream of the male prostitute, in
the later allusion to Ms Wohl's father's attempt to seduce her, and to
some extent in the patient's conscious insight about a likely
unconscious source of her emotional difficulties. All in all, then, once
he engaged in interpreting and rectifying the frame, the patient offered
an apt deep unconscious description of Dr Bart as a genius male
prostitute. In light of the web site and his interpretation and decision
to rectify the frame, this combination of features speak to a valid view
of the therapist. In doing psychotherapy, unconsciously, therapists get
what they deserve.

The First Session

The initial contacts between patients and their therapists are among the
most compelling and influential moments in a treatment experience. The
ways in which a therapist arranges for referrals, and handles the first
telephone call and first session, are overflowing with both conscious
and unconscious meanings and consequences. These interventions tend to
set the tone for all of the therapeutic work that's to follow -- if any.
Indeed, the manner in which these opening moments are handled will not
only determine whether a patient agrees to enter treatment, but will
also speak for how the therapist will go about helping the patient to
find relief from his or her emotional difficulties.

There are many therapists who handle the initial consultation in a
manner that is different from their way of conducting ongoing sessions.
Some therapists will not charge a fee for this session, others will
offer elaborate formulations of the patient's emotional problems, and
still others adopt a personal, self-revealing (and seductive) approach
to the initial hour. There are many variations on this theme, and none
of them find support through deep unconscious validation and, therefore,
they are not to be recommended. Indeed, the emotion-processing mind and
its deep unconscious system operate with the same perceptive
capabilities, needs and preferences regardless of which session is at
hand. Thus, the principles of technique that apply to ongoing sessions
also apply to the initial hour -- be it in a clinic or private office.
Even so, as we shall see, there are several ways in which the first
session calls for exceptions to the usual rules of intervening, although
the listening and formulating processes remain unaltered.

#### []{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_176}Some basic precepts {.h4}

The basic principles that guide the handling of the initial contacts
between patients and therapists can be stated quite succinctly, even
though their elaboration and application takes some effort. The first
precept is that, with only a handful of well-defined exceptions (see
below), it's essential to adhere to the same principles of technique
that a therapist applies to all other sessions. To the greatest extent
feasible, the ideal, secured frame for therapy should be created and
sustained in the initial contact, which usually is by telephone, and it
should also be offered to the patient in the consultation session.
Therapists are also well-advised to be mindful of their interventions,
frame-related and verbal, from the very first moment of contact with a
patient. And in attending to potential patients' communications and
observing their behaviours, it's advisable to adopt a listening process
that takes into account the manifest as well as possible encoded
meanings of the communicated material -- even during the first telephone
call. As always, this should be done in light of prevailing triggers,
which find expression beginning with the nature of the referral source
and unfold from there.

While the called-for principles of technique are identical for all
settings, the issues that tend to arise in clinics as compared to
private settings for therapy tend to be both similar and different. For
this reason, I'll proceed by first establishing the precepts that apply
to all therapy situations, and then discuss the issues that seem to be
distinctive for public versus private treatment settings.

#### The initial contact {.h4}

With rare exceptions, the initial contact and arrangements for the first
consultation session should take place solely between the potential
patient and the therapist. Third parties should not be involved. On the
patient's side, short of a dire emergency or a severe infirmity, or in
dealing with children under the age of 12 or so, the therapist should
avoid making these arrangements with a family member or a referring
physician or his secretary or nurse. On the therapist's side, answering
machines are to be preferred to answering services or secretaries --
which are, in general, frame-violating third-party presences. Thus,
opportunities should be afforded to clinic therapists to make their own
appointments rather than leaving it in the hands of other clinic
personnel. If a potential patient appears unannounced at a therapist's
office, it is best to *not* make an appointment and to instruct
[]{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_177}the individual to call the
office telephone number. To do otherwise is to support the patient's
frame-violating behaviours -- intrusion into a therapist's office risks
contact with another patient and is inappropriate. In addition, it
violates the implicit ground rule that contacts between patients and
therapists take place by appointment only.

The first telephone call should be handled as professionally as possible
and be brief as is reasonable. Both self-revelations and discussions of
the potential patient's emotional problems are to be avoided. It's
necessary, however, to ask several key questions such as who made the
referral, to implicitly or explicitly assess the risk of suicide, and to
make certain that a mutually agreeable time is available for ongoing
treatment if the patient so chooses.

Referrals from professionals of all kinds -- for example other
therapists, physicians, religious leaders and so on -- are usually
uncontaminated and acceptable. Referrals from a therapist's relatives
and from other patients are contaminated -- that is, they violate the
patient's need for privacy and the relative anonymity of the therapist;
ideally, they should not be accepted. The same rule of exclusion applies
to any potential patient with whom the therapist has had or may have
outside personal contact, such as co-workers and individuals with close
ties to someone with whom the therapist is involved. In declining to see
a potential patient, it's best that the therapist simply state that he
or she is not able to see the individual in therapy without explaining
the underlying reason.

It's quite important for a therapist to be clear about the presence of
any possible suicide threat. This can usually be ascertained indirectly
from the tone and manner of the caller's request for treatment. If
there's any uncertainty in this regard, direct questioning is called
for. If there's the least sign of a threat to the life of the potential
patient, the therapist should ask for firm assurances that he or she
will not act on these impulses and will definitely come to the arranged
consultation session -- which should be scheduled at the earliest
possible time and certainly within 24 hours of the call.

As for the requisite that the therapist have a suitable time available
in which to see the potential patient on a regular basis, consultations
without a time slot for a patient's subsequent therapy are
frame-violating and very destructive. They imply either a long delay in
beginning therapy with the consulting therapist, or a referral to
another therapist which means that the consulting therapist is
abandoning the patient after what is certain to be experienced
unconsciously, if not consciously, as an exploitative contact. In
addition, short of an emergency it's best to
[]{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_178}schedule the first session at a
time that both parties will be able to commit to should the therapy go
forward -- that is, ideally the day and time of the consultation should
be used for all future sessions.

The therapist should get a telephone number from the caller in case a
personal emergency arises and there's a need to cancel the appointed
session. The caller must also, of course, be given the therapist's
office address, told how to enter the building and office waiting room,
and instructed to wait there until the therapist comes to escort him or
her into the consultation room. It is generally advisable to inform the
caller that the time for the consultation session is being set aside for
him or her and that they must assume financial responsibility for that
time. Further, it's best for a therapist to not present or discuss his
or her fee during this call. If asked about the fee, the therapist's
usual fee should be indicated without further elaboration. Questions
about a therapist's personal life, like his or her religion, should go
unanswered. Those about the therapist's professional training are best
handled with a general assurance that he or she has the proper
credentials rather than with a detailed description of their training
and experience.

All in all, it is well to be aware that every comment and intervention
made by a therapist in the course of this initial telephone call is an
interventional trigger that the patient may or may not process
consciously, but will most certainly process at the deep unconscious
level. This principle applies to the nature of the referral source and
to any outside information that the potential patient has obtained about
the therapist. The more important of these triggers are likely to be
represented and encoded by the patient in the consultation session and,
if so, will require interpretation -- as well as rectification if they
are frame-violating.

#### The therapist's goals {.h4}

The therapist usually has several goals in mind as he or she approaches
the first session. They include determining the patient's need for
therapy; making a multi-levelled diagnosis; getting a sense of the
nature of the patient's emotional problems; and deciding if there's any
call for hospitalization or psychotropic medication -- steps to be
avoided if at all possible, but to be taken when absolutely necessary.

There is also the intention to get a sense of the patient's conscious
attitudes towards treatment and the type and extent of his or her gross
behavioural resistances, if any, and to mark them for possible
[]{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_179}interpretation in this first
hour, doing so in light of an already existing trigger. For example,
patients who call to reschedule their first appointment, who delay
making the appointment because they will be away for a period of time
soon after calling to arrange a consultation, and those who are late to
the first session are exhibiting gross behavioural resistances. The
basis for their actions needs to be interpreted to them in light of
their encoded themes and the triggers, frame-securing or frame-deviant,
that are being responded to in this way. The dread in these patients of
secured frames and deep unconscious meaning are prominent motives for
this kind of early acting out. However, these motives can be superseded
by therapists engaging in frame-violating approaches to the consultation
session, in which case the deviant trigger -- that is, the therapist's
frame violation -- is to be held accountable for the patient's actions.

Therapists should also plan to indicate to the patient his or her belief
that they can be of help to the patient -- when this is the case -- and
to recommend and offer an ongoing psychotherapy experience. Along
different lines, the therapist should endeavour to determine the
patient's communicative style, mainly the extent to which he or she
tends to produce narrative material and to represent active triggers. In
addition, it's well for the therapist to monitor the patient's conscious
and deep unconscious attitudes towards the unfolding frame conditions of
the treatment. For example, the setting of the office says a lot about
the basic conditions of therapy, which are frame-secured in a fully
private office, and inherently frame-deviant in situations where the
therapist shares the office space and waiting room with other
therapists, has a home-office arrangement, or works in a clinic type of
situation. Attending to the patient's history of death-related traumas
will indicate the extent to which a given patient is likely to be
fearful of a secured or modified frame. Patients who have suffered major
death-related traumas are vulnerable to fleeing secured frames, much as
patients who have been severely traumatized by others will fear the
deviant frame. With both groups of patients, the therapist should be
prepared to anticipate their gross behavioural and communicative
resistances and interpret their deep unconscious sources as early as
possible -- material from the patient permitting.

Throughout the first session, the therapist is actually listening to two
stories being told by the patient. The first is the conscious and
manifest narrative, which usually recounts the history of the patient's
emotional difficulties and reveals their present status, and touches on
his or her prior experiences with and attitudes towards the present
[]{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_180}psychotherapy. In this regard,
it's well for therapists to be cautioned that manifest criticisms of
prior therapists are often unconsciously recruited by patients to encode
negative unconscious perceptions of the consulting therapist, as evoked
by his or her interventional errors and frame-deviant conditions. It is
also advised that therapists be wary of such communications and search
for evocative triggers when stories of that kind emerge from the
patient.

In keeping with this last point, the second story that the patient tells
is an encoded narrative of his or her deep unconscious responses to the
active, interventional triggers that the therapist has created during
the referral, first telephone call, any subsequent contact between the
patient and therapist, and during the unfolding initial session itself.
Most of these triggers pertain to the therapist's frame-management
efforts and they may have been enacted prior to the first session or
revealed during its unfolding, or even promised for the future by the
therapist. These triggers also call for intervening in the course of the
session based on the material from the patient.

In this session alone, the therapist does not wait for encoded
directives from the patient in respect to establishing the frame
conditions for the therapy; it is absolutely necessary to define all of
the ground rules of treatment in the first hour. The failure to do so is
unconsciously perceived by the patient as creating a highly deviant,
structureless and boundariless treatment situation, and some patients
will make the sound adaptive decision to not enter therapy with a
therapist who fails to offer the best possible conditions for treatment.
It is, however, equally true that for maladaptive defensive and
self-destructive reasons, many patients will enter treatment only if it
is frame-deviant from the outset.

As for listening and intervening -- interpreting and managing the frame
-- if a patient represents a triggering intervention either manifestly
or in clear encoded form and also provides a strong pool of themes, the
therapist should respond with a trigger-decoded interpretation and/or
frame-management effort. As a rule, the encoded material will deal with
existing frame-related triggers and interventions that were or were not
made during the consultation session itself. The encoded material will
also touch on the ground rules that are and are not offered by the
therapist, all of it in keeping with the patient's deep-unconsciously
sought ideal framework for treatment.

As a final goal of the therapist in the initial hour, we may note his or
her need to establish a cooperative, professional relationship with the
patient that is essentially geared towards the resolution of the
patient's emotional maladaptations. Much of this is accomplished with
[]{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_181}the way in which the therapist
conducts him or herself in the course of the session. It is also
reflected in his or her manner of intervening and in the therapeutic
skills that he or she manifests. There's a strong need to gain the
patient's trust and confidence in the therapist as a healer.

#### The initial contact in private settings {.h4}

There is, then, much to be accomplished in a first session. Achieving
these goals is facilitated by adhering to the unconsciously validated
principles of technique that have been developed throughout this book,
but there are also a number of precepts that apply specifically to the
first session. I shall take private psychotherapy as my initial model,
and propose a number of deep-unconsciously validated principles.

To begin at the beginning, in entering the waiting room to first greet
the patient, the therapist should address the patient by name and
introduce him or herself by name as well. In a shared waiting room, it's
best for the therapist to announce his or her name, and not the name of
the patient. If there's a third party with the patient, he or she should
not be addressed or acknowledged. That is, the therapist strives to
avoid participating in or sanctioning this frame-deviant, gross
behavioural resistance and, instead, marks it as an indicator -- an
expression from the patient of a strong need for a trigger-decoded
interpretation. The most likely triggers for this deviation is the
expectation of a deviant frame, as with a third-party payer, or an
already existing frame deviation by the therapist.

To continue with the waiting-room scene, an initial handshake --
arguably the only moment of physical contact between the therapist and
patient -- with the patient is optional. The therapist then allows the
patient to be the first person to enter the consultation room -- it's
more appropriate for the therapist to watch what the patient does than
the other way around. This arrangement also enables the therapist to
close and secure the door or doors to the consultation room, which is
his or her responsibility.

Once inside the consultation room, the patient may find his or her
assigned chair if it is obvious, as is the case with a chair across from
a therapist's desk. If the patient moves towards the wrong chair, the
therapist should indicate which chair the patient should use. Once
settled in, the therapist should speak first. The ideal query is: 'With
what can I be of help?' This question establishes the nature of the
relationship as therapeutic, the respective roles of the two
participants, []{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_182}and the initial
framework of their work together. With that said, the therapist should
sit back and listen. As always, this is done on the two levels of
communication, manifest and encoded.

The therapist should listen silently until one of three contingencies
arises. The first involves the patient's falling silent. If this
happens, the best intervention usually is the invocation of the
fundamental rule -- explaining to the patient that he or she should say
whatever is coming to mind. The second contingency that calls for
comment occurs when the patient fulfils the recipe for intervening. The
material in the first session may well include a manifest or encoded
allusion to an interventional trigger and several strong encoded themes.
The therapist should then offer a trigger-decoded interpretation or
playback of encoded themes depending on how the trigger has been
represented. This type of situation is most likely to arise when there's
an active frame issue that needs to be dealt with.

For example, a male patient who wants to use insurance coverage is, in
making the proposal, manifestly representing the anticipated trigger of
his therapist's compliance. He then tells a story about the harm that
was done to him after he told his boss in all confidence about a
personal crisis he was facing, one that involved a known criminal. He
later found out that the boss had leaked the story to another man in
their office, who then told it to several other co-workers. The patient
felt betrayed and that his reputation had been badly damaged by the
leakage -- the boss shouldn't have said a word about what the patient
had told him, he'll never trust him with a secret again, and he's
thinking of looking for another job with a boss he can trust to keep his
secrets.

The trigger-decoded interpretation from the therapist would go like
this:

'You've asked me to complete insurance forms to help you pay for your
therapy. But your story about your secrets and your boss's betrayal
indicates that if I complied, you'd see me betraying you and as
revealing your secrets to third parties who will do you harm. You're
story indicates that if I did that, you'd never trust me again and that
you'd want to go to another therapist whom you could trust to keep your
secrets. Your comment that your boss shouldn't have said a word to
anyone about what you told him is a clear directive to me to do much the
same -- to not complete the insurance form so you can place your trust
in me.'

This is an apt trigger-decoded interpretation and frame-securing
intervention and we'd expect it to obtain encoded validation. Whether
the patient would then heed the advice of his own deep unconscious
[]{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_183}wisdom system is another matter.
As we saw earlier in the vignette about Ms Benson's therapy with Dr Wall
([Chapter 6](#9781403903426_12_ch6.html_ch6)), this kind of frame issue
may take a fair amount of time to process and secure.

The third call for therapists to speak up occurs around the midpoint of
the session. At this juncture, it's advisable for the therapist to
indicate his or her belief that he or she can be of help to the patient,
to recommend ongoing psychotherapy, and to obtain the patient's
commitment to accept the recommendation. If this is the case, the
therapist should proceed to define the ground rules of the treatment.
This structuring would include a recommended frequency, time and length
of sessions, and a statement of the therapist's fee. This should be the
therapist's usual fee and, ideally, there should be no negotiating of
the fee or discussion of this requisite which is, of course, a mandated
amount in the case of insurance coverage. In this regard, therapists are
well-advised to adhere to the rules set by these third-party payers and
not collude with the patient in any way to bypass or alter them. It is
also best for the therapist to inform the patient that he or she will
not be receiving a bill, that they should keep track of the number of
sessions held each month, and that they should pay for the previous
month's session at the beginning of the first session of the new month.
There's no need for a bill because the patient can easily keep track of
the number of sessions held each month and the bill is sometimes kept by
patients as a transitional object. The stated fee for the consultation
should be identical to the fee for ongoing sessions and payment by
cheque or money order is preferable to cash payments, for which a
patient should be given a receipt. The patient's full financial
responsibility for all scheduled sessions also needs to be stated. In
keeping with the principle of crafting the first session as closely as
possible to the design of all future sessions, the length of the initial
session should be identical to that of future sessions.

In regard to responsibility for sessions, the therapist needs to
indicate his or her vacation policy. A rough guide calls for some three
to four weeks out of the office each year and requires that these
vacations be announced well in advance. It is also necessary to advise
the patient that sessions will not be held on major legal holidays.
Implied ground rules, such as the therapist's relative anonymity and the
absence of physical contact between the two parties to treatment do not
need to be stated, because the responsibility to enforce them generally
lies with the therapist -- they usually are demonstrated rather than
articulated.

[]{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_184}With patients who decide not to
go forward with therapy, the therapist is well-advised to ask to be paid
for the consultation session when it's nearing its end. It is, however,
inadvisable to keep time open for these patients until they make up
their minds about continuing with treatment. They should be told that
they should call if they decide to go forward, and that the therapist
will make every effort to accommodate their time needs. If they do call
and decide to proceed with treatment, the time of future sessions should
be established during that telephone call.

Another pair of ground rules that need to be spelled out are the
requisites for total privacy and total confidentiality by both parties
to the therapy. In stating these rules, it needs to be said that nothing
connected with the sessions will be recorded by the therapist and that
the patient make a similar commitment. If need be, the only information
that the therapist should record is the name, address and telephone
number of the patient.

The therapist should also introduce the *fundamental rule of free
association,* namely, that the patient should in each session say
whatever comes to mind. But there's also reason to supplement that rule
with the *basic rule of guided associations* -- advising the patient to
begin each session with a dream or story, and with narrative
associations to their elements, in order to build a strong narrative
pool of themes that facilitates psychotherapy that addresses patients'
deep unconscious experiences and their ramifications.

It bears repeating that the principles that guide a therapist through
the initial telephone call and first session are, in substance, the same
as those that apply to ongoing sessions. There's considerable temptation
in therapists conducting initial sessions to try to lure the patient
into accepting therapy though frame-violating, seductive comments and
promises. Therapists are also inclined, early-on, to be lax about
adhering to the ideal frame in other ways, and are often unusually
active, seeking facts and details rather than allowing the patient to
free-associate. Some therapists will inappropriately conduct a formal
mental assessment instead of doing it by observing the patient as he or
she speaks -- the exception being any suspicion of an organic brain
disturbance in the patient. All types of interventions that would be
precluded in the course of an ongoing therapy should meet the same fate
in the first session. This is especially the case with blatant
departures from the unconsciously sought ideal frame, which should be
avoided at all costs -- their deep unconscious effects can be
devastating for all concerned.

[]{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_185}In structuring the treatment
situation, therapists should be wary of offering unnecessary frame
modifications lest the patient accept therapy for unconscious,
maladaptive reasons. These departures from the ideal frame create the
deep unconscious expectation that additional frame modifications will be
forthcoming and frame violations will become the preferred mode of
attaining maladaptive relief from existential and other forms of death
anxiety. Under these circumstances, patients' requests for further frame
modifications abound. And even though the patient's deep unconscious
system will emit encoded messages that speak for holding the frame
secured, he or she will usually be consciously adamant about having his
or her pathological, frame-violating needs satisfied. While these frame
modifications will be accessible to repeated working through -- patients
will encode their deep unconscious experience of these errant
interventions from time to time throughout their therapies -- these
early frame modifications are very difficult to rectify and they cause
no end of trouble for both patient and therapist. Predatory and predator
death anxieties in both parties to the therapy will play a notable role
in their responses to these disruptive frame deviations because each
participant is being predatory towards the other.

In contrast, the offer of an ideal, frame-secured treatment experience
will always evoke, and will be a test of the extent of, a patient's
secured-frame death anxieties. There will be the typical ambivalent
unconscious response to ideal conditions for therapy -- a strong sense
of holding, healing and security on the one hand, and the activation of
existential and predator death anxieties on the other. The patient is
therefore likely in the first hour to generate a series of encoded
themes in light of this interventional trigger. Lest the patient's
entrapment and existential anxieties become too intense and he or she
flee treatment, the themes need to be subjected to trigger-decoded
interpretation. Encoded validation is likely to follow, but even so the
intervention cannot be expected to resolve in a single stroke the
patient's intense deep unconscious death anxieties and the emotional
events and issues to which they pertain. Indeed, such work will occupy
much of the future therapy. The main goal in the first session is to
offer the patient sufficient insight into these anxieties to enable him
or her to continue the therapy under secured-frame conditions.

#### The initial contact in clinic settings {.h4}

I shall use clinic settings as the model for all non-private settings in
which psychotherapy is conducted -- outpatient clinics, half-way
[]{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_186}houses, in-patient settings,
government-run facilities, and so on. There are a number of problems
that tend to arise in these compromised but socially necessary settings,
but there are also principles of technique that can serve as guidelines
to making these therapeutic experiences as non-damaging and insightful
as possible. The simplest and most basic precept for clinic therapies is
this: every effort should be made to create conditions and offer ground
rules that come as close as possible to the ideal therapeutic frame, and
to approximate as closely as possible the ideal conditions available in
a private therapy situation.

While some frame modifications are inevitable -- for example a
third-party presence, low fee, the therapist's recording a minimal note
for each session -- there are many frame violations, as measured by deep
unconscious standards, common to clinic settings that are frivolous and
unnecessary; they should be avoided and corrected as much as possible.
Of note in this regard is the practice of having secretaries and other
third parties make appointments with patients instead of their
therapists; giving third parties responsibility for collecting the fee;
requiring detailed notes of sessions, far more than the necessary
minimum; keeping patients' records in locations where non-professionals
have access to or can see them; using large public waiting rooms instead
of small waiting areas outside of each therapist's office; the lack of
adequate soundproofing for the therapy offices; unnecessary if not
outrageous casual discussions of patients with colleagues and other
clinic personnel -- all too often in earshot of patients and/or others;
the leakage to patients of personal information about the therapist and
other clinic workers; the improper, unauthorized release of information
about patients to third parties -- a practice that should be kept to a
minimum and require a written, informed release from the patient; and
arranging for a therapist to see in treatment two members of the same
family or two people who know each other socially.

The list of frivolous but deeply affecting frame violations in clinics
is seemingly endless and bears grim testimony to therapists' conscious
neglect of the ground rules of psychotherapy, the power of their
secured-frame anxieties and dread of secured frames, and their need for
excessively deviant conditions for treatment. Every therapist who works
in this type of setting is well-advised to review clinic policies and
the behaviour of clinic personnel for frame violations and to do as much
as possible to correct these harmful departures from the ideal, healing
frame. Nevertheless, I must offer a word of
[]{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_187}caution about such efforts
because, for most people, secured-frame existential and predator death
anxieties are far stronger and more threatening than predatory death
anxieties. This means that most of the individuals who work in a clinic
-- professionals and non-professionals -- suffer unconsciously from
significant amounts of secured-frame anxieties and have a strong
conscious preference for deviant frames. As a result, the reformer is
almost certain to meet conscious opposition and to evoke angry responses
from clinic personnel, reactions that are unconsciously driven,
unrecognized for their deep unconscious sources, and irrational. One
must proceed with great caution in trying to bring about vitally
necessary frame-securing changes in clinic policy.

As for doing psychotherapy in clinics, the basic principle is that,
given the natural focus of patients' deep unconscious systems on ground
rules issues, much of the therapeutic work will, of necessity, revolve
around the frame deviations built into the treatment situation and
experience. This work should, of course, be guided by patients'
representations of triggers and their pools of encoded themes. Clinic
therapies are deviant-frame therapies, and the trigger-decoded
interpretations and deep insights that therapists are able to offer
their patients will be based on each patient's selective deep
unconscious experience of the particular deviant conditions of
treatment. Nevertheless, it has proved possible to link these
experiences and their trigger-decoded interpretations to the patient's
symptoms and resistances, as well as to their core, death-related
traumas and conflicts. Such therapeutic work should, if at all possible,
be supplemented by *secured-frame moments,* during which the patient's
secured-frame anxieties and their history are mobilized and can be
interpreted, worked over and resolved to the greatest extent feasible
under these conditions. The opportunity for this type of therapeutic
experience generally arises when a patient requests a fresh frame
modification -- for example a change in the time of a particular
session, a reduction in the fee, a meeting between the therapist and a
third party -- and the therapist, using the patient's encoded themes as
directives, turns down the request. Properly managed and interpreted,
these interludes are quite healing for the patient -- and quite
rewarding for the therapist or counsellor as well.

The dynamic and interactional nature of clinic therapies serve to remind
us that the psychotherapy experience is by no means constituted as a
simple unfolding of the inner life of a patient. The therapeutic
experience is a mutual creation of both patient and therapist.
[]{#9781403903426_20_ch13.html_page_188}And given the conditions for
treatment that the therapist must offer in a clinic setting and the
untoward effects of frame modifications on all concerned, it's well to
appreciate that doing psychotherapy in these settings is one of the most
arduous tasks a therapist can take on. Nevertheless, done wisely, a
therapist can transform these same difficulties into insightful healing
experiences that make this work all the more rewarding.

An Unnatural Profession

I have now presented the basic theoretical edifice of the strong
adaptive approach and the principles of technique that have been forged
through its listening, formulating and validating processes. In this
final chapter, I shall cover a number of additional, relatively
neglected topics that have a bearing on the efforts by all types of
therapists to help their patients resolve their emotional maladaptations
to the greatest extent possible today.

#### Defying the design of the mind {.h4}

Doing psychotherapy under secured-frame conditions and with the goal of
interpreting the deep-unconsciously perceived meanings of triggering
events is an undertaking with a quite unusual requisite: the therapist
must behave -- listen and intervene -- in a manner that is quite
unnatural and different from his or her usual way of framing, thinking
and adapting. Thus, the adaptation-oriented psychotherapist who strives
to offer patients deep unconscious insights must go against the grain of
nature and the evolved design of the emotion-processing mind, especially
the defensive operations and deviant-frame preferences of the conscious
system. Rather than accepting the natural protection, however
emotionally costly, offered by the MAC as a way of sparing the conscious
mind from system overload and dysfunction, the strong adaptive therapist
must find ways to bring forbidden knowledge about death-related traumas
and other emotional issues -- that is, grim power themes -- dynamically
into awareness under secured-frame conditions that the conscious mind
also inherently dreads and tends to
[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_190}oppose. Indeed, recent clinical
evidence indicates that the prospect of entering the deep unconscious
realm under secured-frame conditions is experienced unconsciously by
many patients as a threat to their mental stability and integrity.
Themes of madness and psychosis, and of mental disintegration, are not
uncommon when the offer of this kind of therapy is even hinted at.

Many of the same anxieties connected with the dread of deep unconscious
meaning also arise in connection with the secured frame. As a
denial-prone adaptive entity, the conscious system prefers to embrace
therapy situations that support its defensive and obliterating needs,
which are largely related to the experience of death anxieties and
madness, especially as they pertain to the awareness of personal
mortality. It is therefore quite natural to avoid seemingly entrapping
secured frames, lest they activate unmanageable existential -- and
predator -- death anxieties. And, again, regardless of the cost in
emotional suffering, it's also natural for therapists to create modified
frames and to modify ground rules in order to create the denial-based
illusion or delusion that they are exceptions to the unconsciously
defined ideal rules of therapy -- and thus to the existential rule that
death follows life. Working under secured frame conditions and securing
such frames for patients therefore requires that therapists stand bold
and strong against their natural obliterating defences and tolerate the
existential angst that this inevitably arouses -- doing so, not in the
name of masochism or unnecessary suffering, but in the name of offering
their patients optimal, deeply insightful, secured-frame healing
experiences.

In sum, human nature stands opposed to sound adaptive forms of
psychotherapy. By evolved design, we humans fight against the very
conditions and deep understanding that are most healing for our
emotional ills. Put another way: optimal forms of psychotherapy must be
structured and carried out in ways that overcome the dysfunctional and
self-defeating aspects of the evolved design of the emotion-processing
mind which is one of the basic causes of human emotional pain.

Despite the cost, it is quite difficult for therapists to resist working
within the framework of weak adaptive approaches to psychoanalysis and
emotional life. These approaches are consonant with the ultimately
defensive design of the conscious system. In substance, then, these
manifestly-oriented efforts are ways of avoiding the most
anxiety-provoking meanings of traumatic events and their deep
unconscious impact on the human psyche. And while defences of this kind
may bring temporary relief to all concerned -- both patient and
therapist -- they do so at enormous cost. Denial of sources of anxiety
[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_191}and conflict do not make the
issues disappear; they remain in the psyche and cause a great deal of
harm, even as that very harm is being denied and overlooked. Denial
creates unnoticed maladaptations, opens an individual to repeated acts
of personal damage from denied sources of harm, and precludes insight,
growth and preparedness for future traumas. There are, then, great
rewards for therapists who are able to forgo their overuse of denial
mechanisms and work within secured frames and engage in the pursuit of
sound trigger-decoding insights. Still, it's very difficult for the
conscious mind to grasp the truth of this statement.

Adopting a strong adaptive approach is not, however, simply a matter of
conscious choice for a therapist. While every therapist should make use
of the vast array of insights that have been derived from this approach,
its clinical use may not suit everyone. In addition to the universal,
basic design features of the emotion-processing mind and its conscious
system, a therapist's personal history of death-related traumas plays a
significant role in his or her choice of therapeutic model and, more
basically, his or her tolerance for deep unconscious meaning and secured
frames. Experiences of loss through death, especially early in life, of
being predated and harmed by others, and of causing significant harm to
others, all tend to affect the operations of the emotion-processing
mind. In most cases, the experience of death-related traumatic events
intensifies the use of conscious-system denial and obliteration. It
follows from this that making use of an adaptive approach is especially
threatening for the traumatized therapist.

Paradoxically, these same traumas sometimes create deep unconscious
needs that render certain individuals strongly inclined to seek and
offer secured frames and trigger-decoded, deep unconscious insights. The
adaptive techniques are often recruited for self-processing (see below)
as well as for their therapeutic endeavours with patients -- the goal of
healing emotional wounds is present in both quests.

The direction that a given therapist chooses -- that is, towards or away
from the strong adaptive approach -- is based on many factors, some of
them yet to be determined. It is evident that death-related traumas may
evoke either an intensification of the use of denial-based obliteration,
or a compelling unconscious need to understand the death-related
concerns buried in the deep unconscious mind. What is not clear is the
nature of the other factors that influence this choice. Discovering what
they are is quite critical because, with few exceptions,
psychotherapists have to-date chosen denial, deviant frames and weak
adaptive approaches, instead of insight, secured frames and
[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_192}adaptive efforts. In my view
there is a great loss in both healing power and insight into the design
of the emotion-processing mind and the nature of emotional life in this
decision. Knowing more about what motivates it unconsciously may well
help improve the quality of psychotherapy -- and of life itself.

In this context, it is well to appreciate that given the evolved design
of the emotion-processing mind, a strong adaptive therapist -- and all
mental-health professionals regardless of their orientation -- must be
forever vigilant against naturally-driven lapses in managing the ground
rules and intervening. This is especially necessary when a therapist
suffers a personal death-related trauma to him or herself or to someone
close to them -- and when death begins to cast its shadow over the world
at large. The activation of personal death anxieties always
unconsciously presses an individual towards frame modifications and the
denial of deep unconscious meaning -- both are ways of denying the
reality of personal death and death-related harm to others, along with
their many disturbing ramifications.

In principle, then, the vicissitudes of a therapist's personal life,
especially in respect to death-related traumas -- and secondarily, in
respect to available outside satisfactions -- have a powerful influence
on how he or she manages the ground rules of therapy and intervenes. The
psychotherapy experience does not unfold in an isolated office far from
the maddening effects of everyday life. Instead, for all concerned, it
is a special segment of that life, set apart from yet inherently
embedded within the unfolding drama of the participants' very existence.
For all concerned, effects pass both to and from their outside lives and
their life within the treatment situation. Past traumas play a real but
secondary role in this regard -- the power of life lies in the immediate
moment.

#### The fate of therapists who defy human nature {.h4}

A few words need to be said about the effects of the universal dread of
secured frames and deep unconscious meaning on the professional
relationships and everyday lives of adaptive psychotherapists. In the 35
years during which the strong adaptive approach has been blossoming as a
new paradigm of psychoanalysis, it has redefined the unconscious domain;
linked psychoanalysis to biology by placing conscious and deep
unconscious adaptation at the heart of emotional life; brought a lawful
formal science to both psychotherapy and biology; identified and mapped
the adaptive module with which humans cope emotionally
[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_193}and traced its evolutionary
history; developed new forms of psychotherapy; generated a host of
unprecedented insights into both daily emotional life and the
therapeutic process; provided the field with unprecedented realizations
about the role of rules, frames and boundaries in all forms of
psychotherapy and in everyday life; identified three basic forms of
death anxiety, each with its own threat to emotional equilibrium and
each evoking a different basic response in humans; and forged new links
between psychotherapy and religion in ways that have enriched both
disciplines.

Despite these accomplishments and in the absence of a single definitive
negative critique of its methods, findings or theory, the strong
adaptive approach has been marginalized and largely rejected and ignored
by the vast majority of mental-health professionals. This is especially
true of psychotherapeutic and psychoanalytic writers who almost never
reference the large number of books and papers that have been written
from the adaptive vantage-point. In addition, on the personal level,
therapists who work in this manner often find themselves alienated from
their colleagues and peers. Why so?

The answer seems to lie in the aforementioned defiance of the natural
design and defences of the emotion-processing mind that underwrites the
theory and the work of practitioners of the adaptive approach. This most
necessary feat evidently evokes strong and unwitting anxieties in, and
hostilities from, a vast majority of mental-health professionals. The
dread of both secured frames and deep unconscious meaning, and of the
various forms of death anxiety, plays an unrecognized role in their
turning away from the adaptive approach and its advocates.

To some extent, then, accepting the precepts of the strong adaptive
approach requires that a therapist be able to both tolerate the often
overwhelming meanings and anxieties that the approach arouses in them,
and endure the hostilities and rejections of other therapists.
Enlightenment of psychotherapists may, with time, help to alleviate this
situation, but pockets of resistance are likely to persist for many
years to come. The inherent support and affirmation of the adaptive
approach that comes from patients' encoded, deep unconscious validation
of trigger-decoded interventions and the strong adaptive therapist's
personal knowledge that he or she is being truly and deeply helpful goes
a long way towards supporting such work and making the anxiety-founded
opposition to the approach tolerable although always disquieting. As is
true of so much in emotional life, satisfaction comes at a price.

#### []{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_194}The constructive aspects of therapists' lapses and errors {.h4}

Given the evolved design of the emotion-processing mind, errors in
managing the ground rules of therapy and in intervening are inevitable.
These very human lapses can, however, be turned to therapeutic advantage
as long as they are recognized either directly or with the help of
patients' non-validating, encoded responses. On this basis, they can
then be interpreted and/or rectified in keeping with the nature of the
error and the patient's responsive encoded advisories. To facilitate
this kind of therapeutic work, we may review some of the most common,
often overlooked, momentary errors made by therapists who work according
to adaptive principles. They include inadvertent and uncalled for frame
lapses, such as accidentally beginning a session late or ending it early
or late, leaving the telephone in the ring-on mode, instead of ring-off
so it doesn't ring during a session. (A therapist should not answer the
telephone during sessions -- doing so allows third parties into the
patient's session and takes the therapist away from the patient even
though the patient is paying for the time and for the therapist's
undivided attention.) There may also be lapses in relative anonymity
such as an inadvertent personal comment, agreeing to a patient's request
to modify the frame for one session, for example by changing the time of
a session, and many other similarly unguarded if temporary frame
modifications.

Another list pertains to errors in intervening, which includes missing a
critical triggering event, one that usually involves an intervention
that is anxiety-provoking for the therapist; failing to consciously
notice powerful encoded themes that are also usually especially
disturbing for the healer (current traumas tend to give therapists tin
ears for patients' themes related to the trauma); missing an opportunity
for a trigger-decoded interpretation and/or frame-securing activity;
lapses in which an adaptive therapist makes an intervention that is not
based on trigger decoding -- and so on.

The effects of, and issues raised by, these inadvertent lapses are
somewhat comparable to those that arise in instances of unanticipated
but necessary frame breaks by the therapist, as happens for example with
an unexpected illness in the therapist or a family or some other kind of
emergency. These lapses are also not unlike situations in which it is
seemingly necessary for a therapist to begin a patient's treatment under
compromised frame conditions -- as happens in clinic settings and with
patients who, out of utmost necessity, must have help from insurance
companies in order to enter and remain in treatment. In all
[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_195}of these situations, the patient
at the deep unconscious level experiences and encodes a measure of
predation, harm and predatory death anxiety -- whatever additional
perspectives they may have. These departures from the ideal frame need
to be interpreted and rectified if at all possible, using the patient's
encoded narratives as the basis for intervening. The intensity of the
effects on the patient -- on his or her symptoms and resistances -- will
depend on the nature of the frame lapse, the extent to which the
therapist could or could not have avoided the deviation, the particular
sensitivities of the patient, and the extent to which the frame
violation can be rectified.

In all of these situations, the modification in the frame has a negative
impact on both parties to therapy, much of it derived unconsciously by
the death anxieties it arouses. But at the same time there are two
potentially healing aspects to many of these frame-deviant situations.
The first is based on the finding that modified frame conditions makes
therapy available for many patients who would not otherwise be able to
enter therapy. Some of these individuals are unable to afford treatment
on their own. Other potential patients have suffered severe, early
death-related traumas -- as victims and/or perpetrators -- and are
unable to tolerate, accept or remain in a secured-frame therapy
situation. They are, however, able to engage in a frame-modified therapy
which affords them an opportunity to develop insights based on
triggerdecoded interpretations related to their modified treatment
conditions. Eventually, some of these patients are able to better cope
with their securedframe, existential death anxieties, and they either
accept a fully-secured treatment situation or allow themselves to
experience and process critical secured-frame moments.

The second advantage to be gained from frame deviations applies to all
frame-modified conditions for therapy and to all of the framedeviant
lapses and technical errors made by therapists. These triggering events
tend to activate deep unconscious experiences of patients that are
linked to traumatic memories and issues that would not find expression
during an entirely secured-frame treatment experience. This is the case
because the conflicts and unconscious issues that are factors in
patients' maladaptations remain in a latent state -- unarticulated and
unencoded -- until they are activated by a triggering event. As a
result, the frame lapses and errors of therapists, while certainly
harmful, also offer crucial opportunities for trigger-decoded
interpretations and frame-securing interventions that touch on areas of
healing that might not emerge under non-deviant frame conditions.

[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_196}The healing aspects of
frame-modified conditions depend, of course, on the therapist's ability
to process and interpret the patient's deep unconscious, encoded
responses to the activating, deviant triggering event. In addition, this
kind of therapeutic works requires that the therapist be consciously
aware of his or her own predator death anxieties and guilt over having
caused a measure of harm to his or her patient. The conscious experience
of guilt is far more adaptive than the experience of this guilt at the
deep unconscious level. Conscious guilt is based on recognizing that
harm has been done and it facilitates ameliorative actions. In contrast,
deep unconscious guilt occurs without conscious articulation or
knowledge of its existence; it exerts its self-punishing effects
unconsciously and therefore does not promote conscious understanding or
efforts to correct the damaging situation. While the minds of therapists
seem to naturally favour experiencing guilt deep-unconsciously rather
than consciously, effective coping and unencumbered therapeutic work are
best done on the basis of the painful but positively motivating
experience of conscious guilt when called for. Here, too, therapists do
well to defeat the evolved preferences of the emotion-processing mind.

#### **Personal self-processing** {.h4}

How then can therapists personally safeguard the offer of adaptive forms
of psychotherapy -- and any other treatment modality of their choice?
How can they protect themselves against excessive therapeutic errors and
discover the deep unconscious basis for their lapses in intervening and
holding the frame secured? Every erroneous intervention should be
understood to be unconsciously motivated by unresolved conflicts and
anxieties within the therapist as triggered by the patient's material.
In addition, each of these errors evokes within the therapist, however
unconsciously, a measure of predator death anxiety and deep unconscious
guilt. Because he or she cannot learn from experiences that are
processed unconsciously, it is essential to have an effective means of
both consciously recognizing these often overlooked harmful errors and
discovering their personal, deep unconscious sources. Such a process
fosters the rectification of the error, the ability to curtail its
repetition, the resolution of unmastered unconscious conflicts and death
anxieties in the therapist, and his or her insightful healing and
emotional growth.

The strong adaptive approach has discovered two especially salutary ways
of achieving these goals. The first lies with engaging in a process of
self-exploration based on adaptive principles; that is called
[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_197}*self-processing.* Elsewhere I
have spelled out in some detail the means by which a mental-health
professional -- or anyone else, for that matter -- can conduct a
self-healing form of personal psychotherapy based on the adaptive
approach (Langs, 1993). The process requires setting aside a set amount
of time -- some 30 to 50 minutes -- and a particular number of days --
somewhere between two and five -- for this activity. The minutes before
going to bed or to sleep often serve this need quite well.

The self-processing session should begin with the recall of a dream from
the previous night or with spontaneously making up a story that will be
used as a dream equivalent -- a so-called *origination narrative.* Once
this is done, the next step is to generate a series of *narrative guided
associations* to the elements of the origination narrative. Many of
these associated stories are taken from the personal life of the
self-processor, but other sources of narrative are also of value. The
alternative of extracting meanings from the surface of a dream or
initial story is a resistance and a way of preventing access to one's
own deep unconscious perceptions and processes -- it is to be avoided as
much as possible.

After engaging for a while in this effort to develop a *meaningful pool
of encoded themes,* it's necessary to step back to determine if the pool
has both frame imagery and power themes. If not, more guided
associations are called for. If so, the next step involves identifying
the most compelling, currently active triggers, keeping in mind the need
to search for those that are frame-related and/or likely to evoke some
type of death anxiety. This done, the next step is to decode the themes
in light of each of the active triggers in order to become consciously
aware of the deep unconscious perceptions and processing of the
triggering events. There then follows an effort to search for encoded
genetic connections to this constellation of triggering event and
decoded meanings -- adding them to the self-interpretation. If a frame
modification is at issue, the themes should also be decoded as
directives to secure the deviant frame, be it in a therapy that the
therapist is conducting or in his or her everyday life. After this is
done, there's a need to associate further to the origination narrative
and to examine these fresh themes for validation of the
self-interpretation and/or frame-rectifying effort -- or its lack.
Non-validating imagery calls for a search for a possible missed trigger
or for the reformulation of the meanings of the encoded themes. If
encoded validation has emerged, it's advisable to continue the process
with fresh guided associations and the search for additional
trigger-decoded insights.

[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_198}Psychotherapists are in an
advantageous position to carry out selfprocessing efforts because the
triggers that arise in their therapeutic work tend to be especially
powerful and to be processed by their deep unconscious minds. In
addition, traumatic events in their daily lives, especially those with
frame-deviant qualities and that arouse death anxieties, also lend
themselves to these efforts. When successful, selfprocessing serves to
acquaint therapists with their deep unconscious issues and the effects
of their life traumas on their lives and work. It should also help them
to reduce the level of death anxiety that they experience and to better
manage these anxieties to the point where they only rarely motivate
technical errors and frame modifications harmful to their patients. The
process can also reduce or alleviate therapists' emotionally-founded
symptoms and other forms of maladaptation, lessen the extent of their
counterresistances and countertransferences, and greatly improve the
quality of their therapeutic work and personal lives.

#### **Strong adaptive forms of therapy** {.h4}

The second approach to personal insight and emotional healing involves
engaging in one of the three forms of strong adaptive psychotherapy that
exist at present. The first uses a *standard model of adaptive therapy*
based on a 45 or 50-minute session and adopts both the fundamental rule
of free association and the basic rule of guided associations. The
second is called *self-processing psychotherapy* and, ideally, it's
carried out using a 90-minute session, but works well in frameworks of
60 or 75 minutes. The third and last is called *self-processing
psychotherapy-supervision,* which is a treatment form that combines
therapy with supervisory work.

Self-processing psychotherapy is structured in a manner that turns over
the first 40 minutes to the patient, who is taught how to engage in the
self-processing effort (see above). The therapist is entirely silent
during this time. He or she then intervenes as needed during the balance
of the session. The reason for such a lengthy session is that,
empirically, it's been found that patients' resistances to accessing
deep unconscious meaning and frame-securing directives are so severe
that it takes an extended session for the patient to fulfil the recipe
for intervening and for the therapist to bring the patient to solid
moments of deep-unconsciously validated insights. For therapists who
conduct therapy based on adaptive theory and principles of technique,
self-processing psychotherapy is very helpful -- as it is for
mental-health []{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_199}professionals who
wish to have a strong adaptive form of treatment without a supervisory
component.

Self-processing psychotherapy-supervision is an optimal treatment
modality for therapists who need both of these aides. The structure of
this situation calls for allowing the patient-supervisee 30 minutes of
self-processing on their own, 40 additional minutes of therapeutic work
with the therapist-supervisor, and 20 minutes of supervision (see Langs,
1994, for details). The great advantage of this modality is that it
facilitates the revelation of the deep unconscious sources of the
supervisee's erroneous, countertransference-based interventions in a way
that is immediate and alive, truly experiential and reflective of deep
unconscious experiences and processes.

The reason that this is the case lies with the interactional-adaptive
aspects of deep unconscious experience. If a therapist -- I'll call him
Dr Jones -- is in therapy with one therapist and in supervision with
another, defining the triggers that detrimentally affect his therapeutic
work with his patients is all but impossible. Adaptively, the evocative
triggers related to Dr Jones' therapy -- most of them frame-related --
are active only in the treatment setting; they are not active in the
supervisory situation. This puts Dr Jones' supervisor at a great
disadvantage. On the other hand, the evocative triggers that are created
by the supervisor's efforts -- and they too are mostly frame-related
(Langs, 1994) -- are not actively available in Dr Jones' psychotherapy,
which puts his therapist at a great disadvantage.

The only sound solution, then, is to combine the two offerings into one
situation and to have but a single therapist-supervisor who works with
Dr Jones within a single frame. The result is but one set of triggering
events activating Dr Jones' deep unconscious system, which is, or can
be, known to his therapist-supervisor who can interpret Dr Jones'
thematic imagery accordingly. From there, it's a small step to showing
Dr Jones how his therapist-supervisor's interventions -- validated or
erroneous, verbal or frame-related -- have affected Dr Jones'
therapeutic work with the patient he chooses to present in the
supervisory part of the session.

#### **The nature of the therapeutic space** {.h4}

Another issue of great importance is the nature of the therapeutic space
created by strong and weak adaptive psychotherapists and called for by
their respective theories. Before turning to the therapeutic situation,
it is well to note that we have just been witness to the nature of
[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_200}these differences. Weak adaptive
therapists would see combining therapy with supervision as a
contaminating interference of both efforts. In contrast, strong adaptive
therapists who understand that all inner mental processes are evoked by
interventional triggers, see no effective means of gaining deep insight
into the personal problems and difficulties in doing psychotherapy of a
given student-therapist than having the same therapist engage with the
patient in both efforts.

As for psychotherapy, comparative clinical studies have shown that
private secured-frame strong adaptive modes of treatment create
therapeutic spaces in which patients consistently express an abundance
of narrative imagery that encodes their deep unconscious experiences of
their therapists' interventional triggers. This allows for a full
processing of these incidents and for extensive work on the deep
unconscious level of experience, including deep unconscious issues of
guilt and death anxiety. Essentially, this type of therapeutic space
implicitly encourages the unencumbered encoded communication of deep
unconscious perceptions and meanings, and supports the healing that can
take place on that basis. But in addition to its seemingly more
effective healing powers, the adaptive therapeutic space is also a place
where the operations of the two systems of the emotion-processing mind
-- and its deep unconscious system in particular -- is patently visible
and readily observed. It's a world that's quite unfamiliar to the
conscious mind and to weak adaptive therapists and its particulars
permit a detailed investigation of the mental realm. The many new and
consciously unfamiliar observations, concepts, structures and ideas
offered in this book bear testimony to this claim.

Weak adaptive treatment situations, which are generally replete with
frame modifications and which direct listening, healing and possible
discovery to the manifest level of communication, create a very
different kind of therapeutic space -- a superficial world in which the
unconscious dimension is very close to the surface instead of deeply
buried as in the strong adaptive space. This is a world that restricts
patients' expressions of deep unconscious perceptions and adaptive
responses to interventional triggers, virtually shutting off any
opportunity to observe these processes. As a result, the available view
of the emotion-processing mind is shallow and virtually restricted to
the conscious system; the complexities of the emotion-related mind and
emotional life simply cannot be seen in this space, nor is deep
unconscious healing feasible.

These differences in the therapeutic worlds in which strong and weak
adaptive therapists work are one way of accounting for the
[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_201}strangeness that strong adaptive
ideas and therapeutic techniques have had for weak adaptive therapists,
and for the tendency of strong adaptive therapists to look past weak
adaptive clinical findings in their search for the more powerful issues
that arise in the world that they occupy. The differences also have
something to say about the comparative richness of the strong adaptive
compared to the weak adaptive approach, and about why every weak
adaptive psychotherapist can learn a great deal from strong adaptive
writings.

#### **The limitations of strong adaptive psychotherapy** {.h4}

Every system in the universe, in whatever form it takes, has its
limitations. The emotion-processing mind, for example, can process only
a finite amount of information and meaning, beyond which the system
becomes overloaded and malfunctions -- for example through a
deterioration of conscious-system functioning or the excessive use of
denial and obliteration. Despite the protection offered by the MAC,
traumas tend to overload the processing efforts of the conscious mind,
and thus failures in conscious-system processing appear to be one basis
for symptom formation.

Much the same applies to scientific theories. As data and information
accumulate, they test their explanatory powers and the effectiveness of
their practical applications. These principles very much apply to the
many diverse theories of emotional life and to the clinical practices
that they have spawned -- including the adaptive approach. It is,
however, extremely difficult for impressionistic sciences, like those
that sponsor the various forms of psychotherapy, including
psychoanalysis, to discover their own flaws and limitations. These
quasi-sciences lack the quantitative, mathematical measures and
mathematically-grounded methods that could enable them to make
definitive predictions and to be in a position where they are confronted
with failed results that speak for erroneous assumptions and theoretical
and clinical errors. Impressionistic theories are notoriously rife with
unrecognized errors that prove to be all but impossible to identify from
within their own confines. These discoveries rely on rare, rebellious,
individuals who are able to find cause for a paradigm shift (Kuhn,
1962), a new view of the same territory that readily exposes the flaws
in previous and alternative ways of thinking. Such basic changes in
theory and practice, however, tend to evoke enormous amounts of
resistance in those committed to the usual way of thinking, so
fundamental changes in impressionistic sciences are difficult to effect
and develop very slowly.

[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_202}The adaptive approach has made
special efforts to discover its own limitations and flaws. It has
developed a formal, quantitative science of human communication and
created likely measures of both countertransference and effective modes
of treatment. While these studies did not test specific aspects of the
adaptive and other theories of psychotherapy, the results were
nevertheless interpreted by neutral observers to significantly support
the adaptive paradigm and its therapeutic techniques (Langs *et al.*,
1996). Indeed, the very fact that the adaptive approach has been the
basis for finding communicative measures that facilitated the discovery
of laws of the mind speaks for its viability.

Clinically, the adaptive approach has established encoded, deep
unconscious validation as a basis for assessing the soundness of all
types of interventions and has used this method to test both its own
clinical precepts and theoretical propositions and those of other
approaches to therapy. Granted that these methods are not quantitative
in nature and are open to bias and error, they nevertheless are an
effort in the right direction. The search for unconscious validation has
enabled adaptive therapists to recognize the kinds of therapeutic
interventions that consistently do and do not obtain encoded validation
-- and to question the correctness and usefulness of non-validated
efforts as well as the theoretical constructs on which they are based.
And when it comes to the adaptive approach's search for its own
inexplicable findings and limitations, its focus on interventional
triggers for all manner of resistances and paradoxical reactions in
patients has placed it in a favourable position to examine its own
theoretical and clinical difficulties. Where other theories tend to hold
a patient's pathology or inner conflicts primarily accountable for
adverse responses to treatment, the adaptive approach focuses first on
the contributions of the therapist and only secondarily on how his or
her interventions impact negatively on patients.

In the clinical arena, then, investigations of this kind carried out by
the adaptive approach have indeed revealed certain limitations in the
applicability of its techniques in respect to who can benefit from its
secured frameworks and interpretative ministrations. As I have
indicated, patients who have suffered intense death-related traumas --
as victims or perpetrators -- resist this type of treatment and often
refuse to remain in its therapy situations. Strong adaptive therapists
have not found the interpretive means of enabling these patients to do
so, a situation that suggests limitations in both technique and theory.
These problems arise with individuals with extremes of both existential
and []{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_203}predator death anxiety.
Indeed, with such patients, securing the frame and offering
unconsciously validated interpretations tends to increase their feelings
of entrapment and/or sense of danger of self-harm. On the other hand,
modifying the ground rules or forgoing a called-for trigger-decoded
interpretation convinces these patients unconsciously that their
therapists have a greater dread of secured frames and encoded meaning
than they do -- and with that comes the feeling that it may be senseless
to remain in treatment.

Along different but related lines, there are the above-noted
observations that many patients dread that the experience of deep
unconscious meaning and/or secured frames will drive them into madness
and cause their psychic disintegration. The basis for this apprehension,
which may be connected to the various forms of death anxiety, is not
entirely clear, nor is its presence easily modified. All of these
observations suggest that there is a major piece of understanding
missing from strong adaptive thinking.

Another sign of difficulty is that adaptive theory is to some extent
able to account for factors that damage the MAC and emotionprocessing
mind, but has been unable to come up with a consistent means of
effectively repairing that damage -- the approach understands an
illness, but not its cure. Thus, it seem well-established that
death-related traumas of all kinds cause changes in the MAC, which raise
its threshold for the events and meanings that it passes on to the
conscious system for hopefully effective adaptive processing and
response. In substance, these traumas result in a lasting
intensification of an individual's use of conscious-system denial and
obliteration. But, that said, no means of consistently reversing this
self-damaging change has emerged. The best that adaptive therapists have
been able to do is to offer these patients a secured frame and to engage
in repeated therapeutic efforts to demonstrate to them their excessive
use of denial mechanisms and tendencies towards self-punishment, and to
uncover and process the deep unconscious sources of these trends. Some
diminution of the use of denial and self-harm has been observed and, in
some patients who have harmed others, themes of absolution, repentance
and forgiveness have emerged after many years of treatment. The lack of
clear insight into how to heal this very common and basic emotional
problem challenges adaptive therapists to search for flaws in their
theory and thinking and to find new means of creating fundamental,
healing changes in the emotion-processing mind.

The continual confrontation with therapeutic failures that are taken as
indications of significant missing pieces in adaptive theory
[]{#9781403903426_21_ch14.html_page_204}and practices is compensated for
by its many therapeutic successes and by its many new insights into the
emotional domain. This brings us to one last sign of insufficient
adaptive understanding -- the failure of its theory and practices to
gain broad acceptance among psychotherapists and in the world at large.
As noted earlier, without being able to articulate their motives, many
therapists turn away from and marginalize the adaptive approach. And
here, too, adaptive therapists have managed to understand a great deal
about the unconscious sources of this rejection of its precepts and
techniques, but it has not found a cure -- that is, a way of reversing
this trend. Adaptive techniques consistently obtain deep unconscious
validation, but almost as consistently are met with conscious
resistance. The inability of the approach to resolve this impasse is
another limitation that is quite painful for adaptive therapists to
face. Paradoxically, it is at the same time the source of powerful
motives to question the approach and to search for deeper understanding.
Unsolved puzzles are painful to behold, yet they are a welcome reason to
probe deeper -- they are the disturbing sponsors of new insights, growth
and development.

#### **A final comment** {.h4}

As a means by which we can deeply understand the emotion-processing mind
and both emotional life and the therapeutic process, there's every
reason to believe that, at present, the strong adaptive approach has no
peer. As a form of therapy it also claims to being the most effective
and least harmful form of treatment available today. But carrying out
such work asks a great deal of both patient and therapist -- even as it
gives a great deal more back in return.

In light of its burdensome attributes and the emotional issues it
activates in its practitioners, we can appreciate that conducting an
adaptive form of psychodynamic, insight-oriented psychotherapy may not
be the unconsciously driven choice of every mental-health professional.
But, at the same time, we all need to appreciate that truly fresh and
rich insights into emotional life and the therapeutic process are quite
difficult to come by these days. Because of this, and because the strong
adaptive approach has so much to offer, it seems fair to say that it is
incumbent on every mental-health professional today to study and master
its theories, ideas and principles of technique. It is my deepest hope
that this book has made such a quest possible and rewarding for those
who have come to its pages.

## []{#9781403903426_22_glo.html_page_205}[]{#9781403903426_22_glo.html_glo}Glossary of Terms {.h2}

**The Strong Adaptive Approach**

synonyms:

*The Communicative Approach*

*The Adaptive Approach*

*The Adaptational-Interactional Approach*

**Adaptation** -- The attempt to effectively cope with and survive
environmental challenges. Adaptation is the prime function of all living
beings, including humans.

**Adaptive context** -- Synonymous with 'trigger', the term alludes to
an event to which the deep unconscious system is responding -- the
context that defines the disguised meanings of responsive encoded,
narrative messages.

**Approach, strong adaptive** -- The theory and therapy of human
emotional life that adopts the basic premise that the emotion-processing
mind has evolved primarily to cope with environmental events, and only
secondarily with inner mental fantasies, memories and conflicts.

**Approach, weak adaptive** -- The theories and therapies of human
emotional life that minimize or ignore adaptations to environmental
events and tend to stress the role of inner mental life in this regard.

**Associations, free** -- Unencumbered communications from patients who
are saying whatever comes to mind without censorship.

**Associations, guided** -- A technique used in psychotherapy and
selfprocessing which requires patients to associate to the elements of a
dream or story with fresh narratives. These associations are guided by
and are a response to dream images and themes of stories that patients
make up in sessions -- so-called origination narratives. Guided
associations promote the expression of encoded stories that tend to be
more powerful than the dreams and origination narratives to which they
are connected. They are an invaluable and essential part of working with
dreams in the effort to interpret the most powerful meanings of the deep
unconscious experiences connected with emotional disturbances.

**Bipersonal field** -- A term used to describe the therapeutic setting
and context, one that emphasizes the systemic aspects of the
relationship and interaction between patient and therapist in which both
parties are seen to contribute to all of the happenings in a treatment
experience.

**Countertransference** -- See therapist madness.

**Cure, modes of** -- The optimal means by which patients find lasting
relief from their emotional disturbances include therapists' offers of
unconsciously []{#9781403903426_22_glo.html_page_206}validated,
trigger-decoded interpretations, the healing qualities of the secured
frame and the therapist's sustaining or establishing as many of the
ideal ground rules of therapy as possible with a given patient, and via
patients' unconscious introjective identifications with their
well-functioning therapists.

**Cure through nefarious comparison** -- A patient's achievement of
symptom relief through an unconscious comparison with the therapist at a
juncture in the therapy when the therapist's madness or
countertransferences are active.

**Death anxiety, existential** -- The universal, entrapping,
claustrum-related anxiety evoked by the realization of ultimate personal
demise. This type of anxiety mobilizes a variety of forms of denial and
obliteration through the use of both mental defences such as perceptual
blindness and denial-based actions such as manic flights.

**Death anxiety, predatory** -- The anxiety caused by threats of harm
and death from others and from natural disasters. This type of anxiety
evokes a mobilization of mental and physical resources in preparation
for fight or flight.

**Death anxiety, predator** -- The anxiety activated when we harm others
psychologically or physically. This type of anxiety evokes conscious and
deep unconscious guilt and an unconscious need for punishment that tends
to lead to guilt-motivated acts of self-harm. Unconscious guilt is a
major problem for humankind to this very day.

**Denial** -- A psychological mechanism through which many unbearable
incoming reality-based events and meanings are barred from conscious
registration. Because adaptation to external events is the primary
function of the emotion-processing mind, denial is seen as the basic
human psychological defence. It is also our prime defence against
existential death anxiety and its use is often supported by obliterating
actions such as ground-rule violations, manic activities, and a shutdown
of encoded narrative communication.

**Derivative** -- An encoded theme in a dream or narrative that is
derived from and thereby serves to disguise an unconscious perception,
or one meaning of an unconscious perception.

**Domain, encoded deep unconscious** -- The world of deep unconscious
experience that is accessed through trigger decoding. It stands in
contrast to the implied superficial unconscious domain which is accessed
through extracting implications from surface messages and observed
behaviours.

**Domain, implied superficial unconscious** -- The realm of unconscious
experience that is accessed by extracting purported implications of
manifest messages. It stands in contrast to the encoded deep unconscious
domain that is accessed by decoding narrative themes in light of their
evocative triggering events.

**Evolutionary biology** -- The most fundamental of the biological
subsciences, one that deals with both the nature of organismic
adaptations and their long-term histories, including the forces or
selection factors that have []{#9781403903426_22_glo.html_page_207}led
to changes in adaptive structures, functions and strategies. There is a
consensus that a full and indepth appreciation of biological structures
and operations -- including those that are mental, psychological and
emotional -- must include an understanding of the selection factors and
evolutionary history of these structures and their operations.

**Existential death anxiety** -- See death anxiety, existential.

**Emotional mind** -- Those components of the human mind that are
involved in the production of affects or feelings. This mental module,
which has strong physical links and involves the expression or discharge
of affects, is to be distinguished from the emotion-processing mind
which has evolved to adapt to emotionally-charged events or triggers.
This distinction revolves around the differences between the expression
of feelings and efforts to cope with traumas through mental and physical
activities designed to master the traumatic event.

**Emotion-processing mind** -- The organ of adaptation, the mental
module, that has evolved in humans to cope with environmental
conditions, events (triggers) and their meanings.

**Emotion-related mind** -- A term used to allude to those components of
the human mind that deal with emotionally-charged events or triggers.
The two main modules that have evolved for this adaptive purpose are the
emotional mind and the emotion-processing mind.

**Empowered psychotherapy** -- A synonym for self-processing
psychotherapy.

**Encoded messages** -- Narrative communications with both manifest or
surface/conscious meanings and latent or encoded/unconscious meanings.
The encoded meanings are decoded in light of the triggers that have
activated the deep unconscious system which has, in turn, generated the
encoded imagery.

**Fantasies, conscious and unconscious** -- Products of the human
imagination, often in the form of daydreams, these mental contents are
motivated externally by triggering events to which they are manifest and
encoded adaptive responses, and internally by instinctual drive needs.
Fantasies come in two forms: conscious and unconscious. Unconscious
fantasies are encoded in dreams and stories, and are far more powerful
than conscious fantasies.

**Fear -- guilt subsystem** -- A term used to allude to the deep
unconscious subsystem of morality and ethics.

**Frame, ideal** -- The set of universally and unconsciously validated
ground rules. This includes a set fee, frequency, time and length of
sessions; total privacy and confidentiality; the relative anonymity of
the therapist; the absence of physical contact between patient and
therapist; and the use of neutral interventions based on trigger
decoding patients' material. See also: frame, secured.

**Frame, modified** -- A set of ground rules for psychotherapy or
counselling in which one or more of the ideal, unconsciously validated
ground rules is either not invoked or is altered. The use of a modified
ground rule obtains non-validating, encoded, unconscious responses. This
type of frame evokes []{#9781403903426_22_glo.html_page_208}predatory
death anxieties in patients and predator death anxieties in the
therapist who has altered the frame and who is thereby seducing and
harming the patient -- however inadvertently and unconsciously.

**Frame, secured** -- The ideal, soundly holding set of ground rules
that are universally supported and validated by patients' responsive
encoded or unconscious narrative imagery. There is, then, a universally
and unconsciously confirmed and unconsciously sought set of rules and
boundaries that promote trust and emotional healing. These frames also,
however, activate notable existential death anxieties that often cause
an unconscious dread of the optimal conditions for a psychotherapy or
counselling experience.

**Frame, therapeutic** -- The ground rules and setting of a therapy as
they create the context for the ongoing therapeutic exchanges and
experience.

**Ground rules, of therapy** -- The ground rules of psychotherapy frame
and afford background meaning to the therapeutic experience. They have
multiple functions. When properly secured, they establish sound physical
and psychological boundaries between patient and therapist; create the
holding -- healing qualities of the therapist's relationship with the
patient; establish a basic trust in the patient towards the therapist;
and facilitate the patient's openness to communicate to and with the
therapist.

**Indicators** -- The signs of disturbance in patients. They include
frame modifications and other forms of resistance, emotional-related
symptoms and interpersonal disorders. Indicators are the target of
trigger-decoded interpretations which are designed to illuminate the
deep unconscious basis of these maladaptations and to enable patients to
insightfully resolve them.

**Intellectualizations** -- The generic term for all non-narrative
communications -- the opposite of narratives. Intellectualizations
include general descriptions, speculations of all kinds, analyses and
evaluations, formulations, interpretations, and so on. These
communications have little or no deep meaning in that they tend to
convey single-meaning messages that generally lack encoded implications.

**Intelligence** -- The means by which we analyse and grasp the meanings
of our environments and inter-current events, and find the means of
responding to them adaptively. There is both a conscious intelligence or
wisdom and a deep unconscious intelligence and wisdom. In the emotional
domain, the latter is far more effective than the former.

**Interpretation, communicative** -- The means by which deep unconscious
perceptions and processing activities are decoded in light of their
triggers. Interpretations usually illuminate a patient's indicators --
his or her resistances and emotional symptoms.

**Intervention** -- An all-inclusive terms that refers to everything a
therapist says and does, as well as the conditions he or she sets for a
given therapy. There are two basic classes of interventions: verbal
comments, and managements of the ground rules. Comments range from
questions to interpretations, but only trigger-decoded interpretations
obtain encoded/unconscious validation and they are therefore seen as the
healing class of comments made []{#9781403903426_22_glo.html_page_209}by
therapists. Frame-management activities that secure the ideal grounds
rules obtain encoded/unconscious validation and are also healing, while
departures from the ideal frame lead to non-validating responses and are
harmful to patients.

**Intervening, recipe for** -- A valid communicative interpretation
requires that a patient express deeply meaningful, power-laden
derivative/encoded themes and either allude manifestly to their
evocative trigger, or encode the trigger in the imagery in a form that
is easily decoded. A therapist keeps this recipe in mind in deciding
whether or not to intervene.

**Memories, conscious and unconscious** -- Recollection of past events
which come in two forms: conscious and unconscious. Unconscious memories
tend to be highly traumatic, emotionally powerful, and are encoded in
dreams and stories.

**Mind-centred approaches to psychotherapy and counselling** -- Theories
of psychotherapy and counselling that propose that emotional
maladaptations arise primarily from intrapsychic conflict and
anxiety-provoking, unconscious fantasies and memories. These theories
are all weakly adaptive in nature.

**Misalliance cure** -- Symptom relief experienced by a patient on the
basis of the unconscious experience of the countertransferences or
madness of the therapist. See for example, Cure through nefarious
comparison.

**Misalliance, therapeutic** -- An unconscious collusion between patient
and therapist designed to undermine therapeutic progress.

**Module, mental** -- A collection of mental faculties -- for example,
perception, thinking, reasoning, and so forth -- organized around a
central adaptive task. The mental module that has evolved to adapt to
emotionally-charged events and their meanings is called 'the
emotion-processing mind'.

**Morality and ethics, deep unconscious subsystem of** -- An unconscious
system of the mind that sets moral and ethical standards and enforces
them by unconsciously orchestrating self-punishments and self-harmful
actions and choices for non-compliance, and self-directed rewards and
sound decisions for compliance. Unconscious guilt is its hallmark. In
psychotherapy, this system's values are represented by the ideal frame
and the system operates accordingly -- unconsciously rewarding
frame-securing efforts and punishing deviations.

**Natural selection** -- The natural process first described by Darwin
and Wallace through which organisms with mutations and variations that
enable them to survive best under prevailing environmental conditions
are favourably reproduced.

**Narrative** -- The generic terms for all storied communications -- the
opposite of intellectualizations. Narratives are adaptive responses to
triggering events and are two-tiered messages, in that they convey a
manifest set of directly-stated meanings (along with their implications)
and a more powerful, latent, indirectly-stated or encoded set of
meanings that are camouflaged in the manifest themes.

[]{#9781403903426_22_glo.html_page_210}**Narrative, origination** -- Any
story or fantasy that a patient composes in the course of a therapy or
self-processing session that is then used as a source of guided
associations. These stories are used in narrative-driven,
self-processing psychotherapy when a patient does not recall a dream.

**Non-validation, of therapists' interventions** -- Encoded storied
responses to therapists' interventions in which negatively-toned themes
such as harmful, inappropriately seductive, blind or ignorant people
appear. These themes indicate that the therapist has intervened
erroneously and they call for refomulation.

**Origination narrative** -- A story composed by a patient or client
that serves as a dream equivalent and, thereby, as a source of guided
associations. Typically, they are generated at the beginning of an
empowered or selfprocessing psychotherapy session when a recent dream is
unavailable.

**Perception, conscious** -- An all-inclusive term used to convey the
reception of incoming stimuli -- visual, auditory and otherwise -- that
register in awareness, along with their directly experienced meanings
and implications.

**Perception, subliminal** -- See perception, unconscious.

**Perception, unconscious** -- An all-inclusive term, identical to
subliminal perception, that alludes to the reception of all incoming
stimuli -- visual, auditory and otherwise -- that register outside of
awareness, along with their unconsciously experienced meanings and
implications.

**Predator death anxiety** -- See death anxiety, predator.

**Predatory death anxiety** -- See death anxiety, predatory.

**Psychoanalysis** -- Defined by Freud as the study of the unconscious,
transferences, resistances and infantile sexuality, it is redefined by
the strong adaptive approach as the investigation of emotional
cognition. That is, psychoanalysis is the study of conscious and
unconscious human adaptations to emotionallycharged triggering events --
their universal features, evolutionary history, and personal history and
variations.

**Psychodynamic** -- A term used to describe approaches to the
emotionrelated mind in which conscious and unconscious conflict are seen
as the driving forces of emotional life.

**Psychotherapy** -- An effort by a therapist to help a patient to
favourably resolve and modify emotional maladaptations.

**Reality-centred approaches to psychotherapy and counselling** --
Theories of emotional maladaptation that are centred around failures to
cope with traumatic environmental events. These theories adopt a
strongly adaptive approach and stress the role played by unconscious
perception in emotional life and treatment.

**Rectification, models of** -- A term that refers to the finding that
when a ground rule is modified and departs from the unconsciously sought
ideal frame for therapy, patients consistently encode correctives --
images that point to securing the deviant ground rule and frame.

**Repression** -- The obliteration of inner mental contents such as
traumatic fantasies and memories. Repression is a second-order defence,
denial being []{#9781403903426_22_glo.html_page_211}the more fundamental
of the two. Repressed contents, which are activated by ongoing events,
do however find encoded expression in patients' dreams and narratives.

**Resistance, communicative** -- An obstacle to the progress of a
psychotherapy in which the patient does not express viable encoded
themes and/or a clear indication of the activating trigger for those
themes. That is, he or she does not fulfil the recipe for intervening.

**Resistance, interactional** -- Obstacles to progress of a therapy that
are products of the bipersonal field, and thus those to which both
patient and therapist have contributed.

**Selection factor** -- An environmental challenge, broadly defined,
that must be successfully mastered by a group of living organisms. Those
organisms that have mutated and passed on to their progeny the most
effective responses to such challenges are favourably reproduced largely
because they survive best in face of the environmental threat.

**Self-processing psychotherapy** -- A new form of therapy created
through the new psychoanalysis. It involves a 90-minute session and
concentrates on the build-up of narrative themes and their decoding in
light of their evocative triggers. It may also be carried out
personally, although this is done in the face of strong conscious-system
resistances.

**System, conscious** -- The adaptive system of the emotion-processing
mind that operates within awareness with contents that are directly or
potentially known or knowable. This system has a superficial unconscious
subsystem as well.

**System overload** -- A general term to refer to situations in which
the processing capabilities of the emotion-processing mind are taxed
well-beyond its adaptive resources. The protective use of denial and
obliteration of incoming events and their meanings is a common response
to this type of situation.

**Strong adaptive approach, the** -- A synonym for a new paradigm of
psychoanalysis whose basic thesis is that conscious and unconscious
efforts to adapt to environmental conditions and events (triggers) is
the fundamental task of the emotion-processing mind.

**Themes, bridging** -- A term used to refer to themes found in
patients' dreams and stories that connect or link up to meanings of the
their evocative triggers. For example a dream of being robbed bridges to
a trigger in which a therapist has overcharged the patient.

**Therapist madness** -- A non-intellectualized term that refers to
therapists' countertransferences as expressed through unneeded frame
modifications, erroneous verbal interventions (essentially those that do
not utilize trigger decoding), and errant forms of behaviour like
physical contact with the patient and ending a session early.

**Trauma** -- An emotionally-charged event that is sufficiently harmful
as to activate not only conscious adaptive reactions, but also
unconscious perceptions and adaptive responses. By and large, the
emotion-processing mind has evolved to deal with traumas, psychological
and/or physical.

[]{#9781403903426_22_glo.html_page_212}**Trigger or triggering event**
-- An emotionally-charged incident, verbal or physical, that activates
the emotion-processing mind. These events are, with few exceptions,
traumatic in nature.

**Trigger decoding** -- Deciphering the disguised meanings of a dream or
story by using its activating trigger as the decoding key.

**Unconscious mind** -- A mainstream psychoanalytic term that refers to
all manner of contents and processes that exist or operate outside of
awareness, but are lacking in intelligence and adaptive capabilities.

**Unconscious, deep system** -- The unconscious mind as conceived of by
the new psychoanalysis. This system takes in information and meaning
subliminally, processing these inputs with a highly intelligent wisdom
system, checking out the inputs for moral and ethical implications, and
then encoding these processes and their outcome in dreams and
narratives. The conceptualization of this system is to be distinguished
from that of mainstream psychoanalytic views of the unconscious mind in
that this system has adaptive capabilities absent in the old view.

**Unconscious, superficial subsystem of the conscious system** -- An
unconscious reservoir of contents and images that easily access
awareness either directly (having been preconscious) or in obvious
encoded form (for example a teacher who represents or encodes a
therapist).

**Validation, of therapists' interventions** -- The unconscious
confirmation of the correctness and healing qualities of an
intervention, which takes the form of encoded stories that feature
helpful and wise people, rewarding events and other positive themes.
This response indicates that an interpretation or ground-rule securing
effort has been correctly carried out and is serving the healing
process.

**Weak adaptive approach to psychotherapy and counselling** -- A term
that applies to the wide spectrum of treatment modalities in use today
with the sole exception of the communicative or strong adaptive
approach. In these forms of therapy, mental efforts at adaptation are
implied, but they are not central to the theory that is advocated, nor
to the clinical thinking derived from that theory. In essence, these are
not adaptation-centred approaches to therapy.

**Wisdom, deep unconscious subsystem of** -- A term used to allude to
the remarkable knowledge-base and adaptive resources of the deep
unconscious mind and its processing activities. In the emotional realm,
deep unconscious wisdom far exceeds conscious wisdom, and its operations
are reflected in trigger-evoked narratives which encode its processing
of, and adaptive solutions for, traumatic triggering events.
