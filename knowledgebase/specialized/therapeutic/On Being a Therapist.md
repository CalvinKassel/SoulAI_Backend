### Practicing Counseling and Psychotherapy in the New World Order {#05_preface.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-5-div1-1 .sec1}

Over the last century, there have been a handful of world events that
have forever altered the nature of healthcare, particularly related to
emotional and psychological difficulties. The 1918 flu pandemic led to
the establishment of a national health service in the United States. The
measles outbreak of the 1950s led to the development of vaccines as
preventive measures. The number of "shell-shocked" veterans of World War
I and "battle fatigue" conditions of World War II resulted in the first
diagnoses and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition,
civil wars, terrorism, mass shootings, crime sprees, economic
depressions, increased unemployment, racism, and especially pandemics
and health threats have been known to significantly increase mental
health problems. Often these crises have led to major breakthroughs, if
not transformations, in the ways that healthcare has been delivered.

There have been times in history, especially most recently, when the
ongoing ripple effects within the political arena have led to massive
protests, increased feelings of alienation, as well as the erosion of
trust, courtesy, and civility within our culture. The previous years
have taken a toll on everyone's mental health, leading to significant
increases in depression, anxiety, economic disparity, suicide, crime,
and violence. Even "truth" and "facts" are now considered open to
debate, depending on one's political and religious convictions. Social
movements and events like Black Lives Matter, the oppression of refugees
and immigrants, not to mention the pandemic that killed millions of
people and left half the world in economic misery, only increased the
suffering and helplessness.

Yet during a time when people most needed---yearned---for intimate
support and contact, masks, social distancing, and outright fear and
avoidance made such deep connections difficult, if not impossible.
Therapists, []{#05_preface.xhtml_page_viii}among so many other
professionals, were often left with little alternative other than to
deliver services via screens, mobile devices, or messaging. Within a
period of weeks, all of a sudden, everything we ever learned and
understood became obsolete, or at least radically changed. With minimal
(if any) preparation, training, and supervision, clinicians were forced
to pivot to therapeutic delivery systems for which we had only vague
notions for what was considered "best practices." Once the pandemic
infections abated, vaccines were made possible, and dangers of physical
contact were reduced, it was clear that counseling and
psychotherapy---as we previously understood and practiced it---were
forever going to be different. Many practitioners decided to give up
their offices altogether and work from home or else offer exclusively
virtual or distance-based services. Many other practitioners decided
that the convenience, cost-effectiveness, reduction of expenses, and
preference of many clients required them to provide an altogether
different menu of options. In addition, client groups such as indigenous
and marginalized groups, deployed military personnel, and those who are
economically disadvantaged or live in rural or isolated regions were
finally able to seek greater access to mental health services for the
first time.

Updating and revising this book about therapy for this latest edition, I
had already been prepared to deal with some fairly important changes
within the profession during the previous half decade. When I first
decided to begin this work, I had no idea just how much a book about
therapy or---for that matter---*any* service profession would become
unrecognizable in its current form. Who could have imagined a few years
ago we'd be talking to people about their deepest secrets and most
pressing problems while staring at their faces on a computer, tablet, or
phone? Whoever imagined that therapists wouldn't require offices any
longer?

How all this will play out in coming years is both exciting, confusing,
and, at least for some of us, a little disturbing. What has been
welcomed and appreciated as convenient, accessible, and in some ways,
uniquely helpful, is also limiting. For those who are doing distance
therapy, we are missing essential data and cues that were previously
available to us: a client's posture, scent, what the hands and feet are
doing, where the person sits in the room, or who else is listening to
the session. In addition, some of the most crucial parts of therapeutic
change used to take place during the commute to and from sessions when
clients would review and rehearse what they wanted to talk about, as
well as the kaleidoscope of thoughts, feelings, and reactions that took
place on the trip home. Once we have collected evidence, completed
comparative studies, developed training and supervision programs,
figured out jurisdictional matters and licensure to do this sort of
[]{#05_preface.xhtml_page_ix}work, we will understand a lot more about
the respective advantages and limitations of various therapeutic
options, which approaches, methods, and practices work best for which
clients and difficulties. Meanwhile---and fortunately---the experience
of *being* a therapist is still much the same.

### Changes Are to Be Expected When We Are in the Business of Promoting Change {#05_preface.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-5-div1-2 .sec1}

The climate for being a therapist has changed so dramatically that the
field is all but unrecognizable to those who began their careers when
the first edition of this book was published over 40 years ago. This was
a time when clients were mostly white, female, and upper middle class;
when therapy was believed to take a long time (at least months, if not
years) to be considered viable; and when insurance companies would
routinely pay 90% of whatever we charged, with no lifetime limit or
restrictions on frequency of sessions.

Now we practice in an era when more indigent, immigrant, and
working-class clients are being served, often presenting much more
severe problems. During the global pandemic, not only were professionals
faced with mortal threats to health and safety but also there was an
epidemic of emotional difficulties and severe disturbances that resulted
from economic collapse, loss of jobs, political instability, lack of
accurate and reliable information, and uncertainty about the future, not
to mention the quarantines, displacements, hardships, and even tragic
loss of loved ones. Since we were unable to schedule sessions in person
because of dangers of transmitting the virus, the whole structure of
counseling and psychotherapy, as we used to understand it, changed
overnight. How these options continue to evolve, coupled with therapy
"apps" and online programs, is still open to much debate, but it is
clear that the evolution of our field is taking place at a dizzying
pace.

In addition to changes in the landscape for clinical practice, many
caseloads are now filled with court-ordered and involuntarily confined
clients. Whereas once upon a time therapists followed Freud's lead of
specializing in the so-called worried well or the neurotic middle class,
we now reach a far more diverse population, representing every
conceivable cultural, ethnic, racial, religious, socioeconomic, and
sexual orientation background. The greatest health crisis in human
history since the Bubonic Plague was only exacerbated by the number of
refugees and displaced persons fleeing their countries for safety,
requiring a whole new set of strategies to address the widespread
trauma.

[]{#05_preface.xhtml_page_x}Whereas it had once been the case that
therapists must master the intricacies of a handful of different
theoretical orientations, with increased blending and integration of
models into more pragmatic, evidence-based practice, it is now just as
important to learn the unique and most significant aspects of various
cultural backgrounds of our clients. We are also asked to treat an
increasing variety of complaints, many of them not particularly amenable
or responsive to therapy in the past: domestic violence, physical and
sexual abuse, sexual identity issues, substance abuse, eating disorders,
personality disorders, self-harm, and dissociative disorders. Moreover,
we are being required to make a difference within ever-shorter periods
of time. Whereas long-term therapy once was measured in the span of 5 to
10 years, now it is often restricted to the same number of months, or
even weeks.

Managed care has completely restructured the ways we operate as
therapists, not only limiting the time we spend with clients but also
dictating what sorts of things we are permitted to do. In most managed
care situations, the course of treatment is strictly limited, and any
extension of the allowable number of visits must be approved, often by
personnel who may not be particularly sophisticated in their knowledge
of mental and emotional disorders. Everything is about accountability,
empirically supported, evidence-based treatments, and measured outcomes,
all within specific time parameters.

Technology has also revolutionized the field during the past few decades
and will only alter things further in years to follow. More and more
often, we are using software to communicate with managed care payers,
file our reports and invoices, create a whole new generation of required
paperwork, and aid our diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. Both
therapists and clients are using the Web as a source of instant
consultation and for delivering and receiving therapy online. Texting,
emailing, social media, apps, and instant messaging are becoming
increasingly common as favored means of communication, even as a way of
conducting sessions. We are spending more and more time in front of a
screen and less and less time engaged in face-to-face, intimate
engagement with others. This might make us more efficient, but it
certainly changes the nature of our work and our lives---and not all for
the better. In many ways, the life of a therapist is far more stressful
with so much continual accessibility and so little downtime.

### The Mysteries of Being a Therapist {#05_preface.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-5-div1-3 .sec1}

Since the first publication of this book, the boundaries between
theoretical orientations have begun to crumble further. Most of us could
once easily []{#05_preface.xhtml_page_xi}identify ourselves as a strong
follower of one particular model---as psychodynamic, existential,
feminist, cognitive behavioral, or one of a few dozen others. Now,
almost everyone is eclectic and pragmatic, or at least integrative, no
matter what is publicly espoused as a favored ideology. We might call
ourselves constructivists, behaviorists, critical theorists, or
humanists, and we might describe ourselves as psychodynamic, cognitive,
Gestalt, narrative, or relational therapists, but the reality is that we
now borrow concepts and ideas from a variety of approaches, depending on
the context, culture, and presenting complaints of our clients, not to
mention our own mood. Mindfulness-based approaches, as well as those
that specialize in attachment disorders, have been increasingly
replacing some of the more traditional options of the past.

One thing that has *not* changed much since the first publication of
this book is that the process of psychotherapy still flows in multiple
directions. This is obviously the case in the direction of influencing
the client, but it is also true with respect to affecting the personal
life of the clinician. This impact can be for better or for worse,
making the helping professions among the most spiritually fulfilling, as
well as the most emotionally draining, human endeavors. Some of us
flourish as a result of this work. We learn from those we try to help
and apply what we know and understand to ourselves. And some of us
become depleted and overwhelmed. Over time, we may become cynical,
indifferent, or stale.

We have long recognized the impact of various therapeutic ingredients in
the changes that a client will likely undergo. We know that such factors
as the therapeutic alliance, collaborative agreement of goals, reliable
and accurate feedback, empathic responding, sensitive questioning, and
constructive, diplomatic confrontation will lead to greater
self-acceptance and even to personality transformations in a client. But
what impact do these processes have on the person facilitating them? Can
the clinician be an active instigator of the therapeutic process
without, in turn, being affected by its ripple effects? Can therapists
be immune to the influence of prolonged exposure to human despair,
conflict, and suffering? Can we resist the inevitable growth and
self-awareness that come from studying other lives? Can we remain the
same after being in the presence of so many who are changing in such
dramatic and fulfilling ways? Whether we like it or not, the decision to
become a therapist is also a commitment to our own growth.

I remember when this book was first published, lo these many years ago,
the reviews were somewhat mixed, sometimes reflecting the passionate
opinions of the scholar that there are just certain subjects that we
shouldn't be talking about in a public forum. I drew some consolation
from another []{#05_preface.xhtml_page_xii}reviewer at the time who
called me the "conscience of the profession," and I've always liked the
idea that I was willing to discuss taboo topics, even if sometimes
awkwardly and inadequately. One of my earliest heroes was the little boy
in Hans Christian Andersen's tale of *The Emperor's New Clothes*, the
truth speaker who says aloud what everyone else can plainly see but will
not acknowledge. Likewise, early in my career I felt so lost because the
things that I struggled with most never seemed to come up very often in
supervision, workshops, or resources---and they were certainly never
discussed in my training. I wondered constantly why it was so rare that
therapists talked about their failures, or why we argued among ourselves
so much about whose approach was superior to all others, or why it
didn't feel safe to talk about all the ways that doing therapy was
making me a better person or why others seemed to be so limited by the
literature and research exclusively in our field when I noticed my most
influential teachers came from novelists, travel experiences, adventures
in my own life, and especially lessons learned from clients.

### Coming Attractions and Latest Innovations {#05_preface.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-5-div1-4 .sec1}

During the years since I last revised and updated this volume, there
have once again been so many changes in the ways that we operate. One
can imagine a time, in the not too distant future, in which everyone
will have a device in their home, or implanted in their head, that will
respond to any query, whether offering directions to the grocery store
or advice for dealing with mental health issues.

::: prosequote
[Person:]{.enumeratorf}"Siri, I'm depressed. What should I do?"

[Device:]{.enumeratorf}"You sound tired. *I'm* tired. It's 3 a.m. and
you should be sleeping, not talking to me."

[Person:]{.enumeratorf}"Sorry. I just keep thinking over and over about
. . ."

[Device:]{.enumeratorf}"Have you tried a warm bath and some hot milk to
help you sleep?"

[Person:]{.enumeratorf}"What I'd really like now is a real drink."

[Device:]{.enumeratorf}"Now, now, don't go there."

[Person:]{.enumeratorf}"Where?"

[Device:]{.enumeratorf}"Genetic tests have already demonstrated your
susceptibility to alcohol addiction. And then with your family history
you are further at risk."

[Person:]{.enumeratorf}"Okay, then, what's on Netflix?"
:::

[]{#05_preface.xhtml_page_xiii}This volume incorporates the latest
research and developments that have occurred during the last few years,
plus quite a bit of new material that reflects cutting edge innovations.
For instance, in the previous edition I added a new chapter on the power
of storytelling since what we do most of the time is (a) listen to
people's stories, (b) help them to collaborate on a different narrative
version that is more self-empowering, and (c) introduce stories in the
form of metaphors, disclosures, modeling, and teaching tales. Given that
the vast majority of our waking moments are captured by stories in the
form of shows, films, novels, conversations, gossip, song lyrics,
fantasies, and dreams, the brain has actually evolved as a "storied
organ" with mirror neurons that make the vicarious experience feel real.

Over the years I've become increasingly aware that therapists are not
the only ones who read this book. Quite a number of clients---past and
present---have also found it as a way to better understand and get the
most from their experiences. I'm aware that many therapists have
actually recommended the book to their clients; other clients have
received the book as a gift. And quite a few have written me over the
years asking about what they can do to get the most from their sessions.
Many others had questions about the process and wondered if certain
things going on were "normal" or appropriate or even what they might say
or do to better improve their outcomes. I had added a new chapter at the
very end that is specifically focused on how to become a more responsive
client. I would hope that therapists find it helpful as well, just as
reminders of how important it is to prepare our clients to get the most
from our work.

Finally, given the tremendous upheaval that has occurred during the last
few years, as the result of not only political tensions, economic
uncertainty, and a pandemic, but also especially advances in technology
that make telehealth so much more convenient and accessible; I've also
added a new chapter specifically about this new world order. After all,
very few professionals have ever had much systematic training related to
how to use evidence-based and empirically supported practices when
conducting sessions via screens. It has simply been assumed that because
we know how to do face-to-face therapy it is a simple matter of pivoting
to another modality, one that with all its advantages, yet still
provides us with distinctly limited nonverbal and contextual information
with which to do our jobs. Yes, we can see where our clients live, but
we can also only see half their bodies. In addition, we can't see who
else might be secretly listening to the conversations.

Like its predecessors, this expanded volume is written for all
practitioners of therapy---social workers, counselors, psychiatrists,
psychologists, psychiatric nurses, family therapists, human service
professionals, pastoral []{#05_preface.xhtml_page_xiv}counselors, and
other mental health specialists. It will be of utmost value to students
of these professions, who may be preparing for a career by learning
helping skills without fully appreciating the personal consequences of
this training. Those who have experienced therapy as clients, or who are
contemplating such an adventure, will also find the premises contained
herein of special interest.

[Chapter
1](#08_chapter1.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-1){#05_preface.xhtml_n0021}
begins with a discussion of what it means to *be* a therapist, the inner
journey with all its joys, benefits, and challenges. It explores the
personal motives for becoming a therapist, as well as the cultural,
political, and social context for the relationships we create and
maintain. This chapter also names and describes the inherent risks of
working as a therapist and presents a unified framework of the change
process as a backdrop for exploring further ideas about modeling and
influencing power in [Chapter
2](#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2){#05_preface.xhtml_n0022}.
Essentially, all systems of therapy work because they share several
elements in common: the powerful presence of a therapist; an effective
therapeutic alliance; structures for constructive risk-taking, both
within sessions and in the client's life; and constructive feedback to
limit self-defeating behavior and increase self-enhancing choices.

[Chapter
3](#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3){#05_preface.xhtml_n0023}
further explores the implications of the role of the therapist as a
model by examining the relationship between personal and professional
effectiveness. Just as professional skills help therapists improve their
personal relationships, their real-life experiences are also invaluable
tools during sessions. This is the best fringe benefit of the field:
Constant exposure to change continually stimulates us and promotes
greater personal growth, which in turn make us more powerful models.

[Chapter
4](#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4){#05_preface.xhtml_n0024}
discusses the power of storytelling to persuade and influence people,
both in therapy and everyday life. Traditions within various cultures
around the world become the context for understanding the virtually
universal employment of stories as the primary means by which to
instruct and heal others. Readers are encouraged to develop their
storytelling skills as the means by which to make therapy (and their
lives) more dynamic, interesting, and engaging.

[Chapter
5](#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5){#05_preface.xhtml_n0025}
was a new addition to the previous edition, one that further expands
discussion of how therapists are profoundly changed by their clients,
both personally and professionally. Clients can become our best teachers
and supervisors in that they help us become more responsive to their
needs (if we are flexible, adaptable, and paying close attention).

The next set of chapters explores special challenges that are part of
being a therapist. [Chapter
6](#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6){#05_preface.xhtml_n0026}
reviews many of the hardships that are part of this work, including the
strains of fatigue, one-way intimacy, and personal restraint. New
material has been added about how the practice of
[]{#05_preface.xhtml_page_xv}therapy changes as we age, for better and
worse. [Chapter
7](#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7){#05_preface.xhtml_n0027}
was another new chapter to the previous edition and focuses specifically
on therapists' struggles with imperfection, negative outcomes,
disappointments, and failures. There is an overriding theme that such
experiences provide valuable feedback that can make us both more
personally resilient and professionally effective. [Chapter
8](#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8){#05_preface.xhtml_n0028}
concentrates on so-called difficult clients, those we experience as
unusually challenging and frustrating. [Chapter
9](#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9){#05_preface.xhtml_n0029}
examines issues of burnout and boredom---not only how we can address
them but also, more importantly, how we can prevent or minimize them in
the first place.

[Chapter
10](#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10){#05_preface.xhtml_n0030},
also recently added, speaks in greater depth about the secrets of the
profession, the topics that are often considered most taboo and
forbidden: that much of the time we are flying by the seat of our pants;
that we don't often understand how and why therapy really works; that
sometimes we feel like frauds and hypocrites; that inside our heads we
are far more critical of others than we pretend; that we don't often do
what we say we do in sessions. [Chapter
11](#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11){#05_preface.xhtml_n0031}
follows this discussion by mentioning some of the lies we tell ourselves
and others, as well as the "games" that therapists sometimes play. We
also explore some of the myths and misperceptions of therapy, why
sessions are scheduled in 50-minute increments even though there is
absolutely no evidence that this "dosage" is appropriate in all cases.
Just try to think of another medical procedure or prescription in which
*everyone* is given the same exact amount of treatment regardless of
their problems, gender, culture, size, and needs.

To balance all this exploration of deep, sometimes disturbing and
uncomfortable, topics, [Chapters
12](#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12){#05_preface.xhtml_n0032},
[13](#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13){#05_preface.xhtml_n0033},
and 14 discuss ways that therapists can revitalize and take better care
of themselves, as well as to adapt to the technology that now drives
innovation. The chapters introduce practical suggestions for initiating
more personal and professional development, encouraging creative growth,
and finding deeper meaning in our lives and work. In this latest
edition, there is also increased focus in [Chapter
14](#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14){#05_preface.xhtml_n0034}
on the therapist's role and responsibility to promote issues of social
justice, human rights, and systemic changes within the community and
world at large. [Chapter
15](#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15){#05_preface.xhtml_n0035}
ends the book by speaking directly to clients about how to get the most
from their experiences. For those who are reading this book as a class
assignment, member of a book club, or recommendation by colleagues, a
collection of discussion questions are included in the Appendix that can
be used as prompts for journal writing, personal exploration, group
discussions, or conversations with others. One other new feature is the
inclusion of some of my photographs that are intended to visually
highlight themes that are explored in each chapter.

[]{#05_preface.xhtml_page_xvi}Throughout all the previous editions of
this book over the past four decades there were many incremental, often,
subtle changes in the practice of therapy that required revision.
Generally speaking, new editions may be primarily cosmetic in that they
include a few minor changes and fortified references with more recent
dates. Yet *this* version required, by far, the most updating in light
of so many transformations that have taken place within therapeutic
practice, as well as politically, socially, culturally, and
interpersonally in the wider world. There are hundreds of new sources
that have been added, reflecting new innovations in the field. Almost
every page of the book, if not each paragraph, has been reshaped,
further edited and clarified, or expanded in some way. As much as I
might celebrate the exhilaration of change, within individuals or our
culture, I sincerely hope that we might enjoy next a period of relative
stability in order to integrate all that we are learning from the
confusion, chaos, and transformations that took place during the second
decade of the twenty-first century.

I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the many professionals who
represent the various mental health specialties and theoretical
orientations who agreed to be interviewed regarding what it means to be
a therapist. Although many of these clinicians and therapist educators
wish to remain anonymous, their words speak loudly throughout the
chapters that follow. I'm also appreciative of the input and suggestions
from the hundreds of reviewers over the years who helped improve the
book in so many ways. Many of them have been using this book as a
primary and secondary text in their classes for decades and so were able
to provide deep and meaningful input into ways to make it even better.
With respect to this sixth edition, I once again am indebted to my
long-time editor, Dana Bliss, with whom I've shared so many previous
projects, all of which represent a true creative partnership that has
resulted in some of my favorite works.

[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-1-div1-5}There are many
healers among the indigenous people of the world who would find it
utterly ridiculous that anyone would ever *choose* to become a
therapist. They believe that becoming a helper or healer is a calling,
but one that is fraught with danger and burdens. After all, clients come
to us in pain and despair, hoping we will cure their suffering and leech
away their toxic energy. They have unrealistic expectations about what
is within our power to do. They are often in *very* bad moods. And they
come to talk to us, in part, because they don't feel that anyone else
has the patience or interest to listen to them.

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-005.jpg)

[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_2}And yet---and *yet*---there is no other
profession that can be as fulfilling and satisfying, no other job that
provides as many opportunities for continual learning and growth. Being
a therapist is truly a lifelong journey, one in which we accompany
others on a road toward enlightenment or peace or salvation. It is a
journey into the unknown with many obstacles along the way. Like any
journey, there are not only hardships for each pilgrim, but also many
joys. We are afforded the opportunity to live myriad different lives
through the stories we hear---and create---with our clients.

We are offered glimpses, even deep searches, into the questions that
haunt people the most. We experience a level of intimacy with our
clients that few will ever know. We are exposed to levels of drama and
emotional arousal that are at once terrifying and captivating. We get to
play detective and help solve mysteries that have plagued people
throughout their lives. We hear stories so amazing that they make
television shows, novels, and movies seem tedious and predictable by
comparison. We become companions to people who are on the verge of
making significant changes---and we are transformed as well. We go to
sleep at night knowing that, in some way, we have made a difference in
people's lives. There is almost a spiritual transcendence associated
with much of the work we do.

### Personal Motives for Being a Therapist {#08_chapter1.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-1-div1-6 .sec1}

For most of us, our journey to become therapists began not with the urge
to save the world or help people, but rather to save ourselves. Many of
the motives for becoming a therapist are unconscious and even beyond the
reach of supervision or personal therapy that may have skirted over such
unresolved or disguised issues. Frequently they involve lingering
struggles with early loss or unfulfilled narcissistic needs for
recognition and approval ([Barnett,
2007](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-12){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0036};
[Kuchuck,
2014](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-195){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0037};
[Sussman,
2007](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-301){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0038}).
Several years ago, half of therapists polled in a large-scale survey
confessed that their choice to become a therapist, as well as their
subsequent professional development, was motivated largely by the
resolution to work through their own problems ([Orlinsky & Ronnestad,
2005](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-246){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0039}).
In a more recent survey, those numbers are significantly higher,
approaching three quarters of practitioners who say a primary motive was
the desire to understand themselves more fully and feel understood by
others ([McBeath,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-220){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0040}).

[Ghent
(1999)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-97){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0041}
contended that therapists, on some level, are masochists and gluttons
for punishment. What else could possibly explain our willingness to
spend so much time exploring the darkest recesses of human
[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_3}experiences? He asked, "What other
occupation has built into it the frustration of feeling helpless,
stupid, and lost as a necessary part of the work?" (p. 236). Perhaps we
are willing to subject ourselves to the trials and tribulations of the
work in order to become more authentic and real.

Another motive for becoming a therapist relates to feeling a greater
sense of power and control, not only over others but also over yourself.
This is one reason that close to 90% of all practitioners reported they
are extremely satisfied with their chosen profession and would make the
same decision again if given the opportunity ([Norcross & VandenBos,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-243){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0042}).
One experienced clinician admitted with some reluctance that this was
what clearly drew her to the profession. "After all," she said, "if
you're always focusing on other people's problems, it's easy to wriggle
out of focusing on your own. People think I have it all together---Ha!
After a while, maybe I started to believe the same thing, even if part
of me knows that it isn't true. I guess what I'm saying is that being a
therapist means enjoying intimacy without the loss of control that
intimacy usually requires."

Besides the feeling of being in control, there are other reasons that
therapists cite for ending up in this profession. We might have been
inducted into caretaker roles in childhood and so are only doing what
came to be (or was trained to be) natural. As mentioned by the therapist
just quoted, we can enjoy deep levels of intimacy without being hurt. We
get to be voyeurs and enjoy living other lives vicariously; each week
clients come in and tell us the most amazing stories. As if that isn't
enough, we also enjoy the benefits of post-traumatic growth as a
vicarious experience, observing the ways that our clients develop so
much resilience dealing with their life challenges.

Obviously, it is fairly important to become aware of one's personal
motives for choosing a profession in which our own desires, interests,
intentions, and history would come into play. It may truly be the case
that those who are most drawn to this type of work are not necessarily
the best candidates. If we are honest, it is likely most of us would
admit that we were evenly split between wanting to help ourselves and
those who are suffering. Nevertheless, the vast majority of
practitioners believe that their own personal issues and emotional
wounds can actually *enhance* their ability to connect and understand
their clients.

Although we may have our own private, perhaps unacknowledged, reasons
for wanting to heal ourselves, there is also little doubt that most of
us are driven by a strong desire to make a difference in the lives of
others, especially those who have been most marginalized and oppressed.
It is perhaps ironic that although we are graduating more social
[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_4}workers, psychologists, counselors, family
therapists, and other mental health professionals than ever, three
quarters of all counties in the United States have an extreme shortage
of therapists; 17% of rural counties don't have a single practitioner
physically present (Zimmermant et al., 2020). Telehealth options may
address this problem, but the reality is that the underserved,
especially in the military, rural areas, and among the elderly, poverty
stricken, indigenous people, and refugees, still lack reliable care.
This may be the single greatest challenge of all for our profession:
shaping the motives of a new generation of practitioners who are
committed to helping those who have previously been ignored.

### Developing a Second Sight {#08_chapter1.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-1-div1-7 .sec1}

Central to all that we will explore about the interaction between
therapist and client is a relatively unified view of change. This
framework particularly emphasizes the power and influence of the
therapist's personality as a facilitator of growth. The force and spirit
of who the therapist is as a human being most dramatically stimulate
change, especially the personal attitudes that we display in the
relationship. Lock a person, any person, in a room alone with Sigmund
Freud, Carl Rogers, Fritz Perls, Alfred Adler, Virginia Satir, Albert
Ellis, or any other formidable personality, and several hours later the
client will come out different. It is not what the therapist *does* that
is necessarily important---whether she interprets, reflects, confronts,
disputes, or role-plays---but rather who she *is* as a person. A
therapist who is vibrant, inspirational, and charismatic; who is
sincere, loving, and nurturing; and who is wise, confident, and
self-disciplined will often have an impact through the sheer force and
power of her essence, regardless of her theoretical allegiances.

The first and foremost element of change, then, is the therapist's
*presence*---her excitement and enthusiasm and the power of her
personality. Rollo [May
(1983)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-218){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0043}
spoke of presence in a different sense: the complete experiencing of the
client's being---not of his symptoms or problems but of his essence. The
therapist enters the relationship with clarity, openness, and serenity
and comes fully prepared to encounter a soul in torment. The client
comes prepared with his or her own expectations for a mentor, a guru, a
doctor, a friend, or a wizard.

In spite of these different expectations, not only between clients and
their therapists, but also among practitioners of different backgrounds,
there has been a consistent movement toward integrating ideas, theories,
interventions, and best practices. This synthesis has been significantly
[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_5}increasing in recent years for a number of
reasons ([Kottler & Balkin,

:::

If our initial preference has been to find comfort, support, and
camaraderie within a community of like-minded colleagues who owe
allegiance to a particular favored theoretical orientation, these
boundaries have now mostly collapsed. There has always been a
significant discrepancy between what professionals say they do in
sessions compared to what actually took place. Currently the optimal
strategies from many approaches have been integrated into the repertoire
of most clinicians, regardless of the labels they ascribe to themselves
as constructivist, feminist, emotionally focused, cognitive behavioral,
existential, Adlerian, or anything else. We now know and understand that
"common factors," first mentioned by [Rosenzweig
(1936)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-271){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0047}
almost a century ago, is the currently order of the day even if there is
still debate that whether such correlational effects between identified
variables is truly meaningful and valid ([Cuijpers et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-46){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0048}).

[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_6}One thing we do know for certain is the
sometimes surprising ways that doing therapy produces an altered state
of consciousness, not only in our clients, but also in us! When things
are really moving along well, when concentration and connection are at
their peak, we may experience a kind of synesthesia, or "second sight,"
in which a state of hyperarousal leads to greater intensity of our
awareness. We are able not only to hear and see, with exquisite
sensitivity, what is going on in the session and within the other person
but also to transcend the ordinary senses to achieve greater clarity.
Many indigenous healers of the world speak of being able to develop
"second eyes" in which they can actually *see* sickness in others, as
well as smell and taste it. During those times when empathy is at its
peak, when we have entered the trance-like state of total immersion in
the relationship and concentration in the conversation, when we can
almost read the client's mind and anticipate what he will think, feel,
say, and do next, there is a similar synthesis of perception.

### The Power of Belief {#08_chapter1.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-1-div1-8 .sec1}

Some of the therapeutic elements that we take for granted in Western
mental health treatments have been part of indigenous healing traditions
for thousands of years. Regardless of the locale and cultural context,
whether in the Amazon River Basin, Himalayan Mountains, Kalahari Desert,
or a large urban center, helping usually takes the form of instilling
hope among those who feel only despair. The shaman, physician, priest,
teacher, and therapist all believe strongly that what they offer to
those who are suffering will bring comfort and even promote a cure. They
have faith in their powers to make a difference and promote change. Just
as important, they are able to persuade their clients that this is the
case.

In the context of therapy, some theorists from the past (Fish,
[1973](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-74){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0049},
[1996](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-75){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0050};
[Frank,
1993](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-82){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0051})
concluded that most therapeutic systems are designed to maximize the
client's expectations for a successful outcome. This optimism and hope,
coupled with the client's own positive beliefs, are considered to be
among the most operative common factors of all forms of therapy. We set
this active placebo in place not only through our confidence and
persuasive skills but also by the way we manage the helping environment.
Diplomas, books, dress, arrangement of the office---all feed the
client's expectations that this is a place of serenity and wisdom.

The specifics of what we do next---whether encouraging catharsis,
self-control, or self-confrontation; whether using interpretation,
reflection, or goal setting; whether focusing on thoughts, feelings, or
behavior---probably []{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_7}elicit less client
insight and action than does our belief that they will. The client has
faith in us, as professionals of integrity and knowledge, as experts
with the power to heal.

If we were merely magicians or faith healers, then what use would there
be to study the scientific and clinical aspects of our profession, much
less to train so rigorously in its methods? But of course, what we do
only *appears* to be magical because of its many dimensions. You may
hear colleagues and read authors all the time who speak with such
authority and confidence about what they do that makes a difference.
They say things so casually, such as, "*This* was the client's problem,
and *this* was the clear diagnosis, so *this* is what I did that
produced such dramatic changes." I must admit that has not been my
experience of being a therapist at all. Certainly I have my theories and
favored explanations to account for what happens and why, but if I have
learned anything about this craft over so many years of practice, it is
to appreciate and honor the complexity of what we do. I think we could
spend a lifetime studying a single case and still not ever get close to
understanding everything that happened and why. If you aren't able to
learn to love this sort of ambiguity and complexity, you will likely
find different work.

In the absence of certainty about what is best, in the presence of
someone who is needy and vulnerable, there is a compelling urge for us
to *do* something. It has become the zeitgeist of our times to embrace
evidence-based practice, empirically supported treatments, technical
eclecticism, strategic interventions, structured therapeutic tasks,
technological innovations, behavioral management, and other forms of
helping that emphasize technique, especially those that are purported to
work quickly and efficiently. In so many ways, we must adapt our style
and methods according to the client's needs, preferences, background,
and clinical situation. Lost in the rush toward technical innovation are
the human dimensions of the relationships between people. After all, it
is the *client's perception* of the quality of the alliance that best
predicts positive outcomes ([Constantino et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-40){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0052};
[Kottler & Balkin,
2017](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-174){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0053}).

Despite our best efforts to research the phenomenon of the therapeutic
relationship, to isolate operative ingredients, the fact remains that
something magical and wonderful does take place when we create a certain
kind of alliance with clients. This healing force is not unique to our
profession; doctors, teachers, lawyers, and even hairdressers, and
bartenders offer some degree of comfort and aid in their relationships
with clients---apart from the contracted services they provide. This
healing relationship between people goes beyond mere catharsis: Human
beings have an intense craving, often unfulfilled, to be understood by
someone []{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_8}else. Even Carl Rogers, the founder
of humanistic, person-centered, relational psychotherapy never really
felt understood during his lifetime ([Kirschenbaum,
2009](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-151){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0054}).

### Cultural, Social, and Political Contexts {#08_chapter1.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-1-div1-9 .sec1}

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-006.jpg)

In many cases, therapeutic responses are also greatly influenced by the
cultural, social, and political context of the client and therapist. It
is one of the sad realities and significant limitations of all research
in psychology in general, and therapy in particular, that the vast
majority of research on human behavior, on which our theories are built,
were based on skewed, terribly biased samples. It turns out that 96% of
all such studies were conducted with Western populations and 70% with
undergraduate college students ([Henrich,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-123){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0055}).
Stop for a moment and consider just how peculiar this is when we compare
the prevalent values of these groups compared to cultures in the rest of
the world. Within the West we are highly individualistic, self-obsessed,
nonconformist, analytic, and vulnerable to guilt when we stray from
sanctioned norms. We value efficiency, personal control, maximum
choices, and free will. And yet (it is hoped) a sizable number of our
clients, especially those from indigenous, Asian, African, and Latino
cultures, are instead more prone to shame rather than guilt for
violating []{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_9}social norms. In addition, they
think more about their social roles than individual identities and were
brought up in collectivist communities in which they lived with extended
families. Rather than seeing themselves as unique, they instead view
themselves as part of a social network. In addition, the whole notion of
having a private conversation about personal problems with a perfect
stranger may seem utterly ridiculous.

Most therapeutic approaches are no longer applied in universal ways but
are adapted according to the values and needs of those from varied
socioeconomic, ethnic, racial, and religious backgrounds and of a range
of gender and sexual identities. The goal of such clinical flexibility
is for practitioners not only to customize therapy to fit the particular
needs of an increasingly diverse client population but also to confront
their own prejudices and stereotypes. If there's one thing that has
consistently gotten me in trouble over the years it was related to
making assumptions about students, supervisees, and clients based on
what I considered my vast experience (and arrogance). I remember
teaching in New Zealand when I invited participants to do their standard
introductions by sharing their names and something significant about
themselves. "I'm Harry," one student began, "I work in a local agency
and someday want to have my own private practice."

As we went around the circle, a male student I identified as Maori, the
indigenous people of the country, started rambling (to my way of
thinking), talking about ancient history when his ancestors first
traveled across the ocean to settle the country. He talked about the
geographic landmarks near his community but still mentioned nothing
about his own background---or even his name! After about 10 minutes of
this recitation (the other students only talked for a minute or two), I
interrupted him to ask about more "relevant" details (like his name!). I
heard a gasp in the room, and I could see the guy was extremely
offended. In fact, he crossed his arms, scooted his chair back, and
refused to say another word. I was both totally confused and at a loss:
Why should this person, just because he was Maori, be permitted to speak
so much longer than everyone else? And why wouldn't he play by the rules
and just tell us his name and aspirations?

As you might appreciate, but I totally missed at the time, within his
culture this was the appropriate way to identify himself when requested,
not by *personal identity* but rather by revealing the mountain, river,
and canoe of his particular tribe. Only much later would he reveal his
own name---but likely not to me since he felt humiliated and
disrespected when I cut him off. I'd like to say I learned my lesson,
but as I mentioned, I continue to find myself in difficulty when I make
assumptions about others based on vast previous experience that is still
biased and limited.

[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_10}I realize that the preceding cautions and
statements about cultural diversity are so commonly and obligatorily
included in every book that they have sometimes lost all meaning. It has
become so politically correct to espouse the standard party line
regarding diversity issues that we may fail to appreciate the real
depth, complexity, and influence of the challenges we face on countless
different levels. We are not supposed to make sweeping generalizations
about groups of people, but the reality is that every practitioner
understands that there are certain similarities in the ways that
particular people of certain backgrounds react in therapy.

A new client walks in your door, perhaps a 54-year-old Vietnamese female
with a strong accent, shy smile, and averted eye contact; maybe an
African American teenager wearing sunglasses (it is nighttime) and
earphones attached to a mobile device; or a guy in a tailored suit with
a Rolex watch and perfectly coifed silver-gray hair. It is difficult, if
not impossible, to avoid forming immediate impressions. Some of these
prejudgments are based on prior experiences with clients who appear to
be similar; some are based on far more personal influences, such as the
values within our own families of origin or perhaps our own ethnicity.

There is a myth operating that therapeutic approaches or ingredients are
essentially the same; you just fine-tune or adjust them a little for
so-called diverse groups. A Vietnamese immigrant walks in? Expect
deference and try to work within a family context. A young Black man
from the inner city comes in? Expect a little resistance and hostility,
especially to a White therapist. The Dude with the polished wingtips who
looks like a chief executive officer? Expect power and control struggles
because of his narcissism and sense of entitlement. But these minor
concessions to diversity (and that's what they are---minor, token
efforts) only scratch the surface. The greater truth is that we would
sometimes do better by throwing our theories out the window and meeting
each person not just as a representative of his or her cultural group
but as a completely unique individual with an assortment of cultural
identities that include far more than ethnicity, race, and religion.

I was working with an older Vietnamese woman (similar to the one
mentioned previously) who was very self-conscious about her English
fluency. In fact, it was difficult for me to understand her, and I
suspect a good part of our communication consisted of smiles and shrugs.
This left me little choice but to abandon the usual ways I might work
and to experiment with alternative methods that were less reliant on
verbalization.

We struggled through the first few sessions as the woman's story
emerged. She was a recent immigrant and a survivor of the Vietnam War
[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_11}(American War as it is referred to in
Vietnam) while a child. She was now the eldest woman in her household,
which meant that she was responsible for everyone else, even though she
was to remain obedient to the eldest male, who happened to be her son.
There were clear lines of authority based on gender and age, and this
was creating some problems both within the family and for her own dreams
for a career.

The whole concept of traditional therapy was an anathema to her. Here I
was, an older male authority figure, trying to negotiate a relationship
in which she was the most important partner in the process. Given her
own cultural traditions, we were doomed to frustration unless I could
find a way to meet her on terms that were mutually acceptable. Once we
found this common ground, whatever I learned had little applicability to
my next client---an angry African American woman who felt that the
system I represented was giving her a hard time. Her mistrust of me, as
an agent of the oppressors, became the most important issue for us to
deal with in our relationship before anything else constructive could
occur.

We win a few, we lose a few---quite literally. But whatever we do, it is
hardly business as usual in the sense that we can never truly expect to
help those who are most needy until we learn to customize and adapt
everything we do, regardless of our attraction to a favored model. This
is both humbling and endlessly fascinating, making it virtually
impossible for us to reach a place where we can *ever* be certain about
the therapeutic path we are taking.

In addition, the increasing reality for many minority and economically
disadvantaged people is that they are locked out of the system and have
little access to mental health services no matter how desperate they
might be. One psychiatry professor lamented that so many of his students
end up in private practice serving the wealthy and "worried well,"
charging exorbitant fees for those who treat the sessions as a status
symbol or hobby ([Dembosky,
2016](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-52){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0056}).
Private practice is certainly a viable, legitimate, and honorable way to
make a living, but we also have a responsibility to help those who would
otherwise never receive assistance. That's why most practitioners not
only adjust their thinking, but also their fee structure with each
client.

Minority and working-class clients are often those who are most out of
luck. In one study that investigated therapists' willingness to take on
new clients, [Kugelmass
(2016)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-196){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0057}
had people call for appointments using either a name that might be
associated with a Black woman (LaToya Johnson) or a name that might
imply a White woman (Amy Roberts). The callers, who were pretending to
be prospective clients, also used scripts that signaled
[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_12}they were working class or else more
affluent. Perhaps it isn't all that surprising that that the
upper-middle-class Whites were accepted as clients twice as often as the
Black or working-class individuals. It was especially surprising
considering that they all had the identical health insurance, so there
was no financial advantage to serve one person over another. It was
plain and simple that this was another example of racial and class
discrimination by those of us who are supposed to advocate for the most
needy and oppressed.

### Client Risk-Taking in the Change Process {#08_chapter1.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-1-div1-10 .sec1}

No matter which approach we adopt, and no matter what background our
clients come from, we still operate in such a way that it motivates
people to take constructive risks in their lives. When a person gives
attention to unresolved issues of the past, she often must work through
resistance and apprehensions. To dismantle rigid defenses, interpret
unconscious motives, or reflect on unexplored feelings we must sometimes
push the client to the brink of her patience and endurance. She must
confront parts of herself that have been deeply buried, and she must
risk the consequences of relinquishing coping strategies that have
worked fairly well until this point, even with their side effects and
collateral damage. There is a risk (or perhaps even a certainty) that
some destabilization will occur. In order to attain real growth, the
client must often be willing to experience intense confusion,
disorientation, and discomfort. She leaves behind an obsolete image of
herself, one that was once comfortable and familiar, and she risks not
liking the person she will become. She will lose a part of herself that
can never be recovered. She risks all this for the possibility of a
better existence, and all she has to go on is the therapist's word.

When the client seeks to modify specific goals and behaviors, the risks
are even more evident. To change any single aspect of one's behavior is
to set in motion a chain reaction of subsequent aftershocks. One woman
had been procrastinating for years in therapy, reluctant to take any
action. As is usually the case, many of her difficulties were
interconnected---the dead-end job, the desire to move away from her
parents, her relationships with men, and the desire to lose weight. To
make a change in any one of these areas would mean she would risk having
everything else possibly fall apart. The idea of losing even 15 pounds
was frightening to her because it would mean that she would be more
attractive, feel more confident, have demonstrated the capacity for
self-control, and have proven the power []{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_13}to
change. She just could not face the consequences of changing any part of
her life because that would mean that every other part might have to
change as well. It was much easier to come to therapy each week and
please her therapist with good intentions, a cooperative attitude, and a
wonderful capacity for generating insights that would not necessarily
lead to actual alterations in her thinking and behavior.

If we were truly open and honest in our declarations of informed
consent, they would cover far more than confidentiality, record-keeping,
and standards of care. Among the potential dangers and risks that are
rarely mentioned in the beginning might include some of the following:

:::

The therapist's job is to do everything in her power not only to promote
self-understanding but also to encourage experimentation. The client
must not only reflect but also act decisively. This task is accomplished
through both the quality of the therapist's interventions, designed to
reduce the perceived threat and increase the willingness to experiment,
and the genuine commitment to risk-taking that the therapist makes in
her own life. A professional who believes in the value of risk-taking is
one who has had varied experiences in taking calculated chances when the
need arises. It is hoped this courage, as it is modeled in the sessions,
begets courage in the client.

### []{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_14}Risks of the Therapist {#08_chapter1.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-1-div1-11 .sec1}

Doing therapy is risky work indeed. We sit in a room all day long with
people who spill out the most disturbing, horrifying, tragic stories
imaginable. They tell us of their abuse and suffering, their sense of
hopelessness. A few have been referred to us in the first place because
they are so toxic nobody else can deal with them. They may deliberately
deceive or manipulate us or at least provide very sketchy and misleading
details. Over time, many practitioners become desensitized to human
emotion and experience an acute overdose of feeling; they learn to keep
boundaries firmly in place and turn off their emotions. Even when we
maintain such a guarded and cautious stance, there are times when
contact with our clients penetrates us deeply---sometimes in ways we
neither acknowledge nor understand.

I was cross-country skiing in the woods with my wife. The sun was
blazing, reflecting off the snow. We were breathing hard, enjoying the
scenery and the synchronized movement of our bodies. It was an
absolutely peaceful and spectacular day, requiring continual
concentration to stay upright, balanced, moving along the trail. Quite
suddenly, without any warning, I abruptly stopped in my tracks and
started sobbing. Needless to say, my wife was a little surprised.

She asked me what was wrong, especially considering that a few moments
earlier I had been feeling such joy. I finally blurted out the question,
"Are you going to leave me?" She looked at me as if I were a raving
lunatic and replied, "Of course not!" She reassured me with a hug and
tried to find out what was going on. I explained that lately in my
practice a number of female clients had been working on issues of
freedom and independence. They felt trapped in their marriages and
resented their husbands' needs for approval and dominance. After years
of struggle with and resistance from their husbands, they had chosen
divorce as the only solution for liberation. Again and again, I heard
their words ringing in my ears: "Why is he so oblivious to what I want
and what I feel? He thinks things are so great between us just because
he finds me home at night. When he finally realizes how serious I am
about making changes, it will be too late. He has no idea how bad things
are, and he doesn't want to know."

For weeks, the effect of hearing these words in several different keys
had been accumulating, and it had begun eating away at my own illusions
of security. Was I, like the partners of my clients, on the verge of
divorce while blissfully denying my problems---while enjoying an
afternoon in the woods? Fortunately, my concern was unnecessary, but I
felt shell-shocked from the close proximity to other people's
battlefields. One benefit of such []{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_15}fears is
that they helped me to become even more determined to work on honest
communication in my marriage and friendships.

Physicians take careful steps to protect themselves from the infection,
disease, and the suffering of their patients. Rubber gloves, surgical
masks, face shields, and probing stainless steel instruments keep germs
at arm's length. But sometimes there is a seepage of pain. For some
practicing physicians, all barriers between themselves and their
patients become eroded because they let themselves feel too much when
their hands explore inside the visceral organs of their patients. Yet
because they are admonished against showing any signs of "weakness"
associated with emotional expression, they retreat into the stairwells
or bathroom stalls to cry in private. More and more often, they now hide
behind computer screens or mobile devices while they enter data.

Throughout the process of therapy, the relationship is our main
instrument of treatment. Although we try to insulate ourselves, and we
are successful in doing so most of the time, leaks inevitably occur. As
our warmth, caring, and power radiate toward the client, facilitating
the kind of trust that will lead to more open exploration and
constructive risk-taking, so, too, do we experience intimacy,
discomfort, and countertransference reactions that permanently alter our
perceptions and internal structure. The more clients talk about subjects
that touch on our own unresolved issues, the more insecure and uneasy we
may feel about ourselves.

To take on a client, *any* client, is to make a tremendous commitment to
that person, which in some cases could last weeks, months, or even
years. For better or worse, no matter how the client behaves, we feel an
obligation to be available, understanding, and compassionate. From the
moment a client settles himself in the chair (or in front of a screen)
for the first time, we take a deep breath, knowing that what is about to
occur is the beginning of a new adventure. We will share moments of
special closeness and others of great hardship. The client may, at
times, worship us, scorn us, abuse us, ignore us, play with us, and want
to devour us. And through it all, regardless of what is going on in our
own life---sickness, births, deaths, joys, disappointments---we must be
there for the client, always present.

If we ever really considered the possible risks in getting involved with
a client, we would not do so for any price. Never mind that we will
catch their colds and flu---what about their pessimism, negativity, and
annoying symptoms? One just cannot see clients week after week, listen
to their stories, and dry their tears without being profoundly affected
by the experience. There are risks for us that we will not recognize
until years later. Images stay with us until the grave. Words creep back
to haunt us. Those silent screams remain deafening.

[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_16}Even now, this moment, as I write these
words, I see the blur of faces crossing the page. I hear the sobs of a
father whose teenage son died in his arms. I see the cascade of hair
that hides the face of a young woman who spent a significant part of
every one of our sessions crying copiously. I feel the shudder of
revulsion when a man confessed that he enjoyed exposing himself to
little girls. I relive the story of a woman whose family was murdered in
front of her. I feel the imprint on my lap of a 3-year-old girl I held
just before telling her that she was an orphan after her home collapsed
during an earthquake. I recall conversations with newly homeless people
right after a hurricane---they had lost everything and were looking to
me for hope and guidance in face of such crushing despair. I feel the
helplessness, horror, and frustration flooding me all over again. Some
of these were people I saw more than a decade or two ago, yet they still
inhabit my heart and mind. They will be with me until my last breath.

What do we do with the stories we hear? How do we hold them? How do we
live with them? The answer, in part, is with difficulty.

### Therapist Vulnerability {#08_chapter1.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-1-div1-12 .sec1}

Watching a therapist enter his or her office with nothing but a purse,
backpack, or briefcase, one would never imagine that he or she is
preparing to enter into mortal combat. Things appear quite civilized and
controlled on the surface, what with the polite greetings and all. But
once the action starts, the sparks that fly may leave third-degree
burns. In a small room, there is nowhere to seek shelter. The therapist
uses only his naked self (figuratively, of course) as the instrument of
treatment, a condition that requires tremendous self-control and induces
considerable vulnerability. To meet the client in a therapeutic
encounter, we must leave behind some of our armor and defenses. We must
go out from our centeredness as far as we dare. In our effort to be open
and receptive, to participate with the client in this special
relationship, to venture forth as far as we are able, we risk losing our
own sense of self along the way.

Great racking sobs could be heard through the door, not an unusual
occurrence in a mental health clinic, except that the client had left 5
minutes earlier. Only the therapist remained---alone, behind the closed
door. Tears streamed down his face. He was huddled in a ball on the
floor. The therapist had been conducting a particularly intense session
with a man who was mourning the loss of his unborn son. As he was
helping the client accept the miscarriage and find hope in the future,
the therapist realized at some point that he was no longer speaking to
the client but to himself. His own
[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_17}girlfriend had unceremoniously decided, on
ending their relationship, to abort their baby. The therapist had long
ago assumed he'd worked through his loss, pain, and disappointment. Yet
it all came tumbling forth again as his client struggled with a similar
issue. Against all restraint, all objectivity, all desire to help the
client, he lost the separateness between himself and the other.

It would be senseless to complain about the side effects that stem from
personal involvement. After all, as mentioned previously, many of us
entered this profession in the first place because of an interest in
resolving our own issues along the path of helping others. I am
reluctant to admit that although I did, and do, feel a commitment toward
altruism, a significant part of my motivation to become a therapist came
from my need to make sense of the world, to stave off my fear of
mediocrity, to find acceptance, to satisfy my desire for control, to win
approval and gratitude. I ask myself why I care so much about writing
these words, why I continue to write books, and I laugh at the pat yet
incomplete response: because I have something to say that others might
find useful. But that is hardly the whole truth. I also desperately want
to be liked and appreciated, and I thrive on external validation.
Finally, I want to feel good enough.

During this last phase of my career in semi-retirement, the last stage
of my life, and likely the final edition of this book, more than ever I
struggle for validation, that something I did or said really matters. I
often feel invisible these days, like the world has passed me by and no
longer finds me relevant. I have always defined myself and the value of
my life in terms of the good that I've accomplished that day, the people
I've helped, and the things I've learned. This wasn't so much (or only)
about personal ambition as much as valuing my worth as a reflection of
the suffering I helped alleviate. But with far more time on my hands,
and not enough to do to keep me occupied, I struggle more than ever to
feel worthy and create meaning in my daily life. I remember interviewing
a retired colleague for a book ([Kottler & Carlson,
2016](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-186){#08_chapter1.xhtml_n0058})
about aging therapists, and she told me that after leaving her
professorship she felt invisible. She had been at a social gathering
when someone asked her, "Who did you used to be?"

When a client comes in and struggles with these very themes (because I
am looking for them, I see them everywhere), I rejoice in the
opportunity to do some more work on myself. There are times, however,
when I lose perspective and become so intertwined in the relationship
that I must take a few steps out of range in order to untangle my own
vulnerabilities from those of my clients. Sometimes, when I am
counseling, lecturing, or supervising, I stop for a moment to consider
whom I am really speaking to---more than a few times I must admit that
it is to myself.

[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_18}The therapist is vulnerable not only to
the loss of self but also threats to her self-esteem. We may profess to
be neutral and to have no vested interest in outcomes, but we care quite
a bit about how things turn out. It is impossible to care deeply for
people without caring about what they do. When clients are demanding and
critical, dissatisfied with their lack of progress, or blaming us for
not being a miracle worker, we feel disappointed, if not inadequate.
When clients do not improve, or get worse, we not only feel their pain
but also take it personally that they are not cooperating with our
therapeutic efforts. This is in spite of our attempts to remember the
golden words, "We do our part; the client must do his" or "It is
ultimately up to the client to change." All of this might very well be
true, but we have a lot at stake as well. We can act unconcerned when a
client does not improve, shrug our shoulders and go about our business,
tell ourselves we are doing all we can, then head for the beach. But
others will make decisions about our competence and attack our
credibility even if we do not.

The client's family members, for example, having been in the unenviable
position of having to live with the client while we only see her an hour
per week, cannot afford much patience. It is easy for us to tell them,
"Give it time. This has taken a long time to develop into a problem, and
it will take a while to resolve." They will thank us politely as they
mutter under their breaths, "This guy doesn't know what he's doing."
Then they will express their opinions to all who will listen,
exasperated and exhausted. Considering that everyone knows a therapist
whom he or she likes, the family's confidence will be further undermined
by friends who suggest that they consult someone else who *really* knows
what she is doing.

And let's not pretend that it doesn't hurt when a client abruptly quits
treatment with the following farewell: "Gee, I know you've tried so hard
to help me. And I agree it's probably all my fault. But since I've been
seeing you, I've only gotten worse. You asked me to be patient, and I
think I have been, but this doesn't seem to help. My cousin is seeing
another therapist who was recommended to me. I'm going to be switching
to her. Thanks for all you've done." Now not only will the other
therapist find out how ineffective you have been (because she may not
assume that the lack of progress was the client's fault), but soon the
referral source will call wanting to know how things are going. You can
make up some excuse about primitive defenses or resistance that you may
even believe, and maybe the referral source will buy it, but deep, deep
inside is a quiet little voice that will whisper, "You blew it." If such
an episode occurs in the same week in which you have a few too many
cancellations, you are well on our way to a major bout of self-doubt.

[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_19}Of course that is only half the picture (I
hope much less than half). Just as we are vulnerable to disappointment
because we care so much, we are also open to the incredible joy we
experience being witnesses, if not partners, to the amazing things our
clients accomplish in such a short time. Every single day of our working
lives we hear incredible tales of courage and accomplishment,
breakthroughs that could only have occurred because of our support and
intervention.

### The Experience of *Being* a Therapist {#08_chapter1.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-1-div1-13 .sec1}

The therapist's journey is filled with mystery and challenges. It
follows a developmental pattern that usually progresses through several
stages, each of which provides its own challenges and opportunities. For
the beginner, one of the initial tasks involves learning how to
metabolize everything we take in without undue stress and hardship. For
the veteran, there are other challenges that come with the territory of
sometimes believing you've seen it all and done it all before. We thus
hover at times between periods of excruciating boredom in sessions and
instances when things feel so exciting and overwhelming we can barely
catch our breath.

We act as models of courage and as adventurers, blazing trails that
might inspire others to follow us into the unknown. One therapist, Fran,
shared her fascination with the inner experience of being a therapist:
"I love what it feels like, how it changes us, how it penetrates us. I
see the job, or the profession, or the calling, as just being this
amazing gift for those of us who are privileged enough to do this work
because of these gems and things that we learn."

Fran laughs, remembering what it was like trying to describe to her
children what it is she does for work. It really is quite amazing when
you think about it. I have had a number of conversations with healers in
other cultures, trying to explain what it is that I do in my own work. I
recall one shaman from the Bushmen of the Kalahari who literally fell
off the rock he was sitting on, laughing hysterically, when I told him
how I work by listening to clients, helping them sort things out and
talking about what is most bothersome. The shaman called over others
from his village, yelling out, "Come on over here! You gotta hear what
this White dude shaman character says" (that's a rough translation).
Once assembled with his friends, he urged me to repeat what I do in
therapy. He was absolutely dumbfounded that I didn't bring together the
whole community as witnesses to the healing. There was no dancing,
shaking, chanting, or drumming in my description of psychotherapy. There
was no calling to the spirits. There was
[]{#08_chapter1.xhtml_page_20}no fire built for the healing ceremony
(although I thought about telling him about a kid who once lit a fire in
the wastebasket of my waiting room). Again the shaman grabbed his belly
and everyone laughed at my expense. Finally, when he caught his breath,
he asked me if I had ever helped anyone with just this talk that we do.
It gets you thinking, doesn't it?

I have never really trusted anyone who claims to understand how therapy
works. I think it is far too complex. What the client brings to us in a
session is so overwhelming and so full of content and feeling that we
can't hold it all. So we have to find ways to live with that---to live
with all this uncertainty, all this mystery, all this ambiguity. At the
same time, our clients are demanding answers and solutions. Sometimes
they even have the audacity to ask after a first meeting, "So, now that
you've heard about what's bothering me, can you fix it?"

"You mean right *now*?" you say in astonishment.

"Well, okay then, I can come back one more time if you really think that
is necessary."

Part of the job of inducting someone into the role of being a good
client is teaching the individual a little bit of patience as well as
how to work the process. But all the while we're saying this to our
clients, we're talking to ourselves, too, about how to live with the
ambiguity, complexity, uncertainty, and confusion of our own lives,
trying to make sense of what it is that we do.

[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-div1-14}As we are all
well aware, growth occurs spontaneously without professional help. Many
theories offer explanations of this phenomenon. Most people who are
struggling eventually recover on their own; it just usually takes longer
than if they sought assistance. Psychological growth may be part of our
genetically programmed survival instinct or may be reinforced by the
environment and society. People are transformed by recovery from trauma
or adversity or even by travel experiences. There are developmental,
phenomenological, sociobiological, behavioral, and countless other
explanations for spontaneous, unstructured change processes. To
complicate matters further, the interpersonal influence that operates in
therapy moves in *both* directions. Just as the therapist attempts to do
everything in his power to change clients, so, too, do clients seek to
control the therapist for their own purposes. They do this for a number
of reasons:

::: prosequote
[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-item1-19}[•]{.enumerator}To
persuade us to take sides in their struggles with others and agree that
they are right and others are wrong

[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-item1-20}[•]{.enumerator}To
convince us that we should be more like them, thereby confirming that
they don't have to change

[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-item1-21}[•]{.enumerator}To
win our love and approval, providing the sort of validation that they

[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-item1-22}[•]{.enumerator}To
affirm that they are more important than all other clients and that we

manipulate us into meeting their needs or hidden agendas, often in the
form of affirming their own sense of power

[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-item1-24}[•]{.enumerator}To
work through unresolved transference relationships by knocking us off
our pedestals
:::

During a first encounter with a new client there is most often a
discussion of expectations regarding what will occur. This is when we
explain the process and the roles, perhaps presenting a tentative game
plan based on the initial complaints. Most clients have very definite
preferences for what they hope will happen---how long the sessions might
last, how much they get to talk, whether they agree to do homework, even
the particular approach that is employed. They even have stated
preferences regarding their therapist's characteristics, including
personality, religion, gender, race, sexual orientation, physical
appearance, and personality. They likely also have strong opinions about
what they believe might be most helpful, whether medication, book
recommendations, gentle support, or vigorous debates. They have in mind
someone who is a permissive parent, wise doctor, expert teacher,
creative muse, or hard-driving coach. Because many of these preferences
are at odds with our own plans and abilities, there is intrinsic
conflict during these negotiations: Each partner in this process is
vigorously trying to convince the other one to accept their point of
view. How effectively we manage this power struggle sets the stage for
everything else that will follow.

### Perceptions, Expectations, and Image Management {#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-div1-15 .sec1}

From the very first moment of interaction, both client and therapist are
working hard to create a favorable impression. If the therapist is
unable to convey sufficient confidence and an aura of expertise, it is
unlikely the client will stick around. After all, the single most
important goal of a first session is to get the client to return;
otherwise, not much else will ever be accomplished. That is why we
design our offices (or screen views) with items that broadcast our
achievements and wisdom, including impressive volumes on bookshelves
with medical-sounding titles, diplomas and certificates on the wall, and
a space that exudes privacy and comfort. We present ourselves as figures
of warmth, safety, and dependability. Of course, all the while we are
casually nodding our heads in acknowledgment, saying things like,
"That's very interesting," and "I see," there is a voice inside our
heads screaming, "I []{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_23}have no earthly idea
what this person is talking about, or what the heck I'm supposed to do
to fix this!"

Our clients, of course, have a very different agenda in mind. They are
wondering whether they've chosen the optimal option for their problems.
They may be feeling suspicious, even cynical and skeptical, whether
these sessions will really make much of a difference. They want to make
certain that their therapist is truly on their side, that they won't be
criticized, shamed, or humiliated. They desperately want to persuade
this professional that whatever is going on is not really their fault,
that they can be forgiven for their sins, that this process won't hurt
very much or take very long.

There is thus a two-way interchange of social influence that exists
between client and therapist in which we are each trying to persuade the
other to take a particular position or adopt a favored viewpoint. At the
same time that we are working to influence our clients to think, react,
or act in some way, they are unconsciously or deliberately fighting for
control of the sessions. In classical psychodynamic terms, the client
attempts to act out the transference and mold the therapist into someone
else. Each participant in this process may even begin to imitate the
speech and behavioral patterns of the other.

Of course, the nature of interpersonal influence and reciprocal power
has changed in the last few decades. We therapists are no longer
regarded with the same unwavering respect and deference as we used to be
when we were treated as gurus and godlings. Sure, we still have the
power to inspire awe in some clients who come to us, but not
all---especially those who are court ordered or involuntarily referred.

Those clients who do come of their own free will are more informed by
education, media, online research, self-help books, chat rooms, and talk
shows; they are empowered to act as their own self-healers and want
therapists to serve in the role of consultants or coaches, available as
needed via text or messaging. Although this attitude fits well within
the scope of some practitioners, such overexposure can ruin the mystery
behind what we do. Therapists are no longer universally regarded as
authoritative experts, but rather as partners in the democratization of
therapy. This is not altogether a bad thing, but it does present some
additional challenges in a profession where our maximum influence comes,
in part, from our stature in others' eyes.

Just as in many other contexts, power can be wielded benevolently or can
become an instrument of oppression, dominance, and exploitation ([Fors,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-80){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0059}).
No matter how much we might deny or underplay our role as authority
figures, we are usually perceived as privileged as a function of our
education, knowledge, and positioning. This can be particularly
[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_24}problematic when navigating relational
dynamics with those who have been marginalized, demeaned, or oppressed,
especially if gender, racial, and equality disparity issues are not
discussed explicitly in the relationship ([Budge & Moradi,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-29){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0060}).
More than almost anything else that we do during this initial stage of
image and expectation management, it is imperative that we openly and
honestly talk about privilege and power, as well as their consequences
as they play out during sessions when clients might be deferential or
unwilling to express their genuine reactions. From the outset we want to
demonstrate in our own behavior and conduct a willingness to be direct
and honest to encourage such behavior in others.

### Therapists as Professional Models {#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-div1-16 .sec1}

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-007.jpg)

[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_25}Long ago, Socrates and other Greek
philosophers advocated the importance of teaching by personal example.
The credo of the times was represented by the proclamation that "the
unexamined life is not worth living," and there has never been a clearer
statement about the critical nature of sages, teachers, and healers
demonstrating in their own lives a commitment to self-awareness, growth,
and learning. Sigmund Freud mentioned this in the context of
identification processes, while Alfred Adler more explicitly talked
about "social interest" as a guiding force in the way therapists must
become advocates for the disenfranchised. He viewed our role in the
context of our sense of community and kinship with others.

It was the social learning theorist Albert Bandura who even more
directly talked about how people are so strongly influenced by exposure
to other, more powerful individuals who fostered observational learning
via their perception as nurturing, expert figures. Thus one main force
of childhood is the overpowering urge to grow up and be just like mommy
or daddy, sister, Wonder Woman, Spiderman, a favorite teacher, or the
kid down the block. Even in adulthood, models in the media continue to
exert a powerful influence on people's behavior, which is why
advertisers hire famous celebrities, sports figures, and actors to sell
their products even though it is obvious they have no special expertise.

Even after we learn to stop idolizing our heroes and parents and to
prize new values of independence and self-sufficiency, models continue
to exert a powerful influence on the way we dress, speak, feel, and
think. In fact, the mentor system is the core of most therapist
education: Teachers, advisers, supervisors, authors, and colleagues
shape who we are and the way we practice our craft. I recall all too
vividly reading books like this as a student and beginner in the field,
hoping and wishing with all my heart that someday I would grow up and
become someone comparably competent, knowledgeable, and wise.

For many therapists, the first decade of our professional lives is spent
imitating the master clinicians we admire the most. We generally do this
long before we ever consider what we really believe in our own minds and
hearts. Yet it is interesting how even as we mature in our development,
we still seem to have a strong tendency toward idealizing our heroes and
heroines, as evidenced by the long lines at conferences to obtain
autographs from luminaries in the field. If you don't think this is a
bit strange, can you imagine doctors, accountants, or engineers waiting
at a professional gathering for someone prominent in their field to
autograph their books (or spreadsheets)?

In the early stages of the identification process, we idealize the model
and make that person appear even larger than life. Who among us cannot
[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_26}remember the ways we idealized, if not
worshipped, a teacher, mentor, author, or supervisor who inspired us
like no other? Under such circumstances, this model had extraordinary
influence in our lives, in terms of not only our professional
development but also our personal lives. There is also a dark side to
the modeling phenomenon. (Isn't there always?) Models provide lots of
reinforcement to those who express an interest in becoming just like
them, perpetuating miniature selves who go out into the world and preach
the True Word and convert others to the cause. If you have ever attended
a counseling or psychotherapist conference, then you can easily
recognize the various schools of thought, just like schools of fish,
swimming in synchrony. There is no doubt that there is comfort in such
company, being one of many who have found the one true path to
enlightenment. Over time, of course, as we are exposed to alternative
models, contradictory ideas, additional research, new and different
colleagues, or more demanding clients, we are forced to develop greater
flexibility and exposure to greater diversity.

It is so easy to become seduced by the power and influence of charisma,
narcissism, and overconfidence, as we have witnessed in the political
arena in which unscrupulous, corrupt officials exploit others for their
own benefit and to bolster fragile egos. It is an enticing attraction
indeed to communicate the message, "Look how smart, rich, successful,
and capable I am (or appear to be). Follow my lead and you can become
(almost) as satisfied yourself."

Power and interpersonal influence may be the tools we use to help
promote constructive change in others but they also become a dangerous
form of manipulation. Narcissism pervades our domain. Therapists,
teachers, and other professional models, such as actors, politicians,
and athletes, thrive on gratitude and accolades from fans and disciples.
You would only have to attend any workshop or conference to see the ways
that otherwise powerful professionals in their own right pay homage to
the "rock stars," who are treated with reverence. The only difference is
that public figures receive financial compensation equal to their aura.
Therapists are limited to the ceiling established by their hourly rates
or their salaries. The balance of payment is usually received in the
intangible benefits that accrue from hero worship.

### When Therapists Can't or Don't Practice What They Preach {#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-div1-17 .sec1}

It is galling to hear "crazy shrink" stories in which a therapist is
portrayed in the media or in social conversations as being more
disturbed than any []{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_27}of his or her clients.
This isn't helped by the occassional experience of encountering
colleagues who, let us say, are rather eccentric, if not downright
strange, in the way they conduct their lives. They may be rude or lazy
or sometimes just clueless about how they are perceived by others.

In an article about how emotionally unstable, narcissistic, and wounded
many therapists are, one woman was quoted by [Maeder
(1989)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-208){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0061}
as saying that every time she goes to a party, invariably the most
foolish, embarrassing, and crazy person in attendance is a therapist. As
further evidence for his arguments, Maeder quoted a president of the
American Academy of Psychotherapists addressing the members of his own
organization: "When I first visited a national psychiatric convention,
in 1943, I was dismayed to find the greatest collection of oddballs,
Christ beards, and psychotics that I had ever seen outside a hospital"
(p. 37).

Popular movies and television shows often portray therapists as
harmless, neurotic characters who can barely hold their own lives
together. In some cases, our profession is portrayed as a bunch of
manipulative, demented, even evil characters in films like *Silence of
the Lambs*, *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*, or *Bad Therapy*. These
characters' only agenda is to exploit and control others for some
misguided reasons.

Journalists seem to delight in uncovering scandals that show the chinks
in our armor, or sometimes far worse. In one article in the popular
press about a charismatic, prominent psychoanalyst ([Boynton,
2003](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-26){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0062}),
the author wrote a scathing indictment of the profession based on the
abusive behavior of one disturbed professional who regularly had sex
with his clients, breached confidentiality by talking about celebrities
he was seeing in therapy, and verbally berated and abused people who
come to see him. Of course, this whacked-out therapist deserves to have
his license revoked and to serve prison time, but the impression
sometimes given is that people like this are somehow representative of
our profession.

Some of the most beloved figures in popular culture, entertainment, and
sports have been "ruined" by incompetent, exploitative, manipulative
therapists (Kottler,
[2006](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-162){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0063},
[2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-172){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0064}).
Actress Marilyn Monroe and composer/musician Brian Wilson (from the
Beach Boys) were treated by professionals who were blatantly
self-serving in their behavior. Wilson's therapist moved into his home
and demanded that royalties from all future recordings be shared with
him. Marilyn's therapist required that she move close to him, run
errands for his family, attend daily sessions, and, according to some
sources, may have actually been responsible for her death. Likewise,
writers Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, and Ernest Hemmingway were all
treated by therapists who didn't seem to know what they were doing.
Similarly, although professional athletes are vulnerable
[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_28}to mental illness, injuries, or addictions
because of the pressure they experience every day, the therapists hired
by their coaches or teams may only be interested in their performance
rather than their well-being and personal functioning.

We may also be responsible for perpetuating the myth of therapist
ineptitude by criticizing members of competing helping professions or
therapeutic approaches who are not members of our own tribe.
Psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, counselors, family
therapists, psychiatric nurses, and addiction specialists often attack
one another for perceived (or actual) differences in training. Likewise,
there has been an ongoing war for decades among psychodynamic
therapists, cognitive behavioral therapists, behavior therapists,
humanistic therapists, constructivists, feminists, and so on about who
has best cornered the market on truth. Perhaps these debates are useful
in clarifying universal features embedded in all therapeutic work, but
there is one area of hypocrisy that I just can't abide: It just annoys
and troubles me whenever I encounter a professional (or parts of myself)
who asks clients to do things that he himself cannot do. What kind of
image do we project to the public when we cannot demonstrate in our own
lives the most rudimentary degree of empathy, sincerity, and emotional
stability? What sort of hypocrites have we become when we ask people to
do things that we are unwilling or unable to do ourselves? What do
students, trainees, and beginners think to themselves when they notice
that their instructors, supervisors, or mentors don't practice in their
own lives the respect, compassion, and caring that they so
enthusiastically advocate for others? What does it mean when faculty in
academic departments, or administrators of organizations, are so
conflicted and dysfunctional with one another that they can't
collaborate in constructive ways or even seek to actively undermine one
another?

So many of the joys, as well as hazards, of our work result from the
consequences of being professional models who allow ourselves to be
affected by our clients. We want to show them, by the way we live our
lives, that it is possible to be proactive when taking charge of our own
behavior. Clients know little about the details of our existence, our
dreams, our disappointments, or what we are like in social situations,
yet they know our spirit intimately. They can sense our moods and feel
our tranquility, confidence, and energy. They may not know what we are
really like in the outside world, but they know us at our absolute best.
We do not yell impatiently at our clients as we might at our own
children. We try not to meet our own needs at all during sessions. And
clients come to love us, to worship our idealized selves. Even though we
understand the illusions and myths we may be creating, we still have a
wonderful opportunity to be more like the
[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_29}people clients think we actually
are---completely loving, giving, peaceful, and in control.

### Balancing Omnipotence and Humanness {#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-div1-18 .sec1}

Traditionally, the therapist has been seen as the contemporary
equivalent of the oracle perched on a mountaintop; clients are the
pilgrims who journey in search of enlightenment. Mistrusting their own
inner voices and lacking self-direction, they have looked to their gurus
for guidance and see them as embodiments of perfection. There are
ancient traditions in almost every human culture of not only worshipping
gods but also showing reverence to those who are considered conduits to
the spirit world and to those who are considered sages, shamans, or
healers.

We will explore further in the book how one of the principal hazards of
our profession is the narcissistic belief that we really are special.
After all, it's tough not to take ourselves so seriously when so many
people treat us with such awe and deference. The therapist's office
(physical or virtual space) is an unreal world in which distractions are
minimized and rituals are carefully observed. The therapist controls
most of the show. Although the client chooses the content, the therapist
directs the script and the interpretation of the lines. We are used to
being in control and are accustomed to having people defer to us. We
feel special because we are often treated that way. Besides, we always
get the most comfortable chair.

Most therapists do good work. Clients improve the vast majority of
times, first surveyed by *Consumer Reports* almost a half century ago
when it was discovered that 90% of those who sought therapy for some
difficulty reported that the experience had been mostly positive and
helpful. Since then we've also found that briefer, time-limited formats
can work just as well as lengthier treatments for some disorders and
that almost all the popular systems are effective with some clients,
situations, and difficulties, depending on (a) motivation, commitment,
and characteristics of the client; (b) qualities, skills, and expertise
of the practitioner; (c) quality of the alliance as perceived by the
client; (d) degree of collaboration and cooperation between the partners
in the process; and (e) responsiveness of the therapist to client
feedback ([Duncan & Sparks,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-59){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0065};
[Kottler & Balkin,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-175){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0066};
[Miller et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-223){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0067};
[Norcross & Goldfried,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-240){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0068}).

Our clients tend to feel grateful for our efforts and ascribe their
improvement to something or someone outside themselves. We are more than
willing to take partial credit; it is good for promotions, new
referrals, and our sense of potency. The problem is not in feeling that
we have made some []{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_30}difference in a client's
life but in forgetting that we are not the paragons we pretend to be.
When we direct the interacting, questioning, controlling, confronting,
nurturing, and even summarizing at appropriate intervals for 8 hours a
day, it is an abrupt shock to our systems to find ourselves, once we are
at home or with friends, struggling to be heard like everyone else.

We are used to being listened to. Some people even take notes on what we
say, and we can test them later to make sure they were paying attention.
After a while, we start believing that we really *are* important.
Clients reinforce the idea by telling us how much they were helped. Then
we remember how fragile the illusion of omnipotence really is. Even if
it is initially useful for clients to idealize their therapists, we must
help them and ourselves see a separate reality.

Modeling takes the form of presenting not only an ideal to strive for
but also a real, live person who is flawed, genuine, and sincere.
Occasionally, the therapist can use self-disclosure to close the
psychological distance between herself and the client. Such sharing can
often lead to increased feelings of mutual identification, as well as
build great intimacy and authenticity. Many clients are greatly relieved
to learn that their therapists have suffered similar self-defeating
behaviors that they are now trying to overcome. You may have noticed a
similar phenomenon as a reader in the ways that I disclose my own
doubts, uncertainties, and struggles in this book. If I have done this
effectively, then you feel greater permission to be more open,
vulnerable, and honest about your own unresolved issues. Yet if I am
perceived as self-indulgent or inappropriate, then I risk losing your
trust and confidence.

By serving as a model of humanness, with accompanying imperfections, we
can help clients (or readers) feel less overwhelmed and more optimistic
that relative personal mastery is indeed within reach. We thus walk a
fine line between exuding a certain assurance and personal competence
balanced with our own personal struggles. We must battle with the
consequences of acting like an impromptu guru much of the day and then
successfully make the transition to flawed normality during the rest of
our time. Otherwise, friends and family find us *very* annoying.

### The Therapist's Strength of Character {#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-div1-19 .sec1}

Most of the great teachers we have ever read, known, or heard of were
rather charismatic individuals. Plato, Confucius, Freud, Gandhi, and
Marx were geniuses in mastering their fields' knowledge, but their true
talent was in imparting their wisdom and recruiting disciples through
the force of their []{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_31}personalities.
(Historically, at least, inspiring adulation has often been primarily a
male-dominated enterprise.) Contemporary teachers in every field
demonstrate the power of attractive personalities in promoting learning.
Their followers are as much seduced by their voices, smiles, humor, and
personal magnetism as they are fascinated by what they say.

The leaders in the fields of counseling and psychotherapy have made many
significant contributions through their research and ideas. However,
nobody would have listened to them if they had not been captivating
people in some way. Their unique ways of expressing themselves, their
passion and excitement, their energy and spirit, their commitment and
confidence, gave life to their ideas. It was their eccentric quirks,
their personal demons, and their humanity that were also quite
appealing. They managed to develop theories that not only were perfectly
suited to their own values and interpersonal styles but also were
absolutely brilliant at "recruiting" others through the force of their
personalities.

During the past decades, a colleague and I have completed over a hundred
interviews with many of the field's most notable figures, representing
two dozen different theoretical orientations. We have asked these master
therapists to tell us about their worst sessions ([Kottler & Blau,
1989](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-177){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0069};
[Kottler & Carlson,
2002](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-178){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0070});
most unusual case ([Kottler & Carlson,
2003](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-179){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0071});
best therapy session ([Kottler & Carlson,
2008](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-182){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0072});
spiritual transformation ([Kottler & Carlson,
2007](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-181){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0073});
most creative breakthrough ([Kottler & Carlson,
2009](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-183){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0074});
the client who changed them the most ([Kottler & Carlson,
2006](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-180){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0075});
their advocacy and social justice efforts ([Kottler et al.,
2013](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-188){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0076});
and what constitutes a true master in the profession ([Kottler &
Carlson,
2015](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-185){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0077}),
as well as ones who aged and matured successfully ([Kottler & Carlson,
2016](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-186){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0078}).
The participants in these studies included theoreticians who represent a
broad range of viewpoints and styles. After spending countless hours
with these individuals, listening to their experiences, identifying
common themes in their stories, observing their sessions, and analyzing
the results, one of the surprising---even shocking---discoveries was
that many of these theorists don't even practice their identified models
any longer! They have moved on to other things. They have been
influenced by their colleagues during panel discussions at conferences.
Most of all, they have transcended technique to emphasize far more the
human and relational features of their interactions with clients. In
other words, they may no longer use their developed theory in pure form,
but more than ever they use their caring, compassion, and other personal
characteristics.

I am not suggesting that a therapist must be eccentric or outrageous in
order to be maximally effective. It is one of the most perplexing (and
wonderful) aspects of our work that one can adopt so many different
[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_32}therapeutic styles with equal
effectiveness. There are great therapists who were provocative and pushy
(think Fritz Perls or Carl Whitaker), and there are others who were
softer and sincere (think Virginia Satir). There were therapists who
were talking rational computers (Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck), charming
rogues (Jacques Lacan), kindly grandfathers (Carl Rogers), or wizards of
Oz (Milton Erickson). It doesn't matter so much which path the
professional took to develop a therapeutic style as long as it was one
that brought out the best in him or her.

All good therapists have a way of communicating similar greatness---in
their own unique way. They have developed their own style of helping
people feel that what they have to say is worth listening to no matter
how much effort is required to hear it. They accomplish this through the
intrinsic appeal of their inner voices. All effective therapists
intuitively find a way to capitalize on the strengths of their
character. Freud's self-analytic skills, Rogers's genuineness, Ellis's
capacity for rational thinking, and Whitaker's playfulness formed the
nucleus for their respective theories. So, too, do all clinicians
translate their inner selves into a personal style of helping.

### The Ideal Therapist Model {#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-div1-20 .sec1}

Even with all our differences in values, interests, histories,
professional affiliation, and training, most therapists share similar
attributes as powerful helping models. Many researchers, theoreticians,
and practitioners have attempted to describe the dimensions of an ideal
therapeutic personality ([Bennett-Levy,

Carl Rogers mentioned such qualities as genuineness, congruence,
authenticity, openness, and acceptance. Jerome Frank felt that
confidence was the key to a therapist's persuasive power. Abraham Maslow
believed that the more general striving for self-actualization was a
crucial trait.

Whether through a deliberate and systematic indoctrination in certain
beliefs or as a byproduct of interpersonal intimacy, clients come to
know our basic values about life, no matter how much we try to disguise
them. Some practitioners deny that this is so, claiming that perfect
neutrality and complete objectivity are possible. Perhaps those who
practice within a strict psychoanalytic framework are indeed able to
withhold most of their values from their clients. However, as a veteran
participant in psychoanalytic therapy many years ago, I can attest that
although my therapist tried []{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_33}to keep
herself out of the sessions, I knew exactly what she wanted me to say
and do and the choices she preferred that I make. Being an expert
approval seeker from way back when, I worked very hard to be as much
like her as I possibly could---including entering her profession so that
I might embrace even more of her values.

If this assumption is true---that clients take on our values as a
consequence (deliberate or incidental) of participation in
treatment---we had better be sure that what we espouse is well grounded
in reality and generally healthy. It's also interesting to consider that
there is often a match between a therapist's theoretical orientation and
his or her personal values, beliefs, qualities, early attachment
history, and relational style ([Heinonen & Orlinsky,
2013](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-122){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0085}).
It wouldn't be surprising to learn, for instance, that cognitive
behavioral therapists describe themselves as logical and pragmatic,
whereas humanistic practitioners identify most strongly as being warm
and accessible.

Regardless of chosen approach, ideal therapists are comfortable with
themselves and appear tolerant, sincere, serene, tranquil, and
self-assured. This quiet confidence is counterbalanced by a contagious
zest for life, passion, excitement, electricity, enthusiasm. They
radiate from body and soul.

We have the client's attention. He is attracted to our compassionate and
loving nature. Offering much more than the wooden skills and platitudes
of advanced accurate level empathy, unconditional positive regard, and
other primary facilitative factors, we genuinely care about the client's
welfare. These feelings go beyond restrained professional respect for
someone who trusts us. The client can feel our caring, our intense
desire to give of ourselves.

But love is not enough. If it were, parents could heal their children
with intention alone. Therapists are wise and knowledgeable. They are
experts in human nature. They are perceptive and sensitive. They are
students of science and the arts, of the abstract and the ambiguous, and
especially of language. They hear things that are inaudible and see
things that are invisible to others, and they do so with great accuracy.

Therapists are also known for their stability and grounding, at least as
the image they project. They are patient, so, so patient. They exhibit
great self-discipline, yet, enigmatically, they are also spontaneous and
playful. Creativity, humor, flexibility, honesty, and sincerity are
other qualities that therapists strive toward. And as a function of
these attributes, therapists are in an optimal position to demonstrate
those skills and behaviors that are most persuasive and influential in
promoting change.

Our main job is to make ourselves as attractive and powerful as possible
in order to lend greater potency to our interventions. We communicate on
[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_34}two levels simultaneously. First, there is
the content of what we say: the accuracy of our interpretations, the
truth of our confrontations, and the appropriateness of our metaphors
make a difference in client awareness, insight, and behavior. On a more
subtle, preconscious level, the client also attends to our style. Much
of our interpersonal influence, our power as models, operates in the
nonverbal realm. It is the way we speak as much as what we say that
communicates confidence and favorable expectations. It is the way we
carry ourselves that implies genuineness and sincerity in our movements.

We try to teach goodness, honesty, and trustworthiness in our sessions.
Such qualities cannot be faked very easily. That is not to say that
deceitful therapists are never effective, because some are. But to the
degree that we can make our spirit and energy noble and clear, our
messages carry even more power. As professional helpers, then, one of
our tasks is to be more personally effective and loving human beings. We
should reveal compassion not only in our work but in every aspect of our
daily lives. If we are to be consistent and genuine, then our family,
colleagues, friends, and even strangers on the street deserve the best
of us as well.

One of the ironies of our profession is that we become highly skilled at
giving our clients undivided, concentrated attention without
interruption, yet we may rarely do the same with our family and friends.
Likewise we may talk constantly about the importance of regular
self-care yet fail to apply this policy to our own lives on a consistent
basis, violating our own supposed values and dooming ourselves to
depletion, compassion fatigue, and burnout ([Kottler,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-173){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0086}).
The people we care about the most get us in diluted form, distracted and
self-involved. As I was writing these words, my 3-year-old granddaughter
found me hiding in the study and asked if I would pay hide-and-seek with
her.

"Let me finish what I'm doing . . . ," I started to say, and then
abruptly caught myself, realizing how out of whack my priorities were in
that moment. I would never put a client off, so why would I think this
little girl was any less important to me? This is exactly the kind of
revelation that I try to teach so often to my clients.

### How Modeling Works in Therapy {#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-div1-21 .sec1}

I mentioned previously how several researchers have described the uses
of modeling in specific, behaviorally defined situations. These social
learning theorists are fond of investigating those factors that enhance
[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_35}the acquisition of learning, the quality
of performance, and the transfer and generalization of acquired
behavior. We are less concerned, however, with the details of vicarious
reinforcement processes than with the broader understanding of the
different ways in which modeling operates in therapy.

For example, on the most ambiguous and elusive level, the therapist's
energy has a significant impact on the client's mood and conduct.
Therapists who sit peacefully and sagely, speaking in silky and serene
tones, seem to tranquilize even the most agitated clients. Anxious,
high-strung people, those with fears, phobias, and panic disorders,
respond well to calm models. They learn from our manner of interaction,
the way we sit and stand, the pace of our speaking and listening, just
how a relaxed person functions. In contrast, when a therapist's energy
is animated, electric, vibrating throughout the room, even the most
passive people will wake up a bit. Clients respond to the personal
energy we generate. They admire our intense vibrancy and the
self-control to modulate it.

Clients deliberately and sometimes unconsciously adopt their therapists'
speech patterns, favorite expressions, even mannerisms and dress habits.
Groups of graduate students can be identified with their advisers with
only brief verbalizations as cues. After decades, we can still trace
remnants in our vocabularies to the influences of significant mentors. I
still occasionally catch myself mimicking one of my previous mentors or
supervisors as if he or she still lives within me (which of course is
actually true). Considering that this kind of imitative learning occurs
without deliberate encouragement, imagine the incredible potential power
of more strategic therapeutic modeling.

The simplest form of modeling occurs in those instances when the
therapist spontaneously demonstrates desirable behaviors. During a
typical session, regardless of the content, a client may receive
instruction in effective confrontation, appropriate questioning, or
comfortably handling silence. The therapist subtly (or directly) draws
attention to his or her own assertive posture, internally based
language, concise statements, or creative thinking.

The use of simulated experiences in therapy provides even more specific
imitative learning. Psychodrama and other rehearsal or role-playing
structures usually contain a segment that is demonstrated by the
therapist. A restrained and timid client who is practicing a
confrontation with a family member will be asked during periods of
frustration to observe the expert model in action. The therapist will
then show a variety of ways to defuse conflict and maintain control.

[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_36}Therapists have been known to employ a
number of interventions that have modeling principles at their core,
including (a) rehearsing role playing that emphasizes recurrent themes;
(b) showing videos or simulations that demonstrate desired target
behaviors; (c) teaching discrimination skills through observing models;
(d) reviewing recorded segments of the client engaged in new behaviors;
(e) using puppets or other enactments in play therapy; (f) using
anecdotes or stories to illustrate principles; (g) embedding metaphors
in communication to model effective behavior vicariously without the
client feeling threatened; (h) employing language carefully to
demonstrate self-responsibility; and (i) prescribing websites, messaging
systems, apps, avatars, and virtual reality programs to demonstrate
optimal performance and response strategies. Finally, on the most basic
level, we model acceptance and a caring attitude toward clients, hoping
that they will internalize these qualities to neutralize their own
self-critical natures.

Metaphorical anecdotes can range from fairy tales to more personal
self-disclosures that minimize the psychological distance between
therapist and client. By modeling openness, strength, even vulnerability
and the sharing of intense feelings, the therapist invites the client to
follow her lead. Trust, perceived similarity, and empathic understanding
can be vastly improved through restrained, well-timed, and appropriate
therapist sharing that is devoid of self-indulgence. As long as we don't
inappropriately take attention away from the client, we can increase our
trustworthiness, attractiveness, and credibility through such targeted
self-disclosures ([Berg et al.,
2016](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-18){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0087};
[Danzer,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-49){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0088};
[Hill et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-129){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0089}).

It's a tough call at times whether it is advisable to reveal aspects of
oneself with particular clients who may be more disturbed (fragile,
naïve, impressionable) and manipulative (borderline, narcissistic). On
the one hand we often wish to appear transparent, genuine, and authentic
within the context of a "real" relationship; on the other hand there are
times when our behavior can be misinterpreted. It is also important to
remember that being too restrictive and nondisclosing can also be viewed
as an impediment to developing a solid alliance.

Naturally, how clients receive and interpret self-disclosure depends a
lot on the quality of the alliance that has been established, as well as
the timing and relevancy of whatever was shared. It is also worth
mentioning again that just like almost any other strategy or
intervention that would be employed, self-disclosure must be carefully
adapted to the cultural background of the client or else risk boundary
crossings, overidentification, or misinterpretations that could lead
sessions astray ([Sunderani,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-299){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0090}).

### []{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_37}The Uses and Abuses of Power {#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-div1-22 .sec1}

Therapeutic and instructional modeling strategies share a belief in the
benevolent and judicious use of power. A clinician's power is first
sanctioned by legitimate bodies, such as licensing boards and
professional associations. The diplomas on our walls are sometimes
perceived as endowing us with certain mystical powers to read minds. We
are viewed not only as legitimate professionals with special privileges
but also as figures of authority. Depending on the client's previous
experiences with other models of authority (school principal, teacher,
safety patrol, drill sergeant, boss, parents, doctors, law enforcement),
the therapist's power also can instill feelings of resentment and
rebellion. This is more likely in cases when the therapist and client
represent different cultural, ethnic, gender, or socioeconomic
backgrounds but can become a factor with anyone who has previously been
abused, neglected, exploited, or controlled by someone in the past.

As a function of our role and responsibilities therapists are viewed as
"elite" and "privileged" in the sense that we hold knowledge, expertise,
and leverage. While this power differential can operate with any client,
the issues are far more salient with those who have historically been
marginalized. In addition, cases that involve custody disputes or
forensic evaluations or take place on inpatient units or detention
facilities clearly involve the potential for some injustice or abuse.

Although they have taken great effort to emphasize the "nondirective"
nature of their approach, even humanistic or Rogerian therapists
influence and shape their clients in more subtle, disguised forms
([Margolin,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-213){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0091}).
In spite of one's intentions, the therapist's worldview and biases still
may bleed through if practitioners ignore or deny the ways that power is
an integral part of the process. After all, microaggressions,
internalized racism, homophobia, and other forms of prejudice often
operate without awareness.

In spite of these cautions and warnings, some (Zur,
[2008](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-339){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0092},
[2017](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-340){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0093})
have suggested that the power dimensions within the therapeutic
relationship are exaggerated. Not all clients feel fragile, dependent,
deferential, and powerless; some are more than capable of holding their
own in any dispute or discussion ([Fors,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-80){#09_chapter2.xhtml_n0094}).
Compare for instance, the perceived powerlessness of clients who are
children, refugees, incarcerated, institutionalized, recently
traumatized, stigmatized, marginalized, or oppressed to those who are
affluent, successful, and dominant in their personal lives. Second, the
amount, intensity, and kind of power in the relationship is always
shifting and evolving, especially considering that there are so many
different kinds of power that operate in relationships, whether it is
coercive, rewarding, or based on position, status, race, socioeconomic
status, or professional identification.

[]{#09_chapter2.xhtml_page_38}In the context of interpersonal influence,
clients are not without their own means to establish dominance. They may
resort at times to more indirect forms of power, reminding their
therapist who ultimately has the control. In the past this might have
been limited to showing up late to a session to demonstrate who is boss;
currently, during telehealth sessions, a client who is annoyed,
frustrated, or offended can just hang up to punish a therapist who has
crossed a line. Nevertheless, while acknowledging that clients are
different and unique in their sense of personal control, it is clear
that issues of power must constantly be monitored. We are really talking
about integrity in this context since our job, by definition, is to
utilize power to influence clients in directions that are more
self-enhancing and fully functioning.

### Limitations of Power {#09_chapter2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-2-div1-23 .sec1}

It's important to keep in mind that we may sometimes inflate the amount
of power and control we think we wield considering that somewhere
between an estimated 60% and 70% of therapy outcomes are attributed to
clients' characteristics and what they bring to the table. Depending on
the severity of their problems and their preexisting conditions; their
level of motivation, resilience, and commitment; their beliefs and
optimism; and their perceived self-efficacy and internal control,
clients largely determine their own prognosis. Of course they can only
do so much on their own, and that's where we enter the picture.

Power is what infuses us with the persuasion and influence to motivate
and inspire clients to change. When used in the spiritual rather than a
manipulative sense---that is, for the client's self-articulated good
rather than for meeting our own needs---power is the driving force
behind much of what we do. It gives weight to what we say and commands
sufficient attention that clients will allow themselves to be influenced
by our messages in ways that hardly ever happen in the outside world.
Eventually, there is a gradual transfer of power in which clients take
on the roles and responsibilities that we have modeled. They have
internalized the best parts of us.

If we accept our responsibility as therapist-models and agree to use our
influence for the good of our clients, we are then committed to
increasing our personal and professional effectiveness. We are involved
in the process of integrating our various roles and making ourselves as
appealing and as influential as we are capable of becoming.

[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml}

## []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_39}[Chapter 3](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0005) {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3 .ch_title1}

## [Personal and Professional Lives](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0005) {.ch_title2}

[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-24}It is the
nature of the therapist's life journey that we would undergo our own
professional evolution and personal transformations as a result of the
rather evocative, interesting, simulating work that we do. Every day, if
not each hour, we are faced with the most devastating trauma, complex
personal issues, provocative existential questions, and emotionally
intense experiences that could ever be imagined. Suffering, after all,
is our business, and promoting change is our specialty.

Quite a number of historical figures in the field, from Sigmund Freud
and Carl Rogers to Hans Eysenck, Joseph Wolpe, Carl Whitaker, and Jerome
Frank, described the ways their ideas, priorities, and interests had
developed over time, just as their style of practice adapted according
to the times and the needs of their clients ([Overholser,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-248){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0095}).
Such evolution, learning, and changes are inevitable for those of us who
have devoted our lives to a profession that so celebrates ongoing growth
and development. This is no less true with respect to shifts in the
direction of the profession over the years.

Looking back over the last half century, several changes have been
notable on both sides of the ledger. The good news has been the
emergence of the scientist-practitioner model and the profession
increasingly being considered a key component of primary healthcare and
wellness, leading to increased collaboration between therapists and
medical personnel to coordinate treatment, medication, and
interventions. In addition, we have explored how clinicians have become
far more integrative, pragmatic, and flexible, rather than owing
exclusive allegiance to one theoretical orientation. There has been more
systematic and careful protection of client
[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_40}privacy, confidentiality, and safety as a
result of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) compliance for record-keeping, risk management,
dual-relationship issues, and boundary violations. Therapeutic models
are also adapting more consistently to become responsive and sensitive
to greater diversity of client backgrounds and needs. And of course the
development of alternative delivery systems via telehealth options has
been a boon to mental health for those who have previously been locked
out of the system.

On the other hand (you knew this was coming), some therapists are still
stubbornly embracing ideas from the past that have long since become
obsolete, irrelevant, or outdated. Remember, it wasn't *that* long ago
that bloodletting, purging, mental asylums, lobotomies, exorcism, and
insulin coma therapy were popular options for treating emotional
problems. This leads one to consider which practices and policies are
*still* being employed that are potentially useless, if not dangerous.

There remains ongoing tribalism and turf wars between different mental
health professions, competing for attention and resources, and pretty
much confusing everyone who tries to sort out the options. We are still
relying on assumptions and beliefs that actually have little empirical
basis for their effectiveness. Consider, for example, some of popular
practices like the 50-minute hour. How and why did *that* ever become an
inviolate standard for the length of sessions? What other medical
procedure can you think of that prescribes the exact same dosage of
treatment for every single person, regardless of their size, background,
condition, diagnosis, and complaints? We often appear to rely
excessively, if not worship, empirically supported data, yet we
completely ignore the lack of evidence when it is convenient.

### Complementary and Confusing Roles {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-25 .sec1}

The practice of psychotherapy permits a unique lifestyle in which one's
personal and professional roles complement each other. There are few
other careers in which the boundaries between work and play, between
professional and personal life, are so interconnected. All the powers of
observation, perception, and sensitivity are equally useful with
clients, family, or friends. The skills we use in our work, such as
empathic listening or flexible problem-solving, prove invaluable when
helping the people we love. In a similar vein, *all* our personal
experiences, travels, learning, conversations, readings, and intimate
dealings with life's joys and sorrows provide the foundation for
everything we do in our therapy sessions.

[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_41}Many have described the practice of
therapy as a "calling" rather than a job or a profession. It is often
observed that we are driven to understand the human condition not only
among those we help, but also within ourselves. We have an insatiable
curiosity about, and a need to make sense of, life experiences and to
help others do so. This process moves in the opposite direction as well:
By helping people put their lives in perspective, unlock the hidden
secrets of their psyches, and understand themselves more thoroughly, we
are helping ourselves do the same. We are often searching for answers to
life's ultimate questions since one of our jobs is to find or create
meaning for a living. Encountering others who will help subsidize this
quest only makes this journey less lonely and more comfortable.
Searching for truth in the tradition of Lao-tzu, Buddha, or Confucius is
admirable, but it is a lot more fun when we do not have to do so as a
hobby.

Personal and professional roles become fused when the therapist is
always on duty and thus unable or unwilling to have a life outside work
and beyond the role of helper. In their classic study of practicing
therapists, [Henry et al.
(1973)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-124){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0096}
discovered that many practitioners adopt a one-dimensional attitude
toward all their relationships, whether they involve clients, friends,
or family. There is a distancing aura in which the clinician detaches
himself not only from the therapeutic encounter but also from home life.
There is also remarkable consistency in the way clients change in
sessions and in the way therapists made their decisions to enter the
field. Most practitioners were more strongly influenced by personal
considerations, such as cultural heritage or rejection of parental
values, than by any professional models. In most therapists there seems
to be a burning desire to work through personal conflicts, a conviction
that helping solve others' problems can help one solve his or her own
difficulties. There is a tendency to merge the personal and professional
dimensions of life into a unified perception of self and world.

This reality can become annoying, if not problematic, when strangers or
acquaintances discover that you are a therapist (or training to become
one). Your seatmate on a flight casually asks what it is you do for a
living, and you reveal your profession. "Oh yeah?" he says, with that
look in his eye you've come to recognize. "You know, I have this
teenaged kid and he just doesn't listen to me. I bet you see that sort
of thing all the time. I was wondering. . . ."

You try to bury your face in a book or screen, but before you know it,
your new best friend is asking for help, if not sage advice. During the
early part of our careers, this is almost flattering, but eventually we
come to realize that if we are going to survive for very long in this
profession, we must learn to enforce clear boundaries.

[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_42}Our early life experiences and events
shaped not only what kind of persons we've become but also the unique
ways that we have chosen to help others. Likewise, each of our current
life passages and experiences continues to influence our work, whether
as a result of becoming a parent, going through a loss or divorce,
navigating a life-stage transition, dealing with illness or aging
issues, or any other challenge. It's also interesting the way seemingly
inconsequential, serendipitous things hit us just as hard and change how
we think about ourselves and what we do.

Within sessions we experience all kinds of strong emotional reactions to
what is transpiring in the room, including joy, pride, satisfaction,
elation, as well as crushing disappointment, anxiety, and
discouragement. The various times when therapists are most likely to
have powerfully strong positive emotional reactions have been dissected
and catalogued, occurring in circumstances that are both predictable and
sometimes surprising ([Vandenberghe & Silvestre,
2013](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-312){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0097}).
The most obvious examples are when clients improve significantly,
especially when we can trace a direct connection to something we said or
when we did something extraordinarily well crafted: We, feel the pride
of professionalism. Other times include when we:

We are sometimes moved to tears in session because of the powerful
emotional energy in the room. In fact, three quarters of therapists
report that at some time they have actually cried with a client,
although it is likely the real figure is even higher because of a
reluctance to disclose such a perceived loss of control
([Blume-Marcovici et al.,
2013](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-21){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0098};
[Fraga,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-81){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0099}).
One study investigated the circumstances under which therapists had been
so moved by the proceedings that they cried and discovered that the vast
majority of times it was in response to the client's story or when the
client []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_43}expressed strong emotion. Eighty
percent of the psychologists surveyed also had no regrets about letting
their tears flow since they believed that this incident sparked quite
favorable reactions from their clients ([Blume-Marcovici et al.,
2015](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-22){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0100}).

Most of us remember times when we were so powerfully impacted by
something that occurred in a session that we couldn't help but feel
choked up. Sometimes this happened as a result of something going on in
our personal lives that resonated with the conversation in some way but
just as often it is our intense empathic attunement that leads us to
feel what clients are experiencing. This is, of course, both a gift and
a burden, depending on how we process the feelings and use them in
session---or refrain from doing so if such disclosures might be
inappropriate or distracting.

There is some fairly compelling evidence that when therapists are having
difficulties in their personal lives, it can reduce their ability to
function optimally in sessions, to remain grounded and clear. Our
capacity for relational attunement is compromised, just as it becomes
far more difficult to remain present and focused. Likewise, when we feel
isolated and disengaged in our personal lives, clients are more likely
to report weaker alliances than if we were involved in a number of rich,
meaningful relationships (Nissen-Lie & colleagues, 2013). Perhaps not
surprisingly, the quality of our lives in the outside world truly has a
huge impact on our emotional reserves and professional effectiveness.
Also interesting are the ways that our own psychological wounds can
actually enhance our ability to be most effective as therapists, a
belief shared by over 90% of practitioners ([McBeath,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-220){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0101}).

The fusion of personal and professional dimensions in a therapist's life
affects not only her lifestyle, emotional stability, and values but also
the course that her sessions take. It is naïve to pretend that the
client assumes complete responsibility for introducing the content and
direction of treatment. We may begin with what the client believes is a
major problem, but in no time we take over to lead discussions toward
the topic that we think is most important---whether it be the client's
feelings toward his parents, underlying thought patterns, or specific
behaviors at work. Furthermore, except for the most conservative
practitioners who follow the tenets of their theory to the letter, there
is a certain amount of inconsistency and unreliability in our helping
efforts, depending on what our mood is at the time, what is currently
going on in our lives, what we have recently finished doing or thinking
about, and what we are planning to do next.

It is no extraordinary revelation to admit that events in our lives
affect the outcome of our work. Why, then, do we pretend as though
therapy is simply the application of scientifically tested principles
and reliable therapeutic interventions to the specific circumstances of
a client's life? We []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_44}act as though the
process is always the same; as though there is always a progression
through identical stages, resolution of conflicts, challenging of the
same dysfunctional beliefs; and as though the therapist is always a
constant. Many leading therapists believe that reliability in helping
methodologies is the most important issue in the field.

Regardless of what we may wish to believe, the practice of therapy is a
distinctly human enterprise that is significantly affected by myriad
random and personal variables. Although it is laudable to work toward
greater consistency in the way we treat clients, a therapist is a
fallible human being subject to quirks, biases, errors, misjudgments,
and distortions of reality. Even with the best education, training,
supervision, study, and self-analysis, a therapist is hardly the
anonymous, perfectly stable, neutral, all-knowing, and accepting creator
that clients prefer to see.

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-008.jpg)

Consider, for example, the potential impact of various personal events
on professional behavior. Several intercurrent events, such as marriage,
divorce, childbirth, illness, and family death, affect a therapist's
life in profound ways, which in turn affects the client's behavior. Any
physical change, such as a leg cast, missing wedding band, weight loss,
even a haircut or new outfit, will hardly be ignored by clients.
Certainly, such life transitions and
[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_45}crises cannot be fully shelved by the
person experiencing them, even for 50 minutes while someone else is
talking.

Perhaps the best evidence regarding how a therapist's increased
vulnerability can change the nature of treatment is the observation that
the majority of therapist--client sexual improprieties occur with
therapists who have been recently divorced. It is also inconceivable
that a therapist who has a baby growing within her, has pain radiating
up his spine, has severe financial difficulties, or has experienced the
death of a loved one is going to conduct therapy in exactly the same way
as he or she would if these conditions did not exist.

How do we know when there is personal and professional role confusion
that may be interfering with our work? How do we recognize when our
unresolved issues are playing themselves out or our lived experiences
are distorting our judgment? Here are some questions to consider:

::: prosequote
[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-item1-33}[•]{.enumerator}Are
you expecting things from your clients that they are unable or unwilling

:::

All of these questions address one theme that is the focus of this
chapter, namely, that our personal and professional lives intersect in
ways that represent one of our greatest resources and also one of the
most challenging hardships.

### []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_46}Oh, You're a Therapist? {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-26 .sec1}

Most of us are involved in two kinds of helping: formal therapy within
our professional domain, complete with all the trappings, and *kinda
therapy*, in which friends, relatives, acquaintances, and even complete
strangers ask us for advice. Of course, we attempt to sidestep this
advice ambush with a feeble protest: "I'm not on duty right now," "I
think it would be best if I referred you to a colleague," or "Giving
advice is not really what I do." But the reality is that we are never
really off duty. We cannot just stop using what we know and can do.
Almost against our will, we find ourselves sorting out arguments or
listening to people's complaints.

One new therapist, for example, struggled with the confusion surrounding
her personal and professional roles. She had volunteered her time to
work with terminal patients. Once it was discovered what she did for a
living, she was assigned to a family to help them work through issues
related to death and dying. What was her role in this helping effort?
She was not actually their therapist, more like a friend. Could she ask
them personal questions, or would that be prying? Maybe she should
extricate herself from the situation altogether, so confusing was her
ambiguous role.

This fusion of personal and professional roles underlies some of the
risks inherent in intimacy with clients. Sorting out dual relationships
has become one of the most prevalent ethical issues of our time
([Reamer,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-263){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0102};
[Zur,
2020a](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-341){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0103}).
Our family members and friends constantly ask us for advice. Although we
may do our best to beg off, the truth of the matter is that we may well
enjoy feeling needed. My own confession: I *love* it when people ask me
what to do. I hardly ever get to give advice to clients since I know
such direct instruction is rarely useful. In my personal life, because
hardly anyone ever listens to me anyway, I feel happily self-important
that someone else thinks I know something that he or she does not. I
pretend I am a little annoyed by those who ask me how to handle their
children, confront their bosses, or straighten out their lives, but I
appreciate that they think enough of me to ask.

I know I'm not the only one who became a therapist in the first place
because I felt so powerless and lost earlier in life. My dismal academic
record, mediocre scores on standard tests, and frequent frustration with
doors closed to me, led me to feel grateful for the smallest recognition
that I might have or know something worthy of others' admiration. Much
of my life my self-esteem was integrally bound to feeling needed.

### []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_47}Risking and Intimacy {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-27 .sec1}

The relationships we experience with clients are not only professional
collaborations that are part of the job, but also genuine, real
encounters between people who are trying desperately to connect with one
another. Some theorists like Carl Rogers, Virginia Satir, Irving Yalom,
and Fritz Perls talked about this euphemistically, but more recently the
"real relationship" in therapy has been conceived as the ways
participants authentically experience one another ([Gelso,
2011](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-93){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0104};
[Gelso et al.,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-94){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0105};
[Gelso & Kline,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-96){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0106}).
If you ever doubt this, consider the extent to which the conversations
we have with clients are some of the most intimate, meaningful, potent,
and cherished we will ever have in our lifetimes.

Intimacy means being open, unguarded, and close to another. To
facilitate trust, the therapist must feel comfortable facing such
intimacy without fear. This closeness helps clients feel understood and
appreciated; it teaches them that true intimacy is indeed possible, that
a relationship based on regard and respect is desirable. Through the
mutual risking that takes place between the partners in the
relationship, both learn to appreciate better what closeness can bring.
But all this is predicated on some basic assumptions about the
therapeutic connection, conceived as both a therapeutic working alliance
and a genuine and real authentic relationship. Here is a summary of what
we know for certain:

::: prosequote
[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-item1-42}[•]{.enumerator}Relationships
are the principal forum by which healing, growth, and change take place

[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-item1-43}[•]{.enumerator}Empathy,
attachment, and hopefulness are universal within the numerous
therapeutic modalities, all of which strengthen the relationship.

of the things that best predicts a satisfying and productive counseling

is strong support that rather than simply focusing on the best
interventions and the most effective techniques and procedures---which
account for only a small amount of positive outcomes---it is
[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_48}the quality of the relationship that
determines more than half of the results.

[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-item1-48}[•]{.enumerator}Therapeutic
relationships must be customized, based not only on the client's

:::

Because therapeutic relationships are intensely personal and often quite
intimate encounters in which participants feel a mutual attachment,
we've discussed how there is intrinsic tension and confusion associated
with the way they are structured. We know more about our clients than we
know about many of our friends. We spend more time each week engaged in
meaningful conversation with a given client than we do with most of the
other people in our lives, including family and cherished friends.
Before you deny this proposition, consider how often you arrange to be
with someone on a regular basis with whom you (a) talk only about
personal matters of great significance; (b) do not allow yourself to be
distracted by any intrusions, including any phone or mobile device; and
(c) confront each other whenever there is a sense that someone is being
evasive or less than truthful. "Say that again," we might direct a
client who is stating something utterly ridiculous and untenable.
Likewise, a client may challenge something we are saying or doing that
appears less than perfectly truthful: "I find that hard to believe," he
might say after we offer false reassurance.

Even with the asymmetrical, inequitable, one-sided professional
dimensions of our relationships with clients, they are nevertheless
moving, personal exchanges. They carry many of the risks that are
operative in any such intimate encounter, regardless of the safeguards
and boundaries we install. In spite of our best efforts to remain
dispassionate and neutral there are times feelings are hurt, we feel
rejected, or sometimes even threatened.

In some cases the levels of intimacy in a therapist's personal and
professional lives may not coincide. Whereas most of us may be quite
willing []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_49}to let ourselves feel close to our
clients, we may not be so successful at committing ourselves to the
intimacy of social and family relationships. Still, if we stay in the
field long enough, we eventually confront our reluctance and defenses.
One therapist admits with candor, "Being a therapist saved my life. I
was about to go into the theater, which is most unhealthy, and rewarded
all the phony, manipulative, narcissistic parts of me. When I chose
therapy, it demanded that I deal with issues that I never would have
changed in another environment. I made a choice for health."

This is another area where the discomfort of confronting your own
hypocrisy comes into play. There are most certainly aspects of your
personal life that are less than satisfactory---you don't have enough
friends, you aren't involved in a committed romantic relationship, you
experience conflict with a friend or coworker, or your relationships
don't feel deep or intimate enough. These are exactly the same issues
that clients bring into sessions every day. And when they do, you most
likely tell them that in order to experience deeper, more satisfying
intimacy, they are going to have to take risks revealing themselves in
more honest, authentic ways. Now, what about *you*?

### Boundaries Between the Personal and the Professional {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-28 .sec1}

The boundaries that we define and enforce are as much designed to
protect ourselves as our clients. Interestingly, it isn't just the
number of clients in one's caseload that increases the levels of stress
and burnout in a therapist's life as much as a failure to set reasonable
limits between work and one's personal life ([Norcross & VandenBos,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-243){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0107}).

Every practitioner often develops habits, policies, and ways of
functioning that minimize personal disruption as much as possible,
whether refusal to respond to messages after a certain hour,
specializing in certain cases, or regulating one's schedule in some way.
Freud preferred his clients to lay on a couch, beyond visual range, not
only to facilitate free association but also because he was tired of
them staring at him all day long. There are other, similar safeguards we
put in place to counter the fear of losing control, of impulsively
slipping over to the dark side in spite of our best of intentions. A
client hugs you---and it feels *good*. You don't want to stop. Your
brain tells you, "Danger! Danger! Abort hug!" yet your body is
responding without your consent.

We sometimes confuse boundaries with walls---that is, rules about the
relationship designed for safety and efficiency as opposed to those
artificial []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_50}(and perhaps unnecessary)
limits that function as armor. In alternative paradigms such as feminist
or relational--cultural theory, practitioners often advocate greater
mutuality in the relationship.

There is a bias, if not a mandate, in the profession that dual (much
less multiple) relationships are a bad thing that can compromise
therapy, confuse clients, and lead to abuse. Yet many of the
breakthroughs that occur in therapy take place because of changes in
context, setting, or structure of the sessions. In a collection of cases
about the most creative interventions of the most innovative
practitioners, many of the breakthroughs took place outside the normal
boundaries of traditional psychotherapy ([Kottler & Carlson,
2009](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-183){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0108}).
Bill O'Hanlon described how Milton Erickson used him as his personal
gardener for a year in order to teach an obscure metaphorical lesson.
Bradford Keeney used home visits with a reluctant family in order to
engage them productively in therapeutic work. Sam Gladding went outside
with a resistant adolescent to take photos that might later be
discussed. Steve Madigan convened a whole community to provide needed
support for a depressed client. All these approaches are consistent with
the healing practices of most cultures around the world in which
therapists (also known as shamans) do all their work in a natural
setting rather than on the artificial, contrived stage on which therapy
usually takes place. It was only after the pandemic that both
practitioners and regulatory agencies were strongly incentivized to
invent alternative settings and structures for conducting therapeutic
work when the traditional parameters collapsed and were impossible to
maintain.

It's important to keep in mind that violating boundaries in the
therapeutic relationship is the most common complaint to ethics
committees. It may be clear that it is *never* appropriate to have a
sexual or romantic relationship with a client or to blur the boundaries
between the personal and professional. Yet there are all kinds of tricky
questions that therapists must face on a weekly basis. Most clinicians
would agree, for instance, that you wouldn't go out for a meal with a
client---*unless* that person is struggling with an eating disorder that
requires in vivo coaching. You wouldn't accept a gift from a
client---*unless* it is of "negligible" monetary value and a rejection
would be viewed as culturally inappropriate or antitherapeutic. You
wouldn't drive a client home after a session---*unless* you saw him
standing at a bus stop in the middle of a blizzard. It is the exception
in these examples that makes things complicated. Clearly the boundaries
between the realms of the personal and the professional are not as
discrete as they would seem---and not as easy to maintain as we were
told during training years.

### []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_51}Learning to Hide {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-29 .sec1}

It is our greatest gift, yet also our heaviest burden, that we must face
ourselves every single day. There is a part of ourselves contained in
every client story and a continuous recognition of our own unresolved
issues in almost every session. Ideally, such awareness would lead us to
work through our personal issues in supervision, if not personal
therapy. At the very least, we spend a portion of every day working to
process what we've experienced with clients, constructing meaning not
only for the client's good but also for our own growth.

Yet nobody is better equipped than we are to bury ourselves in other
people's problems as a way to avoid our own. Likewise, we have at our
disposal a whole collection of tools by which to keep people at a
distance, deflect attention, deny responsibility, or escape being nailed
down.

A friend of mine who works as a musician has frequently found himself
surrounded by therapists conversing about their work. I once asked him
what this was like, listening to us talking about what we do. He started
to laugh and shake his head. "Compared to playing Rachmaninoff's *Third
Piano Concerto*, what you guys do is easy."

::: prosequote
"Easy?" I said. "Are you kidding?"

"Yeah, sure. All you do when someone pushes you into a corner is you
say, 'This isn't about me, it's really about you.' "

I was speechless. Then I started to laugh. There was some truth to what
he said about how we are experts at putting the focus back on others. I
was thinking about all the times I had offered this interpretation to
avoid answering questions or revealing more than I wanted. I was always
amazed at how well it worked.
:::

::: prosequote
"And then the other thing you guys do," my friend continued, "is the
exact opposite. You make everything seem like it is about you, as if you
were so damn important that anyone really cares what you're feeling or
thinking."

"Feeling resentment, are you?" I replied automatically.

"See, there you go with option one, putting it back on me."

"Sorry," I replied, not really very sorry at all.

"It's okay. You can't help it."

"So," I reminded him, a little uncertain that I wanted to take this
further. "You were saying the other thing that therapists do."

"Yeah. You say, 'Hey, this isn't about you, it's about me.' "
:::

[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_52}I must say that this was an elegantly
simple summary of two basic strategies that are an internalized part of
the ways that therapists automatically respond. It reminded me of all
the other ways that we actually avoid deeper intimacy and keep others at
a distance.

One therapist, Myron, described the parallel process he experienced for
many years, trying to reconcile his failing 10-year marriage with his
practice as a specialist in couples therapy. "We were so desperately
unhappy," he admitted, "and so convinced that it was the other's fault,
that we had no choice but to seek help. Unfortunately, the therapist
proved to be much too skilled for my good, and at one point she asked a
simple question that unlocked some dark shadow inside me that felt as
though it would choke the very life from me."

This confrontation turned out to be a point of no return. "It propelled
me into the murky grounds of self-exploration. I learned everything
there was to learn about that shadow, but never went near it again."

Yet the deeper Myron explored his own issues and fractured marriage, the
more frustrated and unsatisfied he felt. He was aware of the recurring
destructive cycle he was living, just as he recognized such patterns in
his clients, yet he felt powerless to change anything. "It almost seemed
a daily occurrence that I would sit wisely in front of a couple and
support them through the pain of their relationship and then return to
the unresolved and deepening pain of my own marriage."

Myron felt like a fraud and hypocrite, unable to apply in his own life
what he was teaching to his clients every day. He felt like a failure
not only as a therapist but also as a client and human being. As much as
he read and studied about dysfunctional relationships, as often as he
helped other couples navigate through their suffering, he could not find
a way through his own issues. It wasn't until he discovered that his
wife was having an affair that he felt jolted sufficiently to take
necessary, courageous steps he had been avoiding. "Our old marriage died
in that moment and was then rebuilt from the ground up into the marriage
we both wanted over the ensuing year."

Myron shared how everything he learned as a therapist had helped protect
and insulate him from suffocating fear that had escalated since his own
session years earlier. "I realized that what I was doing as a therapist
was trying to do my own process vicariously through the pain of my
clients. I was trying to resolve something without experiencing the fear
and powerlessness of actually confronting it. It's not that I've learned
anything new as much as now I understand infinitely more."

What Myron understands, and now acknowledges, is that his training and
experience as a therapist allowed him to hide from his own unresolved
[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_53}issues. He knew all the tricks of the
trade designed to elude and evade. He knew exactly how to deflect blame,
dance around core issues, and avoid having to face himself and his own
role in sustaining mediocrity in his marriage.

### Doing Good {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-30 .sec1}

The risks that come with the territory of being a therapist emanate
primarily from getting perilously close to the flame that burns deep
within the sorrow of each client we see. Yet in spite of the many
hardships and occupational hazards of this work, we also experience
tremendous satisfaction, not the least of which is the urge to strive
for greater fulfillment in our own lives. It is impossible to watch
others growing in leaps and bounds without wanting some of that for
ourselves. Just as satisfying is the wonderful feeling of doing good for
others.

Altruism is certainly a driving force behind our motives and actions as
helpers. There is nothing like that feeling of elation that we sometimes
experience when we know beyond any doubt that our efforts have helped
redeem a human life. Whether the result of a prolonged commitment to a
relationship that spans years or a single gesture that yields immediate
results, the joy we feel from knowing that we have made a difference
goes far beyond mere professional pride; sometimes this "helper's high"
creates an incredible surge of tranquility, inner peace, and well-being.
Such "prosocial behavior" can lead to all kinds of benefits, including
greater longevity, boosted immunity system, and an improved sense of
well-being and life satisfaction ([Dossey,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-54){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0109};
[Hui et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-137){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0110};
[Schroeder & Graziano,
2015](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-276){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0111}).
This is especially the case when we extend ourselves to someone in need
without any financial remuneration or external reward.

I was walking down the street one day, lost in fantasies about what
flavor of ice cream I would have, when I saw a flash of color and
movement ahead, accompanied by screams of indignation. I rushed to the
scene and discovered two children, a girl of about 7 and a boy of 6,
fighting on the sidewalk. The larger and stronger girl quickly
dispatched her foe and then in triumph scattered the contents of his
book bag all over the street. Papers flew everywhere like mutant
snowflakes, falling down and around this little boy, who was sobbing in
frustrated helplessness.

I gathered up as many of his things as I could find, stooped down on my
knees, and handed him his reloaded bag. He looked at me, startled at
first by my intrusion into his misery. Then he broke out into the most
glorious smile I had ever seen and probably will ever see again. I felt
his gratitude []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_54}wash over me. As I continued
on my journey, tears now ran down my face. I was just so thankful that I
happened to be there at that moment so I could help him. I was able to
do some good. In that simple interchange, lasting not more than two
minutes, I had a relationship with another person that was helpful. In
an influential way, that effort of doing good helped make the world a
better place. During subsequent periods of frustration, I have thought
about that little boy's smile, and somehow the risks and aggravation I
must put up with have seemed worthwhile.

In truth, I've become addicted to this feeling of doing good, the
"helper's high", constantly looking for other ways that I can make a
difference. That's one reason why I have been spending so much time
working in remote areas, supporting at-risk children, leading trauma
teams, and bringing students with me to help families in distress. That
we receive no compensation for our efforts---and pay our own
expenses---would seem to make the trials and tribulations far less
endurable. We put up with strikes, civil wars, political upheaval, and
shortages of food and supplies; sleep in tents or teahouses in the
freezing cold; spend hours every day walking up and down steep
mountains; and subject ourselves to the most tragic stories imaginable,
and yet it is precisely because this is a labor of love that the
satisfaction is beyond anything else I have ever known or experienced.

Even when we are paid for our work (usually inadequately), there is
still that feeling of pride and accomplishment that, in our own small
way, we are helping to diminish suffering and make life for some people
more tolerable, if not meaningful. Amid the bureaucracy, paperwork,
politics, finances, client resistance, and any personal side effects
that we feel from doing this kind of work, we still get the biggest kick
from the realization that something we said or did, in isolation or as
an accumulative effect, made a difference to someone else. This desire
to be useful is, in fact, the primary reason that most of us entered
this profession in the first place.

This is one reason why I used to love to give directions (in the days
before GPS) to people who are lost, and why I have worked so hard to
become good at this skill. Rather than feel annoyed when someone stops
me on the street for directions or peeks into my office for guidance
regarding how to find a particular room, I rub my hands together in glee
(and I'm not just talking figuratively). Because the nature of doing
therapy is such that I sometimes can't tell if I really have helped
anyone (clients lie, or they don't know, or it sometimes takes a while
to understand the effects), I really enjoy any opportunity to offer
assistance and know that within a limited time I can make a definite
difference.

After I spent more than 5 minutes giving one person explicit, detailed
directions about how to find a conference room, including suggestions
for []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_55}what to observe along the way, the
recipient of my instructions looked at me as if I were crazy with so
much idle time on my hands. That wasn't it at all, but rather that I
really enjoyed telling someone *exactly* how to get to where he wanted
to go with total certainty that he would eventually get there.

### Therapist Self-Healing {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-31 .sec1}

For the most part, therapists live relatively flexible lives. Except for
those therapists who work in corporate, government, or other large
organizational settings, most practitioners in universities, schools,
community agencies, and especially private practice can exercise
considerable control over their schedules and work priorities. Options
have become considerably expanded with the popularity of telehealth and
distance-based sessions. Supervision and structure are usually minimal.
Like the artist and musician, the therapist needs freedom to flourish
and create.

The marriage between the personal and the professional in the life of a
therapist is never clearer than in the benefits that the career provides
for its practitioners. Far beyond any monetary, prestige, or freedom
needs that are satisfied are the opportunities for continual growth. "I
practice psychotherapy not to rescue others from their craziness," said
Sheldon Kopp, "but to preserve what is left of my own sanity: not to
cure others, but to heal myself" (1985, p. 12). If what Kopp said is
true, that doing therapy helps the therapist become saner, then just how
does this process take place?

There's compelling evidence that the more therapists are satisfied and
fulfilled in their personal lives, the more successful they are in
forming effective therapeutic relationships (Heinonen & Nissan-Lie,
2020; Nissan-Lie et al., 2017). Of course this makes perfect sense!
Interestingly, it seems that even when clinicians aren't necessarily
aware of how their own personal challenges and issues might be impacting
conversations, their clients notice the effects, sometimes as a
distraction, but often as a stated benefit. One clear outcome is that
when therapists feel and express joy, satisfaction, intimacy, and
support in their personal lives, their clients report greater
satisfaction in the sessions ([Yoviene,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-334){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0112}).
Once again, this only makes sense that when a professional feels deep
passion, zest, and excitement for life the effects would become
contagious for others around them.

We return to the mundane details of what a therapist actually encounters
during the day, not only the dramatic moments of revelation when a
client finally understands and feels grateful, but also the
frustrations, repetitions, []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_56}and stalemates.
First of all, therapists have to sit still for long periods of time, and
from this we learn patience and physical self-discipline. Rivaling the
most accomplished monk, a therapist develops phenomenal powers of
focused concentration. We resist the intrusion of external
distractions---cars honking, doors slamming, clocks ticking, phones
ringing, email or texts chiming, unanswered messages winking---and as
though in a meditative trance, we gently nudge our minds back into the
present. With stoic self-control, we ignore internal
distractions---grumbling stomachs, painful bladders, unfinished
conversations, pressing errands and chores, the past, the future---and
return once again to the task at hand. From such deliberate and studied
engrossment, we develop a razor-sharp intellect that is only improved by
the things we must learn to remain effective.

Therapists field questions like line drives during batting practice. We
leap and duck, catch some, and sidestep others. "When will I get
better?" "Why do I hurt?" "How do you feel about me?" "What am I here
for?" "What do you think this means?" "How do I grow old?" "What do you
think happens after we die?" "What should I do about this situation?"
"What would *you* do?" Whether we respond to these questions aloud or
not, we must nevertheless answer them---either then or later. We can
flee, but there is nowhere to hide. Every working day holds for us a
confrontation with the issues we fear most.

Every time we speak to our clients, we heal ourselves, for there is an
audience of two. We talk about what we know or what we think we know,
but we teach only what we truly understand. We feel a tremendous
incentive to answer life's most difficult questions and understand
things and people. If we analyze the content of our sessions, regardless
of clients' presenting symptoms, we will find our most disturbing themes
and the things we best understand.

I take inventory of my caseload.

Tina is learning to stop thinking obsessively, or at least to stop
obsessing about her obsessions. She has made progress in that now she
only talks about her repetitious thoughts during therapy sessions.
Whenever I try to get her to talk about something else, her symptoms
spill over into her work and marriage. We have learned not to tamper
with what is already working, even if it is sometimes boring to listen
to. Tina has learned to accept and live with her irritating symptoms.
From her, I have learned to live with a few of my irritating symptoms,
too.

Michelle has taught me a lot about patience. After a year together, I
finally gave up trying to control or structure our talks. Each week, she
tells me that something is bothering her, but she will not say what it
is because []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_57}she says she does not trust me.
I complain that I cannot help her if she will not open up further. She
says, "Fine. I'll go find someone else who won't require me to trust
him." She keeps feeling better, but I can't figure out why.

Feeling trapped in her marriage, Rachel used to cry the entire session.
But now we play a wonderful game together. Each week, she comes in
having already decided to take on one of two roles. If she decides to be
the dutiful but misunderstood wife, then I attempt to help her feel
satisfied with the status quo. She then leaves the office resolved to
initiate more open communication with her husband. But the harder she
tries, the more frustrated she becomes. (The husband is only interested
in his work, in his '68 Ford Mustang, and thrice weekly in the
missionary position.) Inevitably, she returns the following week
prepared for divorce. We then discuss why she should follow that course
of action, but we both know she will change her mind before the week has
ended. Twice I attempted to confront her about this circular pattern,
but she punished me for my impatience by canceling the next appointment.

Elena is thinking of dropping out of school because she has so little
money. It has taken her years of preparation and planning to negotiate
the time and space within her family so that she might devote some time
to herself instead of taking care of all her siblings and the household
responsibilities. Now she is seriously considering abandoning all the
hard work and negotiations it took to begin her studies. When I confront
her, she looks at me and shakes her head. I know exactly what she is
thinking: "How can this *gringo*, this old white guy with his books and
comfortable life, possibly understand what I am going through?" She is
right, of course: I can't possibly understand Elena's world no matter
how hard I try. How can I relate to what it must be like to go back to a
home where she shares a room with two siblings, where, if she's lucky,
her father will not beat her too badly or take one of her sisters for
fun and games when he's in a drunken stupor? How can I possibly
appreciate the meaning of school to someone whose daily survival is a
major challenge?

I tell Elena that I understand, when I can only begin to appreciate her
plight. I wonder what I can really do for her. Bring her false hope?
Encourage her to take a road that is far beyond what she can reasonably
expect to walk? I realize that she is resigned to what she must do; I am
the one who is not willing to accept her choices. Whose problem is this?
I wonder.

These few cases are a profile in diversity familiar to most therapists.
Yet there is also similarity in the issues clients confront---and
repetition in the things we hear ourselves say again and again. If only
we would take our own advice.

### []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_58}Taking Our Own Advice {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-32 .sec1}

Even the most creative, inventive, and spontaneous clinicians will teach
similar lessons to most of their clients. Our moral imperatives,
favorite platitudes, and well-worn words of wisdom find their way into
many sessions. Regardless of the client or presenting complaint, there
is repetition in the things we hear ourselves say out loud, most of
which could be applied to our own lives.

:::

We disregard our own advice not only by ignoring the messages we repeat
but also by failing to implement them in our lives. It hurts to be a
hypocrite. Day after day, we admonish clients for doing less than they
are capable of, while an echoing voice nags at our conscience: "What
have *you* done lately?" We help clients define those behaviors that
they would most like to change and end up doing likewise for ourselves.
How can we expect clients to understand ideas that we have not fully
mastered?

Besides taking our own advice and applying what we teach to our own
lives, we naturally do many things that lead to self-healing. Out of
necessity, we are good at valuing and organizing our time. Because of
our training and exposure to the consequences of self-neglect, we have
an elevated capacity to perceive our own stress. We thus remain
sensitized to certain warning signs, such as sleep disruption, excuse
making, agitation, or something in the body and mind feeling out of
balance. Once these potential problems are identified, we can
immediately take steps to correct them. Therapists work with colleagues
who happen to be experts at providing support and nurturance. From the
perspective of human contact, we work in an enriched environment. In
theory, anyway, our professional relationships should offer the
potential for personal fulfillment. There
[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_59}should be opportunities for constructive
feedback, benevolent guidance, and lots of hugs.

Unfortunately, there is often a discrepancy between what should be and
what actually is. Therapists can be as cruel, manipulative, insensitive,
self-involved, and political as the rest of the human race. Some of the
best people you know are therapists, and also some of the worst, those
who attempt to use their skills and power to exploit and hurt others.
Fortunately, we are trained to deal with deception, game playing, and
politics with minimal threat to the self. When we do find ourselves
subjected to abuse by others, there is nobody better prepared to counter
this behavior and metabolize it in such a way that damage is minimized.

In so many ways the reservoir of our own social skills and emotional
responsiveness would affect our ability to manage sessions that are so
often filled with intense, volatile emotions. These particular
capabilities largely determine not only the outcome of treatment, but
also the extent of our own satisfaction at work and daily life ([Harvey
et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-118){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0113}).
This is especially true with respect to several interpersonal domains,
which include (a) exuding warmth and empathy, (b) valuing personal
growth, (c) being self-reflective, (d) offering verbal support and
reassurance, and (e) exhibiting a collaborative style. Each of these
characteristic behaviors is evident in every aspect of our functioning
but particularly so when we conduct sessions with multiple participants
in groups or family sessions.

### Family Fallout {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-33 .sec1}

In addition to the usual countertransference reactions that a therapist
experiences in response to client behavior and issues, when we work with
families or groups of clients, we also must contend with an enmeshed,
multiperson system that is potentially unpredictable and explosive.
Group or family therapists must deal with more acting out in response to
them being in an authority role and must simultaneously deal with myriad
feelings and reactions to each person in the group as well as to the
group members' interactive patterns. Moreover, one's own
family-of-origin issues, as well as current family experiences,
influence the work.

In the therapy group I'm leading, Fiona catches my eye and smiles in a
flirtatious way. I feel flattered, then uncomfortable and guarded. I
notice that Fred sees the little interchange and smirks. Fiona smiles at
him, too. I feel a little jealous about that, then chagrined that I am
irritated with Fred. At that moment, Cassie pipes up with another
distracting question. []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_60}I am tired of her
insensitivity, so I point out the poor timing of her interruption. Fiona
rushes in to defend her, so I turn to her. I realize, just before I am
about to confront her defensiveness, that I am still haunted by her
earlier flirtatious gesture.

I have now lost the threads of where we were headed. I feel overwhelmed
by how much there is to attend to and all the complex and varied
reactions that I have to respond to with each person in the group, how
they relate to one another and to me. These effects do not end once the
group ends, but continue to plague me throughout the week.

We try to keep a vigilant eye on personal fallout to protect our family
and friends from the intensity of our professional life. Yet with all
the restraint we must exercise in order to follow the rules regulating
our conduct during working hours, it is difficult not to be insensitive,
surly, or self-indulgent with our loved ones. All day long, we have
stifled ourselves, censored our thoughts and statements, and forced
ourselves to be controlled and intelligent. And then we make an abrupt
transition to go home. Much of the pressure that has been building all
day long as clients have come in and dumped their troubles finally
releases as we walk through the door. If we are not careful, our
families will suffer the emotional fallout.

Among all the strategies that therapists use to manage their own stress
and difficulties from work, by far the single most common coping method
is relying on friends and family for support. Understanding this makes
it even more critical that we invest the time and effort to make sure
that we respond to loved ones with the same degree of caring,
sensitivity, and respect that we would show our clients.

### Personal Metaphors and Professional Work {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-34 .sec1}

After all the training we receive in diagnosis, recognizing defense
mechanisms, perceiving things as they are, and defusing game playing, we
are creatures exquisitely designed to smell self-deception and set
things right---not only when the meter is running during therapy but
also instinctively when we are on our own. Even if we do not
deliberately keep track of how our work is currently affecting our
emotional health or how our personal life is affecting our therapy, such
an evaluation will nevertheless take place. We find ourselves feeling
self-conscious in a social situation, feel our hearts beating quickly,
and immediately start talking to ourselves the way we would to a client.
Or we make an interpretation during a session that is obviously off the
mark and then begin to question what inside us led our clinical judgment
astray.

[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_61}The content of our therapeutic metaphors
comes from our personal experience. Much of what we say to clients is
strongly influenced by what we have read and seen, whom we have
encountered, and what we have done that very week. A client complains in
anguish of feeling trapped, and I find myself describing the lyrics from
a popular song or a scene from a current movie. I plant trees over the
weekend and weave together for a disoriented young man an example of how
each living thing requires nourishment, minimal shocks to the system
during transplanting, and individual attention. I spend the morning
surfing, surrounded by dolphins playing in the waves around me, and I
tell a therapy group how peak performance increases with an absence of
critical judgment; the less I think, the better I surf. I return from
working abroad where the people have nothing, own nothing, and yet seem
so much more content than those I know back home; this is a powerful
example to drive home in my sessions with the disenfranchised and
discouraged. The places I visit, the weather, dreams,
memories---everything that filters through my senses affects what I do
during sessions. My work in any given moment is the product of who I
have become up to that very instant. As I change, so does the style of
my therapy.

We, like our clients, change only at a pace with which we are
comfortable. If we move too quickly, the personal fallout can reach
dangerous levels. Yet it takes such incredible energy and commitment not
to lose ground, much less to change one's position. We all move just as
fast as we can, although we sometimes seem to stay in the same place,
reworking the same issues again and again.

In one mental health clinic, a dozen colleagues were asked how their
personal values, old baggage, and new dreams influence their style of
helping. The question was based on the reality that the choice of one's
therapeutic approach is hardly based only on intellectual compatibility
but also is strongly influenced by one's personality, beliefs,
priorities, cognitive style, and favored mode of expression. Humanistic
therapists, for instance, tend to see themselves as "genial" in all
their relationships, whereas cognitive behavioral clinicians describe
themselves as "practical," and solution-focused practitioners as rather
"forceful" ([Heinonen & Orlinsky,
2013](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-122){#10_chapter3.xhtml_n0114}).

Given the influence of our own personal history on our professional
behavior, it is perhaps not shocking to discover that one psychologist
in the clinic lost her mother to cancer while still a child and somehow
finds a way to diagnose most psychopathology as a form of mother--child
deprivation. She views her primary role as providing the maternal
nurturance that she herself so longs for.

A social worker has had great difficulty dealing with authority and
anger. Not coincidentally, he specializes in work with adolescents who
[]{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_62}inappropriately act out their hostility.
Another psychologist has struggled since childhood with obsessive
thinking and her fear of going crazy. In her practice, she requests the
most disturbed referrals and prefers working with psychotic disorders. A
family counselor prizes humor and spontaneity above all other human
experiences and so functions as a court jester to make people laugh.
Most of us can identify with such correlations between the major themes
of our personal lives and our professional style of practice. Despite
our best efforts to separate the two roles, the barrier remains fluid,
flexible, and even permeable.

### The Human Dimensions of Being a Therapist {#10_chapter3.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-3-div1-35 .sec1}

I emphasize the compatibility between the personal and professional in
my own life for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it makes my
work more fun. I find greater meaning in everything I do when I can
relate it to the rest of my life. Whether I'm reading a novel, watching
a movie or show, watching people interact in a mall or park, or
conversing with a friend, I can't help but apply what I've learned over
the years about human behavior. Likewise, I learn *so* much from these
experiences that often spawn new research projects or book ideas. I like
the feeling that I am always working, always thinking, and always trying
to make sense of what is happening. And yet in another sense I am never
just working because even time spent with clients helps me learn more
about the world and myself.

Second, I monitor the interaction between my personal and professional
lives to protect both my clients and my family. I know I have unresolved
personal issues that get in the way of my being more effective with my
clients. I must constantly guard against my self-indulgences,
egocentricity, and narcissism. I sometimes catch myself saying and doing
things in sessions for my own entertainment. I ask questions only to
satisfy my curiosity. I let clients dig themselves into holes just to
see how they will try to escape. I inflate my sense of importance so
that clients will admire me more. I sometimes see clients longer than is
absolutely necessary because I welcome the income, or I find it
difficult to let them go. Oh, I justify all of these actions, convincing
myself that they are all for the client's good. I don't worry as much
about this personal fallout because I am aware of it. I do genuinely
worry about those instances when I *don't* catch myself meeting my own
needs.

In all these factors that connect the personal with the professional,
the therapist juggles conflicting desires and multiple urges, motivated
by altruism as well as by egocentricity and self-interest. It is
difficult, if not []{#10_chapter3.xhtml_page_63}impossible, to filter
personal elements out of a therapist's professional work or to restrict
clinical perceptions and skills to the office. If truth be told, our
therapeutic perspective on life is our greatest asset and our greatest
liability. Being a therapist affords us the opportunity for continual
spiritual, intellectual, and emotional growth. We become more intuitive
and better risk-takers and communicators. We experience excitement,
human intensity, confidence, and self-fulfillment, all at great expense.
The consuming nature of therapeutic work reminds us of a common truth
that we may repeat to clients: Every joy sometimes has its price,
whether we pay now or on the installment plan.

## []{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_64}[Chapter 4](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0006) {#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4 .ch_title1}

## [On Being a Therapeutic Storyteller---And Listener](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0006) {.ch_title2}

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-div1-36}Caroline
seemed nice enough even if she was unusually quiet and reserved. I
couldn't actually recall her interacting with anyone on our team, pretty
much keeping to herself, smiling shyly when anyone made a point to
address her directly. She had been invited to join our mission at the
last minute by a friend of hers who was part of our volunteer group that
was working on behalf of girls in Nepal who were at risk to be forced
into early marriage (by the age of 12) or even sold into sex slavery.

I was leading some executives who had all been actively involved in
raising money to provide scholarships for our more than 300 mostly lower
caste children. The reward for these corporate leaders who had worked
hard to raise awareness of the girls' plight was to meet the children
and their families and see what impact the donations and support were
having on their lives.

Ordinarily Caroline would not have been permitted to join our team since
she had not actually raised any donations, but it was hard to turn down
the request after I heard about her story. She had been on a road trip
with her husband and two young sons, aged 2 and 4, when the next thing
she knew she found herself waking up in a hospital bed. She was told
that she had been in a car accident and was the only survivor: Her
husband and two little boys had died.

It is perhaps not unexpected that Caroline became a recluse. She cut
herself off from everyone and everything while she mourned alone in her
empty house. She refused all offers for help and all attempts to reach
out to []{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_65}her by friends and family, so it
was particularly surprising when she agreed to come to Nepal, especially
considering that the work involved spending intimate time with children.
After it was explained to me how this would be the first time she had
ventured from home in more than 6 months and how wounded she was, I
couldn't possibly refuse her.

During the previous week Caroline did spend time with the children,
reading them stories, talking to them about their schoolwork, conducting
home visits, and sometimes even holding young ones on her lap. I kept an
eye on her, and she seemed to be doing okay even though she was so
reserved with the rest of the group. Several times I had tried to strike
up a conversation with her, but it didn't appear to go anywhere, so I
backed off and let her have all the space she seemed to need.

After traveling to villages for almost a week, we had set up camp on a
mountaintop with spectacular views of the Himalayas across the skyline.
This was to be our base for the next few days while we spent time
conducting home and school visits in the region. I had been to this spot
many times before, and it was one of my favorite places in the
world---an ethereal place where the clouds covered the valleys below and
the snow-blanketed and glaciated peaks rose to impossible heights in all
directions.

I awoke early in the morning when it was still dark and there was a
light covering of snow on the ground. I had a favorite ritual of
climbing to the top of a nearby mountain where there was a *stupa*, a
Buddhist shrine, perched on the side of the cliff with 360-degree views
of the Himalayas rising above 25,000 feet. It was the most amazing place
to watch the sun rise.

As I was lacing up my boots I could see Caroline standing outside her
tent watching me. I approached her tentatively in the dark, not wanting
to spook her or wake any others who were still sleeping. "Put on your
boots and jacket," I whispered to her. "I want to show you something."

We climbed for almost an hour up the steep, sheer mountainside in the
dark, breathing heavily but not saying a single word to one another. I
would occasionally look back over my shoulder to make sure she was still
with me, but otherwise we just concentrated on the next foothold and
handhold. When we finally reached the summit there was just the
beginning of purple lighting the horizon, with the first glimmers of
pink underneath. We were both bent over trying to catch our breath.

I signaled Caroline to follow me to the edge of the cliff where the
small temple was situated. It was a tiny monument with a likeness of the
Buddha inside and a large gong hanging by the side of the building. "It
is said," I told her, "that if you ring the gong you can awaken Buddha
to hear your prayers." Caroline cocked her head to see if I was kidding,
but I just shrugged and pointed to the wooden mallet attached to the
gong by string.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_66}To give her some privacy I walked to the
edge of the cliff and sat down with my feet dangling over the side. As I
looked down I could see holes in the glowing pink clouds that offered
views of the valley thousands of feet below. Then I heard the low
reverberations of the gong; I could almost feel the sound echo through
my spine. I looked back and could barely make out Caroline standing
thoughtfully by the stupa with the mallet in her hand. She struck the
gong one more time and then carefully placed the mallet in its holder
before she walked over and sat down next to me with her feet also
dangling over the side. We sat that way for several minutes watching the
sun rise and the sky lighten before I heard her start to cry. I looked
over at her, not sure what to say, what to do, so I just put my arm
around her and held her while her sobs grew deeper, wracking her whole
body. To me it felt like the same kind of vibrations from the gong
running up my spine.

I didn't say a single word. I didn't ask any questions. In fact, I
realized that so far that early morning we had not spoken a word to one
another other than my invitation to her to come with me and then to
follow me over to the stupa. I just held her and let her cry. I watched
the mountains and the clouds and the light. I tried to remember the
sound of the gong. I concentrated on my breathing. And then I started to
sob as well.

During the preceding days I had seen so many things that had broken my
heart, so many children living in such horrific poverty. Often when I am
doing this kind of work I feel so helpless and powerless. My boundaries
collapse and I feel pain like none I have ever experienced. Then, all of
a sudden, sometimes I just lose control. Something in me was triggered
when Caroline started crying. I could feel all her pain leeching out of
her body. I just couldn't imagine what she must have been going through,
feeling so alone.

I started to feel self-conscious, if not uncomfortable, in my position.
My arm was starting to go numb. I wanted to help her somehow, but I
didn't know what I could possibly say that could make any kind of
difference, or that wouldn't sound so feeble. It was then I could hear
Caroline clear her throat. I held my breath and waited.

"They are here," she said. "I *feel* them. I feel them with me right
now." Then she turned to look at me. "My little boys," she added. "My
husband. They are here with me right now." All I could think to do was
nod my head.

We walked down the long, serpentine trail back to camp, arriving just
about the time the rest of the group was washing up before breakfast.
Caroline went back to her tent, and I went to talk to our guides about
the day's itinerary. Caroline and I never spoke about what happened at
the stupa, never talked about what she'd said. But something remarkable
changed for her after that morning. She began to interact with the
group. []{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_67}She became more animated. I heard
her actually laughing at times. For the rest of the visit she was always
the first one to dive into the gaggle of children, holding them, holding
herself.

It was the most remarkable "cure" I've ever had the privilege to be a
small part of. It was a relational cure I am certain, although I'm not
entirely sure whether it was her connection to me, the children, or the
spirits of her lost family that healed her. But it's her story that
sticks with me and continues to haunt me.

Each of us is privy to so many tragic, powerful stories that are shared
with us by our clients. We "hold" these stories, take them in with our
minds and hearts wide open, all the while doing our best to protect
ourselves from the collateral impact and side effects that sometimes
penetrate our own defenses. But far more than that, we also help to
restructure, reframe, and coauthor the stories in more constructive,
heroic forms that honor the lessons learned. This is the essence of
narrative and constructivist therapies but is also part of *any*
therapeutic approach, regardless of the particular names ascribed to the
process. In one sense, our main job is listen to the stories presented,
as well as to offer our own versions that are designed to have maximum
influence and alter the ways that clients view their experiences.

### We Experience the World as a Series of Stories {#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-div1-37 .sec1}

I settled on the idea of rethinking what I do, and how I do it, one day
when I was out for a run along the beach. Like almost all the things I
choose to write about, the seeds for my reconceptualization were planted
when trying to sort out my own personal reactions and curiosity to a
confusing phenomenon. I had just finished reading a trilogy of novels
about a zombie apocalypse in which a virus had turned most of the world
into the walking dead. I spent weeks immersed in this alternative
universe to the point that I was totally beguiled by the idea of how I
might survive such a catastrophe. Although I would later learn that
there are actually some highly adaptive and functional aspects to this
literature---and to almost any form of vicarious entertainment,
including video games, television shows, films, and novels---at the time
I still found myself recovering from the chills and thrills of the
continuous tension. I mention this as both an explanation and an apology
for my behavior that seemed so embarrassing.

As I was running along the beach, another runner approached me from the
other direction. Once he drew closer I could see him smiling; as we
passed one another, he held out his hand to offer a "high five," as if
to say, []{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_68}"Aren't we both awesome, out here
running while everyone else is still sitting at home?"

I thought to myself that this was pretty cool since this almost never
happens. Runners are notorious for our grim, suffering expressions,
rarely acknowledging anything other than the placement of our feet and
labored breathing. Against my will, a thought popped into my head: "What
if he has a zombie virus that he just passed along to me?"

Utterly ridiculous, even slightly insane, I know! But the thought, once
embedded in my brain, just wouldn't let go. I noticed that I was rubbing
my hand against the front of my shirt, as if to wipe away the imagined
virus. I could only shake my head in wonderment: "Kottler," I thought,
"you've lost your mind! Here it is a gorgeous day, enjoying a run,
encountering a friendly compatriot, and all you can think of is that he
infected you by touching your hand?" (By the way, this was years before
the COVID pandemic when it never crossed anyone's mind that touching
people might be dangerous.)

As crazy as the idea might sound, it then occurred to me that if this
really was some kind of deadly virus, wiping it on my shirt would hardly
keep me safe. So I stopped to rub my hand in the sand before immediately
turning around and heading back home, all the way whispering to myself,
"Don't touch my face, don't touch my face."

Okay, I admit: It *does* seem like I lost my mind. And you may be
wondering how this can possibly be related to therapy and storytelling.
My point is that stories can sometimes seem so vivid and immersive, so
powerful and persuasive, so emotionally evocative and impactful, that
they seem like they are *real*. And here's the kicker: It turns out in
the research that followed, I learned that I am hardly alone in the way
I was so completely involved in this fictional tale that I couldn't let
go. As far as the brain is concerned, there is an impressive body of
evidence to demonstrate how it has evolved over time as essentially a
storied organ. Humans have developed the means to accrue vicarious
experiences, whether climbing mountains; visiting faraway, exotic
places; chasing a serial killer---or being pursued by one---even
surviving a zombie apocalypse, all within the safety of a chair. It is
surmised that *mirror neurons* in the brain function as "as if"
receptors, simulating experiences that might better prepare us to face
danger or adversity ([Bahinga,

2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-333){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0119}).
Although the research on this phenomenon is somewhat tentative and has
its critics ([Hickok,
2014](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-128){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0120};[Turvey,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-310){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0121}),
it is still a compelling explanation for why we are so profoundly
impacted by vicarious experiences that really feel like they are our
own. We may never have to deal with raging zombies, vampires,
werewolves, or serial killers (all
[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_69}manifestations of predators) or face
floods, cyclones, riots, wars, or other disasters, but it helps allay
fears to consider the ways we might cope.

You'd only have to reflect on the stories that have irrevocably changed
your life to jump on board this bandwagon. There are films, shows, and
novels that leave us forever different, opening up new avenues of
thought and feeling. We watch programs, plays, or movies or read novels
that leave us dissolved in terror or tears. There are fictional
characters on the screen or in books that really *do* feel like our
closest friends. The appeal of reality shows or celebrity attachments
similarly reveals the very strong emotional connections that people feel
toward those they've never even met. And once again our brain treats
these relationships as if they feel (almost?) real. Indeed, there is
some evidence that fiction is actually even more powerful than
nonfiction or self-help books precisely because of the high emotional
arousal and complete immersion in the experience ([Appel,
2008](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-6){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0122};

[Vanderbes,
2013](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-313){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0127}).

That's just part of the story, so to speak. Stories are so much a part
of our daily lives that we don't stop to think about all the ways we are
influenced, persuaded, affected, and sometimes manipulated by various
narratives. Gossip consumes something like half of all human
conversations, sharing stories about outliers, sexual improprieties, and
strangers in our midst, not to mention juicy secrets. Gossip may have a
bad reputation, but it is actually quite helpful to share intelligence,
keep people in line, and discuss both prosocial and inappropriate
behavior within the group ([Beersma & Van Kleef,
2012](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-15){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0128};
[Giardini & Wittek,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-98){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0129};
[Hartung et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-117){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0130}).
I came across one interesting theory that women may have invented
language primarily as a means to trade gossip about potentially
unreliable men since the consequence of mating with a poor choice would
have been catastrophic and life threatening for the mother and infant if
the partner didn't stick around to help with protection and food
gathering.

Add up all the time that the average person spends watching television
per day (3 hours), listening to music lyrics (1 hour), watching movies,
and using other media, and we can appreciate that our lives are
essentially formed through these narratives. Currently, even text
messages are (very) short stories that are so pervasive that they are
simply accepted as standard communication. Emojis are even shorter
"stories" represented as a single symbol! And even when we are sleeping
the brain effortlessly and automatically converts random fragments of
memories and thoughts into the structure of a story. We thus tend to
better remember and retrieve information that is coded into narrative
form. All this adds up to the realization that if we truly want to be
persuasive and influential, the best avenue to
[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_70}do so isn't by giving advice, lecturing,
scolding, threatening, interpreting, or explaining, but rather by
sharing a story that is specifically designed to have maximum impact.

### Stories in Therapy {#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-div1-38 .sec1}

The term "narrative" and the reference to "stories" have an assortment
of different meanings and occur in a variety of contexts. You might
bring to mind "narrative therapy," one approach that features a client's
dominant stories as useful material to recast and reauthor. Yet
storytelling has such a distinguished history in our profession
regardless of the way it is conceived and the terms used to describe its
processes. Stories that may have solid therapeutic content could very
well be consumed vicariously in the form of autobiographies, memoirs,
diaries, biographies, and all kinds of fiction. Our interest is in
psychological narratives rather than those with a literary bent.
"Literary narratives end on the last page," [Ward
(2019)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-316){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0131}
pointed out, "yet have the capacity to preserve a story and cultural
detail, whereas psychological narratives are circular stories,
generational and enduring in memory, overarching culture and society."

One of the main differences between literary stories meant for
entertainment and stories told in therapy is that in the latter accuracy
and veracity matter---a lot. Clients do sometimes shade the truth, leave
out certain critical details, exaggerate particular things, even
outright lie at times, and that is far more significant than when
"unreliable narrators" in fiction do so for purposes of tension. In one
sense, if the client believes the story that is being told, that makes
it "true," but such fabrications make our job so much more difficult.
Trust, after all, is the glue that bonds the therapeutic relationship;
if we can't trust our clients to be honest and straightforward in the
stories they share with us, we are operating mostly in the dark.

Sometimes the current political scene reminds me of the wars we used to
have in our profession, arguing and fighting about who had cornered
"truth," denigrating everyone else who didn't subscribe to the same
worldview and beliefs. The legitimate focus of our work, many would say,
is coming to terms with the past and revisiting stories during the early
years. Others would insist that a far more useful area is to invite
clients to talk about stories in the present, what is going on in their
lives right now. And still others would urge clients to create stories
about their future and what it could be. Likewise, there have been
heated debates about keeping conversations centered on feelings---or
thoughts, behavior, or sensations in the body. Even today, there are
still rather passionate advocates of experiential therapy versus others
that hone in on empirically supported
[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_71}treatments (which are hardly mutually
exclusive). Then there are the dozens of popular approaches currently on
the scene, all of which have their fans and advocates. The good news is
that with the emphasis on integration and pragmatism in today's climate,
the debates have been far more civil and mutually respectful.
Nevertheless, there are still many disagreements about which approaches
are best, for which clients, in which circumstances, each of which is
supported by compelling "evidence."

Perhaps one of the features that unifies all forms of therapy, something
on which we might all agree, is that therapy is essentially a storied
experience, one in which the bulk of our time is spent listening to
client's reports, prompting them to consider alternative ways to frame
those experiences, and then offer other stories in a variety of
different forms ([Kottler,
2015a](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-167){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0132}).
Given the different conceptual and language systems that various
theories favor, it is no surprise that this process is described
differently. Most obviously, narrative and constructivist therapists
take the lead since so much of their work revolves around the ways that
stories are conceived, interpreted, and internalized. Feminist and
social justice advocates also look at the ways that stories have been
"colonized" by the cultures within which we live. Almost every other
therapeutic system similarly utilizes storytelling as its essence;
whether exploring self-talk, utilizing reframing, challenging underlying
beliefs, reflecting on disowned and neglected feelings, imagining
alternative outcomes, making different choices, or offering different
interpretations, they are all interventions that have stories at their
heart.

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-009.jpg)

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_72}There have thus been quite a number of
sources that explore the power of storytelling as an agent of change
([Bucay,
2013](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-28){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0133};
[Renken,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-265){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0134}).
This has been especially relevant and applicable with clients from
indigenous and similar backgrounds in which stories are so much a part
of individual and cultural identity ([Friskie,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-88){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0135}).
There is also considerable literature related to how stories may be
incorporated into the therapeutic process ([Adler,
2013](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-2){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0136};

[Yano & Lima,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-333){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0142}),
as well as the ways that stories within the larger world influence
political and social movements ([Gottschall,
2012](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-104){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0143};
Hagstrom & Gustaffson, 2019; [Krause & Rucker,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-193){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0144};
[McAdams,
2006](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-219){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0145}).
Rachel Carson's *Silent Spring,* for example, helped to spark the
environmental activist movement. Upton Sinclair's *The Jungle* was
instrumental in creating the workers' rights and union movement. Harriet
Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* may have actually been one of the
sparks that launched the American Civil War, just as Thomas Paine's
*Common Sense* did the American Revolution. St. Augustine's
*Confessions*, Machiavelli's *The Prince*, and Henry David Thoreau's *On
Civil Disobedience* were all powerful forces for change in their times.
Then there are all the influential sacred stories that have formed the
basis for the world's religions. It's pretty clear that particular
stories can lead not only to wars, political calamities, and societal
destabilizations but also to breakthroughs in therapy and everyday life.

Why is storytelling such a critical part of what we do, and what
functions does it serve within the therapeutic process, regardless of
the particular approach? Here is a list of features to consider:

::: list1
[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-60}[1.]{.enumerator}Stories
capture attention. Immediately. Just hearing the words, "Once upon a
time" puts us into a trance. Stories are entertaining and provocative in
ways that mere conversation can't touch.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-61}[2.]{.enumerator}Stories
naturally follow the structural properties of memory. We tend to be more
likely to hold on to ideas or experiences, as well as respect "facts,"
when they are embedded in stories.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-62}[3.]{.enumerator}Therapeutic-type
stories such as metaphors offer coded information in an efficient
package. Just as a picture is worth a thousand words, a metaphor can
capture and hold complex ideas that can't be merely described or
explained. Pictures also access unconscious processes to enhance their
potential for promoting change.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-63}[4.]{.enumerator}Given
that vivid storytelling provides a kind of "direct experience" through
vicarious imagination, we can lead clients to places they could never
otherwise visit on their own.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-64}[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_73}[5.]{.enumerator}Well-told
stories activate strong emotional reactions, the kind that inspire,
motivate, or ignite passion. Review any of the greatest speeches ever
given, or a list of the most beloved TED Talks, and you will find that
almost all of them begin with a compelling story that rivets audience
interest. Interestingly, almost always the self-disclosures are
self-deprecating rather than heroic.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-65}[6.]{.enumerator}Stories
can be "hypnotic" in that they can induce altered states of
consciousness through immersion in the narrative. When you are reading a
great novel or watching an exciting film, hours fly by, and it feels as
if you have literally entered into the action.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-66}[7.]{.enumerator}Stories
almost always take place within a particular cultural and historical
context, whether within an individual or the larger community. The
narrative is understood as representing certain social or environmental
values that are critical to the meaning making.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-67}[8.]{.enumerator}Storytelling
often bypasses resistance and defensiveness because of its subtlety and
visual imagery. You can *explain* something that is threatening or
*tell* clients they need to do something that they don't want to do---or
you can tell a story that contains within it a plot or characters by
which clients can position themselves or identify with the action that
may parallel their own struggles.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-68}[9.]{.enumerator}Because
stories have multiple dimensions of complexity and cognitive processing,
they operate on levels we don't thoroughly understand but still have
powerful effects.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-69}[10.]{.enumerator}Stories
produce overarching, organizing scaffolds that assist with deeper
understanding of events and experiences.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-70}[11.]{.enumerator}We
present alternative realities that may be possible as viewed through
fantasy stories or fairy tales. They often include creative pathways and
options for viewing problems and their solutions.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-71}[12.]{.enumerator}When
therapists disclose (appropriately and well-timed) personal stories,
they reduce the power imbalance in the relationship as well as model the
kind of deep sharing that is desirable for the client.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-item1-72}[13.]{.enumerator}Alternative
stories constructed by therapists help to reframe and reconstruct the
"victim stories" of trauma survivors into versions that emphasize
courage and resilience.
:::

This fairly extensive list is rather persuasive in presenting the case
that so much of what we do involves the mutual exchange of stories with
others. Given that this is such a big part of our jobs, it's interesting
that although we receive so much training in various interpersonal and
therapeutic skills, []{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_74}one area that has been
sorely neglected is the means by which to become better and more
effective storytellers.

### Harnessing the Power of Storytelling {#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-div1-39 .sec1}

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-010.jpg)

Throughout the ages, storytelling has been the primary means by which
elders have passed along the traditions, values, and rituals of the
tribe or people. Whether in the form of myths, legends, sagas, fairy
tales, or cave paintings, critical information about hunting grounds,
enemies, triumphs and defeats, or historical figures are preserved in
collective memories. Values, laws, and moral transgressions are common
themes, designed to teach important lessons and warn tribal members of
the dire consequences of breaching established norms. As mentioned,
gossip, another form of storytelling, is also employed universally to
ensure compliance to established norms and keep outliers in line. That's
why people are so curious about sexual improprieties, which represent
unsanctioned mating, or individuals who seem strange or mysterious---and
therefore potentially dangerous because of their unpredictability and
potential powers.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_75}One purpose of stories, beyond any
entertainment value, has always been about passing on wisdom, tolerance,
and flexibility in thinking about oneself and others as well as
phenomena within the larger world. It isn't just about the stories
themselves but how they are part of the *relationship* between the
storyteller and the listeners/readers. This is as much the case with
respect to indigenous storytellers as psychotherapists since so much of
the connection an audience feels is not only with the characters in the
story but also with the narrator. When one village in Africa was
presented with a television for the first time, the people were beguiled
by this box that told stories from around the world, complete with
moving pictures. But after a while, the villagers drifted away and
returned to their elder storyteller. When they were asked why they would
make such a choice, they agreed that although this box knew many
stories, their own storyteller knew *them*.

Prescribing stories in the form of bibliotherapy has long been a
tradition within our field, one in which clients are asked to read
certain articles or books that directly relate to their presenting
problem. Therapists tend to recommend favorite self-help books to
compliment discussions in sessions and reinforce the work completed, yet
there are also many options within the genre of inspirational memoirs
and biographies, films, and television shows, especially those that
highlight recovery from emotional disorders and life difficulties.

Although such action is certainly relevant and appropriate, perhaps even
useful at times, it's a rather limiting way to think about this mode of
learning and transformation. If fiction is often more impactful than
self-help materials, it is because of the emotional valence, total
immersion in the experience of the story, vicarious identification with
characters who struggle with parallel or similar issues, and the
restraint of critical thinking that may keep ideas at arm's length. For
instance, in this nonfiction book you might find yourself continuously
challenging some of the things I've said, questioning their validity
based on your own experience. You disagree with some of my ideas, even
argue with me inside your head. You skip sections that seem boring or
uninteresting. Most of all, whereas you may *think* about the ideas, you
don't necessarily feel particularly *impacted* by them in such a way
that you will remember and use them in a meaningful way. It is for this
reason that a number of therapists might recommend the kind of stories
to their clients with which they might best identify. We are also hardly
limited to books since we might also prescribe films, videos or
television shows that resonate with a client's predicament and reveal
actions and solutions that have not been considered previously.

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_76}Most therapists also share stories about
themselves, their beliefs, and their priorities that might be
instructive in certain situations. This could involve something rather
basic and simple to further make a connection, such as saying, "Yeah, I
also have two children, both in college." It could also involve teaching
a particular point that is based on prior experiences: "Yes, when I was
in a similar situation I recall feeling much the same way, but there was
one instance when. . . ." We also share stories that we have collected
over time and filed away in our catalogue, each one targeted to a
specific purpose (see [Box
4.1](#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-boxedMatter-1){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0146}).

One subject that therapists struggle with, especially after the
polarizing Trump era, is to what extent their own political beliefs and
values ought to be revealed in sessions. The vast majority of
practitioners (87%) admitted that such topics did arise in
conversations, with mixed results, depending on how well aligned their
beliefs were with the client ([Solomonov & Barber,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-289){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0147}).

It's beyond the scope of a single chapter to cover *all* the ways that
therapists might improve their storytelling ability to increase their
effectiveness, but there are a number of resources available that
present the most critical skills ([Aguilera et al.,

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_77}These resources cover some of the basic
ideas, such as the importance of immediately grabbing attention with a
"hook"; being as dramatic and expressive as possible; using both
dialogue and vivid, descriptive details to make the narrative come
alive; and, most importantly, customizing the story to fit the client's
specific needs to make it personal and most relevant. We don't want
clients asking themselves, "So, why are you telling me this?" In
addition, it also helps to engage curiosity by presenting a conflict or
problem to which the client can relate and including some feature that
is novel to catch the client by surprise. Finally, in the best tradition
of our profession, it is often recommended *not* to explain the story
but to allow clients to find (or create) the meaning and personal
relevance to their own lives and presenting problem.

Although we took courses in each of the standard specialties during
training years and invest considerable time and effort improving our
abilities in a number of domains, learning to become a better
storyteller is not typically part of the curriculum even though it may
be the most essential skill of all (see [Box
4.2](#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-boxedMatter-2){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0159}).

:::

The deliberate, strategic focus on the power of stories in clients'
lives is absolutely critical when working with individuals who are
recovering from []{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_78}trauma, especially
refugees and survivors of abuse ([De Haene et al.,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-50){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0160}).
They must be provided a safe, supportive relational space to share their
struggles and honor the suffering they have endured. So often our role
in such cases is not only to simply hold the stories but also to
collaborate as coauthors, refashioning the client's role from that of a
helpless victim to that of a survivor and ultimately to the position of
heroic figure who managed to achieve so much under such extraordinarily
difficult circumstances.

In one collection of such stories ([Kottler, Banu, & Jani,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-176){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0161}),
a dozen refugees from Afghanistan, Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Vietnam, Iran,
Syria, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Liberia, and Miramar, among others, were
provided the opportunity to tell their stories of displacement, escaping
violence and abuse, surviving torture and sexual assault, losing loved
ones to violence and war. Yet their stories were framed as messages of
hope and resilience once they were asked to concentrate on the growth,
benefits, and gifts that they received as a result of their struggles.
That, more than anything else, is one of our most important and useful
roles in people's lives---when we assist them in reshaping their
narratives in more empowering ways.

When Aisha was just 9 years old she was forced to flee her homeland in
Sierra Leone because of atrocities committed against her people during a
civil war. After spending most of her childhood on the run, hiding from
soldiers bent on genocide, trapped in refugee camps, separated from her
family and parents, she eventually found safety through a benefactor who
funded her education. After waiting more than a decade for asylum, she
was eventually allowed to resettle in the United States, where she
completed her education and became a social worker specializing in
refugee resettlement. "I think it's important to remember," she ended
the story about her experience, "that in all of our struggles come great
lessons and blessings, and I am happy to say in that in my journey, I
found strength and discovered my purpose" ([Koroma,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-156){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0162},
p. 115). Aisha's "purpose" was directly related to the meaning she
created from her suffering that permitted her to help others in a
similar position. But until she was given the opportunity, support, and
encouragement to share the story of her life she had mostly kept to
herself, she never fully embraced her pride and courage in overcoming so
much adversity.

### Thinking of Yourself as Professional Storyteller---And Listener {#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-div1-40 .sec1}

The next chapter delves more deeply into the ways that therapists are
influenced and impacted by the work that we do, and especially the
stories []{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_79}that we hear in sessions. Many of
these vivid and haunting narratives, so infused with strong emotion and
suffering, resonate at times with our own experiences, often triggering
countertransference reactions, or at least sparking powerful memories.
At other times, we might inadvertently become so immersed in the telling
that we lose our own sense of self in the process.

I have heard stories from clients who demonstrated so much courage and
resilience in the face of such suffering that I couldn't help but become
affected. We know that trauma, whether the result of abuse, neglect, or
catastrophe, is mostly all about the stories that one tells about the
experience, whether as a victim or as a survivor ([Botwin,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-25){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0163};
[Cummings,
2011](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-47){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0164};
T. [Hoyt & Yeater,
2011](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-134){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0165};
[Tedeschi & Moore,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-304){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0166};
[Wehr,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-320){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0167}).
In that sense, trauma is often conceived as essentially a "disordered
story" that is stuck in active memory with intrusive reexperiencing of
the events that must be processed within the context of a safe, secure
attachment ([Armstrong,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-7){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0168};
[van der Kolk,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-311){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0169}).
Survivors (who feel like helpless victims) are unable to form coherent
narratives about what happened. During sessions they stop and start,
presenting fragmented versions that lack consistency and require
assistance to transform the chaos inside of them into feelings of
empowerment ([Harrington & Neimeyer,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-116){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0170};
A. E. [Stewart & Neimeyer,
2007](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-294){#11_chapter4.xhtml_n0171}).
Our job in such situations is to help them to re-form the memories of
what occurred into a far better organized story with considerably less
emotional valence. It is as if we are editors, if not contributors, who
reframe, restructure, or reauthor the version of events as presented,
but always within a relational context that makes it safe to do so
without retriggering the symptoms.

Therapists invest all kinds of time and energy increasing their
knowledge, advancing their skills, attending workshops, and providing
supervision, as well as accumulating continuing education credits, most
of it focused on hot topics related to mindfulness, technology, virtual
delivery services, attachment issues, and neurobiology. Certainly these
are all useful and critical areas, but we could also invest a lot more
of ourselves into becoming more effective storytellers who impact our
clients in constructive and *enduring* ways. After all, we are all
exposed to hundreds, if not thousands, of stories every single day---but
how many do we actually hold on to?

As far as what it's like to be a therapist whose job is to tell
influential stories, we are saddled with the responsibility for both
collecting teaching tales and increasing our ability to create them
collaboratively with clients. It is one of the most interesting parts of
our jobs to consider the ways that our own lives represent a collection
of stories. It's worthwhile to reflect on several questions related to
this theme:

[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_80}

child. It could have been sparked by a comic book, puppet show, song

story, novel, or a story told to you by someone else. Regardless of its
source, this story continues to haunt you to this day, perhaps in some
way responsible for who you have become.

Being a therapist means investing in the lifelong mission of collecting
and developing just the sort of stories that are likely to resonate most
with those we wish to help and inspire. Some of our own muses and
mentors have earned their reputations largely as a result of their
storytelling prowess, just as some of the most notable and interesting
books in the field include a collection of stories that we call "case
histories." When beginners ask for recommendations about favorite books
that reveal some of the most important themes in psychotherapy, veterans
often recommend some of the classics authored by Robert [Lindner

Many of us have learned over time that the best way to introduce complex
ideas is through an illustrative story. At
[]{#11_chapter4.xhtml_page_81}our core, all of us are storytellers,
whether in the role of therapist, teacher, parent, or human being.

### A Final Story That Requires *You* to Find the Point {#11_chapter4.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-4-div1-41 .sec1}

In 1969 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were training for
their moon landing in a desolate part of the Arizona desert located near
an Indian reservation. One of the tribal leaders was watching the
exercises with puzzlement, seeing these strange creatures ensconced in
space suits and helmets trying to lift heavy gear. "What are ya'll
doin'?" he called out to them.

::: prosequote
"We're preparing for a mission to become the first humans to land on the
moon," one of the astronauts politely explained and then resumed his
work.

The old man nodded, paused for a moment, and then asked, "Hey, I wonder
if you'd do me a favor after you land on the moon?"

"That depends on what you've got in mind," the astronaut answered.

"Well, you see, my people believe that holy spirits reside on the moon.
I wonder if you would memorize a message to pass on to the spirits?"

"Why sure! We can do that. What do you have in mind?"

"The spirits only speak our language so you would have to memorize the
message if that's okay?"

"We can do that but you'll have to help us practice so we get the
wording and pronunciation correct."

"Okay," the Indian elder agreed. "Listen carefully: *Ah mahna yah hah
masha ko."*

After slowly and methodically repeating the sounds until the astronauts
had them down, they asked the elder what the message meant.

The elder shook his head. "I can't tell you because this message is a
secret among my people."

When the astronauts returned to their base they searched around for a
staff member who belonged to the tribe so they could ask her what the
message meant. They each slowly pronounced the words as best they could,
correcting one another, until they were interrupted by the Indian woman
laughing.

"What's so funny?" they asked, totally confused.

"The message says: 'Do not trust anything these people tell you. They
are here to steal your land.' "

## [How Clients Change Their Therapists](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0007) {.ch_title2}

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-div1-42}Sitting in a
prominent place in my office is a small vial containing an inky mixture
of earthen ingredients. It was given to me by a Peruvian witch doctor
who believed that clients affect their therapists in mysterious ways
just as we influence them. He felt that healers, whether in the jungle,
suburbs, or cities, need protection against the evil spirits that
emanate from people who are suffering.

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-011.jpg)

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_83}According to an ancient Incan legend
passed on from one generation of healers to the next, all mental and
physical illnesses result from an impure soul or else toxic energy from
someone who feels wronged. The mental spirit of the healer, his or her
powers of suggestion and magical powers, can purify a sick soul and
restore inner control. This purification is always undertaken at great
risk---for the destructive energy emanating from a patient also infects
the spirit of the healer.

We had spent the previous evening on a mountaintop where a group of
pilgrims had journeyed to this remote village in the Amazon, hoping that
a *curandero* (healer or shaman) would alleviate their emotional or
spiritual suffering. After hours of imbibing *ayahuasca* (hallucinogenic
substance derived from cactus), chanting, singing, and sharing stories
of struggle and despair, the witch doctor and I retired to his home to
debrief his healing ritual. Since I had been introduced to him as a
shaman among my own people, he was concerned about my welfare when I
disclosed to him that I was also a holder of secrets. Whereas I have no
particular evidence that this inky potion he gave me actually protects
me against clients' toxic energy, it has sat on my desk for the last 40
years; in some ways, this gesture was the impetus for me to write this
book in the first place.

### Sacred But Risky Encounters {#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-div1-43 .sec1}

Most therapists understand that they jeopardize their own emotional
well-being when they intimately encounter the pain of others. Even with
our training, experience, and preparation we are still vulnerable to
slings and arrows of sorrow and suffering that bombard us each day. No
matter how careful we are, how inflexibly we enforce boundaries, how
often we seek supervision or personal therapy, we are still deeply
affected---for better and worse---by the actions, behavior, and stories
that penetrate our core.

Carl Rogers related the story of his involvement with a deeply disturbed
woman. His ambivalence about the case, and confusing feelings toward
this woman, led him to vacillate in their relationship between
professional aloofness and the genuine warmth that was to become his
trademark. His client became increasingly erratic, irrational,
unpredictable, and hostile. She began stalking him, even following him
after his relocation from Ohio State University to Chicago. As her
dissatisfaction with the therapy grew, she became even more critical and
demanding of Rogers, piercing his defenses and triggering his feelings
of inadequacy. "I recognized that many of her insights were sounder than
mine, and this destroyed my confidence in myself; I somehow gave up my
self in the relationship" ([Rogers,
1972](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-269){#12_chapter5.xhtml_n0187},
p. 57). []{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_84}Continuing this destructive
relationship eventually led to a psychotic breakdown for the client and
to a nervous breakdown for her therapist. Rogers believed he was going
insane as a result of the collapsed boundary that occurred with this
client. Feeling trapped, helpless, and unable to sort things out on his
own, he eventually headed to Atlanta, where he believed that Carl
Whitaker was the only therapist in the world who might be able to help
him. After several phone consultations with Whitaker on his long,
circuitous journey south, he eventually returned home, where he began
treatment with a local therapist (one of his doctoral students), who
eventually helped him come to terms with the toxic effects from this
client ([Kirschenbaum,
2009](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-151){#12_chapter5.xhtml_n0188}).
Like so many such stories, this crisis became a breakthrough for Rogers,
not only with respect to his personal well-being but also regarding the
future trajectory of his career that led him to abandon academic and
clinical work for increased devotion to promoting social justice and
world peace, eventually earning him a nomination for the Nobel Peace
Prize (not to mention an Academy Award for best documentary film).

The experience of any practitioner would attest to the emotional and
intellectual strains of living constantly with clients' crises,
confusion, and intense suffering. We sit in a sacred vault, completely
isolated from the rest of the world and all other intrusions,
accompanied only by those who have lost hope, who live with excruciating
agony, and who sometimes try to make others' lives as miserable as their
own. Even with the best defenses and clinical detachment, we are still
sometimes polluted by this pain.

Our professional effectiveness, not to mention our personal well-being,
is affected by the intimate relationships that have become the trademark
of our work. We live with the pressure of trying to meet our own and
others' expectations. Despite our best efforts to convince ourselves of
our limitations, we feel responsible for clients' lives. We experience
repetition and boredom that comes from having an assembly line of people
pass through our offices (or across our screens), not to mention the
added stress of supervisors and quality review boards looking over our
shoulder to monitor our progress. We feel inadequate for not knowing
enough, for not being able to help more people, and for not doing more
for them. When we do manage to make a significant difference in
someone's life, we then struggle with helping make those changes last.
Throughout these close encounters with people in pain, our own issues
are constantly touched, our old wounds reopened.

Consider the experience of therapy for *both* participants.
Confidentiality, and therefore privacy, are implicit parts of the
encounter. The level of intimacy that is sometimes reached sometimes
exceeds those of our closest friendships. We are privy to secrets that
clients are barely willing to share []{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_85}with
themselves. We know clients at their best and at their worst. And as a
function of spending so many intense hours together, our clients come to
know us as well. We aren't nearly as inscrutable as we think. Clients
can read the nuances of our behavior and study our most subtle "tells"
or microexpressions, especially those that might reveal any sign of
disapproval. They recognize our annoying habits, how we repeat
ourselves, when we are bored or irritated. We are indeed partners on a
journey together.

### The Limits of Continuing Education {#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-div1-44 .sec1}

There is a myth that therapists learn their craft in graduate school,
although this belief is certainly not shared by the majority of
practitioners who realize that most of what they learned occurred
*after* they graduated. Equally inaccurate is that whatever was
deficient in our training could more than be made up for through
continuing education workshops. Every state, province, and jurisdiction
now requires therapists to accrue dozens of advanced training hours to
maintain their license. Although certainly well intended, this policy
has created a continuing education industry that is just as intent on
making a profit as on delivering a quality education. And let's be
honest: It is a game that most of us play.

Many of the workshops we are forced to attend are boring and meaningless
and hardly do more than satisfy our obligation. I say this with full
disclosure that I am part of the problem, as I am routinely asked to do
such trainings for state or national organizations (although I'd like to
believe that some people actually leave with something tangible and
useful from the experience). I recently asked an audience how many of
them would have chosen to attend the workshop if they had not been
required to do so---more than half raised their hands. So maybe it is a
good thing that we are mandated to seek additional training that we
would not otherwise consider.

In a scathing critique of the continuing education system, [Wright
(2005)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-325){#12_chapter5.xhtml_n0189}
made the point that there isn't much empirical evidence that continuing
education workshops actually improve the quality of professional
practice, although it is quite clear that they pad the profits of the
delivery services. For a fee, therapists can register for online
courses, download the tests, and then skim the articles for the answers
needed to pass. For clinicians with such a goal in mind, 6 hours of
continuing education workshops can be completed in less than an hour.

How many of you have ever left early from a workshop and yet still
accepted a certificate saying you attended the whole thing? How many of
[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_86}you sat in the room the whole time but
barely paid attention while you completed other tasks to keep you busy?
When was the last time you attended a workshop where you left with
something significant and useful or that stuck with you forever after?

Of course, the same thing could be said for books like this one. How
many volumes about therapy have you read in your life that really made
much of a difference? On such a variable interval reinforcement
schedule, it seems as though less than 1% is enough to keep us searching
for the Next Great Thing.

::: prosequote
"Therapy books?" one experienced clinician said with a smirk. "I stopped
reading those damn things years ago. They all seem to reinvent the same
things or try to advocate their point of view, which sells more of their
books."

"You don't read books in the field anymore?" I repeated in a neutral
voice, intrigued but still appalled by what this person was saying.

"Have *you* read any of them lately?" Then he laughed. "Oh yeah, that's
right, you write them, don't you?"

I smiled politely and resisted digging back. "What about journals?"

"You're kidding, right?"

I waited, a bit, punitively I must admit.

"When is the last time you found something helpful in a journal? They're
all about these academics getting tenured, which is directly
proportionate to how many statistical tables they include."

"Okay, then, you don't read journals. You don't read books . . . "

"I didn't say I didn't read books, just not *therapy* books. I've read
enough of them to last a lifetime."
:::

It turns out that this therapist read voraciously---philosophy,
anthropology, history, literature, contemporary fiction, poetry, dozens
of magazines, plus social media. He seemed intensely motivated to become
better at what he does as a clinician; he was just insistent that this
couldn't happen for him in the sanctioned professional literature, which
only made him feel staler.

This may be a rather extreme form of rebellion, rejecting *all* the
research and writing in the field, claiming it has no value, but it
nevertheless illustrates that something we rarely talk about is the ways
our clients turn out to be our best teachers.

So, if we don't learn to be therapists from just our formal or
continuing education, how does excellence develop? Certainly it develops
from supervision with more experienced mentors who guide us along the
path. But just as often, it is our clients who teach us to become better
at what we do.

### []{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_87}The Enduring Power of Client Relationships {#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-div1-45 .sec1}

When clients' impact on therapists is discussed at all, it is almost
always done in the context of negative effects. A search of the
literature will generate such terms as blurred boundaries,
countertransference, codependence, projection, overidentification,
compassion fatigue, vicarious trauma, secondary trauma, and loss of
control, all implying that the therapist must be *very* wary of the ways
that clients can affect us. From the earliest stage of our careers, and
throughout much of our supervision, we learn to be very cautious and
careful about allowing our clients to touch us or break through the
professional barriers that are supposedly in place to protect clients
but are really designed as much to protect us.

Because I feel so privileged by the relationships I've had with my
clients and what they have taught me, I have long been curious about the
*positive* influence they have on us. I reflect after almost every
session what I learned in the previous hour, about this person I'm
seeing, about the therapy process, and often about myself.

I had been working with a young woman who first showed up with a shaved
head and wearing a brown robe. My first thought was that she was a
member of some religious cult until she clarified she was a Buddhist nun
who had been living in a monastery in Asia for many years until she had
been forced to leave because of a food allergy she had developed. She
returned to the United States completely at a loss about how to adjust
to this new culture and environment. When I asked her how I could help
her, she said she wanted me to teach her how to live in this world that
was so unfamiliar to her.

Throughout our conversations, I was spellbound by the way she looked at
life in Southern California, where we were living at the time. She had
never owned a television or a watch or mobile phone so she didn't know
how these things worked or really why they were required at all. She was
constantly puzzled (in a nonjudgmental, Buddhist way) about the choices
people made and the priorities they considered most important. During
one session I will never forget, she talked about how confusing it was
for her to figure out the bus system to get to work where she had been
hired to assist terminal patients at a local hospital. She was mightily
amused by how commuters always seemed to rush across the street to
transfer from one bus to the next one.

I looked puzzled because this seemed like pretty routine behavior to me.

"Buddhists don't run," she said with a laugh, "because wherever we are
is as good as any other place we might be." She then told me that she
tried, just as an experiment, to run with the others to catch the bus,
but started giggling because it struck her as so funny.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_88}That story stuck with me just long enough
that a few days later, when I found myself frustrated and impatient
waiting to get somewhere, I felt this lightning bolt of inspiration. I
pretended I was my Buddhist client and imagined what *she* would do. I
could feel all the tension drain away and found myself relaxed and even
perfectly calm.

I mention this one story not because it is unique, but because, at least
in my experience, it is so common. This led a colleague and I ([Kottler
& Carlson,
2006](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-180){#12_chapter5.xhtml_n0190})
to interview prominent clinicians in the field to tell us stories of the
ways they were transformed personally and professionally by their
clients. I find this reciprocal influence to be absolutely fascinating
and so often misunderstood or even ignored. Yet, in our interviews with
master therapists, we heard so many examples of this phenomenon:

::: list1
[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-100}[1.]{.enumerator}Some
were impacted by the level and intensity of empathic engagement in a
session or with a particular client.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-101}[2.]{.enumerator}They
talked about the profound impact of being a witness (and facilitator) of
major transformation in someone's life.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-102}[3.]{.enumerator}A
few were affected by extreme emotional arousal that occurred, whether
joy, frustration, fear, or anger.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-103}[4.]{.enumerator}A
few of the theorists were especially grateful for the ways their most
cherished ideas were validated by their work with particular clients,
essentially bolstering their own frameworks and agendas.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-104}[5.]{.enumerator}When
boundaries were crossed in some way, meeting outside of the office,
going for a walk, experimenting with some creative breakthrough, they
found that memorable.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-105}[6.]{.enumerator}Being
or feeling challenged may not be all that pleasant, but it was certainly
impressionable and often led to rethinking certain behaviors or beliefs.
:::

It was interesting the different ways that therapists interpreted the
question about a client who changed them in a significant way. Whereas
some chose to talk about the seminal case that helped them develop their
theory or validate their most cherished ideals, others were willing to
talk about the ways their lives were altered ever after by their
relationship with a particular client that was especially meaningful or
evocative or frustrating. William Glasser, the founder of choice theory
and reality therapy, mentioned one particular client who pushed him to
literally move outside his office to help her, thereby breaking him
loose from some of his most rigidly held conventions. Similarly, Arnold
Lazarus (multimodal therapy) mentioned a client who was complaining of
his inability to ever approach someone who was attractive, leading the
therapist to suggest a novel way they might work on this issue not just
by talking about it but []{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_89}rather going out
into the world and practicing recovery from rejection. This was a game
changer for Lazarus, just as it was for others we interviewed, like
psychoanalyst David Scharff, child therapist Violet Oaklander, or
constructivist Donald Meichenbaum, all of whom described particular
clients they remembered so vividly precisely because these clients
forced them to move far outside of their comfort zones. After 20 years
interviewing these notable figures about their most memorable cases,
this led me to conclude: "The clients we tend to remember most clearly,
and those who have impacted us the most, are usually the ones who tested
our limits, led us into new territory, presented novel problems,
introduced ideas we hadn't previously considered, and touched our hearts
and souls" ([Kottler,
2018a](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-170){#12_chapter5.xhtml_n0191},
p. 137).

The intersection between personal and professional lives, the ways that
our therapeutic relationships impact us and our clients influence our
thinking and behavior, can be either a tremendous burden or produce
valuable benefits and gifts (see [Table
5.1](#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-tableGroup-1){#12_chapter5.xhtml_n0192}).

:::

Consider in your own life the people you have tried to help in some
capacity, whether as a therapist or in some other role. Who stands out
as the one client who had the most impact on you, personally or
professionally or both? These changes you experienced could have been
positive or negative, but they occurred as a result of your relationship
with this person. Further, the changes endure to this moment.

When you consider the key dimensions of this helping encounter, what
made it so memorable and influential in your life and work? You would
have little difficulty identifying some of your own cases in which the
level and intensity of engagement was such that you were left limp and
reeling. Perhaps there was even a client who touched you deeply at such
a level that you are certain you will never forget him or her.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_90}Other theorists spoke about the ways they
were challenged by clients who forced them to go far beyond what they
thought they already knew and understood. It was intriguing how some of
these groundbreaking thinkers in the field could actually point to one
client, sometimes even one session, who was partially responsible for
the development of their seminal ideas. Until this point in their
career, they had been happily following a template that had been firmly
established and refined. Then they encountered a client who didn't
respond to their favorite methods, who didn't react positively to
*anything* they already knew how to do. In light of these setbacks and
repeated failures, the therapists were forced to invent something new,
something they'd never tried before or even heard of as possible.

Still others were far more personal in talking about how a particular
client left a deep impression by teaching them a valuable life lesson.
In my own case, I have made a great many profound, life-changing
decisions as a direct result of my contact with clients. Not all of
these have been heroic or desired changes, but I suppose that is one of
the prices we pay for allowing clients inside us.

### Haunted by Stories {#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-div1-46 .sec1}

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-012.jpg)

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_91}The previous chapter made the case that we
tell stories for a living---designed, we hope, to instruct and inspire.
Just as important is our job to listen and honor clients' stories that
are so poignant and heart wrenching that they are sometimes beyond what
we can comfortably hold. In many cases, we are the only person on the
planet who has been privileged (or burdened) to hear stories that are so
secret and forbidden that they have never been told before. In each
session, we hear another installment in the ongoing saga of a client's
life, a narrative that sometimes has as many bizarre plot twists as
anything we could ever find on television or in pulp fiction.

Every therapist has been exposed to stories (yes, "exposed" like a
virus) that still leave them shaking their heads---if not shaken in
their spirits. Some are life narratives filled with tragedy, abuse,
violence, and despair. Some resemble situation comedies or reality shows
that rival anything we've ever seen or heard in the media. And others
involve dramatic tales so remarkable that if they were ever produced as
movies, audiences could only assume that some crazy writer made them up.
Yet they are real---or mostly real anyway.

One therapist mentioned, without apology or shame, that he finds other
people's secrets and perversions to be absolutely fascinating. "I know
that everyone has some sort of hidden secret about themselves, things
that they may never even share with a spouse or partner, but they may
share it with *me*---and I love that! I love hearing about people's
'dirty laundry' mainly because I am nosy. It's not like I sit around all
day collecting these secrets, rather I just happen to find the taboo so
interesting, the things that people don't talk about, the things that
people do when they are totally by themselves."

Like this therapist, I have also been riveted by people's most private
moments and secret selves, what we all do behind closed doors when
nobody is watching. For one project ([Kottler,
1990](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-157){#12_chapter5.xhtml_n0193}),
I interviewed more than a thousand people over the course of 10 years,
asking them to tell me about the things they do when they're alone. I
have always been prone to some rather uninhibited behavior when nobody
is watching. I talk to myself in strange voices. I sometimes pretend my
house is under attack by aliens and use a squirt gun to fend off the
invaders. You know, the usual stuff.

There is a secret world, an alternative universe, that our clients
inhabit on a daily basis. When we hear these stories, we are transported
to locations we could never have imagined, to dark places where people
do harmful things and to strange realities with different rules. We hear
stories that are so bewildering, so bizarre, so amazing, that we can
hardly believe they are possible. While we listen with visible
casualness, inside our heads we are
[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_92}screaming, "Oh my gosh, you've got to be
kidding! That's the weirdest thing I've ever heard!"

You've got your own stories, some revealed in supervision, some shared
with colleagues and friends (identities disguised of course), and some
so tender or bewildering or disturbing we would never tell a soul. These
are not just amusing tales but representative of the kinds of stories we
hear from people who are troubled or live unusual lives. They haunt us
precisely because of their novelty, because they aren't quite like
anything we've heard before.

### The Things We Learn {#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-div1-47 .sec1}

Perhaps the greatest benefit of practicing therapy is what we learn on a
daily basis. Each client brings with him the sum total of his
accumulated knowledge, and his primary job is to share the context of
his life, complete with all relevant background information. We are thus
offered a glimpse into the most intimate world of humanity. We learn
about the customs, language, and culture of diverse ethnic groups. We
are exposed to differences in Italian, Persian, Chinese, Mexican,
Vietnamese, Jewish, African American, Puerto Rican, American Indian,
biracial, bicultural, blended, single-parent, or multigenerational
family structures. We learn about religions, unique foods, and even the
most intimate details of sexual and social behavior.

Here are just a few of the most important lessons that therapists report
they learned from their clients that they were able to apply to their
own lives:

::: prosequote
[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-106}[•]{.enumerator}There
is remarkable resilience and hardiness of people to tolerate such
excruciating pain and yet still keep fighting to regain some kind of
equilibrium and reasonable functioning.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-107}[•]{.enumerator}Personal
struggles and trauma can be for better or worse, depending on how these
experiences are processed.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-108}[•]{.enumerator}When
people appear resistant to change, it is often because of some hidden
and disguised benefits they are "enjoying" by remaining stuck and
helpless.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-109}[•]{.enumerator}Patience
is respecting the readiness, pace, and abilities of others to make
changes according to their own timeline.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-110}[•]{.enumerator}There
is the need to be accepting the limits of our own abilities and
humanness and learning forgiveness for our inadequacies.

importance of abandoning the treatment plan when things aren't working
and remaining as flexible as possible when things aren't working, a
major lesson for all life.

*ever* work harder than those we are helping in spite of the deep
commitment to their well-being.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-113}[•]{.enumerator}Repetitious
patterns are present not only in the dysfunctional behavior of our
clients but also our own futile efforts to help them.

is important to meet people where they are, not just where we would like
them to be.

waste so much time and energy focusing on stuff they really can't do
anything about instead of constructive efforts that are truly within
their power to control.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-item1-116}[•]{.enumerator}It
is important to take risks, with uncertain outcomes, if we ever hope to
grow.
:::

As we immerse ourselves in our clients' lives, we also spend much time
learning what people do for work. We learn about not only conventional
careers but also those on the fringe of society, about being on welfare,
in foster care, in the juvenile or criminal justice system. In any given
week, we may learn about life as a professional athlete, politician,
engineer, prostitute, or factory worker. As a byproduct of our
therapeutic digging, we find out the most interesting details of how
corporate decisions are made, how drug deals are consummated, how a poem
is created, how clothing is most easily stolen, what waiters secretly do
to customers they don't like, how the stock market works, how a tennis
player trains, how someone is really elected to office, how an assembly
worker copes with boredom on the line, how a seventh grader tries to win
friends and influence people, how an advertising writer thinks up ideas,
how a policeman controls his aggressive urges, and how another therapist
deals with burnout.

We have the privilege of knowing what people *really* think, feel, and
do when their guard is down. And we get paid for it. Not only does the
information we gain from clients help us better understand them, but
also such knowledge helps us better understand ourselves. Indeed, being
a therapist allows us to live several hundred or more lives, not as a
passive audience to a play or movie but as an active participant in the
process of helping others re-create their worlds.

Not only do we learn from our clients, but also our personal curiosity
often complements our professional preparation. The training programs of
therapists, whether in medicine, education, psychology, nursing,
counseling, family therapy, pastoral care, or social work, emphasize an
[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_94}interdisciplinary perspective to integrate
the study of mind and body. Biochemistry is a prerequisite for
understanding the organic basis of many emotional disorders as well as
the actions of psychopharmacological medication. Neurophysiology is
necessary for the differential diagnosis of psychosomatic illnesses.
Sociology, social psychology, sociobiology, and social anthropology help
explain the social context of symptoms and experiences. Educational
psychology provides theories of learning and development that we use for
facilitating healthy growth. Philosophy and general systems theory help
us reason logically, organize knowledge, and formulate coherent
explanations for physical and spiritual phenomena.

Freud found the writing of Dostoyevsky, Sophocles, and Shakespeare; the
sculpture of Michelangelo and Leonardo; the philosophy of Mill and
Nietzsche to be the inspiration for his theories. It was not his formal
medical training as much as his readings of *King Lear, Hamlet, Oedipus
Rex*, and *The Brothers Karamazov* that formed the cornerstone of his
theories. Freud was first and foremost an integrationist, able to draw
on the wisdom of poets, sculptors, neurologists, philosophers,
playwrights, and his patients to create a unified vision of the human
world.

In the tradition of Freud, many of his followers educated themselves as
generalists, with influences from diverse academic disciplines. Carl
Jung, for example, was heavily influenced by his Latin and theological
studies, as well as by the philosophy of Goethe, Schopenhauer, and Kant
and by the practitioners of the new science of psychiatry. Alfred Adler
was also influenced not only by the novels of Dostoyevsky but also by
philosophers like Kant and Nietzsche. Similarly, Rollo May, the North
American champion of existentialism, described perhaps the most
pragmatic recipe for a style of therapy that used ingredients from
philosophy (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger); psychoanalysis (Freud);
phenomenology (Merleau-Ponty, Husserl); art (Cézanne, van Gogh);
theology (Marcel, Jaspers); literature (Sartre, Camus, Kafka); and the
concentration camps (Frankl). There is, therefore, great historical
precedent in our field for learning as much as we can about
*everything*. Ours is a science of experience---not only from formal
research and case conferences but also from literature---that aids our
understanding of the complexities of emotion and behavior. Without
Shakespeare's plays, Dostoyevsky's novels, or Henry James's short
stories, our knowledge of anguish and conflict would be hollow, our
self-revelations one dimensional.

In examining the experience of doing therapy, especially family
sessions, the experience is likened to looking at oneself constantly in
the mirror, examining everything that occurs---or *didn't* occur---in
the context of what we may have encountered growing up or in our current
living situation. []{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_95}Clients are constantly
acting, reacting, providing input and feedback to us about how they are
responding to our own behavior. They also force us to look more closely
at our own families of origin and how they impacted us, as well as
better educate us about the ways that loved ones can come together (or
pull apart) during crisis or conflict.

When therapists are asked about special or memorable incidents that
occur in their work, they often point to new insights that developed,
"moments of meaning" that could have been quiet, subtle, or hardly
noticeable unless you were paying very close attention. These are some
of the gifts we enjoy as a result of the work we do in that all the
while we are talking to clients about their problems we are also
speaking to ourselves as a parallel process.

By and large, we are a pretty optimistic group since we prefer to see
the best in people and emphasize their strengths and resources whenever
possible rather than dwelling only on upsetting experiences. We view the
world through benevolent, hopeful lenses. Yet for those who work with
trauma, we are tested in ways for which we might not be fully prepared.
That is why there is so much discussion in the literature on compassion
fatigue, secondary trauma, and vicarious trauma. It is assumed that
seeing these kinds of cases would necessarily take a toll on the
therapist's emotional being.

Yet just as clients often experience what has been called post-traumatic
growth, so do therapists sometimes enjoy dramatic transformations as a
direct or indirect result of delving into a client's suffering. I spent
several months working in earthquake-ravaged areas in which I not only
had to see and treat hundreds of festering wounds, broken bones,
infections, and acute trauma, but also was subjected to terrifying
quakes every day. I still have flashbacks, startle reflexes to movement
or loud sounds, and haunting memories. I was overwhelmed most of the
time and terrified I would become infected by cholera, encephalitis, or
other contagious diseases that were running rampant with all the dead
bodies buried under the rubble.

In spite of these difficulties I also experienced so much incredible
learning and growth as a result of the mission, developing new skills
and confidence, bonding among members of our trauma team, and an
increased appreciation for the special moments of my life. This is
actually not uncommon among members of our profession in that we are
afforded so many opportunities to learn from our clients' lives and
stories, especially those accounts of heroic resilience and survival
that promote our own greater courage.

Among those therapists who work with trauma survivors, three quarters of
them consistently report that as a result of this work, they live their
lives more fully, treat others with greater kindness and respect, feel
[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_96}more emotionally expressive with loved
ones, and feel stronger as a result (Linley & Joseph, 2007; [Tedeschi &
Moore,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-304){#12_chapter5.xhtml_n0194}).
The more deeply we enter into the client's world and allow ourselves to
fully resonate with their experiences, the more likely we will be
changed by the relationship, for better or worse, depending on how we
process it. It is thus a peculiar and wonderful phenomenon that we are
able to enjoy the benefits of post-traumatic growth by proxy, through
the vicarious engagement with the client's own recovery ([Kang & Yang,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-143){#12_chapter5.xhtml_n0195}).

### Deepening Relationships {#12_chapter5.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-5-div1-48 .sec1}

"If doing therapy has taught me anything," a therapist explains, "it is
how to connect with others. I mean *really* connect. In my family of
origin, I was taught a very restricted, inhibited way of being with
others. I always played it safe and mistrusted others. But doing therapy
helped me to develop greater sensitivity, intuition, and blunted my fear
of judgment."

This therapist owes much of this progress to the work she does. "My
clients, many of whom were labeled mentally ill or dysfunctional, were
the ones who taught me to be a more empathic parent, a better partner, a
kinder daughter, and a more open friend. They are the ones who invited
me into a deeper level of engagement with others than I ever imagined
possible."

Therapists are relationship specialists, experts at navigating through
the most troubled conflicts and turbulent interactions. All day long,
people bring us their most intractable problems, their worst nightmares,
and we work with them to sort things out and devise alternative ways for
them to handle them. We spend our lives learning to become more
compassionate, empathic, and loving. We refine our interpersonal skills
so that we can communicate more effectively. All of this makes us not
only better therapists but also more responsive human beings in all our
other relationships.

A therapist attended a 60th birthday party recently and came across a
friend he hadn't seen in over 30 years. "Before long we were talking
about what really mattered in life. At one point, he paused for a moment
and said how surprised he was that we were even talking about things so
personal in such a public gathering. He then confided struggles he'd
been having, as well as a recent success that brought him a lot of
pride." The therapist was surprised by the intimacy and deep disclosures
they shared with one another, yet was not really that surprised because
this is what we do: We deepen conversations.

[]{#12_chapter5.xhtml_page_97}In one sense we become accustomed, if not
addicted, to deep, intimate relationships because that is where we
"live" during the time we spend with clients. Regardless of their age,
background, culture, and personality, we learn how to engage them on the
most intimate level possible. There is minimal, if any, small talk. The
clock is running during the brief intervals we have together, so we
spend as much time as possible talking about only the most meaningful,
significant subjects. Whenever the conversation drifts toward the
mundane or superficial, we gently lead it back (or forward) to more
personal engagement. As much as possible, we encourage clients to talk
about the taboo and the forbidden, to share their secrets and fantasies.
Whenever appropriate and useful, we use our skills to probe and prompt
strong emotional responses and help clients to express them more fully.
We help people think in symbolic and metaphorical ways about their
behavior. We help them look for deeper meaning. We talk about our own
relationship with them and ways we might deepen it even further. In
other words, we spend much of our work life engaged in the most intense
closeness with others that is imaginable.

Then we go home.

As much as being a therapist is a privilege and a gift, an opportunity
for us to continuously learn and grow, our clients sometimes touch us in
ways that are certainly not enjoyable or desirable. There are hardships
associated with the job and lingering effects that sometimes just don't
seem to go away.

## [Hardships of Therapeutic Practice](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0008) {.ch_title2}

[]{#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-49}![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-013.jpg)

Being a member of any profession has certain benefits, as well as
liabilities. To make some sweeping generalizations, accountants who
spend all their time dealing with numbers may be really good at managing
their own finances but somewhat less skilled at dealing with
relationship issues. Emergency room nurses may handle their personal
crises with calm assurance but have trouble relaxing when the action is
dialed down. Forestry []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_99}rangers may feel
perfectly comfortable when working or playing outdoors but struggle when
forced to spend prolonged time at home or an office. Mountain climbers
enjoy spectacular views on the summit of peaks but also endure the
limits of their endurance and the prospect of constant danger from
weather, avalanches, crevasses, and injuries. And then there are
therapists, professionals who are trained in the nuances of human
behavior, experts in negotiating interpersonal struggles, who also live
with the consequences of this career choice.

There is no doubt that we enjoy certain advantages as a result of our
chosen work. We have already explored how we enjoy a privileged position
in our culture as experts in the mysteries of human behavior. Most of us
have tremendous latitude in the ways we work; we're able to customize
the context, style, and structure of what we do to best fit our
preferences and personalities. We have the opportunity---even a
mandate---to keep learning, growing, developing, changing, evolving. Yet
with these benefits, there are other, darker consequences of this chosen
profession. Whereas some of these costs, such as dealing with failures,
difficult clients, and stress, have been well documented, others have
not been as acknowledged and deeply explored. This is particularly true
after the game-changing impact of the worldwide pandemic that not only
led to catastrophic hardships for the larger population, increasing
anxiety, fear, and depression, violent crimes, domestic abuse and
neglect, and greater economic disparities, but also affected the lives
of mental health professionals, who were also forced to reckon with a
dramatically changed world. "I can't be both a really worried human and
a good therapist at the same time," one therapist admitted. "I have to
kind of pick and choose" ([Madani,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-207){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0196}).

### Hardships Within Specialties {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-50 .sec1}

The various specialties within therapy present their unique challenges
and problems. In addition to dealing with the hazards associated with
seeing clients and functioning within an organization, each practitioner
must confront the identity problems she inherits with training. As we
all know, status, power, competence, and expertise are not allocated
equally among the specialties practicing therapy. Psychiatrists, for
example, must contend with their lack of early training in therapy and
an orientation toward the medical model that brands them among fellow
physicians as quacks who []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_100}don't do
anything and among their nonmedical colleagues as pill doctors who try
to do too much.

Many social workers struggle with their obsolete public image as
do-gooders who chat with people in their homes. Within the mental health
network, they fight for parity with psychologists, who have their own
problems trying to prove what they can do best. Psychiatric nurses,
family therapists, and mental health counselors quietly go about their
therapeutic work but may feel frustrated by their lack of recognition.
All clinicians, regardless of their chosen specialties and work
settings, carry a tremendous burden into a therapy session before the
client even opens his mouth.

Then there are the special hardships associated with the type of setting
where therapy is practiced. A counselor working with child protective
services and another working for the probation department feel
absolutely overwhelmed with the tragic stories they hear---of
unremitting violence, hopelessness, abuse, and suffering. Another
counselor working for social services assesses eligibility requirements
for financial aid among those who are homeless (or claim to be); she
encounters not only tragic poverty and despair but also fraud and
deceit. An elementary school counselor covers three different schools in
the district, with barely enough time to handle even the most pressing
cases in the most superficial way. Another therapist leads groups for
perpetrators of domestic violence, all of whom are court mandated to
attend sessions for a year and most without remorse or guilt for their
actions. A social worker for county social services speaks fluent
Spanish but now works in an area with mostly Vietnamese-speaking
clients, many of whom understand very little English (and no Spanish!).
Other practitioners work in halfway houses, refugee camps, crisis
intervention clinics, state mental health systems, veterans hospitals,
prisons, jails, juvenile detention centers, battered women's
shelters---all with shrinking budgets, increasing caseloads, and more
severe disorders. Then there are almost all the rest of us who were
trained and experienced working with clients in our offices, and then,
virtually overnight, we were forced to adapt to sessions online or on
the phone---all without much warning or preparation for this dramatic
shift.

Even private practice is not what it once was during the golden years.
Competition is fierce in the community. Managed care restricts both the
fees that can be charged and the length of treatment. Quality assurance
boards (what a name, huh?) micromanage treatment plans and require
ever-increasing documentation of services. What had once been considered
a relatively plush professional life, catering to the worried well---the
neurotic []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_101}privileged class---is now both
far more diverse and interesting in its clientele. There is a greater
need for private practitioners who are prepared to work in minority and
marginalized communities and to encounter greater challenges and
hardships.

### Problems of Beginners {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-51 .sec1}

There is a danger talking in much detail about the hardships of
therapeutic practice for fear it will discourage students, interns, and
those just starting their careers. After all, why scare beginners away
when they are often so filled with optimism, enthusiasm, and excitement
for their new profession? Yet it is ignorance about the challenges you
will face that most contributes to the feeling of being ambushed when
these challenges do inevitably occur. Without meaning to temper any
exuberance regarding your choice to be a member of our esteemed guild,
it would be negligent not to offer the same informed consent that you
are ethically mandated to provide for your own clients.

The truth is that being a therapist changes *all* your relationships,
and many friends and family will be left behind. You will face your own
most terrifying demons every week, and this takes its toll. You will be
underpaid and unappreciated. Most of the time you will be confused no
matter how carefully you try to present a confident image to others. You
will see people when they are at their worst, and you will be expected
to present yourself at your best---every time.

Therapists in training shoulder additional burdens related to their
fears of inadequacy and avoidance of failure. They are under competitive
academic pressure at the same time that they are struggling to develop a
professional identity and to reconcile some of the paradoxes of their
profession---to get close but not too close to clients, to be caring yet
detached, to provide support without fostering dependency, and to
unravel the ultimate mystery: How it is possible for so many of their
professors and supervisors to be equally effective in their work even
though they appear to be doing such different things? I remember sitting
in my first few classes, looking around the room, and thinking to myself
that I don't belong there. I didn't understand how this therapy stuff
really works even though everyone else pretended that it all made
perfect sense.

Perhaps most stressful of all for neophytes is reconciling the
discrepant feedback they receive. Present a case---*any* case---to a
collection of peers and watch the heated debates begin. One time I was
completely stuck with a young woman who had been deteriorating after
showing an initial surge []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_102}of progress. A
crucial point in our work together centered on the ambivalence she felt
toward men. She had as yet been unable to consummate sexual intercourse
because of an inability to lubricate sufficiently, perhaps because of
vaginismus, or tightening of the vaginal muscles related to anxiety.
"Why," she asked me at a critical juncture, "if I am so afraid of
penetration, is my most frequent fantasy of being raped?"

This is a good question---actually a brilliant question. Unfortunately,
I had no earthly idea regarding the answer. Because I could not think of
what else to do, I did what any self-respecting therapist in my position
would do: I stalled and put the focus back on her until I could get some
help. "That's a good question," I responded after a long a pause. "What
do *you* think it means?"

We hemmed and hawed for a while. The session ended with the resolve that
we would explore the issue in greater depth next time. The moment she
walked out the door, I cornered a tribunal of my peers. "Okay, folks,
here is the situation. What the heck does this mean?"

Another issue involved here was my feeling of inadequacy: If I were
*really* a good therapist, I would surely know what this means. My
uneasiness was only reinforced by my colleagues' easy assurance that
they understood this phenomenon. What confounds me to this day is that
each of their interpretations was different!

"She was obviously sexually abused. You checked this out, didn't you?"

Before I could reply, another chimed in, "I would think she has fears of
intimacy. I would reframe this as a relationship problem rather than a
sexual issue."

I took notes furiously. That last one sounded good, until the next
suggestion, and the next one, and the one after that. I heard five
different interpretations for the same case, all of which seemed
reasonable to me. I wondered how a doctor would proceed if she had a
patient with stomach pain and consulted with colleagues to examine the
patient and they came up with four radically different diagnoses and
treatments. Imagine if one diagnosed acute appendicitis while another
said no, this was a simple muscle strain, another claimed with authority
that it was just indigestion, and a fourth doctor said that this was
deferred pain and the real problem wasn't in the stomach at all. This
discrepant feedback we get from superiors, colleagues, and books we read
only add to the confusion, uncertainty, and stress we live with. We face
people every day who want answers, and we do our best to appease their
needs for certainty. But all the while, we have our own doubts: feelings
of uneasiness that are often made worse by the sheer diversity of
ideas---all with a devoted following---that flourish in our field.

### []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_103}Occupational Hazards {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-52 .sec1}

It was Sigmund Freud who first suggested that therapists submit
themselves for further treatment every 5 years because of the regressive
effects caused by constant exposure to clients' emotionally charged
issues. It isn't really that surprising he would have recommended such
ongoing treatment for therapists considering all the struggles he was
dealing with in his own life, the most notorious of which was his
addiction to cocaine. Even worse was his cigar smoking habit, which
eventually became so self-destructive that he continued the habit long
after he developed cancer of the jaw and mouth. Then there were a few
other emotional maladies---superstitious habits related to numbers, his
persistent insistence he would die at the age of 62, blackouts,
agoraphobia, and of course his obsession with instinctual drives.

There is actually a long and distinguished list of luminaries in the
field who suffered from similar kinds of mental difficulties, not to
mention the occupational hazards of this type of work. William James,
the first psychologist, struggled with depression throughout his life,
sometimes made worse by his deep research interests and investigations.
It's been interesting, as well, how influential psychologists chose to
investigate topics that were so directly related to their unresolved
issues.

Erik Erikson, for example, described stages of identity development
throughout the life span. He never knew his own father and became
obsessed with the meaning of personal identity, even choosing his last
name (Erikson, "son of himself"), declaring a singular identity. Victor
Frankl was all about finding meaning in suffering, hardly surprising
after surviving Nazi concentration camps. Abraham Maslow was utterly
controlled by his parents---told what he could do, what he should study,
who he could marry---but he eventually chose to defy his parents in
order to pursue his own self-actualization, an achievement he considered
the highest level of personal functioning. Alfred Adler almost died from
pneumonia as a child and became weak, insecure, and disabled; he
developed a theory of compensation for disabilities through
overachievement (that one applies to me as well).

Aaron Beck and Albert Ellis, the founders of cognitive therapy, both
felt weak and inferior earlier in life, plagued by emotional insecurity,
so they developed theories based on using logic to overcome irrational
fears. Kenneth Clark was subjected continuously to racism and oppression
as an immigrant from Panama of African descent and so developed a theory
of racial prejudice. Lawrence Kohlberg developed a theory of moral
development, fascinated with higher order decisions of personal choice
that guide []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_104}behavior. After developing an
incurable disease he chose to take his own life on his own terms. Marsha
Linehan spent her career researching and treating borderline personality
disorder after disclosing that she also suffered from this condition.
Again and again our field is filled with wounded healers who somehow
learned to face their own personal struggles by choosing a profession
that allowed them help others better understand their comparable
problems.

[Chapter
1](#08_chapter1.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-1){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0197}
mentioned how Carl Rogers developed a theory based on the importance of
being understood, a condition that he said he never really felt in his
own life. I've always viewed these imperfections, struggles, and
internal conflicts as badges of courage, actually enhancing their esteem
in my eyes. Certainly being a therapist only makes these burdens
potentially worse given the hardships that we face on a daily basis, but
they also provide so many opportunities for growth.

In the face of incredible emotional arousal---anger, sadness, panic,
despondency, conflict---the therapist is expected to maintain
neutrality, detachment, tolerance for frustration, empathy, alertness,
interest, and impulse control, all without feeling depleted, deprived,
and isolated. Further, being a therapist requires us to be
contemplative, self-analytic, and self-reflective, continually
self-monitoring our inner states, our motives and desires, our behavior
and interpersonal patterns. Although this continual focus on our own
internal states is great for promoting increased self-awareness, it can
also lead to a degree of self-absorption, and this is one of the major
symptoms of depression. Indeed, one of the things we hear a lot from
friends and family outside our esteemed guild is that we think too damn
much.

As if such demands were not enough, we are also supposed to be charming
and invigorated by the time we get home. Because our friends and family
know what we do for a living, they have higher expectations that we will
be superhumanly patient, forgiving, and compromising during those
instances when they have us locked in battle. If we should slip up in
some way or lose composure, some people will throw it back in our faces:
"And you say you're a psychotherapist?"

One social worker has worked for the county department of social
services for 12 years. She is completely entrenched in the
system---politically, emotionally, and financially. She is also cynical,
aloof, and sarcastic. Her job description as senior clinician sounds as
though it was written by a naïve, altruistic academic. There is little
time to spend with her clients because most of her energy is devoted to
keeping her position in the ever-changing
[]{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_105}power hierarchy. She is afraid of the
abused women she must treat---they seem so pathetic and remind her too
much of the way she feels some of the time. She commutes an hour into
the city each day and is patiently waiting for 18 more years to pass so
she can retire. She feels old at 34. She has seen too much of human
misery. She has nightmares about broken people without hope; she sees
the faces of children dotted with cigarette burns. She cannot leave the
system because she has a vested interest in the retirement plan.
Besides, where would she go?

A psychologist in private practice appears to have the best of all
worlds---a full caseload, freedom, self-employment, self-direction,
status, and relative financial security. What is there not to envy? But
he is trapped by his own success. He conducts 45 sessions per week,
neglecting his health, family, and leisure pursuits in order to maintain
his expenses and lifestyle. He has virtually no discretionary time. He
hasn't taken a vacation in years because he can't justify the cost of
losing two weeks' income in addition to the cost of the trip. He finds
it difficult even to meet a friend for lunch because he figures in the
cost he could have billed for his time.

A marriage and family therapist who splits her time between contract
work for a community agency and a part-time private practice feels as if
she is always looking for more to do. A single parent with complete
financial responsibility for her children, she can never quite get on a
solid footing. Most of the families and couples she works with cannot
afford her full fees, so her sliding scale has slid below what she can
afford to live on. There was a time when she loved doing family therapy,
but now it feels to her as if she is grossly underpaid for the quality
and quantity of work she does. She feels torn when a couple
cancels---finally an hour to recover from her previous sessions of the
day---yet when she does not work, she is not paid for her time. She
thinks seriously about taking on a third part-time job, just for a
little while to make ends meet.

The preceding examples of how a few professionals experience the
hardships of therapy portray only a minority of therapists and certainly
very few of those readers who would ever purchase and read a book on the
personal consequences of practicing therapy. Nevertheless, we all know
practitioners who have let the side effects of therapeutic work really
get to them. We shudder at the thought that it could be happening to us
at this very moment. And what is the "it" that infects the nervous
systems of people who try to help others for a living? How do our
clients get to us, unravel our precious control, haunt us with their
fears?

### []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_106}Sleepless Nights {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-53 .sec1}

Clients bring us their nightmares, drop them in our laps, and then leave
us to sort them out for ourselves. They have been enduring sleepless
nights for years; now the challenge for us is to keep their demons away.
Especially at night, when we are relaxed and our defenses are down,
images creep into our dreams, or, if we are lying awake, they invade our
sense of peace. We toss and turn, probably in synchrony with the very
client who infected us.

Any client's story could be the trigger, but there is usually one
particularly sad or terrifying tale that returns to haunt us when we are
alone in the dark. We tell ourselves it was someone else's misery, but
by then it is too late: The chain reaction has started, and we are
probing deeply into our own failures.

One image brought to me by a client will haunt me until I die. Even
though I had read stories and seen movies about this sort of thing, I
could never have been prepared for the intensity that I would feel from
being so close to someone who had been really and truly terrorized. To
add to the intensity of the encounter, unlike many people recovering
from trauma who tell a fairly disjointed, fragmented, chaotic story of
what happened, this woman had been a writer with a remarkable ability to
tell her tale with all the drama, intensity, and emotion that made it
feel like I had been in the room watching.

One day, when the client was living in a faraway city, she ran into an
old high school classmate who was on vacation. Although he was more of
an acquaintance than a good friend, she nevertheless knew him quite well
because he had been her senior class president. They were delighted to
run into each other after so much time and in such a large city. They
stopped to have coffee, chat, and catch up on their lives. Then they
parted ways. She went back to her apartment, and as was her habit, she
read stories to her little girl until the child fell asleep. Then she
began studying at her desk.

Several hours later, there was a knock at the door. She asked who it was
and heard her high school acquaintance's voice say that he had brought
something she had forgotten. As her hand hovered over the handle, she
saw her daughter standing in her bedroom doorway. She was momentarily
distracted as she swung open the door and turned to see her friend with
a disfigured, hideous grin on his face and a butcher knife raised in
each hand. The last thing she remembered was the hot burn of the steel
as it repeatedly entered her body and the screams of her daughter as she
passed out.

Although the woman eventually recovered from her wounds, she would never
again open a door without taking some evasive action. And she has never
since had a peaceful night.

[]{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_107}It has been decades since I heard this
story. I still hesitate before I open doors to strangers. And late at
night, I see people with hideous faces from my past coming at me with
big knives.

Every therapist has heard similar stories from their clients---people
terrorized and horribly abused; people subjected to the most awful
injustices and miseries; victims of rape, mutilation, attempted murder,
satanic cults, genocide, or disaster. Therapists may treat people who
sexually or physically assault their own children and people who have
been subjected to such actions. We even encounter parents who
accidentally or deliberately killed their children. Each of these
stories, told through the tears of ongoing anguish, penetrates us to
your core. We weren't actually present to witness the crimes against
humanity, but sometimes it sure feels that way. And rather than having
to come to terms with only one such atrocity, we must metabolize dozens
or even hundreds of them. This is but one source of ongoing stress in
the life of a therapist.

### Sources of Stress {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-54 .sec1}

Many therapists are heard to say that if only they could be left alone
to do their *real* work---the business of seeing clients---and insulated
from the squabbles and politics of their organizations, their lives
would be greatly enriched. The sad fact is that many staff groups can
resemble extremely dysfunctional families. Power struggles and resource
competition go on behind the scenes. You may be constantly triangulated
into conflicts with peers and supervisors that drain your energy and
demoralize you. All too often, what is best for clients takes a back
seat to the posturing of your most insecure colleagues. In addition,
limited budgets, threats of financial cutbacks, and demands of insurance
companies and managed care policies pressure you to compromise treatment
planning for the sake of economic realities.

Whereas our working environments ought to be a source of support,
nurturance, and growth, too often we attempt to function effectively in
spite of daily frustrations. In one private practice setting, the
therapists spend more time discussing how to beat the system and keep up
their billings than they do planning ways to help their clients. In a
community mental health center, staff members spend their free time
griping about supervisors' ineptitude and nonsensical rules. A substance
abuse treatment center lost a huge grant as a funding source, sparking a
civil war among the staff fighting over the meager resources. A refugee
resettlement agency lost funding because of racist, xenophobic policies
of their state leaders. []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_108}A group of school
counselors and social workers lament to one another that they never help
kids anymore because they are so locked into their scheduling and
administrative duties. Staff members at a university counseling center
complain that they cannot do their jobs properly because of a lack of
support among administrators who view their services as "nonessential."

In each of these cases, the professionals spend almost as much time
dealing with bureaucratic annoyances as they do getting on with their
clinical responsibilities. The usual pressures that they experience as a
result of their clinical work are exacerbated by so many additional
obstacles. The result is an alarming burnout rate and distress level
within our profession. Time pressures are often cited as the most
frequently occurring precipitant of strain, although organizational
politics, excessive workload, and conflicts with colleagues are also
mentioned frequently ([Grover,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-107){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0198};
[M. K. Lee et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-201){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0199}).

Most of the burdens, hardships, and stressors related to the job can be
grouped according to several categories ([Farber,
2016](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-70){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0200};
[Kottler,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-173){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0201};
[Moore et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-228){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0202};
[Norcross & VandenBos,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-243){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0203}).
The one we talk about the most includes *client-induced stress*, such as
those times when clients display angry outbursts, intense anxiety,
worsening depression, suicidal threats, or attempt to triangulate us
into family dysfunction. It is also rather upsetting when someone files
an ethics grievance (presumably vindictively), sues for malpractice, or
actually follows through on self-destruction. Finally there are
instances when therapists are stalked by clients and threatened with
violence.

Also frequently mentioned are sources of *work environment stress* that
often relate to being overworked, underpaid, overwhelmed, and
unappreciated. All of these feelings can be significantly exacerbated
when there are internal conflicts at the organization or agency,
infighting, injustices, unfair practices, or even harassment. Add to the
picture a touch of supervision and administration that are inadequate,
if not incompetent, plus unsupportive colleagues, an overbearing
supervisor, excessive paperwork, time pressures, or restrictions on
freedom, and the hardships become intolerable.

The third source of stress arises from those unforeseen things that
happen in our own lives, *event-related stressors*. These could include
health crises, money problems, major life transitions, change in job or
responsibilities, legal actions, or family difficulties. Unresolved
issues from the past, relationship difficulties, divorce or separation,
personal loneliness or feelings of isolation, pregnancy, child problems,
the death of a loved one, or just feeling stuck in one's life and career
also presents major areas of vulnerability. For practitioners who are
members of minority groups, there is []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_109}also
the added pressure related to entrenched racism, microaggression, and
discrimination that have been pervasive.

Finally there is *self-induced stress*, which represents our own
inability to take care of ourselves. Typical of this last category are
excessive rumination and worry, self-doubt, need for approval, feelings
of perfectionism, and poor lifestyle choices. Then there are inevitable
developmental crises in the therapist's life and career, losing a
desired opportunity, attaining licensure, or moving toward retirement.
Of course this last domain affects and impacts every other hardship
since it determines the way we typically navigate these challenges.

A pattern of distress may arise from each of these sources, one that
includes psychological symptoms (boredom, isolation, frustration,
irritability, depression); behavioral symptoms (procrastination,
substance abuse, lowered productivity, recklessness); and physical
symptoms (sleep disruption, appetite gain or loss, headaches,
respiratory problems, muscular tension). It appears as if the restraint
and concentration that we continually must exercise take their toll on
our mental and physical health. We develop many of the same symptoms
that plague our clients, only we are better than they are at denial. Not
only our bodies and minds suffer, but also our relationships.

### One-Way Intimacy {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-55 .sec1}

One of the tragic flaws of some therapists is not necessarily the
insatiable desire for intimacy but rather its avoidance ([Kovacs,
1976](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-192){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0204}).
Only within the sterile, ritualized context of a therapeutic session,
where clinicians are both boss and observer, can they feel safe. In this
controlled setting the therapist can experience loving relationships but
also avoid the risks associated with real family conflict. Whether we
actually got started in the helping profession to save the world, to
save our families, or to save ourselves, we enjoy getting close to
others and helping them solve their problems. Yet the intimacy a
therapist experiences with clients is quite peculiar and contrived in
many ways---there are rules and structures, even payment, for attention.

One major source of complaints to professional ethics committees and
state licensing boards involves alleged sexual intimacies between
clients and therapists ([Norcross & VandenBos,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-243){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0205}).
One common pattern has been called the "Svengali" scenario ([Pope &
Bouhoutsos,
1986](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-256){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0206}),
in which the insecure therapist creates and exploits client
dependencies. Others include "as if," wherein the therapist confuses
transference with infatuation; []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_110}"it just
got out of hand," in which emotional closeness grew beyond manageable
limits; "true love," or its rationalization as a justification for
abandoning professional boundaries; "time out," in which the therapist
makes an arbitrary distinction that what occurs outside the office does
not count; and "hold me," in which erotic contact escalates from comfort
gestures. In all these cases, sexual involvement results from the high
level of intimacy that makes both participants more vulnerable to
counterproductive entanglements.

We become for our clients not only objects of transference but also
living, breathing, loving, attractive people. Our clients' friends,
partners, and spouses pale in comparison to the ways they experience us
with unconditional acceptance, gentle support, and our extraordinary
relational skills. We are rarely angry, irritable, short-tempered, or
demanding (at least when on duty). Instead, we demonstrate limitless
compassion, patience, wisdom, and control. Our clients feel such
gratitude. Some of them, especially those who are most vulnerable or
manipulative, may wish to show their affection with their genitals.

It is clear why a client might be motivated to seduce a powerful,
attractive model who also may be a reminder of prior unresolved
relationships. What then of the temptations felt by the therapist? We
also have unfulfilled needs. Our hormones do not differentiate which
individuals are off limits. Many of our clients not only look good to us
but also feel good to know. They are people not unlike
ourselves---motivated to grow. They have been dedicated learners. Some
have worked very hard to turn themselves into our Galateas (as we are
their Pygmalions). They can express feelings fluently, use the language
and terms we favor. They have been completely open, sharing, and honest
with us. They have disclosed their histories, fantasies, dreams, and
desires. And for this dedicated effort, we like many of them a lot.

The consequences of acting on our impulses are obvious. We lose our
objectivity and jeopardize the trust and therapeutic work that have been
accomplished. Sexual contact with clients or ex-clients represents an
abuse of power and is always self-indulgent and antitherapeutic. Many of
the victims of "therapeutic incest" experience lowered self-esteem;
sexual dysfunctions; feelings of exploitation, anger, and betrayal; and
a feeling of mistrust toward other helping professionals that makes them
reluctant to seek treatment for their now-compounded problems. We know
all of this. And that is why we work so hard to restrain our natural
(and unnatural) desires.

It is especially important that therapists at greatest risk---those in
the midst of divorce or separation---recognize their vulnerability to
the []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_111}temptations of acting
inappropriately. Those clinicians who have been victims of sexual abuse,
who have frequent sexual fantasies about their clients, who are in the
midst of personal crisis, who don't maintain clear boundaries in their
client relationships, and who are isolated professionally are
particularly at risk of acting out.

And then there are gray areas in the restraint of intimacy. Some
practitioners restrict their therapeutic activities to their offices,
whereas others work wonders in the outside world making house calls,
doing community interventions, escorting therapeutic field trips to
practice new skills. The difficulty of maintaining intimacy boundaries
increases during field trips and in sessions conducted in restaurants,
at picnic tables, or on walks. The temptation to become involved with
clients beyond appropriate limits is more severe. The therapist must
exercise incredible self-monitoring, self-control, and self-deprivation.
The pressure builds.

### Restraint and Self-Deprivation {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-56 .sec1}

The cumulative pressures from maintaining prolonged one-way intimacy are
challenging enough for a professional who also requires liberal doses of
approval and affirmation. The tension is compounded by other ways in
which a therapist exhibits restraint. From training onward, we are often
told what things we must *not* do during sessions with clients. Most of
all, we are warned not to do too much (even when practicing
action-oriented, directive approaches); it is the client's
responsibility to do the work, choose the content, pace the progress,
develop insight, and change behavior. Embedded in the admonishment to
avoid doing too much to rescue the client is an unwieldy list of more
specific negative imperatives. Don't express personal opinions. Don't
take sides. Don't be too passive---or too directive and controlling
either. Don't moralize and impose your values. Don't let your attention
wander. Don't meet your own needs in session. Don't share too much of
yourself, but don't be extremely withholding either. Be genuine but not
too transparent. Be honest but don't say everything you're thinking.
Find your own path and clinical style and don't pay too much attention
to lists like this.

Depending on your training, theoretical allegiances, and supervisors,
this personal list of precautions will vary. Regardless of the context,
there is often a theme of "stifle yourself" juxtaposed with
encouragement to be authentic. We know what happens to children who
deliberately withhold their true feelings and repress their unsatisfied
needs: They become neurotic, well-disciplined adults. We know what
happens to children in a []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_112}double-bind
family when they receive mixed messages: They become confused or even
crazy. What happens to therapists who experience these same
contradictory and paradoxical messages?

Self-deprivation comes with the territory. We are trained and
compensated to put others' welfare before our own. We are disciplined to
suppress our own desires. By dispassionately acknowledging our personal
needs, we lessen their grip on our actions. More and more we simply
observe rather than identify with our motives. It's not so much that we
are trying to push them away; denial buys us no peace. Rather, we are
loosening our attachment to our motives by letting them slumber.

In our drive to be therapeutic, we rein in self-centered urges. Yet it
is hard to tread water with someone on our back without drowning. We can
only give so much without needing support in return. And just when we
have achieved that miracle of therapeutic love, when we feel comfortable
and safe, when we even look forward to the meetings with clients we have
grown attached to, it is time to say good-bye.

It is during the closure of therapy that we must often restrain our own
feelings of loss and mourning each time a relationship ends. Sure we are
proud of the progress that has been made, but we often still feel a
sense of loss when a client moves on. There could be lingering
insecurity and doubts about what transpired during the process, perhaps
awareness of what we could have---*should* have---done differently or
better. In addition we may feel some regret about the times our
carefully controlled veneer slipped a bit and we indulged in some action
that was indefensibly self-indulgent.

### Narcissism---In the Therapist, Not the Client {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-57 .sec1}

Many years ago, before the popularity of mobile phones, I was standing
in a movie theater lobby. There was a long line of people waiting to use
the only pay phone in sight. I recognized a well-known psychiatrist
striding across the room toward the phone. He ignored the people who
were waiting patiently and approached the woman who was currently
speaking on the phone. She promptly turned her back on him and continued
her conversation.

"Ahem," the psychiatrist said, clearing his throat loudly. "Excuse me
please." His booming voice immediately drew the attention of everyone
else in the vicinity, but the woman just ignored him and kept talking.

The psychiatrist impatiently tapped the woman on the back. "Excuse me,"
he said once again.[]{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_113}

The woman cupped her hand over the phone. "Yes?" she said, looking over
her shoulder, more than a little annoyed by the interruption.

"Excuse me," the psychiatrist repeated, "but I'm a doctor." As he said
this, he pointed to the phone in her hand.

"Your mother must be very proud," she answered, then turned around to
continue her phone conversation.

Everyone in the lobby started applauding wildly. The good doctor turned
with a harrumph and slinked away.

The arrogance of this psychiatrist is, unfortunately, not especially
unusual within the therapist (and medical) community. Sometimes we take
ourselves so seriously that we really do think we are special and
entitled to special privileges. We are used to people deferring to us,
paying homage to our position. After all, we get paid to talk for a
living and to dispense wisdom. Our clients treat us as sages. Strangers
treat us with a certain reverence because of fears that we can see
through them to their core. Yet it is our own illusions of being
perfectly empathic beings, of infallibility, that most feed our
narcissism.

A particular kind of narcissistic yearning in therapists can manifest
itself in several different forms. The same interpersonal sensitivity
that makes us ideally suited to the profession also creates problems for
us. This relational attunement may have been nurtured through our
professional training, but in many cases, its roots lie in our families
of origin, in which we developed a kind of "audience sensitivity" to win
approval and validation. Many therapists report taking on caretaker
roles as children, equating love as a transactional reward for service.

After my father moved out of the house when I was 12, I was stuck taking
care of my two younger brothers, as well as my depressed, alcoholic,
suicidal mother. I remember more than a few times calling her therapist
on the phone when she locked herself in the room, drunk and despondent,
threatening to kill herself. During a time when I was struggling with my
own adolescent insecurities, I was forced to take on the role of the
ultimate parentified child who was required to be a caretaker---never
feeling adequate or prepared for that role and always striving harder to
do a better job. I've been working toward that perfection ever since.

I can't quite claim that now my own secret is out because I've been
writing about this exact struggle for decades. It is just interesting to
discover that I am one of so many others who were first attracted to
this profession because it was part of my training in childhood. To this
day, before I go to sleep at night, I ask myself what good I've done and
how many people I've helped, and I measure my success in terms of the
quality []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_114}and quantity of such "goodness."
Along with this perhaps laudable but neurotic desire is also the drive
toward perfection, accompanied by avoidance of feelings that I'm
essentially a fraud. Who would need to write three to four books each
year if he were not attempting to prove his worth? Who would choose to
study failure and imperfection in the profession if he were not
investigating his own struggles? Who would (re)write a book such as this
one if he were not trying to finally come to terms with his own secret
failings?

Restraining our egos is a challenge that many of us will never quite
meet. What with our diplomas, titles, and carefully appointed chambers,
it is hard for us not to take ourselves seriously. Such self-centered
preoccupation with the image we project to the world is hazardous to our
mental health. We become disembodied selves, separated from our feelings
and from those of the people we try to help.

Honestly consider for a moment the real kick you get out of being a
therapist---besides all the benefits you enjoy. I suspect that deep
within my own heart is the desperate need to influence others. I am
afraid of dying, but worse, of being forgotten. I feel as though I am in
the process of immortalizing myself with every disciple who goes out
into the world with a part of me inside him or her. It is as if I can
cheat death if only I can keep a part of me alive. Does this motive
affect what I do in my sessions? Naturally. Does this grandiose
self-involvement limit the quality of my work? Of course. Do I feel
impaired in my capacity for empathy because of this narcissism?
Unfortunately, yes. But I still remain safe.

To give up this narcissistic stance is to risk a deeper, more terrifying
form of self-involvement: confronting the feelings we fear most. Like
most obsessives, we successfully distract ourselves from those things we
least wish to understand. We can avoid real intimacy even in our sacred
chambers by keeping clients at a distance. We can glorify the influence
we have had on clients while denying their influence on us. We can
distance ourselves from pain by retreating deep inside our chair-side
manner---a few strokes of the chin, a blank stare, a delusion that we
have the power to heal.

Enter a woman in her mid-30s who is far from composed. Suffering oozes
from her pores; even her tears have tears. She feels hopeless,
despondent, deeply depressed. This is her third attempt to seek help in
as many months. She saw the last therapist for six sessions.

::: prosequote
"What did he say?"

"I don't know."

"You don't remember?"

"I remember quite well. He didn't say
anything."[]{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_115}

"He said nothing?"

"No."

"What, then, did he do during the time you spent together?"

"He took notes."

"Uh-huh."

"He said thank you when I paid him at the end."

"Why did you go back if you didn't feel he helped you?"

"He seemed so important. He came highly recommended. And he seemed so
awfully busy. He had to arrange things to fit me into his schedule, and
several times he was interrupted by calls from people who needed him. I
thought maybe if I waited long enough, he might notice me. But he only
seemed to notice himself. It's like he looked right through me, as if I
wasn't there. I felt like a bug he was inspecting. All he did was take
notes. Even when I broke down sobbing, he just looked at me across his
desk and kept writing on his pad."
:::

The woman stopped abruptly, peeked out from behind her anguish. I asked
her if she would give me a chance to help her. She said she was tired of
seeing therapists, but she would think about it and let me know. She
drove straight home, drew a bath, swallowed 12 antidepressants, drank a
pint of bourbon, lay down in the bathtub and slit both her wrists. She
died from the chronic indifference and narcissism of the therapists who
refused to see her as a human being. If I sound unduly harsh, full
disclosure: I have never really recovered from this loss, this failure,
for which I blame myself for not recognizing the potential risk during
our only, brief meeting.

There is a danger in using anecdotal material such as this to support
assumptions about therapist characteristics and experiences. We all know
individuals in our profession who believe themselves to be godlings and
demand homage from their disciples. Although this concern about the
therapist's overblown ego may be a bit exaggerated, it is clear that
those practitioners high in narcissism tend to have more premature
dropouts and dissatisfied clients ([Oasi et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-244){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0207}).
That, of course, is in addition to the damage they may inflict with
their haughty, contemptuous, critical posture as a result of feeling so
special.

Therapists in our society are, after all, treated as if we have special
powers that allow us to see inside people's hearts and souls, predict
the future, and heal suffering. It is indeed difficult for us not to
come to believe in our specialness.

I have long felt that I hold superpowers. After all, it seems at times
(to others if not to myself) that I can read minds, predict the future,
and hear, see, feel, and sense things beyond the powers of mere mortal
beings. I have []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_116}worked hard to develop my
capacities for intuition, sensitivity, and verbal fluency far beyond the
levels of those without my training and skills. It is no wonder, then,
that I take myself far too seriously and inflate my sense of
self-importance. Moreover, I know that I am not the only one among my
brethren who does so.

### Knowing Too Much {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-58 .sec1}

There is something to be said for a certain degree of ignorance,
naïveté, or at least being shielded from the dark side of behavior.
Unfortunately, therapists have nowhere to hide. Every day, every hour,
people disclose to us the most disturbing and dysfunctional behaviors
imaginable. After a while we lose the ability to be shocked by the
weird, creepy, sick, hurtful things that people do to themselves and
others. People tell us secrets that have never been shared before---of
abuse, trauma, suffering, addiction, compulsion, perversity, anger---and
we are expected to hold all that and tell no one. People confide their
worst instincts, fantasies, hallucinations, delusions, and obsessions,
and we are required to listen and take it all in. Nothing we see on
television or the media can touch the realities that we encounter in our
offices. We see people at their absolute worst, when they are on the
verge of cracking. We are subjected to onslaughts of rage, shame,
indignation, seduction, and manipulation during times when people are
most powerless and out of control. We talk to people about the
forbidden, about that which is not said.

Forget about peering inside someone's mind or heart: We see inside their
*souls*. And what are the effects of being so close to people who are
struggling with the ultimate questions of existence, meaning, and
survival?

Graham, an ex-priest who later became a therapist, talked about the
transition from hearing one kind of confession and offering God's
forgiveness to quite another in which people must learn to forgive
themselves. "Now I struggle alongside people trying to make some sense
of their lives. I try to help them find some kind of meaning. It feels
like I am an oasis in their lives, a place for them to rest and recover
during times when they are lost. When I was a priest, I was expected to
know the answers. As a therapist I now accept that as much as I know, I
don't have any answers. I just know that we can't do it alone. It is all
pretty frustrating knowing that peace or satisfaction will never be
achieved."

Like this therapist, we are often forced to surrender our illusions. We
can't pretend that things are simple. We know too much about what
happens when people deceive themselves. And all day long we listen to
[]{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_117}people lying to us, lying to themselves,
and trying to find a way to cope; our job is to confront this deceit.
When the day ends, we are left to face our own self-deceit, which is one
reason why it is so critical for us to honestly and scrupulously assess
early signs and symptoms for potential difficulties.

### Pathologizing of Self and Others {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-59 .sec1}

It is both amusing, and potentially hazardous, when a trainee first
studies the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*
(*DSM*) during an assessment course. At first, there is power in this
knowledge, the feeling that *finally* we have the means by which to
classify and label the bewildering variety of disorders that we may be
asked to treat. There is almost a mathematical precision in learning the
coding system, complete with the numbers associated with each possible
variety of any given category: "dementia with Alzheimer's"; "dementia
due to Creutzfeld-Jacob disease"; "dementia, late onset, with
delusions"; and "dementia, early onset, with depression." It's about the
time we delve into personality disorders that we begin to see florid
examples everywhere among our friends, family, coworkers, and
politicians and in the media. We start using the new language we've
acquired, delighted with the symptoms we recognize in people all around
us. In our heads, if not out loud, we start calling people histrionic,
narcissistic, avoidant, obsessive-compulsive, or---when we're really
angry---borderline. This pathologizing lens has been referred to as the
"therapist's disease," in which we tend to constantly look for what is
wrong in others, what is dysfunctional, maladjusted, disturbing,
abnormal, self-destructive, and crazy. The more familiar we become with
the nomenclature and diagnostic labels, the more fluently we incorporate
the terms in our everyday thinking. Although this is a natural and
important part of becoming a competent practitioner, it also shapes the
way we look at the world, other people, and ourselves.

In spite of influences from the positive psychology movement, in which
the research and writing has refocused attention on human strengths and
resources, therapists remain firmly embedded in a psychopathological
worldview. We are specialists in figuring out what is wrong with people.
Our clients only come to us when they are desperately in the throes of
dysfunctional behavior. We constantly sort through the presenting
complaints, narratives, life histories, and presentations by clients in
order to identify problems and disorders in need of attention. Moreover,
it is very, very difficult to turn off this pathological filter when we
aren't in session.

[]{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_118}It is all too easy for us to become
psychological hypochondriacs, constantly aware of every nuance of
possible problems in our own functioning, or those close to us. We are
taught to become increasingly self-aware for purposes of honing our
clinical skills and working through countertransference reactions. We
are admonished to continually work on our own stuff so that it doesn't
pollute our work.

Mya, a therapist intern, freely admitted that she entered the field as
much to work on her own growth as to help others. She was delighted with
the personal gains she had already made---improved communication, deeper
intimacy in relationships, increased empathy, greater knowledge and
self-awareness---but she also felt raw and vulnerable.

::: prosequote
We get so much encouragement from supervisors to be open, honest, and
authentic, yet often it isn't safe. Am I really accepted for who I am?
How am I being judged as not good enough? There are such conflicting
messages. We are told to open up and be trusting and share ourselves,
yet also don't be too self-indulgent. Our performance is always being
evaluated, and we are told to evaluate ourselves after every session. I
have to tell you: it all gives me a headache. I feel weak and
vulnerable. And oh so tired.
:::

### Fatigue and Exhaustion {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-60 .sec1}

In an article on his lifestyle, one prominent therapist described a
typical day as being rigidly scheduled from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. the
following morning. Each 15-minute segment of time was meticulously
accounted for. His 25-minute sessions were run back to back without a
break. He inhaled his meals between administrative, lecturing, writing,
and consulting chores and even must schedule conversations in advance.
Although he defended this inhumane regimen as an "affair of the heart,"
it could more accurately be described as a case of neurotic workaholism
that is part of a maladaptive vicious circle. Even 30 years after this
report on his working habits, and at over 90 years of age, this
theoretician still worked from dawn to dusk.

As noted, time pressures head the list of therapist stressors. There are
never enough hours to see all the people we need to see, return phone
calls, have video chats, receive messages, attend meetings, complete
paperwork, do outreach, keep up with the literature, eat, sleep, and
have a life outside the office. We often run behind schedule. For those
who work in the public sector, there are often people waiting, yet there
is always pressure to see just one more client.

[]{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_119}For those in private practice, there is a
different set of time pressures and fears, mostly related to maintaining
one's tenuous hold on financial stability in the face of increasing
competition and economic realities. I could never quite get over the
terror that one day the referrals would stop coming. I could never quite
turn down a new case for fear that the lean times would hit soon---and
inevitably they would. So it was often a matter of feast or famine, and
the good times brought with them different challenges of balancing
excessive work with a healthy lifestyle.

One would think that once the door closes, or we open a screen, to begin
a session, the narrowed focus on a single life and task would provide
some relief from the exhausting pace. With distractions and intrusions
kept at bay, the rhythm of the day slowed down to that of the client's
heartbeat, we can feel our profound weariness. It is so hard to sit
still. Our back aches; our eyes burn. After the eighth, ninth, tenth, or
eleventh session in a row, there is little left beyond an empty shell.

We get so tired of sitting, of listening, of talking, of thinking. This
fatigue comes on us when we take on too much work out of pride, greed,
habit, escape, fear, or following the path of least resistance. One
therapist noticed that the times he feels weary are those when he is
blocking some other feeling:

::: prosequote
In one session with a client where tiredness tugged at my sleeve, I
found a resentment I had pushed aside about his call at the last minute
to cancel our previous session. In another, I looked under the feelings
of tiredness and got in touch with some sexual feelings I wasn't
acknowledging to myself. With another the feelings were ones of danger
and the client volunteered that she was feeling self-destructive and not
telling me. ([Griswell,
1979](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-106){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0208},
pp. 50--51)
:::

Much of the time, we urge clients to avoid the excesses of overwork. We
caution moderation to reduce stress, fatigue, and mental exhaustion. We
teach people to better appreciate their present moments, to live a
tranquil existence. We warn them of the dangers of continuous
multitasking and constant interruptions from messages, calls, texts,
emails, all while we engage in the same behavior. Until we can create
balance between work and play in our own lives, abandoning the search
for perfection, it is very difficult to teach clients to lead more
moderate lifestyles.

I know therapists (and so do you) who specialize in wellness and stress
reduction in their practices, and all the while they are seeing 50
clients each week on top of other professional responsibilities. I know
therapists who run busy private practices on top of their regular
40-hour-per-week jobs. I know therapists who work until 9 or 10 each
night and most of their []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_120}weekends. I know
a therapist who writes for a few hours every day beginning at 6 in the
morning and then heads off to his university job. He can't sleep well at
night unless he has completed his creative output, often juggling work
on four, five, or even six books at the same time. (Yeah, that one used
to be me prior to semiretirement, when now I have a different challenge
of not having enough to do---but that's another story.)

We show symptoms of overwork when we skip meals or refuse to decline
work when we are already overloaded. We neglect family, friends, and
most of all ourselves. There is so little time to be alone, to think, to
feel, to relax, to do absolutely nothing. Some of us are reluctant to
take more than a few days off work because we fear losing income or
losing power in the organizational structure. It doesn't take others
very long to realize that we are replaceable---even if we nurture the
illusion that we must do everything ourselves because nobody else would
do as good a job.

When we are not working, we mull over our cases. We consider the
direction our clients will head next, the things we did that we wish we
had not done, and our plans for the following week. At odd moments, we
wonder how clients are getting along. Why do some of them never return?
What did we do to chase them away? These people populate our world. We
see them more frequently and regularly than we see most of our friends.
No matter how much we work to preserve our professional detachment, no
matter how hard we discipline ourselves to push them out of our minds
when they walk out the door, we still carry them around inside us. How
could these people not be significant in our lives and loom in our minds
when we spend week after week discussing the sacred details of their
lives?

I feel exhausted; my energy is depleted just *thinking* about the
burdens we routinely carry. It is strange to consider that we work so
hard while sitting perfectly still. Maybe it is because we must remain
immobile and attentive that the job is so tiring. If only we could
separate ourselves from the chair. If only our existence outside the
chair could be as meaningful as the time we spend enveloped within it.

### Isolation {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-61 .sec1}

Therapy exists to provide a safe and private haven for people to resolve
their underlying problems. Without a guarantee that communications will
be held in strictest confidence, it is unlikely that we can accomplish
much that is very useful. To protect the client's right to privacy,
secrecy, and dignity, we swear allegiance to our profession's code of
conduct with regard to []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_121}privileged
communication. If we do nothing else, our primary obligation is to
respect and protect confidentiality of whatever was shared.

Naturally, clients appreciate our integrity and sense of honor. For us,
it is second nature after years of training. We would no sooner commit
an indiscretion that might compromise a client's safety than we would
neglect to guard our own shameful secrets. When talking about our work
in any context---with colleagues, client families, friends, and even
spouses and partners---we routinely monitor what we say so that client
identities are disguised and protected. This shield serves our clients
well, as presumably our prudence protects their privacy. However, like
all barriers, it not only prevents things from getting out but also
ensures that other things do not get in.

One of the most meaningful, interesting, and fulfilling parts of a
therapist's life is the time spent with clients. There are instances
when we may be practically bursting at the seams to tell friends about
some prominent citizen we are working with or some peculiar case that is
so bizarre. Yet we can tell no one about the people we work with or
about the details of what we do.

If we run into a client at a social gathering, etiquette requires us to
fade into the background unless the client chooses to recognize us. If a
client's name comes up in conversation, we must pretend indifference so
we do not give away our involvement. It is as if we were conducting
secret affairs with 50 people simultaneously! We even arrange our
schedules and office setups so that clients do not accidentally
encounter one another. All of this results in a kind of sanctuary for
the people we help and a kind of prison for us.

Physically, we are separated from the outside world, ensconced in a
soundproof chamber. We (it is hoped) don't answer calls, open the door,
reply to messages, or otherwise tolerate interruptions during sessions;
in the intervals in between, we are so busy doing paperwork or going to
the bathroom that there is little time for interaction with anyone.
Visitors rarely stop by because we are continually unavailable or in
session. It is as if we cease to exist in the outside world.

What are the effects of this compartmentalized isolation? Maybe it
contributes to therapists' feeling of specialness and sainthood: We
suffer in silence so that others may be released from pain. We also may
become secretive, mysterious, aloof, and evasive when we are not at
work, while we continue to struggle to be authentic, transparent, and
genuine with clients. We retreat inside ourselves for comfort and pat
ourselves on the back for being so professional. Actually, we feel like
martyrs.

All over town there are restaurants, venues, and bars that we can't
visit because clients or ex-clients work there. At parties or social
gatherings []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_122}we have to monitor closely how
much we drink, knowing that losing control would sully our reputation.
We must carefully scrutinize anything we might post on social media or
else opt out altogether. Neighbors watch our children for signs of
emotional disturbance so they can substantiate the myth of the crazy
shrink down the block. People constantly ask for advice on what to do
about their lives. Others feel intimidated by their own perception of
therapists as mind readers. They will not get too close for fear we will
expose their insecurities with a casual glance. "Oh, you're a therapist.
I suppose I should be careful around you \[giggle\]."

So we live on display in glass houses. If clients or prospective clients
research our reputations in the community, we hope they will discover
that we are not only competent professionals but also nice people.
Because we are being watched, we stay in line and cultivate a consistent
image. We watch, listen, speak when we are spoken to, and keep our
mouths shut.

### Money Issues {#13_chapter6.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-6-div1-62 .sec1}

It might seem peculiar that money is discussed in the context of
therapist hardships, but many of us do have an awkward relationship with
the ways we are remunerated for our time. On one level, it sometimes
feels that we are *way* undercompensated for the hard work we devote to
our craft; on the other hand, it can feel quite awkward accepting
payment for what can seem like just a supportive conversation between
two old friends.

Of course therapy is practiced differently in various settings, with
fees for service a big part of the negotiation in private practice or
else mostly irrelevant in a county agency. The therapy approach chosen,
the length of treatment, and the methodologies employed will depend, to
a large extent, on certain economic realities. In a community mental
health center with a 2-week waiting list and funding contingent on the
number of new patients enrolled, it is unlikely that psychoanalytic
treatment will be all that popular. And in private practice, where a
therapist's livelihood depends on being able to consistently sell one's
time by the hour, it is unusual to find someone exclusively practicing
brief therapy interventions. Such a therapist with a large turnover
might require more than 400 new referrals every year just to survive,
whereas another clinician could get by quite comfortably with 10 or 12
if she specializes in long-term, more severe cases.

We belong to a profession whose members cannot decide whether they are
scientists or philosophers, technicians or artists. We cannot agree on
whether therapists should be trained in schools of medicine, health,
education, human development, family studies, liberal arts, social work,
or the []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_123}seminary. We cannot agree on
whether therapy takes a short time or a long time; whether it ought to
focus on the past, present, or future; whether the therapist or the
client should define the problem we are to work on; or even whether the
therapist should talk a lot or a little. And perhaps more important, we
cannot decide whether therapy is essentially a profession, a business,
or a calling. And the reality is that we may often spend a small portion
of every session calculating how much we earned while listening to
someone tell his or her story.

We have a tangled relationship indeed with money, often creating guilt
and conflict in our lives because of the peculiar exchange of compassion
and understanding charged for a fee ([Hancock,
2015](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-112){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0209};
[Stevens,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-293){#13_chapter6.xhtml_n0210}).
Some therapists identify with the role of monk, in which they believe
that having too much money will corrupt them; they experience a
tremendous amount of anxiety and conflict over the business aspects of
their work. Others feel like prostitutes: They are providing intimacy to
strangers for a fee. And quite a number of practitioners in private
practice may feel guilty about being paid to do work that they truly
love.

When we splice into this picture the feelings among some clinicians that
they are not really doing much in their work anyway, that they are
frauds who are just paid to listen, guilt can lead to a vicious circle.
Because these therapists may feel that they haven't really earned the
money, they want to get rid of it as quickly as possible, ensnaring
themselves in a consumerist lifestyle: work, spend, work, spend. One
therapist of my acquaintance was incredibly busy, seeing 50 to 60
clients per week and making more money than any reasonable person could
hope to spend. With no leisure time to shop in person, she shopped
online between sessions, eventually ordering so much merchandise that
she worked herself into unrecoverable debt.

To complicate money matters further, even while we are dealing with the
guilt of being paid for doing what sometimes seems like so little,
marveling at the salary we are paid to do what we most love, we struggle
with the corresponding feeling that there is not enough money in the
world to compensate us for the tedium and abuse we must put up with at
times. Nobody works as hard as we do mediating battles between family
members, dealing with obstinate children and surly adolescents whom
nobody else can handle, and seeing people in anguish and suffering.

Further, each of us has a personal relationship with money, a
circumstance that creates additional hardships in our work. We see
couples who argue about money or who will not talk about the subject at
all. We see disadvantaged clients who have no money, sparking guilt that
we have too much. We see wealthy individuals who fritter away their
funds in a search for fulfillment. Envy, resentment, and pity get in the
way of our []{#13_chapter6.xhtml_page_124}compassion. And when it comes
to managing our own resources, each of us has issues that impinge on our
work and can muddle things quite a bit.

Once upon a time, the practice of therapy was a calling. It was less a
job or a career than it was a commitment to helping. There was passion
and single-minded devotion to a simpler world with simpler ideals. Then
the image of the therapist was transformed from that of a kindly country
doctor dispensing advice to that of a consummate professional with
technical and psychometric support. Legislators began regulating the
field. Professional organizations mandated appropriate conduct.
Insurance companies got into the act, followed by health maintenance
organizations and preferred-provider plans. Now competition for
customers is the name of the game for many therapists and mental health
organizations. Some of the most popular programs at conferences and
workshops have titles that euphemistically (but misleadingly) imply how
you can get rich marketing your practice.

Clinicians are caught between an image of themselves as missionaries and
behavior that is more characteristic of marketing executives. We feel
frustrated about being unappreciated and underpaid. Sometimes it seems
that no amount of money could fairly compensate us for the aggravation,
intensity, emotional turmoil, conflict, and frustration. Other times, we
feel guilty about being overpaid for seemingly doing nothing, simply
listening to someone ramble on for an hour. In exchange for spending 50
minutes listening to someone talk and then telling him what we think
about what he said, we receive enough money to buy 10 books or a whole
night on vacation. It would almost seem that even with the hardships of
being a therapist, we have a great thing going.

Yet there are also those nagging doubts that weigh on our conscience. We
try our best, but sometimes it's not nearly enough. Among the most
challenging hardships we face are the limits of our own ability to make
a difference. There are disappointments---and failures.

[]{#14_chapter7.xhtml}

## []{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_125}[Chapter 7](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0009) {#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7 .ch_title1}

## [Being Imperfect, Living With Failure](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0009) {.ch_title2}

[]{#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7-div1-63}When you think
about it, the prospect of spending 10, 20, or even 100 hours with
someone trying to get him to change his behavior when he is alive close
to a million hours seems pretty futile. No matter what we do, how hard
we work, how skilled we are, how much experience we have, or how many
workshops we attend and books we read, it is inevitable that some of our
clients are not going to improve; some will even become worse while
under our care. And when clients do make significant progress in
therapy, most of the time we have little idea if the changes will last
over time.

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-014.jpg)

[]{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_126}Even books like this are mostly doomed to
fail. What are the chances that anything that is said on these pages is
going to have a significant impact on you, let alone produce the kind of
profound impact that would make some idea memorable enough that it would
actually lead you to think and act differently? You have dozens, if not
hundreds, of similar books sitting on your shelves or on tablets that
represent all your previous attempts to hold on to what you've learned.
If you're honest, you'll have to admit that most of the time this stuff
just doesn't stay with you. That's why most self-care programs don't
last very long and why people tend to make the same New Year's
resolutions a dozen times in a row.

It's also important to acknowledge in this discussion that even when
things don't go as planned---or preferred---that doesn't necessarily
mean that nothing at all was achieved or accomplished. No matter how
disappointed or frustrated a client (or therapist) might feel about the
proceedings, it is rare indeed that *nothing* meaningful occurred or
that there was not some measurable progress. This is important to
mention, not to let us off the hook when things go awry, but rather to
promote forgiveness for our lapses so that we might learn from them
([Balkin,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-10){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0211}).
It is when we are able to model and demonstrate such self-compassion
with regard to our own failings and imperfections that our clients might
follow our lead and become more accepting of their own---at least until
such time that they can make significant changes.

### The Inevitability of Failure and Disappointment {#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7-div1-64 .sec1}

Whether in the performance of music, dance, comedy, or psychotherapy,
improvisation is considered the highest form of creative expression.
This has always been the case with role playing and psychodrama in our
field, but some of the most exciting, interesting, and transformative
experiences we've ever shared with clients occur when we find ourselves
collaborating in ways that are novel and unique.

It is one of the most intriguing and confusing aspects of the
therapeutic process that clinicians and their clients often have very
different perceptions of the experience and certainly varied
interpretations of what occurred. Although 95% of therapists admit they
fail their clients on occasion (leading anyone to wonder what the other
5% are thinking), the vast majority of times it is the clients who are
blamed for the difficulties ([Malus et al.,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-210){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0212}).
Regardless of our own level of frustration and dissatisfaction with the
way things are progressing, ultimately it is the clients who
[]{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_127}decide the result, usually based on
whether they felt heard and understood whether we feel that way or not
([Kottler & Balkin,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-175){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0213}).

It is only after we acknowledge that our favorite strategies, standard
responses, programmed scripts, and traditional structures are woefully
inadequate that we are willing to experiment with alternatives that are,
as yet, unfamiliar. It is almost always the case that the first time we
try a technique, or make something up, it is going to feel awkward,
uncomfortable, and likely not work very well. It is precisely this
failed attempt that forces us to dig deep inside and come to terms with
the limits of our current thinking and practices.

What makes this process ever more challenging is that sometimes it is
difficult to determine when particular conflict, tension, or stress in
the relationship is significant enough to justify a change of course or
direct attention to the possible problem. Is this a minor glitch along
the journey, or a major issue that requires intervention? This begs the
question about when a "strain" within the working alliance becomes a
"rupture" ([Gelso & Kline,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-96){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0214}).
Quite often, a certain amount of pushback is expected, inevitable, even
useful within the working alliance as part of the negotiation that takes
place during the early stages.

To answer that query about the severity of the relational strain, we
first must assess the visible consequences of the possible tension or
disagreement, wondering whether it signifies a meaningful issue to
resolve. We look for evidence of withdrawal, repeated arguments,
cancelled appointments, even acting out in some way. It is also
necessary to do a gut check on our own level of empathy, compassion, and
caring with this individual or case. A minor strain may qualify as a
serious relational rupture when there is (a) ongoing and continuous
disagreement about goals of the treatment, (b) poor cooperation and
coordination of efforts during sessions, or (c) emotional strain with
one or both parties frustrated and annoyed by a perceived lack of
progress ([Eubanks et al.,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-68){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0215}).
Once a rupture has been identified that requires repair, the next step
involves determining one's own role in creating or maintaining the
impasse. Is this really evidence of "bad therapy" or "therapist
failure," or rather is it simply an inevitable stage in the process?

### What Is Bad Therapy Anyway? {#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7-div1-65 .sec1}

Although the client plays the most significant role in the eventual
outcome of treatment, and there are certainly other factors that enter
into []{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_128}the picture, we also have some
responsibility for what happens. Most of the time we may do really fine
work, but it is hard for us to talk about our mistakes, misjudgments,
disappointments, and failures. All of us mess up on occasion,
miscalculate what we believe a client can handle, push too hard or not
enough, or make some blunder about which we can only cringe with regret.

Various studies of therapy dropouts estimated that roughly 20% to 30% of
clients don't return after their initial interview, and close to half
don't come back after the first two sessions; most therapists don't know
why ([Goldberg,
2012](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-102){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0216};
[Leichsenring et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-202){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0217};
[Oasi & Werbart,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-245){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0218}).
Did they not return because they were so disappointed, or rather, as
some have suggested ([Dryden,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-55){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0219};
[M. Hoyt et al.,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-133){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0220}),
they already got what they needed after a single session or two? Just
because a client doesn't reschedule or show up again doesn't
*necessarily* imply that something went wrong. In one study of mildly
depressed clients who terminated their treatment after just a few
sessions, half of them interviewed afterward reported significant and
satisfactory progress and recovery ([Lopes et al.,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-205){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0221}).

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-015.jpg)

When studies are examined to define and assess negative outcomes, one of
the difficulties making sense of the data is that so much depends on the
setting, client's preexisting condition, presenting complaints, and
diagnosis, as well as the therapist's abilities and experience with
these types of malady. When figures estimate that somewhere between 3%
and 30% of []{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_129}cases end up as at least
partial "failures," we don't take into account the different levels of
severity and complexity. There are significant differences in successful
outcomes when treating an uncomplicated grief reaction versus bipolar
disorder or florid personality disorder. There are also certain couples
and families we see that feel so hopeless, or are entrenched in such
miserable circumstances, that it seems futile to make a dent in their
suffering.

There's also an interesting question related to who actually "owns" the
failure. Certainly the therapist can be at fault if there was a clear
indication of inappropriate, insensitive, or incompetent behavior, yet
the client's contribution can hardly be overlooked given that this is
the single best predictor of any outcome. We know, for example, that
those people most likely to have a disappointing experience tend to be
mistrustful, pessimistic, and present extremely severe symptoms for
which they already feel out of control. They tend to be intolerant of
complexity and ambiguity and lack much capacity for self-awareness or
insight. They not only had poor attachment with parental figures in the
past but also little social support in the present. Finally, they are
inclined to make excuses for their situation and externalize blame and
are relatively unsophisticated about how and why therapy works
([Constantino et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-40){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0222}).

Those clients who do keep returning to sessions, but without any
observable or reported gains, will typically continue treatment for an
average of a dozen more sessions before concluding that things aren't
working out (R. E. [Stewart & Chambless,
2008](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-295){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0223}).
This doesn't include the estimated 5% to 10% of clients who actually
deteriorate in therapy, with percentages significantly higher for those
therapists who do grief work, traumatic stress debriefing, or work with
dissociative disorders. In more routine agency settings outside of
clinical trials, failures and deleterious effects are considerably
higher, possibly as high as 30% ([Lambert et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-199){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0224}).
Of course there is also wide variability in these negative outcomes,
depending on the characteristics, attitudes, skills, and abilities of
the practitioner since some therapists rarely encounter deterioration,
while others have all kinds of difficulties.

To comfort ourselves in these and other cases, we deploy a variety of
tactics and excuses:

:::

The fact of the matter is that sometimes we just do lousy work. It hurts
to admit when we fail our clients, and we *do* take it personally for
very good reasons. After all, clients aren't the only ones who are
destabilized or thrown into crisis when they discover something about
themselves that is not as they had always assumed. It is more than a
little disconcerting to observe---or be told directly---that our best
efforts aren't good enough or that our noble intentions are not
appreciated. When we are faced with clients who aren't improving, or
even becoming worse, it can very well lead us to question everything we
think we know and understand. Personally, I tend to pout when a client,
student, or supervisee doesn't appreciate all my goodwill, vast
experience, and dedicated commitment to their well-being.

If it makes you feel any better to hear about them, I'll mention once
again there have been some spectacular cases of really bad therapy with
some well-known figures ([Kottler,
2006](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-162){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0225}).
Judy Garland's therapist used to see her twice per day for sessions and
prescribed all kinds of drugs to help her sleep, stay awake, and reduce
depression, anxiety, and loneliness. (She died of an overdose.) Composer
and musician Brian Wilson's (Beach Boys) therapist actually moved in
with him for a year, insisted that all music composed during that time
credit the therapist as a coauthor, and charged Wilson \$1 million as a
fee. Then there was Marilyn Monroe's therapist, who may have actually
been the one who killed her with a barbiturate suppository. (He was the
last one to be seen with her alive.) He also made the depressed actress
run errands for him; gave her unlimited supplies of Nembutal, Seconal,
and chloral hydrate; and required her to buy a house within walking
distance so he could have easier access to her at all times.

Although these are clearly cases of bad therapy and treatment failures,
there is much disagreement about what exactly constitutes such negative
outcomes. We asked prominent therapists to define what they thought was
bad therapy and were surprised by the variety of answers we received
([Kottler & Carlson,
2002](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-178){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0226}).
Some of the theorists focused primarily on
[]{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_131}clients' behavior and responsiveness,
whether they were acting differently outside of sessions, whether they
felt understood, whether they improved or got worse. Interestingly,
other prominent figures looked more at their own experience of clients,
whether they felt in control or not, to what extent they demonstrated
compassion and empathy, their degree of flexibility and freedom within
the relationship, the accuracy of their assumptions and diagnosis about
the case, as well as the amount of their own arrogance and
overconfidence that may have gotten in the way. It was also intriguing
the way some of the theorists were quite forgiving of their mistakes,
refusing to call that bad therapy as much as tentative data that should
be taken into account before changing direction. According to this
perspective, miscalculations, errors of judgment, awkward timing, and
poorly executed interventions don't necessarily imply consistent and
chronic ineptitude unless the therapist fails to make adjustments.

Interesting, isn't it, that experienced practitioners have such
radically different notions of what constitutes bad therapy? Whereas
some theorists based the assessment totally on the client's ultimate
opinion or actions, others considered such possibilities as their own
feelings about what happened. Is a case a success if the client leaves a
happy, satisfied customer, even if nothing fundamental has changed in
her behavior? What about the case of a client who claims there has been
no progress whatsoever, but about whom others report dramatic
improvement? We might conclude, therefore, that bad therapy involves
some kind of assessment by *both* parties that the results have been
less than satisfactory.

### Keeping Failure at a Distance {#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7-div1-66 .sec1}

Negative outcomes are not only disappointing to the client but also
often disconcerting to their therapists. Being bright, perceptive, and
psychologically sophisticated folks, if we are going to find excuses to
explain negative outcomes, they will be very good ones. Certainly, these
explanations do have some merit.

One of the most popular ways of warding off perceived threats is to tell
ourselves that it is really the client who succeeds or fails in this
therapeutic enterprise. Nevertheless, whether we admit it or not, we
cannot help but become affected by a client who is deteriorating before
our eyes and for whom there is nothing we can do to stop the downward
slide. These are the cases that haunt us the most, invade our sleep,
occupy our idle time, and dominate our conversations with colleagues. In
some instances, they are the most
[]{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_132}influential individuals we will ever
know---shaping our theories and whole style of practice.

During my own training years, I watched films of the masters in the
field with awe and admiration. I got the distinct impression that this
was what my own psychotherapy was supposed to look like, these magical
single sessions in which the clinician produces an amazing breakthrough.
Attending workshops only made things worse because presenters are so
often interested in selling their approaches, demonstrating how
efficiently and effectively they produce changes we can only dream
about. It has been one of my most closely guarded secrets that my own
sessions looked nothing like what I had seen on these films; they were
often chaotic, confusing, and awkward, and they sometimes required
considerable time to produce desired effects. This led me to spend
several decades interviewing therapists about their own experiences with
failure in order to feel better about my own (Kottler,
[1993](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-160){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0227},
[2017](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-169){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0228};
[Kottler & Blau,
1989](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-177){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0229};
[Kottler & Carlson,
2002](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-178){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0230}).

When I was eventually invited to do my own demonstration video, I was
determined to try something different. I was sick of all the experts in
the field showing what wizards they were, so apparently self-assured and
effortlessly working their magic. I wanted to do a session that really
looked like therapy in the trenches with all the awkward negotiations
that take place in the beginning. Initial interviews tend to be somewhat
uncomfortable, pressured interactions, with both participants trying
hard to make a good first impression, but it is rare that much work is
accomplished beyond data gathering and image management.

I was surprised to learn when I showed up for the taping that there were
actually three different clients I was scheduled to see. I inquired why
this was necessary, considering that the way I do therapy is different
with each person I see. I have this recurring fantasy of my clients
comparing notes on their sessions with me and reporting that it feels to
them as if each consulted a *different* therapist. So if the producer
wanted me to see three different clients, he would likely get some very
inconsistent and variable products. He explained to me the purpose of
this was to make certain that one session was usable. When I looked
puzzled by this explanation, given that he had been collecting archived
footage of the greatest, most accomplished practitioners in the world,
he smiled and explained in a whisper that so many of them don't actually
conduct sessions very well. They might be charismatic personalities,
passionate advocates for their approach, excellent writers and public
speakers, but they weren't necessarily very good at doing what they
taught to others. That's why they needed three opportunities (or more)
to produce a usable example of their work. I thought that was pretty
hilarious (and affirming).

[]{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_133}It turned out that the session with the
first client *did* turn out surprisingly well, and I happen to know why.
Before we went onstage and faced the lights, cameras, and studio
audience, I turned to the client and asked her if she was feeling as
nervous as I was. When she grabbed my hand for reassurance, I just knew
that everything would be okay: We had bonded in that moment, before the
cameras ever started rolling. There was an implicit contract between us:
"Look, I'll watch your back if you'll watch mine. It's us against them.
Let's make one another look good!"

If the first session went incredibly well, the second one was only fair.
Actually, it was pretty typical of a first conversation with an
adolescent girl. She was chatty and responsive but didn't really reveal
much about herself, and all I could do was grin and support her. It was
the third session that was absolutely miserable. I mean it was so bad
that I almost got up and walked off the production set. The adolescent
male wouldn't talk---at all. He said he had nothing to work on and just
sat there with his arms folded. The more I pushed him, the more reticent
he became. I violated everything that I hold most scared in my work;
most of all, I didn't respect his pace and needs, instead pursuing my
own hapless agenda. At one point in the session, you can actually see me
lean over and physically poke the guy in the arm, daring him to take a
risk with me. It is humiliating for me to watch the video (I have the
only copy since the producer insisted on deleting it), yet it pretty
accurately demonstrated what therapy looks like with a resistant
adolescent boy during a first session (especially in front of an
audience).

Once the ordeal was over, I argued that *this* was the case we should
use in the video. I wanted the world to see what therapy looks like when
I am failing miserably. It seemed to me that this would be so much more
instructive. The producer disagreed with my preference. We selected the
best session after all, the one that makes me look as if I really know
what I'm doing. But this spawned an idea about how much fun it would be
to ask the most famous therapists to talk about their most stunning
failures. The prospect may have been entertaining to contemplate, but it
was quite another thing to get famous theorists to talk about a time
when they failed miserably just like the rest of us mortal beings.

The main themes that emerged from these and other studies are that
failures are absolutely critical to our continued development---if, that
is, we are willing to acknowledge them. In most of the cases, the
negative outcomes helped us develop greater flexibility, creativity,
resilience, humility, and openness. It is when things go wrong that we
are forced to think about the ways we work and the things we can change.
When things merely go well, we move on to the next challenge without a
further thought.

### []{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_134}Causes of Failure {#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7-div1-67 .sec1}

If it is inevitable, if not a certainty, that therapy will "fail" at
times, lead to deterioration or an "alliance rupture," then it is
imperative that we are familiar with the most common causes of these
breaches. What can begin as a relatively insignificant gesture, simple
mistake, or miscalculation, can easily spiral out of control without
awareness of what might be happening. The therapist makes an offhand
joke, something that seems entirely benign that was just intended to
loosen things up a bit. But the client takes offense in a way that is
visible to the therapist, who wishes to clarify the minor
misunderstanding. The therapist becomes a bit annoyed by the client's
overreaction---a condition that the client can detect, leading to
feelings of rejection and withdrawal.

The therapist's projective and countertransference reactions results in
overpersonalizing what happened, kicking in more rigid boundaries that
are now consistently enforced. The client experiences this as further
rejection, a reminder of similar abuse from the past, all of which the
therapist does not realize and so chooses to interpret the resistance
and confront the increased tension. The client feels significantly more
agitation with this conflict, feels further misunderstood, and begins to
push back against almost anything the therapist says or does after that.
Things escalate when---well, you get the point: The cascade of
misunderstandings and hurt feelings grow until both parties feel
frustrated and discouraged.

Failure in any enterprise, especially one as complex as therapy,
involves a variety of factors on several different levels. Clearly some
are related to the client's characteristics and what he or she brings to
sessions in terms of motivation, unrealistic expectations, and hidden
agendas. When clients are referred against their will (as many are),
blackmailed into treatment by significant others, or ambivalent about
changing (as many are), impeded progress is more likely. Then there are
the personal characteristics and attitudes that influence outcomes, not
to mention certain counterproductive attitudes and beliefs, such as "I
know this won't help, and there's nothing you can do." There are also
particular personality styles (borderline, narcissistic, histrionic)
that could signal trouble ahead, as well as organic factors that might
impair the client's capability for insight and processing information.

Next there are variables contributing to failure that are outside our
control altogether. These are extraneous factors that are part of the
client's reality and situation, including an enmeshed or sabotaging
family, lack of a support system, ongoing substance abuse, poverty and
deprivation, and lack of reliable transportation or technology to attend
sessions. If the []{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_135}client can't get to
therapy on a regular basis, whether in person or via distance options,
then obviously results will be compromised. If the family or friends are
actively involved in sabotaging and undoing any progress, that also
makes things more difficult. When the client doesn't have solid supports
in place to reinforce new behaviors, then it is challenging to maintain
progress outside of sessions and make the effects last.

Third, there are factors related to the therapy process and relationship
itself, which are often the most common root cause for disappointment,
especially when the therapist does not systematically invite, assess,
and respond to client feedback ([Duncan & Sparks,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-59){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0231};
[Schuckard et al.,
2017](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-277){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0232}).
Sometimes there is a basic incompatibility between clinician and
client---things just don't mesh because of a clash in personalities,
values, or styles. The pace of sessions could be too fast or slow,
causing the client to drop out prematurely. There could be an inadequate
alliance, with a corresponding lack of commitment, trust, and perceived
understanding. There could be also be dependency issues operating or
transference processes that are all part of the relationship.

In addition to these process considerations, there are certain
therapeutic approaches, techniques, and strategies that have been found
to be relatively ineffective, if not harmful, even though therapists
might continue to employ them ([Knox,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-152){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0233};
[Kottler & Balkin,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-175){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0234};
[Rozental et al.,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-272){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0235}).
Some of these treatments that have little evidence to support their
effectiveness include treatments for dissociative identity, critical
incident stress debriefing, "scared straight" interventions, rebirthing,
thought field therapy, sexual reorientation, and age regression, among
many others. You may be aware of particular colleagues who are operating
from outdated assumptions and using obsolete methods that have little
empirical support and may have been debunked a long time ago. In recent
times, the whole notion of "truth," "facts," and "scientific evidence"
has been eroded within the political arena, leading a significant part
of the population to subscribe to beliefs that are wildly at odds with
reality.

Throughout the history of medicine in general, and mental health
treatments in particular, there has always been a time lag between
popular practices that have been employed and eventual discoveries of
their potential ineffectiveness and dangers. It wasn't *that* long ago
that our predecessors believed that the emotionally afflicted should be
treated with animal magnetism, frontal lobotomies, leeches and bleeding,
or even burned at the stake or drowned as witches. This only leads us to
justifiably wonder what we are still doing these days with the utmost
confidence that may eventually turn out to be utterly worthless when all
the evidence is collected.

[]{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_136}Last but hardly least are therapist
characteristics that get in the way of success, not just with a given
client but with our work in general. Practitioners who communicate
negative attitudes, who are perceived as rigid and arrogant, or who
display blatant narcissism and self-centeredness, can drive clients
away. Practitioners can also be deficient in certain skills, struggling,
for example, with confrontation or other interventions that are
awkwardly timed or poorly executed.

If you do your own honest self-assessment of your weaknesses, lapses,
and most consistent mistakes, such an exercise is both disconcerting and
clearly enlightening. One of the most valuable contributions we make to
clients' lives is when we are able to tell them things about themselves
about which they are apparently unaware---the things they do that are
off-putting and push others way, their annoying habits, or their
self-sabotaging behaviors that consistently get them in trouble. Given
how useful such feedback can be, it is absolutely crucial that we
subject ourselves to the same kind of self-scrutiny to improve our own
performance and effectiveness.

Take a few moments to consider the kinds of things you have most
frequently heard from former and current clients, as well as colleagues
and supervisors, about the things you do that are less than ideal. I've
been told repeatedly, especially by students but also by clients, that I
have an inscrutable blank face when I'm concentrating, which is often
interpreted by them as critical judgment; I've been told repeatedly to
show more authentic reactions. I have also struggled with my own
internal critical voice most of my life, frequently forming judgments
about people that are less than kind. I pout when I don't get the
approval I feel I deserve. I have this burning need for recognition that
has fueled my unrelenting ambition. I self-disclose too freely and
sometimes self-indulgently. But my biggest problem of all is my
impatience, pushing clients too fast, too hard, because *I'm* the one
who wants or needs to see some action.

What about *you*?

### Processing Failures With Scrupulous Honesty---and Forgiveness {#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7-div1-68 .sec1}

The most constructive way to process failure is to simply conceive it as
useful information that what we are doing that is not working very well.
Admitting this requires a degree of honest assessment, as well as
recruiting the client's help regarding what is most and least effective.
One of the best predictors of a positive outcome and a reversal of
disappointing results is []{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_137}the therapist's
systematic attempt to solicit feedback from clients after every session.
Even when things aren't going well, clients still report greater
satisfaction when they are allowed to provide their input on what they
like and what they don't ([Duncan,
2014](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-56){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0236};
[Duncan & Sparks,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-59){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0237};
[Miller & Rousmaniere,
2014](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-225){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0238}).
This relates directly to the research on team members' level of
satisfaction with scheduled meetings---most often mentioned as the most
annoying waste of time in people's jobs ([Geimer et al.,
2015](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-90){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0239};
[Kottler,
2018b](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-171){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0240}).
As long as participants are allowed to offer an opinion during a
meeting, whether it is listened to and responded or not, they still feel
grateful and rate the experience much more satisfying. People just like
to be able to express themselves, no matter how people respond
afterward.

It is critical not only to acknowledge and own our failures but also to
be forgiving of these lapses. What distinguished the master therapists
I've interviewed from others I have known is their resilience and
acceptance of themselves as fallible people who sometimes miss something
important. It is also useful to be able to reframe failure as
constructive feedback since this permits a greater level of flexibility
to make needed adjustments when things are going well. And when things
are *not* proceeding as desired or expected, it is useful to consider
several questions that are directly related to soliciting ongoing client
feedback:

::: list1
[]{#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7-item1-125}[1.]{.enumerator}When

:::

It requires a level of determined and scrupulous self-critical honesty
to process this feedback in such a way that we don't just blame clients
for being stubborn, resistant, or uncooperative when, in fact, they are
just doing the best they can under the circumstances. Instead---or at
least in addition---we must examine our own behavior, assumptions, and
actions as possible factors, if not causes, in any sort of failed
effort. Failures are hardly ever the result of one person in a
relationship but involve interactive effects that play out between
participants. It may be true that, more than anything else, clients
largely determine their own outcomes, but we are also aware of certain
things that we might do that are oft-putting, discouraging, or clearly
ineffective when we might do any of the following:

::: prosequote

:::

One reminder worth mentioning repeatedly is the consistent body of
research that indicates that the single most important factor
influencing whether treatment is a success or failure (or anything else
in between) is the *client's* perception of the quality of the
relationship. When we fail to form a collaborative alliance or don't
recognize when there is some rupture, it is almost inevitable that the
experience will likely be []{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_139}unsatisfactory
for everyone involved. A second reminder is that we often tend to
overgeneralize what we think we know and understand to an assortment of
different cases without adapting to fit the unique cultural background
of clients who bring quite different expectations and goals into
sessions.

### The Gifts From Failure {#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7-div1-69 .sec1}

Failure is useful to us in many ways, teaching us to be more creative
and experimental, to try out new strategies when familiar ones are not
working. It teaches us humility and patience and promotes greater
reflection about what we do and what impact our behavior has on others,
for better or worse. Failure is at the growth edge in our work and in
our lives. We sometimes forget that it is precisely our mistakes and
miscalculations that so often lead to breakthroughs in our own
understanding and creative endeavors. This has been the case in almost
any domain and profession, illustrated by one dramatic case in medicine.

Sidney Faber, a pathologist working at a New York children's hospital
during the mid-twentieth century, found himself at a complete loss for
how to treat leukemia when there was no available treatment during those
days. He watched his young patients waste away, feeling completely
helpless to ease their suffering, much less cure their fatal disease. He
had heard from a colleague about some of the clinical benefits of folic
acid, so he tried experimenting with this compound to treat his own
patients. Alas, all the children in his study promptly died, after which
he was fired from his job! It would be impossible to think of a more
devastating failure than killing all your patients and then being blamed
and dismissed for the tragedy. Some might quit the profession altogether
or at least hide in shame. But the story is not over.

Faber reasoned that if folic acid accelerated the growth of cancer
cells, then perhaps an antifolic compound might actually lead to
remission or even a cure of the disease. This became the first
successful cancer treatment in the history of medicine and led to the
invention of chemotherapy as a cure. This is not just an unusual case in
which mistakes and failures can result in brilliant new inventions and
discoveries. Alexander Fleming allowed his laboratory equipment to
become contaminated through negligence, after which he discovered the
first antibiotic, penicillin, growing in his petri dishes. Likewise, the
pacemaker, x-ray, vaccinations, nitrous oxide, angiograms,
anticoagulants, and benzodiazepines were all discovered by pure accident
and previous errors.

[]{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_140}With anything we do, or have ever done,
personally and professionally, it is only after we've already exhausted
everything we know how to do that we are willing to experiment and
improvise with something else, something that often leads to the
unexpected and unanticipated. That is such an important lesson to learn
during those times when we feel lost or stuck.

Last night I led a therapy group that was one of the most frustrating
professional experiences of my life. Nothing seemed to work. There were
long silences. Nobody would volunteer or agree to work on key issues
that they brought up during the check-in. When I attempted to confront
the resistance that was going on, most of the members denied such
feelings. When I attempted to stir things up through immediacy and
talking about my own feelings of frustration, a few members used it as
an opportunity to express their anger in indirect, manipulative ways. I
tried breaking the group up into smaller units to talk about what wasn't
being said. I deputized a few other members to take over and lead the
group. Nothing worked, and we remained at a stalemate. Among the
thousands of groups I'd led in the past, I had never encountered
anything quite like this one before. I felt lost, confused, and clueless
about what to do next.

Okay, I didn't sleep much last night while I was trying to sort out what
was going on and what I might do next with this "failing" group. I
reviewed my own leadership interventions carefully. I played back
critical issues that had occurred in the session, making links to
previous content. I wrote down some possible hypotheses to explore in
future sessions (if the group stays together). Most of all, I have been
doing some hard thinking about what I know, what I think I know, and
what I don't understand at all. This is painful work that is both
disorienting and quite exciting. And all the new learning and growth
taking place for me this minute as I write these words is the direct
result of perceived failure. Regardless of what happens next group
session, being and feeling blocked have led me to consider alternative
ways to work in the future. Although I can't honestly say I'm grateful
for this opportunity, I am trying to make the most of it.

The internal, self-critical review described above is an example of the
kind of reflective analysis that almost all of us are doing these days
as we experiment and learn how to adapt our work to the increased demand
for telehealth and screen-based sessions. It is an important and
necessary step in this process that we figure out what things we have
always done in the past that don't translate well to alternative
delivery systems, as well as figure out new ways to increase our
influence and impact when we are literally operating from a different
place altogether.

### []{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_141}Talking to Ourselves About Failure {#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7-div1-70 .sec1}

Even the most seasoned professionals struggle at times processing
critical feedback from clients without feeling defensive and needing to
make excuses. Until such time that we can work through feelings of
doubt, threat, or incompetence, it's difficult to learn anything useful
from the experience, not only to resolve the dispute but also to improve
personal and professional functioning in the future. It is precisely our
own ability at emotional regulation and self-talk that leads to a deeper
understanding of our mistakes and misjudgments, as well as the
opportunity to "fix" them. Struggling with a history of brutal
self-critical thinking, I have taken comfort from the little known fact
that squirrels can't find 80% of the acorns that they bury. I will say
that again because I find it so astounding---and hilarious. Think about
it: If you were asked to provide a job description for a squirrel you
would say: "They locate, collect, and then survive on acorns they have
buried." And yet---even though this is how they spend most of their
time---they lose more than three quarters of their valuable food
sources. But the lesson here is that (I assume) they just accept this
consistent failure and loss as part of the job and move on with a shrug
(if squirrels can shrug).

More relevant to our own situation, Albert [Ellis
(1984)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-63){#14_chapter7.xhtml_n0241}
once remarked that it was rash, if not downright irrational, for
therapists to believe that they can be successful with *all* their
clients all the time. I am certain he was right. We understand that it
is beyond our means to help everybody. Yet this realization does not
protect us from the beliefs that, "All my interpretations must be
profound," "I must always make brilliant judgments," "My clients must
appreciate my work and be grateful as hell," and "They should work as
hard between sessions as I do when I'm with them."

One of the most illuminating interviews I did with a prominent therapist
about attitudes toward failure was with psychiatrist Frank Pittman, who
responded to the question by saying, "You want an example of failure? Do
you want one that happened *today*? I've got so many I don't know where
to begin."

"Well," I prompted him further, "how about your favorite one?"

Pittman then began to tell the story of the time he was doing a
demonstration with a family onstage in front of a large audience. He
pushed the identified patient, a young man, hard enough that the boy
indignantly walked offstage in anger. The boy's mother and sisters were
so furious at the way he had been treated that they gave Pittman a piece
of their mind and then walked offstage and out the door, never to be
seen again. Then the audience protested the treatment of the family by
getting up and walking []{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_142}out, leaving
Pittman sitting onstage alone. The organizer of the workshop was so
upset by this that she immediately drove Pittman to the airport without
speaking to him; it wasn't even the airport he was supposed to leave
from, just the one closest to the venue!

"How can you live with yourself after that?" I asked Pittman. "How can
you show your face in public again?"

Pittman just shrugged. "You win a few; you lose a few."

"That's it? That's the way you dealt with blowing the session like
that?"

"Hey, it's like this. You can't do good therapy unless you take some
risks. Sometimes they work out, and sometimes they don't."

I still don't know how he could shrug off the incident so easily, but I
found great wisdom in his reminder that living with mistakes and
failures is just part of being a therapist, and there is no sense in
denying it. We are all squirrels in a sense that sometimes we have lost
a few acorns no matter how careful and systematic we might be. The
important thing is what we learn from these experiences.

### Living With Futility {#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7-div1-71 .sec1}

There is no surprise more devastating than receiving a Release of
Information form from another therapist who is now working with an
ex-client of yours. First, feelings of anger and betrayal emerge; then
self-doubt sneaks up and builds to a thundering crescendo. If we have a
colleague available to complain to, it is likely that you will hear a
comforting pronouncement: "You were so effective with that client that
he is afraid to come back to you, knowing he will have to change." Sure.

The truth is that there are times when each of us feels lost. We just
cannot get through to some people because of our (or their) deficiencies
and limitations. Most of the time, we never find out what really went
wrong. The client stops coming and does not return calls. In some ways,
it feels even worse when a client keeps coming but will not let you get
through to her; she feels strong enough and safe enough to continue
therapy without the fear of having to change. It is no consolation to
remind yourself that you get paid whether the client appears to change
or not. You still have to deal with that stony, determined face. You
still have to put up with the games, defensive reactions, and stubborn
resistance and not take them personally.

There are those clients who will seemingly come forever: the passive,
dependent personalities who need someone to dish out approval; the
[]{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_143}narcissistic people who need an audience;
or the borderline clients who, when they are not bouncing off the
ceiling, need someone they can pay to abuse. It sometimes seems futile
to work with these people because they will often improve so slowly, if
at all, and will rarely be cured of what ails them. We measure progress
among the severely disturbed population in terms that are less than
spectacular. We have the audacity to believe that we can change the tide
of a person's genetic structure, a family's rigid hierarchy, or stable
personality traits that have been in place since birth. It's a miracle
that we ever make a difference in these clients' lives. And it is not
unusual for us to encounter a force greater than we are capable of
counteracting. Even when we do manage to play some significant role in
helping a person change, that does not mean the effects will last for
very long.

It seems futile to try to convince a 17-year-old that we can offer him
an antidote to his lust for excitement that can compete with marijuana,
beer, Oxy, or meth. It feels hopeless to try to help a child who has
been the victim of physical and sexual abuse, living in a temporary care
facility because she can't be returned to her parents and there is
nobody who will take her into foster care, much less adopt her. It feels
similarly hopeless to try to lure an alcoholic away from bourbon with
the mere promise of greener pastures. It is futile to try to help an
enraged adolescent when his parents sabotage treatment. When an
individual jumps right back into his peer group after leaving our
office, it is unrealistic to think we can alter his values. We
experience futility when we attempt to cure anybody of anything. Nobody
wants what we are selling until they find they have no other choice. And
even then, they will settle for cosmetic changes if they can just buy
some time. We can give them what they want---a little relief---but we
know that is futile, too.

### Some Tentative Conclusions {#14_chapter7.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-7-div1-72 .sec1}

So what is to be concluded from this discussion of failure in therapy?
For one thing, it not only is when you do something terribly stupid or
graceless that you do lousy work, but also when you demonstrate benign
neglect. Laziness, complacency, and functioning on autopilot all
contribute to mediocre work.

Second, reflecting on your failures and disappointing results can serve
to considerably improve your skills in the future, teaching you to be
more flexible and inventive in your interventions and more responsive to
each client's needs. Yet excessive self-reflection also has its side
effects in []{#14_chapter7.xhtml_page_144}contributing to greater
self-absorption, self-doubt, and feelings of perfectionism for you can
never measure up to the ideal you have in mind.

Third, the key to processing failures effectively begins with owning
them, acknowledging your mistakes, and talking about them honestly with
colleagues whom you trust. This doesn't mean just complaining about
client resistance and noncompliance but talking about your own behavior
and ways you can improve. Related to this point is the importance of not
only accepting your limitations but also forgiving yourself for being
imperfect, flawed, and human. No matter how hard you try, no matter how
much you study and learn and practice, you'll do good therapy, and
you'll do bad therapy.

Just hope you can tell the difference.

## [Patients Who Test Our Patience](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0010) {.ch_title2}

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div1-73}I had been
working as a full-time therapist in private practice for 10 years when
most of my clients started to sound the same to me. Most of them were
fairly affluent, privileged professionals who seemed to be complaining
about the most minor disruptions in their lives. I began seriously
wondering if I was actually wasting my own life holding their hands and
offering false reassurances. It got to the point that I was teetering on
depression myself because it seemed that my work was becoming so
routine, if not futile. I started to think about my clients in the most
derogatory terms, resenting some of them, celebrating when they canceled
appointments, dreading the prospect of enduring some of the sessions. I
didn't feel sufficiently appreciated. Some of the people I faced seemed
to talk about the same things every time, content just to use me as a
receptacle to hold all their grievances.

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-016.jpg)

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_146}It was during this time that I conceived
of a book idea that was certain to be a raging success: I would call it
*Clients From Hell*, and each chapter would be about a different kind of
client who had been sent to make my life miserable. I don't know whom
you might nominate for inclusion in such a book, but I had no trouble
making a long list of prospects (many of those in my caseload at the
time). There was the surly adolescent who wouldn't talk---I mean never.
He would make hand gestures and sulk; that's about it. The only thing
he'd agree to do in therapy was play the card game War, which is just
about the most boring game in the world and requires no skill whatsoever
other than shuffling the deck. Then there was the elderly woman who
wouldn't stop talking at all, never letting me get a word in. She would
ramble on, repeat the same stories over and over, and refuse to respond
to any meager thing I offered. There was another client who would tell
me each week that I was the greatest therapist in the world, but never
changed a single thing about her dysfunctional life and was still
involved in the most abusive relationship I could imagine. There was the
guy who kept coming back, week after week, to complain about how
worthless I was and how nothing I was doing helped him, but he refused
to go away until I fixed him. There was---well, you get the point and
could perhaps construct a list of your own.

I was very excited about this project about difficult clients who test
our patience and drive us crazy. I had little problem getting other
therapists to talk about their own most challenging clients or finding
tons of material in the literature about so-called resistant, reluctant,
ungrateful, noncompliant, nonresponsive, defiant, challenging,
rebellious, uncooperative, obstinate, hateful clients. I had discovered
a gold mine and couldn't wait to excavate it further. I was feeling
better already about how unappreciated I was by many of my clients who
had the audacity to resist my best efforts to help them.

The manuscript was sent out for review, and one recipient offered the
following feedback: "I think Kottler has a problem because he thinks all
of his clients are sent from hell to make his life miserable." As I read
these words, I found myself immediately nodding my head in agreement.
"Further," the reviewer added, "it seems to me he has lost his
compassion."

Yikes---that hit me square where it hurt the most. This reviewer was
absolutely on target: I *had* lost my compassion and empathy for my
clients. I *did* see them as enemies to be defeated. I did feel
embroiled in conflict with many of them, fighting a losing battle. And I
was impatient because clients weren't moving as quickly as I wanted them
to; in fact, they weren't moving as fast as I *needed* them to because
my own life felt stale and stuck. I realized, then and there, that it
wasn't that my clients who were being all that obstructive as much as
that my own attitudes signified that *I* was the one who was being
difficult.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_147}I made several important decisions once I
digested that single incisive comment. First I switched the name of the
book from *Clients From Hell* to *Compassionate Therapy.* I changed the
whole focus of the project to look not only at the ways that clients
were being resistant but also at the ways that therapists were making
things so much worse for themselves and those they were trying to help.
The second consequence of this realization was that it was time to get
another job because I recognized that I was not functioning very well in
my current work situation.

Oh, by the way, who was that reviewer who pointed out the importance of
compassion, understanding, and empathy in working with those who don't
cooperate in ways we would prefer? Who was this scholar who reminded me
about how important it was to be patient and accepting of where my
clients were at? Perhaps you've heard of him: His name was Albert Ellis.

### Preferred and Nonpreferred Clients {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div1-74 .sec1}

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-017.jpg)

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_148}Some of the perils that a therapist
encounters are an implicit part of the job. Just as a construction
worker would hardly complain about the heights at which he must work and
a soldier would not be surprised to find people shooting at him during a
war, a therapist accepts the challenges of spending time with people who
are troubled and often interpersonally challenged. Unfortunately, there
is increasing evidence that conditions like depression really *are*
contagious, especially within the intimate context of families or
therapy relationships. Furthermore, certain clients present extreme
disturbances of personality or behavior that not only drive us a little
crazy but also penetrate our souls.

That clinicians have strong preferences concerning whom they prefer to
work with is well known. Most everyone prefers clients who are bright,
eager, verbal, perceptive, and attractive. These clients not only grow
quickly but also can be patient, polite, prompt, and grateful, and they
pay their bills on time.

What is often left unsaid is how much more comfortable a therapist (or
anyone) feels working with people who are most similar to her in terms
of religion, race, socioeconomic background, and core values. A young
Japanese American female therapist told me in supervision that she
feared working with the inner-city African American youth who make up
part of her caseload. A Latino school counselor from a homogeneous
community struggled with some of the Asian girls in his elementary
school, who seemed so quiet and passive compared with the other
children. An African American pastor and family counselor found himself
resenting some of the Whites who were attending his congregation and
found himself guiltily wishing they would stay away. And a middle-class
so-called liberal therapist liked the *idea* of helping at-risk
populations but failed to make the kinds of deep connections with these
clients that she did with those who were more similar to her in
background. The conclusion, hardly surprising even if rarely talked
about in public settings, is that we tend to feel more comfortable
working with people who are most like us (however that is conceived).

Therapists may express preferences based mostly on the similarity of
cases to those others that have turned well, whether the case falls
within their spectrum of expertise or whether it involves issues that
are not very personally threatening. Therapists would also have
expressed preferences for those clients who are more flexible in
scheduling sessions and who either have good insurance or pay their
bills without having to be reminded or begged. We also all form first
impressions and initial assessments regarding how challenging we think a
client might be for us to help or handle, especially when we encounter
someone who seems either overly compliant or aggressive.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_149}Part of being a therapist involves
working with those individuals who, for a variety of reasons, will test
your patience, flexibility, and resourcefulness in ways you've never
imagined were possible. In some cases, they push your buttons and ignite
a whole host of strong personal reactions that may or may not be related
to the client's own issues. It is certainly the case that what
contributes to clients being perceived as "difficult" not only relates
to their personality characteristics, attitudes toward therapy, beliefs
about their problems, severity and intensity of their diagnosis, chronic
habits, among other factors, but also is shaped by the therapist's
experience and intention labeling the behavior as somehow "resistant" or
"obstructive" ([C. Fischer et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-72){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0242}).

### Countertransference Reactions {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div1-75 .sec1}

Perhaps the most thoroughly discussed hazard of therapeutic work is the
classical countertransference reactions to challenging clients. The term
itself is used in several different ways, depending on the context and
theoretical orientation. It has been described most generally as the
therapist's personal feelings toward a client, which may or may not
represent some degree of distortion, bias, or projection. It can involve
the way the therapist responds to the client's own transference
feelings, triggering strong reactions to being treated as a parent,
lover, authority figure, or some other ghost from the past. Like so many
other processes in therapy, countertransference can be classified in
terms of whether the reactions are essentially reactive, induced,
displaced, or projected. In each case, there is the likelihood of some
degree of distortion that can lead to treatment difficulties as well as
the possibility that such feelings will have either beneficial or
detrimental effects.

In reviewing the anecdotal and empirical literature that has been
presented in both psychoanalytic and generic psychotherapy literature,
it is evident that these personal reactions can be used as significant
turning points in the therapy, a means by which the therapist can offer
feedback and impressions that might otherwise be withheld ([Hayes et
al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-120){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0243};

[Tishby & Wiseman,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-306){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0246}).

Any interpretation that a therapist offers contains a statement about
not only the client but also the therapist herself. Any clinical
decision to choose one course of action over another is based on more
than objective analysis of what is best for the client; it also
represents the subjective inner world of the practitioner, including our
moods, responses in the moment, and whatever else is going on in our
lives at the time.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_150}It is within the context of our
relationship with clients that we are most likely to see evidence of our
overinvolvement in some way. [Treadway (2000, p.
34)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-308){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0247}
lamented his most memorable failure: "I can still see Amy sitting there,
cross-legged, with her arms folded across her chest. She was perched on
the hood of my car. Our therapy session had ended five hours earlier."
He had lost control of the case, mostly by failing to manage his own
feelings for the overly dependent young woman. He wanted to save her,
and by exaggerating his own power, he got caught up in his grandiose
beliefs in his power to heal.

The manifestations of therapist distortion---overidentification and
overinvolvement---may take a number of different forms that have been
most commonly mentioned:

:::

Countertransference was first described by Freud in his relationships
with patients (e.g., Dora) and colleagues (e.g., Wilhelm Fliess and Carl
Jung) that sometimes inexplicably spun out of control. In 1910, in a
letter to his friend Sandor Ferenczi during a period of conflict, [Freud
(1955)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-85){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0248}
revealed that he was not the psychoanalytic superman that others
imagined him to be, and he had not overcome his strong reactions. He
would develop these ideas in a paper published a few years later in
which he stated that the therapist's personal feelings toward clients
are both the greatest tool in treatment and the greatest obstacle
([Freud,
1912](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-83){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0249}).

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_151}After registering these initial thoughts,
Freud didn't have much more to say about countertransference reactions
except to remind therapists that it was important to develop a "thick
skin" toward clients in order to displace strong feelings that were
viewed mostly as a hindrance to the process. This belief was later
echoed in greater detail by others, who thought countertransference
feelings were not only undesirable complications in the therapeutic
process but also real assets in the promotion of a true human encounter.
Such psychodynamic theorists as Frieda Fromm-Reichmann, Franz Alexander,
and Therese Benedek felt that although the analyst's personal reactions
to patients could be seriously disturbing to both parties, the dangers
were minimal if the analyst had undergone intensive treatment and
supervision in his own analysis.

Since the work of these psychodynamic thinkers, countertransference has
come to mean many things beyond unresolved, unconscious reactions. We've
now mostly viewed these personal reactions as possible evidence of both
distorted and genuine, "real" relational responses that offer possible
leverage for deeper work ([Hayes et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-120){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0250}).
Particular reactions---and personal distortions---have different
meanings depending on whether they are situational, chronic, or case
specific. When cultural differences are taken into account, we can
appreciate just how varied our responses might become. More recently,
with the increased popularity of online, virtual, and distance-based
sessions, our feelings toward our clients---and their own toward
us---have shifted in ways that are symbolic, metaphorical, and literal
([Svenson,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-302){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0251}).

Just like almost everything else, countertransference has been found to
come in a variety of forms that signal different issues and challenges
involved, as well as suggest specialized ways of resolving them
([Barreto & Matos,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-13){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0252}):

::: list1
[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-150}[1.]{.enumerator}*Subjective

blind spots, conflicts, internal distractions, and inappropriate

and clinical ruptures.

posture* refers to one's favored theoretical orientation and clinical
style, each of which features unique limitations and "holes" in the
system. A therapist, for example, may adopt an assortment of different
mindsets in response to client actions, such as psychodynamic
[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_152}(evenly hovering attention); cognitive
behavioral (rational, logical, directive); or humanistic (empathic,
accepting, nonjudgmental).

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-153}[4.]{.enumerator}*Experiential
countertransference* is embedded in an approach that views the alliance
as authentic, genuine, and collaborative, thus interpreting the
therapist's reactions as legitimate and "real." This can occur, for
instance, when we have sincere, clearheaded, deep feelings of caring,
compassion, even nonpossessive "love" for a client.
:::

There have been many refinements in therapeutic technique since Freud's
day, yet clinicians still struggle with their feelings, distortions,
unconscious reactions, unresolved conflicts, misperceptions, antagonism,
and subjective experiences in relation to certain clients. At best,
unraveling these personal reactions can be seen as a creative act of
personal discovery, not to mention a therapeutic breakthrough. At worst,
such experiences can provoke a personal crisis for the therapist in ways
that may not have been anticipated. One therapist described a case in
which her strong feelings toward a particularly difficult client didn't
crop up until 14 years later ([Khair Badawi,
2015](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-149){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0253})!

Whether we catch ourselves being overprotective, overly solicitous,
aloof, or downright hostile, it is evident that we have very different
feelings and reactions to certain clients. A brief glimpse at the
appointment calendar reminds us of those people we eagerly await and
those we dread. We are friendlier with some clients than with others.
Some of them are greeted cordially with an open smile and an offer of a
beverage, whereas others are coolly directed to their place with a
reminder of their delinquent bill.

Of course, we are supposed to treat all our clients with an equal degree
of respect, solicitousness, and caring regardless of their background,
race, religion, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, personality, or
presenting complaints. It even says so in our ethical codes! But we know
that is not nearly the case. We genuinely like some clients better than
others: We are drawn to them (or even *overly* drawn to them) because
they share our most cherished values. We also have strong personal
reactions to those who are from backgrounds foreign to our experience.
Our socially liberal, politically correct sensibilities may lead us to
find such individuals exotic or interesting, while others who support
and vehemently express extremely conservative views might earn our
disgust. Other habits, customs, behavior, or actions might also trigger
us depending on prior experiences.

A Chinese immigrant tells his sad tale of leaving his family behind to
make a new life in an adopted country, but it is hard to concentrate on
the story because he keeps spitting phlegm in his handkerchief, in
keeping with his custom back home.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_153}An adolescent girl from the inner city
talks about her troubles fighting with her boyfriend, but all the
therapist can do is focus on the dozens of piercings that protrude from
her nostrils, ears, lips, tongue, and eyebrows.

A school counselor with strong feminist convictions sits in a family
session, appalled at what is unfolding before her. The family is of
Persian origins. The mother is dressed in a *chador*, the traditional
Islamic head cover. While she and her son sit obediently and quietly,
the father speaks with authority and condescension about how the school
is at fault for not doing a better job of tolerating their son's
"creativity." Each time the counselor addresses a question to the
mother, the father answers for her and does so in a manner that suggests
that if only she would be more obedient, then perhaps they wouldn't be
having such difficulties in the first place. The counselor tries her
best not to leap across the room and slap the guy for his insolence. But
the truth of the matter is that she has lost her composure, lost her
ability to understand the cultural context for what is going on, because
her own buttons are being pushed.

Such inadvertent, unconscious, utterly understandable reactions abound
even though we are supposed to be feeling compassion and a certain
neutrality. In reality, there are times when we feel slightly put off,
if not totally repulsed, by some clients we see. Some of this may be the
result of their antisocial or annoying behavior, but other times the
strong feelings of aversion arise from our own prejudices, racism,
biases, and lack of experience with people of some backgrounds.

Many therapists consider their intense personal reactions, when
recognized, to be crucial in diagnosing how others might respond to the
client in the outside world. Such reactions can be valuable clues in
making sense of chronically dysfunctional patterns, especially when we
wonder the extent to which our own reactions reveal some reasons why
others might find this person so challenging. Once you become cognizant
of strong feelings toward a client, what do you do with that awareness?
Share it in session? Ignore it and refocus? Enforce stricter boundaries?
Refer to another therapist? Confess to a supervisor? The main concern,
of course, is what is in the client's best interests and how we can use
these reactions productively.

For example, one client may speak in a general, abstract way about what
is bothering him, but I've been able to narrow it down to a
communication problem with his girlfriend. Every time I encourage him to
elaborate and say more about the issue, he announces with finality that
he'd rather not. I struggle to respect his right to go at his own speed,
but I can feel my frustration start to build. I now have a sense of what
I believe his girlfriend must be feeling every time she tries to get him
to open up. This turns out to be extremely helpful when untangling what
might be going on.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_154}There is no shame associated with
admitting we have strong personal reactions to our clients. It is when
they remain unacknowledged and unchecked that the feelings not only
ferment within us but also compromise the quality of work we can do in
sessions. Self-awareness is thus such a critical part of our presence in
any relationship, professional or personal, in that we must distinguish
between any of our distorted, exaggerated responses from those that more
accurately uncover counterproductive or dysfunctional behavior. This is
really a discussion of not only those mentalizing processes that occur
during intense sessions but also especially the nagging, annoying
thoughts, feelings, and disturbing reactions that take place before and
afterward.

### Some Therapist Fantasies {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div1-76 .sec1}

When reactive feelings are ignored, denied, distorted, and projected,
both the client's treatment and the therapist's mental health can often
suffer. One obvious place to uncover possible clues to
countertransference reactions is in the texture and content of our
fantasy life. Whether these fantasies are primarily rescue oriented,
erotic in nature, or expressive of rage, frustration, and anger, we
can't help but think about and daydream about some of our clients,
especially those who are most vexing, uncooperative, or manipulative.
The following descriptions of reactions toward clients come from a mixed
group of social workers, family therapists, counselors, and
psychologists and highlight some of the fantasy landscape in which we
might sometimes reside:

::: prosequote
I genuinely love a few of my patients. I mean, I love them as much as I
love my sister, my best friend, or my husband. I suppose, in a way, a
few of my patients have become my closest friends. I think about them
during the day, and when I do, I feel warm inside. I have known this one
patient for about seven years and I like her so much. I feel sad
sometimes that I can only know her as her therapist because I would very
much enjoy meeting her for lunch and telling her about my own life.

This guy I've been treating for a few months is the president of a major
corporation. He's got a tremendous amount of power and responsibility.
He hires and fires people at whim, and he's let me know that I'm under
his scrutiny as well. I think about how great it would be if I help this
guy, that maybe he would invite me into his company to work with his
people. He's got offices []{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_155}all over the
world, and I think about traveling from Bangkok to Rio putting out
fires.

I see this adorable Mexican kid who has no stable home. His mother is
hardly ever around doing who-knows-what. His father is back in Mexico
trying to keep things together. And this poor kid is lost and alone most
of the time. There are times when I think about adopting him, taking him
home with me, giving him a proper home rather than just the bandages I
apply once a week.

I could strangle this guy he's so whiny and complaining. He exhibits
everything I despise in other people and myself: passivity, external
control, helplessness, incompetence. I know he knows that I don't really
like him much. But he's so used to having people not like him that my
relationship with him seems normal. I end up feeling like he
does---helpless---because he refuses to change. As I listen to him talk
in his high-pitched monotone, I idly wonder what creative things I could
do to break through his inhibited exterior. I picture myself slapping
his face or laughing at him. Then I feel such guilt because I lose my
compassion.

These and other fantasies represent only one narrow aspect of the
therapist's phenomenological world, and they are certainly not typical
of the way we think about our clients all, or even most, of the time.
Occasionally, however, such fantasies provide clues to how we are
reacting to our clients. When processing strong countertransference
reactions toward some clients, there are several questions to be
considered:

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_156}Because these questions require a high
degree of frankness and honesty, it is often challenging to consider
them productively without the assistance of a colleague or supervisor to
confront your attempts to disown your own role in therapeutic impasses.
It is just so tempting to blame the client as the problem, the one whose
resistance, defensiveness, and plain orneriness makes your life so
unnecessarily difficult.

### Most Difficult Cases {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div1-77 .sec1}

Among experienced therapists, there is some consensus regarding those
clients who most consistently present special challenges. Borderline
personalities, sociopathic personalities, and those with conduct
disorders test a therapist's patience and defenses like few others. The
prognoses are poor; progress, if any, is slow; and the therapist is
likely to be on the receiving end of manipulation or dramatic and
painful transference.

A number of studies on the client behaviors that therapists experience
as most stressful create a consistent portrait of the most frequently
mentioned occurrences: threats of suicide, expressions of anger,
demonstrations of hostility, severe depression, abject apathy, and
premature termination. In addition, characteristics and behaviors of
clients are frequently mentioned, such as those who (a) experience
extreme psychotic symptoms (major hallucinations, delusions); (b) have
hidden agendas (workers' compensation or court referrals); (c) violate
boundaries (chronic lateness or missed appointments); (d) externalize
blame and refuse to accept responsibility ("It's not my fault"); (e) are
argumentative (hostile, skeptical, aggressive); (f) interpret everything
in literal and concrete ways (unable to access or express internal
states); (g) reveal serious suicidal intent; (h) have poor impulse
control (offenders, substance abusers); or (i) feel trapped in life
circumstances (homelessness, poverty) that make therapy seem useless
when compared to basic necessities that are really needed most.

This list might make it appear as if *all* our clients are difficult. As
therapists, we see the most perverse, bizarre, and sometimes even the
most evil parts of human existence. We are constantly exposed to
cruelty, conflict, deception, manipulation, cynicism, mistrust, and
betrayal. We see people when they are desperate, lost, and at their
absolute worst. We are privy to their most secret, hidden selves. We are
the folks delegated to pick up the pieces after disappointment, divorce,
crisis, or tragedy.

There are clients we encounter whose main purpose in life seems to be
making others miserable. They are schooled in the intricacies of
sociopathic, narcissistic, hysterical, or borderline behavior. They know
just []{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_157}how to get under our skin, and they
feel most fulfilled when they succeed. Through all the rage,
despondency, and conflict, we are supposed to remain unperturbed. The
sheer energy it takes to stay calm and in control in the face of such
behavior is a major drain on our resources.

It is interesting, however, that not everyone agrees on which cases are
most troublesome. For every therapist who dreads working with
dissociative or borderline disorders, there are others who absolutely
love the drama and challenge of such cases. The really intriguing part
of this exploration is to examine carefully those clients you enjoy
seeing most and least and what that says about *you.*

### Clients Some Therapists Find Most Challenging {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div1-78 .sec1}

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div2-1}As mentioned,
we each have our preferences, strengths, and those clients we prefer to
avoid. Some clinicians thrive on the challenge of personality disorders.
Others are remarkably patient and effective with people who are
manifesting psychotic symptoms, with drug abusers, or with the
intellectually impaired. But for most therapists, several patterns of
client behavior are often mentioned as among the most challenging and
potentially disruptive.

#### "I got held up in traffic." {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div2-2 .sec2}

Resistance, in all its manifestations, is hardly the nuisance and
obstruction to treatment that Freud once believed. Whether clients are
overly compliant or dramatically hostile, we now understand that they
are doing the very best they can to keep themselves together. We also
remind ourselves constantly that missed or chronically late appointments
are not part of a conspiracy to make us miserable, but rather may be the
client's attempt to retain some control in a threatening situation or,
alternatively, might indicate memory or distraction issues. Ideally,
clients will stick around long enough, and we will exercise sufficient
patience and set firm enough limits to allow the resistance to be worked
through.

Noncompliance by playing with space and time arrangements in therapy is
one of those things that beginners are taught to expect but nevertheless
may not be prepared to handle effectively. No one likes to be stood up
(flashback to adolescent rejection), even if you are being paid for the
idle time. Some therapists protect themselves by keeping a favorite book
available (or dreaded paperwork), so that if a client is "held up in
traffic," []{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_158}"the car broke down," or "the
meeting ran over," the gap can be happily filled. Currently, of course,
there is also the option to conduct the session remotely, but that
doesn't take care of the annoyance when the client "forgets" the
appointment.

#### "I want to die." {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div2-3 .sec2}

Death is the ultimate failure. It is especially tragic when someone
takes his own life---not only for the victim but also for those who are
left behind. Family, friends, and those who tried to help experience
guilt, responsibility, and regret. For any therapist who has ever lost a
client through suicide, there is a special sadness, vulnerability, and
fear that it could happen again. Furthermore, there are few socially
acceptable ways that therapists are permitted to mourn their loss in any
public way.

Suicidal clients present a challenge on multiple levels. Looming
foremost in our souls is the pure emotional terror of being close to
someone who is so despondent and desperate that nothingness seems like a
viable option. There was a time in all our lives when we flirted with
hopelessness; it was a time we would like to forget.

Second, we feel an incredible burden of responsibility in trying to help
a suicidal client. There are, of course, risks of legal repercussions if
things go awry. There are also moral obligations to push ourselves
beyond our usual limits, to do everything in our power to remain
vigilant. A mistake or miscalculation may have lethal consequences.
Every threat must be taken seriously.

Third, once a risk of suicide is assessed, a different therapeutic
machinery is set in motion. Records are documented meticulously. All
clinical staff move cautiously, covering themselves, doing everything by
the book. But it is hard to be all that therapeutic when handling a
client with kid gloves and protecting ourselves against future
liability. Confrontation and deep interpretations are tabled in favor of
mild explorations of feeling. Until the client is once again on stable
ground, most efforts are devoted to simply maintaining basic life
functions while rekindling the will to survive. There is a tightrope to
walk between pushing the client hard enough to get him off the fence and
not pushing him over the brink. The margin for error is small, and the
pressure on the therapist is profound.

A fourth challenge is in being able to leave the problems of the
potentially suicidal client at work. Needless worry will not prevent a
tragedy. Therapists who spend their time excessively preoccupied with
clients who are at risk may do so more for their own benefit, as a
distraction and []{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_159}inflation of power, than
for any useful purpose. We can feel important running around with our
phones beeping the siren of despair.

#### "How do you feel about me?" {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div2-4 .sec2}

At one time or another, most clients troll for our affection. They do so
as part of the transference, to get from us what they have always wanted
from another caregiver, or they do so because in our authoritarian role
we have the power to dispense approval for those actions that are
desirable. Another possibility is quite simply that we are their
confidants, the keepers of their secrets, and they have a natural
curiosity to know what we think and how we feel about them. Although we
may use evasive tactics to deny that we feel anything at all or choose
to withhold such opinions as irrelevant, clients well understand the
rules of the game.

With seductive clients, we find our powers of restraint pushed to the
limit. Some of them are determined to have their way. Conquering a
therapist is the ultimate victory, proof that anyone can be corrupted.
It is a way in which the client can regain control of the relationship
and win power and approval. It satisfies the desire to flirt with the
forbidden, and it gives the client a means to frustrate the therapist
just as she has been frustrated by the therapeutic experience. It is
also the best way for a client to confound the relationship, sidetrack
the treatment, and prevent further therapeutic assaults.

The therapist's efforts to confront the client about the seductive
behavior often lead to frustration. If the feelings are discussed
directly and the therapist gently yet firmly rejects the overtures, the
client may feel humiliated and rejected. If transference feelings are
interpreted, the client may fall back on denial. Yet if the therapist
attempts to back off and let things ride for a while, the seductive
efforts may escalate. There is no easy solution.

One other part of this problem deserves attention: Clients may behave
seductively for other than sexual reasons. Often sexuality becomes
confused with intimacy, especially when the two people in the room feel
affection for one another. Many seductive clients do not have the
slightest interest in a physical relationship but would like to
establish a deeper reciprocal emotional connection. The client feels
that she is giving, giving, giving, and getting precious little of a
personal nature in return. This perception is accurate and part of the
grand design of things. The client, therefore, must exercise
considerable ingenuity to find out what her therapist really thinks of
her. Clients may measure the time it takes for us to return
[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_160}their messages or calls, how many minutes
we will allow the session to run over, or the frequency of smiles as
indications of our true regard.

#### "This isn't helping, but i'm coming back." {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div2-5 .sec2}

There are less obvious ways to resist treatment, such as by being overly
compliant ("This is *so* much fun") or using the classical defenses of
repression and denial ("Of course I had a happy childhood"), but a
direct challenge to our competence is the most difficult to stomach.
Sometimes these resistant clients are the most diligent as far as
keeping appointments, showing up on time, and at least pretending to do
what they are supposed to do to get better. But they keep getting worse,
and we may not know why. Oh, we have ready responses to give them,
saying things like, "You'll get better when you're ready to," "You
really are much improved, but you just don't recognize it yet," or "This
is really frustrating for you that you can't see the changes you have
made."

Deep down inside, we may be afraid to admit the naked truth: We don't
know what we are doing with this client, and we can't figure out why the
he keeps coming back to remind us of our ineptitude. Certainly, the key
to the puzzle is what the client *does* get out of returning to the
sessions without any apparent gain. Beneath the surface lies the
client's hidden agenda.

For 90 consecutive sessions, Brenda entered the office just as the
second hand crossed the 12. She always paid in cash, crisp \$20 bills,
which she insisted that I count. Each week, she took her place, looked
up, and sneered. Her opening remark, cutting and cynical, usually sent
shivers up and down my neck: "Well, as you probably expect, I'm still
not feeling any better. I know I'm a fool for coming here every week,
paying you my good money to listen to you pretend you care if I live or
die. We both know you're in it for the bucks, but God do you look
foolish sitting there acting like you know all about me. You don't know
shit. When are you going to give up and give me the boot?"

Suddenly one day, just as I had dreamed it would happen, her facade came
tumbling down, exposing a quivering, vulnerable human being. I honestly
don't think it was because of anything specific I did---unless you count
90 consecutive sessions of waiting for her to make the first move. She
later explained that all that time she was just waiting until she felt
she could trust me---and that took almost 2 years!

As long as these clients can keep us off balance, we will not be able to
get close to them. Because they are used to functioning in antagonistic
relationships, even our disdain does not disturb them much. Their goal
is []{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_161}to keep us in line until they decide
they are ready to surrender the verbal combat. In the meantime, it is
kind of fun for them to ridicule this symbol of authority and wisdom.

#### "Um. Uh. No." {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div2-6 .sec2}

One of the basic rules of therapy is that the client talks while the
therapist listens. When that convention is broken, all else becomes
uncertain. Occasionally, we do work with people, often children or
adolescents, who are not all that verbally expressive, who answer
questions in monosyllables if they answer at all, who are uncertain and
indecisive, and who can outwait us. We can try any trick in the
book---staring contests, interrogations, monologues, card tricks---and
we will still end up with virtual silence. It is easier with children
because there are still many nonverbal options (art, music, sand tray,
play therapy) in the ways time can be spent constructively.

With overly passive or withdrawn adults, a single hour can seem to last
weeks. I think the clock actually slows down---if not downright
stops---when these people enter the room. Something in their hormones
must impede time. We feel, at first, like vaudeville entertainers trying
to get a laugh. We could sing, dance, probably do a striptease, and the
silent client would merely watch indulgently.

::: prosequote
"So what brings you here?"

"Not sure."

\[Kick in active listening.\] "You're feeling uncertain and confused."

"Uh-huh."

\[Wait him out. Silence for 4 minutes.\]

\[Active listening again.\] "It's difficult for you to talk here."

"Uh-huh."

\[Try again. Reassurance.\] "I, uh, mean with a complete stranger most
people find it hard to get started."

"Yes."

\[Probing questioning.\] "Can you tell me a little bit about what is
bothering you?"

"My mother."

\[Persistence.\] "That *is* a little bit. How about some details?"

"She doesn't understand."
:::

Finally a breakthrough! The session will drag along at its own
interminable pace. Once there is a hint of feeling, an opinion, a
concern, we slowly []{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_162}and determinedly
explore its shape and form, build on it and connect it with previous
disclosures. Eventually, we help these people open up more, but it takes
*so* much work.

Equally difficult is the client who talks incessantly but rarely says
much and never listens. These clients also have the power to slow down
the clock. They have been compulsive talkers for so long that they are
virtually impervious to interruptions, confrontations, snoring,
gags---everything but fire alarms. Some of these folks eventually find
their way into Congress, but the rest end up in therapy because nobody
else can stand to listen to them.

Occasionally, when they draw a breath, take a drink, or pause to write a
check, they will let us talk for a minute---even a few minutes if we can
talk fast---but they will continue with the monologue after this
interruption. Amazingly enough, at the start of the next session, the
client will remember exactly where she left off and will continue as if
the week had lasted but a moment. Naturally, the client's intent is to
prevent hearing anything that might be unpleasant. Eventually, with
patience and persistence and once trust is established, we can try to
alter this pattern.

With either the silent or the excessively verbal client, the therapist
is required to do more, which is to do less. The more we attempt to
manage and control the sessions, the longer the obstructive behavior
will continue. We can well understand this intellectually, but still may
be unable or unwilling to restrain our impulse to control. To sit with
someone hour after hour after hour and really be with him while he is
off in his own world is a difficult task indeed.

#### "But I don't really have a drug problem." {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div2-7 .sec2}

Substance abusers are among those clients who seem to improve only as
long as they are in our company. Once they leave, they often resort to
past habits of getting high to avoid their pain. We face an uphill
battle because therapy can never compete with the instantaneous pleasure
that a drug can provide or even entrenched habitual patterns grooved
into the brain. It is hard enough to counteract the effects of past
trauma and the usual defensive reactions. Once the ploys of a skilled
alcoholic or addict are added to the scene, the therapist who really
thinks she can make a difference before the client is ready to change
may end up an addict herself. In addition to the abuser's denial that he
has a problem, and added on to all his manipulation, deceit, and
sneaking around, are the physiological effects. This client is
physically addicted and psychologically dependent, and he may be
experiencing some deterioration and memory loss. The need to
[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_163}escape is much stronger than the need to
understand. Avoidance wins over confrontation.

Clients with drug and alcohol problems who are unwilling to admit their
dependency typify the kind of work that can be incredibly frustrating
for the therapist. Then there is the likelihood of relapses on the way
to eventual recovery. In many cases the therapist's own feeling of
impotence may reflect the client's powerlessness.

#### "Sorry to bother you." {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div2-8 .sec2}

The fastest way to get any therapist's attention is with a panicky 3
a.m. phone call or text. It is hard to say what actually precipitates
the late-night call or message because by the time we are fully awake,
we are already 5 minutes into the conversation. The gist are the
following points: (a) Did I wake you up? (b) Sorry to bother you. (c)
You said I could call if I needed to. (d) This is kind of an emergency.

Phone calls or messages at home, one of an array of devious ploys common
to the manipulative or desperate client, are irritating but unavoidable.
Those who are severely depressed or prone to panic need to have the
reassurance that they can call if they absolutely have to. And simply
instructing them to call 911 or go to the emergency room won't usually
take care of things because they wanted not only help but also attention
and sympathy. Two or three calls annually are probably not a nuisance.
Anything more than a few per year may be considered a form of cruel and
unusual punishment.

### Success With Difficult Cases {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div1-79 .sec1}

Many therapists may be underpaid, overworked, and unappreciated, but
there is no doubt that the greatest benefit of our work is the pure
unadulterated joy we feel when we can see the results of our efforts,
particularly with difficult cases. We become great explorers and guides,
midwives to deliver greater freedom.

Francine, a seriously disturbed woman, was prone to an assortment of
self-destructive, manipulative behaviors that easily qualified her for
the dreaded borderline diagnosis. She called her therapist at regular
intervals, often threatening suicide. She relied on an assortment of
means to sabotage her own progress, seemingly just to get under the
therapist's skin.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_164}The clinician stayed with the case for
several years. She gnashed her teeth, sought the counsel of her
colleagues, attended conferences, and read innumerable books, trying
anything and everything to find the key that might prove helpful. On two
separate occasions, she referred the woman to other specialists, only to
find that, like a boomerang, Francine sailed back into her office with a
completely new set of symptoms.

I lost touch with this therapist for a few years. When we resumed
contact, I asked how Francine was doing. I expected the therapist to
roll her eyes skyward or to begin a litany of complaints that I had
heard many times in the past. I was, therefore, quite surprised when she
broke out into an angelic smile, and her eyes sparkled with pride. There
had been no single breakthrough, but gradually, ever so slowly and
painfully, Francine had made steady if not dramatic progress. It had
taken more than 4 years of patient, excruciatingly difficult work, but
now both the therapist and Francine could see an amazing difference.

"She still drives me to distraction sometimes. But it has been worth it!
I stayed with her. I hung in there when nobody else would or could. I
don't mean to be grandiose, but I know I saved her life. And by doing
so, I saved a part of my own."

### Responding to Challenging Clients {#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-div1-80 .sec1}

A significant number of us entered the profession because we like to be
needed, to have people depend on us. It is therefore ridiculous for us
to complain when clients exhibit exactly those qualities of neediness,
dependency, helplessness, and manipulation that they came to us to cure.
We must expect a certain amount of intrusion, of having people smother
us with their demands and even invade our lives with their late-night
cries of anguish. We should not be surprised at the lengths to which a
disturbed person will go to get the attention he or she equates with
love.

Most of us have learned over time several principles that should be
followed in dealing with any case we experience as particularly
challenging:

::: list1
[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-163}[1.]{.enumerator}Determine
whether the problem is with the client or with you. In many cases, it is
your own impatience and need for control that lead to unnecessary
struggles and conflict.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-164}[2.]{.enumerator}Respect
the purpose and function of resistance and client defenses. It is safe
to assume that the client's irritating or manipulative behavior has
served him well for quite some time. The fact that you are feeling
[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_165}annoyed and off balance is evidence that
this behavior is working with you as well.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-165}[3.]{.enumerator}When
feeling trapped, follow the principles of the reflective practitioner,
which allow a professional to restructure a problem in such a way that a
different set of actions is possible.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-166}[4.]{.enumerator}Help
the client to feel understood---even if such understanding currently
escapes you. Remember that you will never, ever truly understand anyone,
including yourself.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-167}[5.]{.enumerator}Take
inventory with the client of what has worked best so far and what hasn't
worked at all. Make adjustments in light of these data, if not in the
approach taken then in the style in which it is offered.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-168}[6.]{.enumerator}Do
not try to cure the incurable. It is necessary for you to accept your
own limits and share with the client the responsibility for the success
of treatment.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-169}[7.]{.enumerator}Acknowledge
to yourself that the client is operating under a different set of rules
than the ones you would prefer. Do not retaliate in anger. Retain your
compassion and caring at the same time that you enforce appropriate
boundaries.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-170}[8.]{.enumerator}Remain
as flexible as possible. Patients test our patience precisely because
they require treatment that is more innovative than we are used to.
Allow so-called difficult clients to help stimulate your own creative
capacities. It is highly likely that such a case will require you to
develop, adapt, or invent something altogether new.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-171}[9.]{.enumerator}Educate
yourself about clients who come from backgrounds that are beyond your
experience or comfort level. I know this is the standard advice that is
mentioned repeatedly, but for good reason: All too often, biases,
prejudices, blind spots, and overreactions occur because of ignorance
about the cultural context for behavior.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-172}[10.]{.enumerator}When
all else fails, allow the clients to keep their dysfunctional behavior.
It is theirs to keep or lose as they see fit. When they are ready to
change, they will do so at a pace that matches their motivation.

[]{#15_chapter8.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-8-item1-173}[11.]{.enumerator}Honor,
respect, and cherish the reciprocal "gifts" that occur from the
challenging cases and celebrate what you have learned.
:::

When expert therapists were asked how they dealt with their most
challenging cases, they initially found their particular theoretical
orientation useful in terms of interpreting and making sense of the
impasses. Second, and just as important, they doubled down on their
level and depth of empathy to the point it became an embodied state that
created a "relational space" for mutual growth ([Moltu & Binder,
2013](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-226){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0254}).
Yet much of the []{#15_chapter8.xhtml_page_166}challenge with such cases
is related to not only what we do (or not do) with challenging clients
but also how we manage our own anxiety between sessions ([Barreto &
Matos,

Whether we are talking about clients who are suicidal, decompensating,
traumatized, or otherwise nonresponsive or spinning out of control, one
key to these cases is related to confronting our own needs and feelings
of incompetence.

Perhaps the last and most important principle is to practice a high
degree of self-compassion because we are often so critical and hard on
ourselves, especially when we encounter clients who don't seem to be
cooperating with our best efforts. [Schwartz
(2015)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-280){#15_chapter8.xhtml_n0257}
echoed a point made in a previous chapter that sometimes our most
challenging clients become our best teachers. He suggested that our
clients become our mentors by the ways they "torment" us, helping to
make us more aware of the parts of ourselves that are most in need of
self-compassion.

All the client patterns presented in this chapter make our work not only
more difficult but also more interesting and challenging. The key to
preventing boredom and burnout, to surviving in the field with the
minimum of negative personal consequences, is to do only what we
can---no more and no less. It turns out that, in one sense, there really
are no so-called resistant or "difficult" clients. After all, their main
"job" is to bring to us all their typical behavior, choices, and usual
style that have been so self-defeating in the past. It is our task to
meet them where they are---and to the extent we have trouble with that
leads to the uncomfortable conclusion that perhaps *we* are the ones who
are really being difficult!

Over the course of four decades (and five previous editions of this
book), I worked in a dozen different jobs as a psychologist, school
counselor, administrator, supervisor, instructor, and social justice
advocate. It was during all these various responsibilities that I
encountered every possible []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_168}kind of
job-related stress. You name it: I lived it. Haunted by clients'
disturbing stories? Check. Bored out of my mind listening to the same
tedious stories over and over and over? Check. Subjected to abuse by
clients, toxic work cultures, and incompetent or negligent supervisors?
All quite familiar. Licking my wounds from career disappointments,
session failures, and misguided choices? Oh yes. I've been exposed to
some of the most difficult and annoying people I could ever imagine.
I've been cheated by clients, lied to by others, manipulated and
stalked, shamed and attacked. I've been subjected to even far worse by a
few colleagues over the years who seemed more disturbed and dangerous
than any of the people I've treated in sessions.

I suppose this makes me uniquely qualified to discuss the subjects of
burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious trauma since I seem to have
experienced almost every conceivable manifestation of occupational
stress from countertransference and projective identification, to
primary and secondary trauma. I've quit more jobs than I can remember,
each time vowing I will never again subject myself to such misery and
lack of support. I've been in and out of more forms of supervision and
therapy than I can easily recall. I've had more than my fair share of
nightmares and insomnia. I've written more books about the doubts,
uncertainties, and tribulations of therapy practice than anyone else
alive. I suppose you could say that I'm a world-class expert on the
unnecessary burdens and failed practices of therapists trying to
metabolize the strains and challenges of therapeutic work. I can also
say, with considerable pride, that I've learned over time to develop
remarkable resilience and the ability to recover from life's (and
work's) challenges and disappointments, maintaining tremendous passion,
joy, and enthusiasm for my devotion to helping others in spite of the
stressors. That has always been the driving force that underscores the
very existence of this book---to remind ourselves of the balance we
constantly navigate between the burdens and joys of our work.

### Between Boredom and Anxiety {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div1-82 .sec1}

It was almost a half century ago that [Csikszentmihalyi
(1975)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-44){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0258}
described the "sweet spot" balanced between a state of high anxiety and
disengaged boredom. In any activity that feels too overwhelming and
challenging, beyond what we believe we can handle, the result is usually
considerable distress and insecurity. On the other hand, if the task is
too easy, presenting little challenge, we experience a degree of
boredom. It is the condition of "flow," located precisely in the middle
of these uncomfortable states, []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_169}that we
attain our highest level of performance. Practicing therapy can easily
become routine and stale if it feels like we are just following a
predictable script or repeating incantations that are tiresome. Under
such circumstances clients appear on an assembly line and the job
involves assembling the same pieces in the same sequence. On the
opposite end of the spectrum, if the job feels beyond one's capacity or
the tasks are too complex and difficult to complete, then anxiety
usually appears as a warning that things are out of control. The goal,
of course, is to find a match between our expertise and skills that are
most appropriate for the demands of the particular job.

Among all the problems a therapist encounters---from someone who wants
to jump out of a window to someone who is trying to jump out of his own
skin---none is more difficult than the challenge of remaining energized
about one's work. If burnout is caused by an overload of stimulation,
then boredom is caused by its absence---at least in terms of
subjectively perceived experience. Both involve a discrepancy between
what one is offering and what one is receiving.

The first part of this chapter discusses the phenomenon of therapist
ennui and tedium; the second covers overstimulation, emotional
exhaustion, and a broken spirit. In both boredom and burnout, the
clinician experiences a loss of motivation, energy, control, and
direction. These conditions, if left untreated, can become chronic and
incurable.

I realize that beginners in the field might find it hard to imagine that
someday they would ever become bored with the job considering all the
complexities and overwhelming challenges and stimulation. But like
everything else we do in life, autopilot takes over when we become
complacent and stale. Thus in some ways experienced therapists are far
more at risk if they don't remain committed to continual vigilance and a
sense of renewal that channels "the beginner's mind" so filled with
enthusiasm and excitement for helping others.

### About Boredom {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div1-83 .sec1}

[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-9}Boredom
involves a loss of interest and momentum, either temporarily or
chronically. Although it is usually experienced as uncomfortable, it
also serves to rest the mind and spirit and to give them time to
rejuvenate. Boredom thus does have its functions and purposes as a
transitional period between what you have been doing and what you may do
in the future. It also evolved in such a way that the discomfort
associated with the state of mind alerts us that our brain is being
underutilized.

[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_170}How do you know when you are bored? There
are several familiar symptoms, the first of which is a sense that time
has slowed down to a pace that it seems to have stopped altogether.
Things feel monotonous and predictable, making it difficult to
concentrate or focus for very long. Everything feels kind of pointless,
leading further to lethargy and restlessness, all of which significantly
reduce any drive, motivation, and engagement. In addition, alertness,
self-control, and commitment are all seriously compromised ([Danckert &
Eastwood,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-48){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0259}).
This can become a somewhat temporary, transitional "state" in response
to one person, situation, or context or else a consistent "trait" that
is relatively chronic within a way of being.

People have died of boredom, and perhaps an intolerance for sameness
leads others to the fireworks of madness. Boredom is nature's way of
saying, "Get back to work!" If people felt content with staleness and
with doing little that feels very productive, our species would die out.
We have instinctual urges to procreate and preserve our gene pool, to
protect and provide for our offspring. And we have urges and ambition to
have more, more, more of what we already have---not because we need new
things, but because of that voice within us that protests against
contentment.

When work becomes routine and predictable, when stimulation is minimal,
when a person dislikes her own company and that of others, boredom will
leak in to motivate some action. It is less a condition than a way of
viewing the world.

Boredom can be precipitated by a diminishing sense of meaning in what we
do and a sense of futility that it doesn't matter nearly as much as we
once believed. It definitely has its benefits, as sensory deprivation
experiments will attest. Those athletes who run, swim, or bike in
ultramarathons or triathlons for 8 hours at a time can also testify to
what endless repetition can teach us in terms of focus and
self-discipline. While we are bored, there is time "to strip away our
character armor, shed layer after layer of imposed motivations and
values, and circle closer to our unique essence" ([Keen,
1977](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-145){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0260},
p. 80). It is a time to stand naked and confront one's pain without
distractions or diversions. World-class runners are able to simulate a
perfect state of boredom in their quest for optimal performance. They
refuse to retreat into fantasy when the pain becomes intense, but
instead stay with the discomfort and pain: "I not only pay attention to
my body as I run, but I also constantly remind myself to relax, hang
loose, not tie up" ([Morgan,
1978](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-229){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0261},
p. 45). Pounding the pavement mile after mile, hour after hour, they
concentrate only on the nothingness of where they are---the placement of
the foot, the pace of breathing, the swing of arms. Such athletes excel
because they are willing to put themselves in that place
[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_171}where there is nowhere else to escape to;
no matter how much discomfort or pain they might feel, they stubbornly
cling to the belief that the more focused they remain on each moment the
more likely they reach optimal performance.

#### Therapist Vulnerability to Boredom {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-10 .sec2}

The experience of boredom is, in part, affected by a person's conception
of time. Those who are clock-watchers (as therapists tend to be), who
are constantly aware of how time progresses, find themselves waiting
more often for things to happen. Our involvement in life is regulated by
what the clock dictates. The nature of a job that requires the precise
timing of a conversation to the minute, with frequent checks of the
clock (5 to 10 times per hour), makes therapists much more vulnerable to
the subjective flow of time. As boredom is most likely to occur when
time seems to slow down, clock-watchers, by inclination and training,
are more aware of this phenomenon.

Some of the best therapy sessions we've ever experienced are those when
we have reached that state of *flow* described by Csikszentmihalyi
([1975](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-44){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0262},
[1998](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-45){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0263}).
This is an effortless and heightened concentration in which time seems
irrelevant. Boredom is impossible for those who are so totally involved
in what they are doing that they even lose their sense of self; they
*become* what they are doing. For veterans this means stopping internal
and external distractions to remain in the flow state; for beginners it
means stopping self-critical talk. These distractions can take many
forms: intrusive thoughts ("Must remember to pick up the mail");
distractions in the environment (phone, email, noise); body urgings
(indigestion, hunger, bladder urgency, discomfort, fatigue); time
constraints; or ongoing issues in your life that require attention.

In a way, boredom is a kind of dissociation, a "defensive
disconnection," from something or someone. For therapists it is also a
"wordless conversation" with particular clients who trigger this
reaction because they don't interest or entertain us sufficiently. In
that sense it is a kind of countertransference because something that
might be going on is experienced as somehow threatening or at least
potentially upsetting in some way ([Scott,
2017](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-281){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0264}).

It is when we lose the sense of challenge in what we're doing, when we
think we know where things are going, that boredom can most easily
infect us. We feel embarrassed by the number of times we have looked at
the clock. After planning a dinner menu in your head, figuring which
ingredients you []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_172}have on hand, calculating
which bills to pay, and going off into fantasy land, you notice suddenly
that someone is talking to you. You think, "What are you still doing
here? Why don't you go home already?" It is the repetition that is so
difficult to tolerate, in not only the similarity of client complaints
but also the therapeutic messages we relay. Certain regimented styles of
therapy, for example, can become repetitive in their execution, as
[Ellis (1972, p.
119)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-62){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0265}
admitted: "I have seen myself at times doing the same thing over and
over with clients and have recognized that this is a pain in the ass,
this is something I don't greatly like." Whereas some clinicians might
feel "stuck" with their chosen orientation, many others keep evolving
their style to practice to keep things fresh.

The people who march through our offices are indeed unique and
individual, yet after years of practice many of the voices begin to
sound much the same. A psychologist complains, "I've done over 4,000
child assessments in the last several years. I do them in my sleep. Sure
every kid is different, but the damn questions never change." A
psychiatrist is similarly frustrated: "All my patients just want drugs.
They come in prepared to do a song and dance showing how sick they are
and hoping for relief from some magic pill they think I'm hoarding." And
a social worker reached a point where all her home visits featured
familiar scenarios when she interviews parents after a child abuse
complaint: "They never get the point and they'll never change. The kid
will go to a foster home and probably get beaten by someone else. Maybe
a long time ago I found this interesting. Now it's just frustrating and
boring."

It is thus repetition and the similarity of stories we hear that can
lock us into a sense of complacency. We create all these boundaries,
rituals, and a "holding environment" in our sessions, all of which limit
and program the kinds of things that might unfold if our standards and
preferences are too restrictive. It is also curious the way some of our
clients keep us absolutely riveted while we can barely remain awake with
others. [English (1972, p.
95)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-64){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0266}
recounted his experiences with boredom in therapy work:

::: prosequote
There have been patients I liked to see and treat and some I dreaded to
see, some who amused me, some who bored me to distraction. Some could
put me to sleep, and I use the word *put* rather than say I went to
sleep on them. Because I would find myself thinking, "How sleepy I am.
When the patient leaves I'll take a nap for sure!" But when he departed
the office I couldn't go to sleep for the life of me.
:::

One therapist commented that when she felt bored in therapy, it was
usually because she wanted to cut herself off from issues that were
threatening. When a session or a meeting becomes tedious and drags on
endlessly, we []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_173}can look first toward
ourselves: What are we hiding from inside this cloak of disinterest? It
is far more common, however, to just check and respond to messages when
things drag on. Mobile devices have become the antidote to even a few
seconds of stillness, always beckoning, always distracting, always
providing instant diversion whenever there is a moment's downtime.

A second possible explanation for boredom is that there are people
walking around who are objectively, intrinsically, and completely devoid
of spirit and energy. Some clients come to our offices because they
cannot find anyone else who will listen to them for very long. They
speak in monotones. Some of them may be *alexithymic*, incapable of
describing internal thoughts and feelings. They are concrete,
repetitive, and utterly predictable in what they do and how they do it.
Each session, they cover the same ground and repeat the same stories.
They will test the patience and compassion of any therapist because they
do not respond very well to either subtle nudges or more dramatic
confrontations intended to move them toward being more expressive. There
is even some question about whether, neurologically, they have the
capacity to be so. They drone on and on about topics so pedestrian and
disconnected from their own experience we can hardly pay attention.

The third possibility when we encounter boredom in our work has less to
do with the client, or with the particular topics that are discussed,
than with our own self-centered demands for stimulation. Although we may
be reluctant to admit it, many of us selected this kind of work because
we are entertained by the voyeuristic delights of being privy to
people's private lives. It's like television---each channel a window
into a different life program. But then one channel gives us identical
programming each time we tune in---maybe a fishing show---and we feel
cheated: "You aren't doing your job! Don't you know you're supposed to
go out there in the world and do fun stuff and then come back and tell
me about it?"

Boredom, in this third case, results from our own expectations for how
clients should perform for us. It is also the situation we can do the
most about. People who appear chronically boring believe they are
essentially unlovable and have discovered a very effective way to keep
others at a distance. Our job, then, is to love them in spite of their
attempts to keep us at a distance. This is easier said than done,
however, for to do so we must stretch ourselves beyond the limits of our
patience and concentration.

#### Boredom and the Avoidance of Risks {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-11 .sec2}

On one end of the continuum is a therapist steeped in
boredom---demoralized, dissatisfied, restless, and weary. On the other
end is someone []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_174}who has become timid,
irresolute, and fearful of taking risks. Change in some clients is
stymied by a reluctance to act differently or to experiment with new
modes of being. In much the same way, some therapists tend toward
safety, security, and predictability at the expense of their own growth
and development.

Therapists can avoid constructive risk-taking in a number of ways. This
isn't about reckless thrill-seeking but rather those occasional
opportunities to take an unknown route and end up in a very different
place. Reluctance to expose oneself to hazard and danger, unless the
perceived gain seems worth the potential loss, is sensible. But much
more than the desire to protect ourselves from needless jeopardy is a
determined avoidance of risk. When someone is secure and comfortable, it
takes some real incentive to convince her to venture out into the cold.
We may, therefore, be just as guilty of avoiding the unknown as anyone
else, postponing action until it becomes absolutely necessary.

Therapists who play it safe in their work may remain basically satisfied
with their moderate gains. They will do just enough to get the job done
but not enough to produce optimal results. Under the guise of protecting
their client's welfare, they will avoid confrontation and conflict,
preferring instead to move at a pace consistent with the client's own
tolerance for boredom. They will wait and wait, knowing that waiting has
some therapeutic value and that most clients will get better on their
own or in spite of what their therapists do (or don't do). They will say
only what they have said before. They will try only what has been most
familiar and comfortable. Any departure from the formula must be
preceded by a consultation of the works of their favorite authority.

Certainly, it is neither appropriate nor helpful to advocate risky
therapeutic interventions to appease some restless spirit in the
therapist. On the contrary, those who are able to satisfy their needs
for stimulation and excitement in their personal lives have no interest
in using their clients as guinea pigs in experimentation for its own
sake. Therapists, in fact, have an obligation to protect people at risk
from exposure to unnecessary dangers. But there are many ways that a
clinician may safely and responsibly try new intervention strategies
without jeopardizing the client's safety.

#### Antidotes to Boredom {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-12 .sec2}

Although boredom is an inevitable if uninvited guest, it need not stay
long. Yet when the clinician feels apathetic and helpless, boredom may
become []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_175}a permanent resident. Sometimes,
despite a therapist's fervent desire for renewal, boredom nevertheless
hangs on.

Excitement and stimulation result from the perception of challenge
matched to our abilities. This is one of the main messages we send our
clients: Any emotional state, boredom most of all, is the logical
consequence of our chosen cognitive activity. The primary cure for
boredom in therapy is thus to focus on the uniqueness of each case, the
individuality of each client, and the opportunity for growth in every
encounter. When our minds function routinely and interventions have
become mechanical, we experience tedium.

When I catch myself feeling blasé about the real magic that is
transpiring in my involvement with a client, I make a deliberate shift
in my perception. If I first change my position in the chair and
concentrate on my breathing and on my posture, if I go back to the
basics I learned as a student, I find that something wonderful takes
place. The client becomes more special, her words carry more power, and
the whole experience becomes energized. I can feel the new energy, and
so can the client. As she notices my renewed interest, she begins to
feel and act more interestingly, not to entertain me and release me from
my boredom, but because I value our time together more. She begins to
believe that she is more exciting. The changes are, at first, very
subtle: I forget to watch the clock, and the session runs over.

One practitioner relates his strategy for avoiding staleness in his
work:

::: prosequote
I have never been bored. . . . I consider myself very fortunate to be
doing such interesting work, particularly when I can experience a degree
of falling in love with a patient. This is not a threat to my marital
commitment but rather is a further installment on the resolving of my
romance with my parents and my siblings. When I can no longer fall in
love with patients to some degree, I will be approaching the end of my
vitality as a therapist. ([Warkentin,
1972](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-317){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0267},
pp. 258--259)
:::

When I hear statements like this, I feel instant admiration, followed by
a certain shame because it is so unlike my own experience. I have to
reinvent myself at least every few years because I get so bored with
myself. I'm tired of listening to myself, hearing my own stories, or
reliving the same things over and over. How often do any of us repeat
ourselves in sessions, tell many of our clients the same things, even
the same way? It is really about being lazy: It is so much easier to
pull familiar interventions off the shelf than to invent something
altogether new.

One of the reasons I have revised this book every several years is that
I am no longer the person who existed at the time of its previous
edition. []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_176}I have changed, moved on, and
learned new things. I read what I wrote 5 years ago and realize I don't
believe that anymore or don't work that way any longer. I have this
fantasy that if any two of my clients were to meet and describe their
therapy, they would think they were seeing someone completely different
because I try to keep changing what I do and how I do it. This is one of
the keys that keeps me energized and loving my work, even after almost
half a century.

It also helps to bring feelings of boredom out in the open in sessions,
at least with those clients who are ready for more authenticity and
honesty in the relationship. Preferring to work in the present moment in
most circumstances, [Yalom (2002, p.
66)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-328){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0268}
described how he might bring this up: "For the last several minutes I
notice that I've been feeling disconnected from you, somewhat distanced.
. . . I wonder what is your level of connection to me today? Is your
feeling similar to mine? Let's try to understand what's happening."

Although boredom is usually experienced as a negative feeling, its job
is to signal us that that what we are currently doing (or not doing) is
no longer satisfying, and some action must be taken. Although there is
no single solution to the challenge of remaining energized and focused,
it is wise to try an assortment of things: becoming more active and
involved in the relationship, finding meaning in the experience, using
the feelings as a diagnostic tool, or realizing that it is time to
diversify your life and change the ways you work. It also helps to be
more playful and find the humor in things that might otherwise drag us
down. Other therapists successfully immunize themselves against boredom
by taking on challenging cases that do not permit a lax attitude. Also
useful is to be under the supervision of someone who helps keep you off
balance, humble, and comfortably confused. Boredom thus can be kept at
bay by your working consciously and deliberately to keep things fresh,
especially by looking for meaning in the things you do. Writer Dorothy
Parker once observed that the ultimate cure for boredom is curiosity.
"There is no cure for curiosity," she added.

### About Burnout {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div1-84 .sec1}

[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-13}First, some
context is necessary. Even before the global pandemic, it was discovered
that two thirds of all workers in the United States were experiencing
some form of emotional depletion or burnout on the job, which led to
absenteeism, lowered productivity, and health disorders ([Wigert &
Agrawal,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-322){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0269}).
The survey also destroyed the myth that simply reducing hours or taking
time off would fix the problem since the systemic
[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_177}toxic influences like an unmanageable
workload, lack of role clarity, unfair treatment, and lack of
communication were never addressed. Once therapists switched to doing
more online and distance-based sessions, they may have served more
desperate people but often at the expense of "zoom gloom," the
inevitable fatigue that accompanies staring at a screen most of the day.

Since practicing therapy is among the most emotionally volatile,
stressful, and pressured jobs, it is no surprise that we would become
even more vulnerable to unrealistic demands. Our own personal tragedies,
losses, triumphs, experiences, and background make us even far more
likely to develop some form of collateral damage when exposed to others'
trauma ([Chaverri et al.,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-37){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0270}).
Listening to tragic and sad stories all day from the faces on the screen
only seemed to increase our sense of futility during a time when almost
everyone was suffering losses and disappointments during the world's
pandemic shutdown.

No matter how skilled a practitioner is at avoiding other occupational
hazards (including boredom), there will be some period of time---a day,
a week, a month, or eternity---in which serious consideration will be
given to leaving the field. Perhaps it will be one of those days when
successive no-shows combine with an irate phone call from an irrational
parent. Or maybe one of those weeks in which you discover that the
supervisor you liked has moved on and the colleague you don't like has
just been promoted (over you) to that position. Or one of those months
in which your tires are slashed by an ex-client you thought you had
helped, and your ego is repeatedly slashed by peers who are trying to
undermine your authority, referral sources who have lost confidence, a
supervisor who feels threatened by your superior intellect, and clients
who will no longer return your phone calls.

The question, then, is not *who* will experience burnout but *how long*
the next episode will last. Those who deny their vulnerability may
forget that more than half of all therapists report "moderate-high"
levels of occupational stress at any one time. It may also be surprising
that beginners are actually more at risk because of their unrealistic
expectations, lack of coping skills, and an inability to deal with the
sometimes overwhelming demands of the work for which they were not
prepared ([Simionato & Simpson,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-285){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0271}).

It may very well be that "burnout" may not be the best term to describe
the kind of insidious neglect and deterioration that takes place when
professionals lose interest and effectiveness---perhaps *rustout* is a
better descriptor because it indicates the kind of slow, gradual process
that eats away at a therapist's spirit ([Gmelch,
1983](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-101){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0272}).
After all, you will hardly wake up one morning and discover that you are
suddenly burned out all of a []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_178}sudden;
rather, dozens, if not hundreds, of such mornings have elapsed over
time, each one contributing to your overall disillusionment.

It is the nature of the human condition in general, and the therapist
condition in particular, to experience ebbs and flows in life
satisfaction. This is a *very* emotional business, with many highs and
lows. Sometimes we feel as close to being a god as any mortal
can---powerful, elegant, graceful, wise---and other times we feel so
totally inept that we wonder how we can be allowed to continue to
practice. No matter how many people we have helped, deep inside there is
a sickening feeling that we will never be able to do it again. For the
life of me, I do not really know what I did the last time. And when a
new client comes in, sits down, presents his case, and then waits
expectantly for my assessment, there is always a minute of panic in
which I stall and think to myself, "I don't have any *idea* what's going
on or the foggiest notion of what will help this person." Then I take a
deep breath, jump in, and say something, *anything*, even if it's only,
"I don't know yet what is happening, but I'm sure we'll figure it out
together."

Burnout, or rustout, is taking place when you realize that you neither
know what is going on with your clients nor really care. Conversely,
these conditions can be just as prevalent when you are a little too
certain about what is going on and what is best for everyone else and
you feel frustrated because others won't listen to you. Yet the global
term *burnout* doesn't come close to covering the territory of the
stress that therapists experience. Although it may represent the
endpoint of erosion of the spirit, there are also incremental stages and
other forms of stress reactions in the form of *secondary trauma* (close
proximity to someone in despair), *vicarious trauma* (contagious effects
of being a witness to or intimate with someone who is decompensating),
and *compassion fatigue* (prolonged exposure to someone's suffering with
a corresponding collapse of boundaries). Burnout can encompass all of
these in some form to the point that there develops reduced efficiency,
physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and loss of satisfaction.

For those newcomers to the field who are reading (or skimming) this
chapter because boredom or burnout are the *least* of your concerns as
you begin your career, consider this fair warning that *all* therapists
started out with optimism, enthusiasm, and incredible excitement about
their work. You may vow never to become a victim of the emotional
erosion that you observe in some older veterans, but the years of work
in the trenches do indeed take a toll. The best way to prevent such
negative effects is to develop an early warning system to recognize
initial symptoms as they emerge.

#### []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_179}Signs and Symptoms of Burnout {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-14 .sec2}

Burnout is commonly described as having several features, including (a)
emotional depletion or exhaustion; (b) negative attitudes toward clients
(depersonalization, cynicism, critical judgment); and (c) a perception
of diminished personal and professional accomplishment (frustration,
pessimism, futility). The condition is also often accompanied by a lack
of meaning and satisfaction in work.

If there is a consensus on the common symptoms, there is considerably
less agreement about the causes, which have been ascribed to any number
of factors, such as work environment, client load, compensation,
self-image, and lack of collegial and family support ([M. K. Lee et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-201){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0273};
[Simpson et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-286){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0274};
[Wigert & Agrawal,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-322){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0275}).
It makes sense that those practitioners who tend to become emotionally
overinvolved with their clients, as well as those who display low energy
because of chronic fatigue, would be at greatest risk. It's also
interesting how the environment and cultural context in which therapists
operate also influence the ways they metabolize stress and experience
burnout. Whereas in the United States burnout is most often attributed
to mental and physical exhaustions from the demands of doing (too much?)
therapy, practitioners in Japan most often mention perceptions of
inefficiency or feelings of failure as a primary cause, and those in
Korea say that it is influenced more by problems in their personal
lives. Also interesting in this study is that therapists in the
Philippines didn't report experiencing much burnout at all ([Puig et
al.,
2014](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-259){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0276}).
That doesn't necessarily mean that the symptoms were any less evident
but rather there may have been more reluctance to blame any external
sources for the problems.

We are exploring burnout not only as a problem that interferes with the
therapist's enjoyment and satisfaction with work but also as a condition
that can lead to significant deterioration in professional effectiveness
and an increased probability of ethical misconduct ([G. Corey et al.,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-41){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0277};
[Jenks & Oka,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-141){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0278}).
There is greater vulnerability to sexual improprieties as well, whether
meeting clients outside sessions, inviting conversations about sexual
preferences that may not be relevant, or acting on one's own impulses
([Norcross & VandenBos,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-243){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0279};
[Pope & Bouhoutsos,
1986](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-256){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0280}).
The vast majority of therapists admit to knowing a colleague who is
seriously burned out, and fully one third of practitioners acknowledge
that they have personally experienced this condition.

A number of fairly specific behavioral indices of acute burnout have
been described. Some symptoms are the clearest indications of an
incipient []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_180}problem, such as when there is
a general unwillingness to talk about work, return messages, or keep up
with paperwork. There may also be an inclination to engage in forms of
self-medication for the condition, whether recreational substances,
prescribed drugs, compulsive shopping, overeating, and excessive
exercising. Cynicism, pessimism, and negativity dominate thinking, as
well as constant verbal complaints about not being valued or appreciated
sufficiently.

To bring this discussion to a far more personal level, ask yourself at
the end of the day the extent to which you (a) feel mentally and
physically exhausted; (b) have signs of somatic distress (headaches,
muscle tension, stomach problems); (c) feel overwhelmed and flooded
because of all the things that are left to do; and (d) feel hopeless
that you can somehow possibly catch up and complete all the tasks that
require your attention.

One reliable measure of disengagement would be the frequency of
daydreaming and escapist fantasy. It takes constant vigilance to stay
with a client. Yet in spite of these good intentions, the mind drifts
away to some other place and time. During idle periods, the escapist
thinking continues as the therapist imagines herself rescuing people in
distress or lying on a beach in Tahiti.

The content and pattern of your fantasy life, both during sessions and
elsewhere, offer rich clues about the relative prevalence of
burnout--impairment symptoms. I think it is interesting to ask any
practitioner two questions:

::: list1
[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-item1-174}[1.]{.enumerator}During
your typical sessions, about what percentage of the time do you spend
fully engaged and completely focused? In other words, how often are you
listening intently to what your clients are saying, as opposed to
drifting off, fantasizing, and thinking about other things?

[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-item1-175}[2.]{.enumerator}When
you do leave the sessions in your head, where do you go?
:::

As for the first question, I have heard estimates of anything from 20%
to 75%, meaning that practitioners confess that they are actually paying
attention to their clients about one fifth to three quarters of the
time. I think we are all doing quite well to actually listen about half
the time, considering there are so many things going on inside us. A
client says something, and that triggers a whole range of internal
fireworks in which we make connections to our own lives, drift off for a
minute, lapse into fantasy, and plan what we intend to do later in the
session---or later in the day. Then we tune in once again for a few
minutes until something []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_181}else sets us off,
and we leave the room for a little while. Some of this may be boredom,
of course, but a lot of these mind trips are the inevitable result of
processing everything that we hear and experience during such an intense
conversation.

The point is that how often you remain focused in sessions---and how
often you leave the room to go off into your own world---are indications
of your relative engagement with your work. This will vary from client
to client, day to day, and therapist to therapist. Some clinicians
report phenomenal powers of concentration in which they claim that they
are actually listening to their clients 95% of the time. (I find this
hard to believe only because I don't even listen to myself close to that
often.) Others among us can do excellent clinical work tuning in half
the time or less; we might even find a lot of creative energy during
those reflective journeys.

#### Causes of Burnout {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-15 .sec2}

Once again, a reminder that burnout takes a lot of different forms and
can affect functioning in every dimension of daily life. There are some
predisposing factors within individuals that predict increased
vulnerability. Therapists are most susceptible during life transitions,
during periods of accelerated metabolic changes, and after decades-long
intervals between theoretical changes. Therapists who have experienced
previous trauma, are dealing with major personal conflicts, employ
avoidant coping styles, and hold pessimistic attitudes are in greatest
jeopardy. Other factors that come into play include

:::

[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_182}Some therapists are at risk because of
not only developmental transitions but also certain personality
characteristics related to rigidity, narcissism, and perfectionism
([Allan et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-4){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0281}).
Those with a low tolerance for frustration and ambiguity, a high need
for approval and for control, and rigid patterns of thought are going to
be in for greater turbulence. One social worker, for example, has been
practicing orthodox psychoanalysis for 20 years. He subscribes to all
the appropriate journals, attends conventions religiously, and is proud
of the fact that he has not changed his style since he completed his own
analysis decades previously. He resists change even within his sheltered
professional circles and scoffs at ego psychology or Jungian analysis as
too revisionist. He actually does very little in his sessions, although
he can talk to a colleague for hours about all the fascinating things
that are happening. He is often frustrated because he sees little
progress in his clients and receives so little feedback from them
concerning how they feel toward him.

The seeds of disillusionment may first be sown, if not fertilized as
well, in graduate school. Therapists get themselves in trouble with
unrealistic expectations and unreasonable goals. No matter what the
textbooks and professors say, you are not going to cure schizophrenia by
reflecting feelings, and you are not going to wipe out chronic
depression by disputing a few irrational beliefs. Naïve beginners enter
the field prepared to conduct neat, elegant, organized therapy in 10
sessions or less with people who will change fast, show up on time, and
feel exceedingly grateful. It takes several years to realize that some
clients will always be much the same no matter what you do, that you
will never get the recognition you deserve, and that most of the time
you will be unappreciated and overworked.

#### Bureaucratic Constraints {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-16 .sec2}

There are policies within most organizational structures that may make
for efficient operations, happy boards of directors, and balanced
budgets, but that are hardly conducive to staff morale. Paperwork is
just one example of a product that pleases funding and accreditation
agencies but drives clinical personnel up the wall. For every session of
therapy conducted, the therapist may spend 15 minutes describing in
annoying detail what the client talked about, what interventions were
used, how that particular session contributed to the overall treatment
goals, and how the client felt after he left. In some settings, all this
material must be repeated again and again for summaries, insurance
forms, case reports, and departmental files.

[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_183}Some mental health agencies, hospitals,
social service departments, universities, and clinics are notorious for
their political wars. Power struggles are waged not only among
department heads and within the administrative hierarchy but also
especially among the different professional groups. Psychiatrists,
social workers, family therapists, counselors, psychologists,
psychiatric nurses, and mental health technicians often stick together
in their respective groups, each with their own biases toward others.
The result of this often intense competition is an environment in which
staff vie for control, status, recognition, and power. In such a
setting, it is not surprising that people choose to drop out.

Even the most dedicated and well-meaning practitioner who has
successfully avoided all the previously mentioned traps may find it
difficult to resist the contagious effects of others' disillusionment.
When the institutional norm is to complain about the food, it is
difficult to enjoy a meal. When other staff members complain about how
they have been abused by the administration, it is hard to go about
one's business as if others care for your welfare.

#### Emotional Distress {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-17 .sec2}

Most of the problems contributing to burnout are centered less on the
actual daily work than about the therapist's unresolved emotional
difficulties. The usual suspects include early deprivation, neglect,
abuse, and exploitation; or relational attachment or enmeshment
difficulties that can result in mistrust, hypervigilance, and
self-doubt. Several different clinicians can be exposed to exactly the
same clients or presenting complaints; whereas some will internalize the
despair, others can easily shrug it off. This relates to not only
clinical style, cognitive activity, and coping mechanisms but also
preexisting stress levels in the therapist's life.

Some professionals invest themselves too much in the outcome of their
work, a result that depends very much on the client's motivation and
behavior. They may therefore attempt to do too much in the sessions,
taking excessive responsibility for filling silences, providing
immediate relief of symptoms, and generating insights that are supposed
to make all the difference. The more control and responsibility that the
therapist assumes, the less the client feels like a partner in the
process.

One of my own greatest problems is that I attribute *way* too much power
and control to my own abilities and skills in sessions (and in life).
This means that I take more credit for outcomes than I justifiably
deserve []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_184}and also accept more than my fair
share of responsibility for failures. I have known this for a long time
and have worked on it repeatedly in therapy, supervision, and peer
consultations, yet I still refuse to change this behavior (and it is a
deliberate choice). I know the right things to say to my own supervisees
and students---that they need to let the client do the work, that there
are limits to what we can do, and that the rest is up to factors outside
our control---yet I enjoy the illusion of power that comes with the
belief that I can control certain things that are really beyond my
grasp. I also like the continued growth that accompanies this
self-critical style, even if it does predispose me to burn out faster if
I don't carefully monitor what is happening.

Therapists who are more highly evolved than I am in this area are hardly
justified in assuming a passive, detached, observatory role that allows
their clients to flounder aimlessly. Certainly, we share some
responsibility with the client for planning the content of sessions,
providing some input into choices, and gently helping the client
generate a degree of self-understanding and subsequent action. The
problem arises when, out of a sense of self-importance, the therapist
feels a genuine, gut-level stake in what the client does and how fast
she does it.

Emotional factors enter the picture not only for the therapist who tries
too hard but also for the one who overidentifies with a client's
situation. No matter how many times I hear a young client cry out in
anger and frustration at being teased by his peers, I feel the pain
every time. As the little guy goes on to relate the incident of striking
out for the third time in front of his heckling teammates, I can feel
myself actually shaking. I was one of those kids sent into exile in
right field while playing baseball.

Often the sutures closing up an old wound fail to hold against the
onslaught of emotional issues presented by clients. Sometimes the best
we can hope for is constant vigilance: "This client is *not* me. I am
sitting over here in the more comfortable chair. I am being paid to sit
here, to listen, to react, but not to get into my own stuff."

A final emotional issue worth mentioning concerns those therapists who
lack family and social support for their jobs. Helping professionals
require much nurturance, understanding, and demonstrations of affection.
After giving and giving all day long, a therapist can come home (or exit
the designated home office space) with a short fuse and a long list of
demands. Tender loving care is indicated until he or she returns to the
land of the living. This is especially true for primary caregivers in
the field, who often must contend with more than their fair share of
family and household chores in addition to a full work schedule. Single
parents also shoulder a []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_185}disproportionate
burden of financial hardships, carpooling, laundry, and late nights
spent cleaning house.

#### Preventing and Responding to Burnout {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-18 .sec2}

First of all, as you'd guess, there's no permanent cure for burnout as
some degree of ongoing stress is part of what it means to be a
therapist. Even more discouraging is that there are few consistently
reliable and effective strategies for counteracting the effects of
secondary trauma or compassion fatigue. But when distress reaches the
point of impairment, where symptoms begin to affect daily functioning
and compromise professional effectiveness, then some sort of
intervention is necessary, usually in the form of supervision or
personal therapy. The major problem for burned-out professionals is the
attitude they bring to their work and life priorities, which at some
point has slipped into a condition of self-neglect.

For us, just as for our clients, denial is the major impediment to
successful treatment of burnout. In the face of dwindling caseloads,
client or colleague complaints, family concerns, or obviously
dysfunctional behavior (substance abuse, depression, sexual problems,
financial irresponsibility, psychosomatic complaints), some clinicians
refuse to admit there is a problem, hoping things will improve on their
own. As we know only too well, they rarely do.

The result of many of these factors that contribute to burnout is
increased isolation and withdrawal on the part of the therapist. As much
as any other solution, recruiting support is absolutely critical in
mediating the effects of burnout. Because it often is difficult for
professional helpers to ask for help, the self-destructive patterns
become more entrenched and more resistant to treatment. Several
self-administered preventions and cures can nevertheless be useful, many
of which are covered in [Chapter
12](#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0282}
on self-care. First, however, we review a few strategies directly
related to chronic stress.

#### Recognize Signs of Burnout When You See It or Experience It {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-19 .sec2}

It isn't that difficult to notice when a colleague has lost energy and
focus. You see the signs so clearly: The professional is acting out,
displaying classic signs of depression or anxiety, drinking too much,
failing to honor commitments, appearing frazzled, making mistakes, and,
most of all, []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_186}denying that there is any
problem whatsoever. It is much more difficult to recognize the signs and
symptoms of burnout in yourself.

We are all human. We are all struggling to keep ourselves afloat. We are
all wrestling with our demons. We all have our issues that continue to
plague us. And in the arena of being a therapist, there are few places
to hide.

There are several questions worth considering. As you review them,
notice what jumps up for you, what immediately comes to mind. You might
find it helpful to talk to someone, or to write in your journal
afterward, in order to process whatever is activated by these questions.
Remember that this is a privilege of our job: We are not only permitted
but also encouraged to be reflective and brutally honest with ourselves
(and others).

### Do Therapy Differently {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div1-85 .sec1}

[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-20}The simplest
and most direct way to breathe life into unsatisfying work is either to
do something else or to do what you are already doing a little (or a
lot) differently. The booming business of presenting workshops and
seminars attests to the popularity of this particular strategy, even if
the effects are short-lived. After an initial surge of enthusiasm on
completing a workshop or conference, many therapists slip back into the
doldrums. A good speaker can be infectious in her spirit, but just as in
therapy, []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_187}unless the participant continues
to apply the ideas on a daily basis, regression is likely.

After many years of struggling to sort through the vast array of
theoretical orientations, therapeutic technology, and conflicting
claims, you may feel more secure sticking with a proven and familiar
recipe. Even if you have no particular objection to learning new
concepts, new rules, a new vocabulary, and a new set of skills, trying
something new seems to mean condemning the old ways to obsolescence.
This is hardly the case, as we tend to retain those ideas that are still
helpful. Nevertheless, until therapists encounter discomfort of
sufficient magnitude, they may exhibit considerable resistance to
radical change. The key, therefore, is to give yourself permission to
change a little at a time, to experiment, and to be more creative.

One psychologist had been administering mindfulness exercises with great
success for years. He had found a proven formula for creating effective
and efficient induction procedures, vivid images, and positive results.
His clients were still improving (though less so in recent months), but
he was feeling much worse. With all the complaints he made about how
stale and boring his work felt, with all the options he considered in
giving up behavioral strategies, it never occurred to him simply to
alter his approach or enliven his instructions. He did not really need
to read them anymore, but he did so because he did not trust himself to
work spontaneously. An unusual example of rigidity, this case highlights
the point that a psychoanalyst need not become a Rolfing specialist, and
a Gestalt therapist does not need to adopt behavior modification, to
reenergize her work.

Doing therapy differently means forcing yourself to venture off into
uncharted territory where the destination is less well defined. It means
joining the client as a partner in the spiritual odyssey. Most of all,
it means, paradoxically, conquering burnout by initially working even
harder until it no longer is work at all.

#### Teach Others {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-21 .sec2}

There is a very good reason why so many professors do counseling as an
avocation and why so many therapists teach, and it may have less to do
with generating pocket money than with rejuvenating one's enthusiasm.
Therapists teach as a way of not only spreading the gospel and
increasing referrals and their reputation but also of giving greater
meaning to their clinical work. When you explain to others what you do,
how you do it, and []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_188}*why* you do it a
particular way, you are forced to think through the rationale for every
intervention.

An ex-therapist, ex-professor, and now university administrator still
works with a few clients just to keep her skills honed and her
perspective fresh. She still fights for the opportunity to teach one
clinical course each semester, even though it means extra work. She does
not receive extra compensation, and do her superiors do not approve, as
it means time away from her office. She does it for her own mental
health: "Teaching helps me to be more honest and self-critical. When I
talk about what it means to be a good therapist, it helps me to be more
that way myself."

Another therapist teaches a graduate-level course even though it means
another night away from home each week and only a token honorarium:

::: prosequote
I usually get stuck with the classes none of the full-time staff want to
teach. But I don't mind. It's a way to get to talk to people in the
field who are still eager and fresh. It's a privilege and an honor to
work with the really good students. I'd do it for free. I teach this one
techniques class that nobody ever likes---not the professors or the
students---because it involves making and analyzing verbatim
transcripts. My therapy has changed so much since I started studying the
work of beginners who know next to nothing. They use low-level and
awkward active listening, and yet they are still effective. Since I
started going back to the basics in my own work, I'm surprised to find I
enjoy it all over again.
:::

A full-time professor relates the impact of teaching on his clinical
work:

::: prosequote
Questions drive me nuts! The questions some students ask. . . . Like one
wiseass asked me how I know that any of my clients ever really get
better. Maybe they're just pretending. Now this guy had no intention of
being profound; he was just being silly. I put him off with some
appropriate remark. But then I started thinking, really thinking, about
the reasons I know for sure that clients really change, not just fake
it. The more I thought about it, the better I felt about doing therapy.
:::

Clinicians who do research, give public lectures, publish articles, and
write books report similar experiences. To teach is to magnify our
influence. To teach is to continually evaluate what we do from the
perspective of an innocent. We derive greater meaning not only from the
single lives that we help improve but also in how those lives help us
understand and improve the process of change.

#### []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_189}Take Personal Responsibility {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-22 .sec2}

In every location around the world, there are therapists who are
relatively immune to burnout. They get a tremendous kick out of making a
crying child smile or an adult with a plastic smile cry. They stand
aloof from the backstabbing, yet they retain their power through their
expertise, dependability, and tremendous competence. They take care of
themselves and of the people around them. They expect honesty and
respect from others. Even in a closed environment, we can choose such
colleagues as friends. We can also find ways to exercise more personal
control over how we work, as it is precisely a perceived lack of control
that most often leads to burnout.

Seeking out enthusiastic colleagues is only one of several practical
strategies. It also helps to remind ourselves of our own limitations, as
well as to rely on multiple measures of success in our work rather than
just clients' explicit gratitude. Just as corporations try to diversify
their income sources to protect their revenue against inevitable
downturns, so too are we well advised to develop outside interests as a
form of renewal, whether exercising our mind or body. The advantage of
expanding one's involvement to include other activities besides clinical
practice (consulting, advising, coaching, mentoring, teaching,
supervising) is that when one of them isn't very satisfying the others
provide alternative modes of expression and enjoyment.

Perhaps most useful of all is applying the lessons to ourselves that we
teach to others, especially related to the ways we process and make
sense of the pressures we face. We are more than a little familiar with
the ways that stress can become either debilitating or else lead to
major breakthroughs, changes, joy, excitement, and personal
satisfaction. Think how often people deliberately choose to take risks,
consume terrifying media or books, ride roller coasters, and pursue
adventures because they so enjoy the ramped up internal responses, even
the fear. We know that there are two very different systems that
operate, one that leads to all the difficulties associated with
physiological distress, and the other, known as *eustress*, refers to
many of the positive sensations that can accompany a stoked up nervous
system ([Sies,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-284){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0283}).
It was 50 years ago that physiologist Hans Seyle (1974) first observed
that stress can have a number of positive benefits, depending on how the
experience is processed.

Although distress is experienced as frightening, disturbing, and anxiety
provoking, eustress is a feeling of excitement and stimulation when
challenged. The difference between chronic, debilitating stress and the
kind that energizes, challenges, and teaches us new skills and resources
relates []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_190}directly to the way we process
those experiences---the "stress mindset" as it has been called
([Huebschmann & Sheets,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-136){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0284};
McGonigal, 2015). This is what makes our job so potentially creative and
exciting when we face new challenges and grow as a result of the ways we
are stretched. It is also what explains how one's personal beliefs,
attitudes, mindset, and internal processing shape the characteristic
ways we respond to adversity, just as they do with our clients ([Simpson
et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-286){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0285}).
One example of this was tracked during the forced isolation and
quarantine during the global pandemic in which those with varied
resources, as well as satisfying, consistent employment and a
comfortable home, were much better able to tolerate the challenges,
uncertainty, confusion, and stress associated with the predicament
([Merino et al.,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-222){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0286}).

#### Create Work Breaks {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-23 .sec2}

Some therapists are great advocates of work breaks that are used as
buffers against stress, as emotional breathers providing time and space
to unwind, and as safety valves to blow off steam. For some
practitioners, this simply means not scheduling so many appointments
consecutively. Other clinicians are more systematic in their efforts. As
one therapist related:

::: prosequote
Since I normally start to drag in the early afternoon and begin asking
myself why I am still doing this kind of work after all these years, I
have learned to program the hours from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m. for my own
mental health. I read somewhere that this is the time when most mammals
take naps and when most industrial accidents take place. I can believe
it. Anyway, I take time out from my day to go for a walk, to work out,
or to read a novel.
:::

As an example of a therapist who is working in a school or agency, and
therefore has less flexibility than in private practice regarding how he
structures his time, one professional explained how he keeps burnout at
bay: "I build rest periods into my day whenever I can. I might steal a
few minutes here and there to meditate or read a magazine. Sometimes
when I have an unexpected cancellation---at this place, that happens
every day---I force myself to not use the time productively. I like to
just close the door of my office and play online games."

With the wide choice of fitness and expertise apps available, some
practitioners like to partition their day in such a way that every few
hours they do a brief activity or exercise, whether yoga, meditation,
strength training, stretching, or something more vigorous, like a walk,
run, or more []{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_191}serious workout. The idea is
to continue to ground ourselves and shrug off the daily pressures we
face.

#### Disconnections as a Source of Stress {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div2-24 .sec2}

In many cases, job stress results from a specific, identifiable source.
The physical environment may be a factor (i.e., sharing space with a
coworker). More recently, with therapists afforded the option to work
from remote locations and home, there are other technological (and
personal) challenges related to faulty or glitchy equipment, intrusions,
distractions, and space priorities.

The relationship that you have with your immediate supervisor is another
factor that must be considered. Nothing is more frustrating than an
incompetent boss who enjoys having others under his thumb; demands
stringent accountability; likes paperwork; sends conflicting orders;
invites honest feedback, but only if it is pleasant; and understands
very little about therapy. Supervisors who are unreliable, dishonest,
unavailable, or overly critical can also diminish the satisfaction from
our work.

In his first job out of graduate school, a man reported that while he
counseled young adolescents in a cubicle without a door or ceiling, his
supervisor would listen with her ear to the wall. Every time he said
anything to a client that she did not agree with, the supervisor would
bang on the wall and yell out, "Don't tell him that!" When the startled
child and fledgling counselor then continued their conversation in a
hushed whisper, another bang would ensue, followed by the words, "If you
two have to be so secretive, you shouldn't be talking about whatever you
are talking about." The counselor now works as a salesman.

Another major source of stress in contemporary life is the
*dis*connection that results from being so continuously tethered through
technology. We are always accessible and available through mobile
devices, phones, text messages, social media, and---coming
soon---communication implants. You can't help but notice how much
relationships have changed as a result of the technological advances of
the past several years. Some of these breakthroughs have been remarkably
useful and exciting, whereas other experiences---such as someone in a
movie theater who insists on checking his messages every few minutes or
someone on a cell phone talking in a booming voice---are downright
annoying. No matter where you are these days---in a theater, mall, or
airport, standing in line, or sitting in any public space---you notice
practically everyone engaged with his or her mobile device. It is not
unusual to see a family of four sitting at a restaurant having
[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_192}dinner, each person talking or texting
someone else while they sit in one another's company. It is not that
rare that clients want to answer their mobile phones or messages while
sitting in session, as well as multitasking during screen meetings.

[Turkle
(2015)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-309){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0287}
made the case that with people constantly tethered to their devices
there's no downtime anymore to relax; we've lost the art of daydreaming
because we are constantly occupied with distractions---or more demands
for our time. Turkle also revealed from her research that people are
losing their capacity for empathy and deep conversations, valuing
convenience, efficiency, and what she called "the illusion of friendship
without the demands of intimacy" (p. 7). At least this bodes well for
the future of our profession because people will inevitably become more
hungry for meaningful conversation that is actually spontaneous and
uncontrolled.

It is as if practically nobody is fully present anymore. In recent
years, there has been an erosion of attention and an addiction to
technology that not only keeps us connected to news, networks,
information, and friends, but that also disconnects us from those who
are in the room. It is rare nowadays to have anyone's undivided
attention. There is even a high probability that as you are reading
these words, you are doing something else at the same time.

As much as we value technological advances in terms of increased
productivity and efficiency, not to mention enjoyment, there are
consequences that affect every other aspect of our lives, relationships
most of all. Such a barrage of stimuli allows for negligible downtime,
making it even more difficult to recover from all the varied
interactions.

### When Therapists Become Seriously Impaired {#16_chapter9.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-9-div1-86 .sec1}

The terms *burnout* and *impairment* are often used interchangeably in
the literature, although there is a significant difference in that
burnout may not *necessarily* harm clients even if it most definitely
shortchanges them in some ways. An impaired therapist, however, is
dysfunctional to the point of actually hurting others, as well as
himself. Moreover, burnout can be limited to the work setting alone,
whereas impairment usually affects *every* domain in a professional's
life.

Burnout, or rustout, may certainly be a common condition experienced by
almost everyone at some time during their career. Serious impairment is
probably limited to less than 10% of the profession at any one time if
we count clinical depression, substance abuse, chronic illness, intense
loneliness, boundary violations, and so on ([Reamer,
2015](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-262){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0288};
[Schoener,
2015](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-275){#16_chapter9.xhtml_n0289}).
[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_193}It's imperative that we continuously
monitor early warning signs that may signal far more impending problems
if left unchecked. Of particular concern would be (a) disrupted
concentration, sleep, and eating; (b) feelings of isolation and
estrangement from others; (c) recent losses; and (d) symptoms of severe
depression, anxiety, and hopelessness. In other words, the same kinds of
warning signs of trouble that our clients bring to sessions, for most of
which we are hardly immune.

Then there are those who suffer from the usual, pedestrian varieties of
personality disorder, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders that
led them to seek a profession in which they could "hide." We all know
someone in the field who is seriously disturbed and consequently preys
on clients through sexual exploitation, inappropriate value
indoctrination, or other forms of pathological manipulation and control.
We are all familiar with colleagues who continue to operate even though
they are doing great harm. If we were to confront them directly with
suspicions about what we have heard, they would seem shocked and
indignant. As mentioned, being distressed or wounded, however, does not
necessarily mean that a professional is impaired. Presumably, it is
possible to experience some degree of crisis or trauma in one's life and
still conduct one's work, if not superlatively, then at least
adequately.

It is unfortunate that when burnout does lead to significant impairment,
it is the nature of the therapist's dysfunction to deny that there is
anything wrong. There is a hole in the professional's conscience,
evidence of sociopathy, or, more often, a kind of blinding attempt to
save himself at the expense of others. It is when he can no longer deal
with stress or keep symptoms of burnout under control that a therapist
is most likely to engage in unethical conduct or to make self-serving
decisions that harm others.

Whereas it is unlikely that anyone reading these words is seriously
impaired (I suspect that such an individual would not be open to
confronting the personal nuances of his or her work), there are many
among us who can feel themselves slipping, inexorably, toward continued
rustout and eventual distress. It is apparent that that there will be
lasting challenges and consequences for therapists long after the
pandemic ended, adding to their own vulnerability to continued stress.
Demand for our services has never been higher, with skyrocketing
incidences of depression, anxiety, domestic violence, abuse, and
suicide. In the face of such desperation, caseloads are becoming
unwieldy, yet many practitioners feel both overwhelmed and guilty
because they are not able to help all those who in need. In addition,
they don't feel they can offer the same quality of care that they can
with clients they see in person.

[]{#16_chapter9.xhtml_page_194}To make it easier for therapists to ask
for support, a number of state professional societies have organized
hotlines for impaired therapists. In an effort both to reduce the
proliferation of therapists who act out in their sessions and to control
excessive drug and alcohol abuse among their colleagues, professional
therapists stand ready to provide assistance where and when it is
needed. We all have a duty and responsibility to promote not only the
well-being of our clients and our own mental health but also the
functioning of our colleagues as well. That boredom and burnout often
lead to more severe personal consequences, such as depression, drug
addiction, suicide, divorce, and the breakdown of professional
effectiveness, is inevitable. We all entered the helping profession to
make a difference in the world. The place to start is with
ourselves---and then with our peers.

[]{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_196}Like every profession, the practice of
therapy has its secrets that lurk in the background behind much of what
we do. These are issues that are rarely spoken about even among
ourselves, much less in public forums. Until such time that we are
prepared to identify, examine, and challenge some of the myths that
operate within our profession, those not supported by much evidence, it
is going to be very difficult for us to refine and advance our
development and growth. There are many things we do that we just take
for granted, many things we say to others that may not be nearly as
accurate as we think.

Within larger society, as well as every other profession, myths,
misconceptions, and distortions significantly impede progress. Global
warming is one example, a condition on the planet supported by 99% of
qualified earth scientists, yet the belief still persists among the
general public---and some politicians---that it's just a conspiracy to
derail economic progress.

Before we delve into the secrets and myths prevalent among therapists,
the stage is set by considering a few others that have taken hold within
the wider world ([Kottler & Balkin,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-175){#17_chapter10.xhtml_n0290}).
In spite of what might be presented in films and television, real
cowboys never wore cowboy hats (they wore bowlers). Although it has been
repeatedly reported that there were mass suicides of people jumping out
of building windows after the stock market crash during the Depression,
there was actually only one documented case. Women accused of being
witches weren't really burned at the stake, but they were hanged or
bludgeoned to death.

Related to our own field, there are also many misconceptions that are
described in this chapter. A few of them are worth mentioning at the
outset, such as the relative invalidity of the Rorschach test even
though it is still in wide use. Likewise, there is little evidence that
people have preferred learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) or
left- or right-brained dominance, or that we only use 10% of our brain's
potential. One other example is the notion of three-layer, triune brain
development in which it has repeatedly been said by many authorities
that the "primitive" regions like the hippocampus developed first,
followed at the end by the cerebral cortex ([Barrett,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-14){#17_chapter10.xhtml_n0291}).
These examples are mentioned as reminders that in many aspects of our
daily existence we operate from assumptions and beliefs that are not
only misguided but also wrong.

### Essential Secrets {#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10-div1-88 .sec1}

[]{#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10-div2-25}One of the
gifts---and burdens---of being a therapist is our commitment to some
semblance of truth seeking, plain talking, and courageous challenges of
life's paradoxes and incongruities. We have learned that secrecy and
[]{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_197}denial within families or groups can
lead to all kinds of self-delusions and compromised functioning. And
that's one reason why we believe in complete transparency and honesty as
the basis for our work and lives. Yet there are a few areas in which we
often present ourselves as less than genuine and frank. Here is fair
warning that this discussion is both uncomfortable and bewildering.

You may not agree with all of the issues selected. You may also
justifiably believe these issues are exaggerated at times to make a
point. But you will have to acknowledge that there is a shade of truth
to the notion that the very foundation of what we do is laid on shaky
ground.

#### Much of the Time We Don't Know What We're Doing {#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10-div2-26 .sec2}

I don't mean to imply that therapists are not competent, skilled, highly
trained experts who have a clear treatment plan and defensible rationale
for what we do and why we do it, grounded in empirical research and
evidence-based clinical experience. What I'm suggesting is that some of
the time we are operating in the dark, pretending that we know far more
than we really do, and often clueless about what is really going on with
a client at any given time. There. It feels good to say that.

Feeling clueless isn't all that rare for most therapists, who admit to
having questions about their effectiveness about a quarter of the time,
often throughout most of their careers ([Theriault & Gazzola,
2006](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-305){#17_chapter10.xhtml_n0292}).
There is not anything necessarily wrong with occasional fugue states in
which we are wandering around as lost as our clients. We are required to
pretend to possess far more confidence than we often feel and to provide
answers to questions that we barely understand. We hold cherished
theories that are sometimes not all that useful in making sense of what
we are observing or experiencing in any moment of time. If you were
pressed to be really honest and to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 how
confident you are that your diagnosis of a given client is accurate,
your understanding of this person complete and comprehensive, and your
chosen treatment strategy the correct and best alternative available
among all possible options, I'd be surprised (and skeptical) of any
score higher than a 5 or 6.

I had been working for several months with Kyle, who had been presenting
clear, identifiable symptoms of panic disorder. It was an easy diagnosis
to make because of the coherent and comprehensive narrative he
presented, including sudden onset of heart palpitations, difficulty
breathing, loss of control, unremitting anxiety, and feelings of
impending doom. Further, there wasn't any precipitating event or any
identified organic cause.

[]{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_198}Kyle was a wonderfully responsive and
cooperative client. He did everything I asked of him. He worked hard in
sessions, practiced new skills in his life, and had an amazing capacity
for insight into his difficulties and their probable source. The only
problem was that after all this time, the symptoms never reduced in
frequency or intensity; they sometimes became even worse.

By mutual consent, we agreed that it might be a good idea to take some
time off from therapy and perhaps consult with a psychiatrist for
medication to manage the symptoms. This is not, however, the end of the
story.

Several months later, Kyle scheduled an appointment that I assumed was
to resume therapy. After he settled himself in his accustomed chair, he
told me that he had recently sold his home, which required a thorough
inspection.

I encouraged him to continue, all the while wondering why he was telling
me this. I noticed that Kyle looked more relaxed than I'd ever seen him
before. I assumed that all the things I had taught him had finally
kicked into gear and that he had recovered from the panic disorder quite
beautifully.

Kyle then proceeded to explain that during this home inspection, it was
discovered that there had been a furnace leak in the house, producing
toxic levels of gas that were actually the real cause of his symptoms.
Once the furnace was repaired, his so-called panic disorder disappeared.
All along he never needed a therapist but a furnace repair specialist!

I think about Kyle a lot during those times when I feel so certain that
I know what is going on with a client and so clear about the symptoms,
etiology, and best treatment. When I hear colleagues speak with such
authority at conferences, at supervision meetings, and in books about
what they believe is truth in our field or in their sessions, I can't
help but remember Kyle as a reminder that so much of what we pretend to
know is merely illusion, conjecture, supposition, and myth.

#### We Can Never Be Sure If and When We Ever Help Anyone {#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10-div2-27 .sec2}

This is the secret that really drives me crazy. There are clients who we
think---no, we are *positive*---we helped, yet we discover at some time
in the future that they were "fooling" us or that the changes didn't
last beyond a few weeks. As mentioned, people don't necessarily provide
accurate and reliable reports on their progress, shading things in one
direction or the other. It's also difficult to rely totally on the
opinions of family members who may have their own agenda.

[]{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_199}Clients tell us that they are making
fantastic gains, but we later learn it was all distortion, denial, and
fabrication. Even when we are reasonably certain that significant
progress was accomplished, we rarely discover whether the changes lasted
over time or whether there was a relapse. Further, we have trouble even
deciding how best to measure positive outcomes, whether to trust client
self-reports, family reports, or our own observations of behavior during
sessions.

Think of cases for which you are certain, beyond any doubt, that you
made a difference and that the helping effort was successful. How do you
really know that the evidence on which you are basing this assessment
was truly complete, reliable, valid, and accurate?

Then there are supposed treatment failures that, you may later learn,
were actually successes. A client drops out of therapy with no warning.
There is no further contact and no response to any attempt to follow up.
What does this mean? Did the person quit because of dissatisfaction with
the results or because the goals were already reached? We live with the
reality that most of the time we really don't know what happened to our
clients after they stopped attending sessions.

#### Even When We Think We Helped Someone, We Can't Be Certain What Actually Made the Difference {#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10-div2-28 .sec2}

You settle definitively on a case that you are absolutely certain was a
success, no doubt whatsoever. You have your evidence; it is voluminous
and irrefutable. What do you think made the difference and produced this
result?

Whatever explanation you come up with, whatever thoughts you have about
this cause-and-effect relationship, how can you ever be sure that this
is what *really* made the greatest difference?

The obvious solution is to ask the client what helped the most during
the last session or even as a follow-up some time later. This approach
assumes that the client actually knows the answer and that the response
is honest and forthcoming. If you've checked this out with clients in
the past, either haphazardly or systematically, you know that this is
somewhat of a risky path. The response you get is often unpredictable
and hardly what you may have wanted to hear. Clients will tell you all
kinds of things you said or did that you don't even remember. They will
ascribe the changes to accidental or serendipitous things that were
completely unrelated to sessions. They will point to some incident that
even now seems rather trivial and irrelevant. Or they will tell you they
really don't know, shrug, and then make something up.

[]{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_200}I'm not suggesting that we stop asking
clients to describe their views of what helped them most; rather, I am
offering a reminder that such reports are incomplete and often flawed.
One of the most important things we do in our work is to solicit
meaningful feedback from consumers of our service about what we did that
was most and least helpful. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty and
confusion surrounding what we do and how and why it works.

### What Don't We Talk About? {#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10-div1-89 .sec1}

[]{#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10-div2-29}In addition
to supervision and our own personal therapy, we do sometimes confide to
friends, colleagues, and family about our own troubles and concerns. Yet
there are still areas that remain mostly out of bounds; if we talk about
them at all, they are in low whispers or in jest. One therapist
confided, "The more I think about it, the more I realize how much of my
work and my life that I keep to myself. After having seen over 3,000
clients in my career, I could uncover a hornet's nest." So, what is it
exactly that therapists don't talk about much?

There are a few authors who have examined this territory ([Adams,

and identified some of the central taboo topics. What are the secrets
that we live with in various states of denial, or that we at least
distance ourselves from?

#### We're Not Really Listening as Much as We Pretend {#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10-div2-30 .sec2}

In theory, therapists are supposed to be absolutely, completely, and
continuously focused with laser-like intensity in sessions. We
supposedly hang on every word uttered, immerse ourselves totally in the
client's world and exhibit the kind of hovering attention necessary to
scrutinize the subtle meanings of everything said or done. We are always
analyzing, processing, interpreting, making connections, formulating
hypotheses, monitoring progress, revising diagnostic impressions,
reformulating treatment plans, preparing the next intervention and the
next one and the one after that---just as if we were in a chess match
and thinking a half dozen moves in advance.

Certainly there are some sessions that *do* hold our full attention,
flying by so fast that we can't believe they're over in what seemed like
a few []{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_201}minutes. I mentioned previously
that one of our secrets is that much of the time (sometimes most of the
time), we are hardly present at all. There is a continual dialogue in
any conversation, not only with the person to whom we are speaking but
also with ourselves; psychotherapy is no exception. Sometimes we find
ourselves lost in thoughts that are sparked by something that came up in
a session. We are constantly personalizing content, asking ourselves how
it relates to our own lives. Words, phrases, topics that come up, and
images send us on little trips within our head, launch us into elaborate
fantasies, and lead us to think things we would never say aloud.

Let's listen in on one sample of a therapist's inner dialogue during a
session:

::: prosequote
What does that mean, that look? Is she avoiding eye contact? Hiding? Or
just bored? Oh, I have to remember to make a note about the names of her
sisters. Carrie, Kyla, Meghan. Or is it Maggie? Damn. Forgot again. No,
I think it is Meghan. Speaking of forgetting, I have to return that call
from this morning. I didn't have time to eat anything, and now my
stomach is grumbling again. Where should I go for lunch? I'd love a good
salad. Uh-oh. She's looking at me now, expecting me to say something.
But I wasn't paying attention. Doesn't matter. She keeps repeating
herself, complaining. Why is it so hard for me to listen to her? Why do
I keep escaping like this? Is it me or her? I wonder if it's safe to
bring this up with her. No, it would probably scare her away. But I
should remember to bring this up sometime because I notice it keeps
happening. I bet others find it hard to listen to her too. I should
check that out with her. I'll ask her. I should also bring up this case
and why it's so hard to stay present with her. But they'll ask me a
bunch of questions I won't know the answer to. But it is interesting why
I can't stay with her, and now I think this is really about me.
:::

It is this last thought during this brief stream of consciousness that
forces the therapist to confront her internal voice and its particular
meaning.

#### When We Are Listening, It's Often With a Critical Ear {#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10-div2-31 .sec2}

In theory, therapists are supposed to be demonstrating compassion,
concern, respect, warmth, and openness in our client relationships. That
is what we strive for and what we are paid to deliver. However, the
reality of what goes on inside us during sessions with certain clients
is far different from advertised. There is sometimes a critical voice
operating inside our heads, one that we rarely admit to, much less speak
aloud. It whispers, or []{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_202}sometimes
screams, things like, "I wish you'd stop whining and complaining
already," "I can't believe you just said that!" "Didn't you hear what I
just said?" "That's the strangest thing I've ever heard!"

Granted, such critical thoughts are pretty compelling evidence that the
therapist's compassion and empathy are compromised. But remember, these
are *secret* thoughts that we rarely admit or talk about. That doesn't
mean, however, that we don't have an internal running commentary that
can often be quite critical and judgmental. In fact, of all the subjects
mentioned in this book, this is the one that most therapists I
interviewed wanted to talk about the most because it seemed so
forbidden.

One therapist mentioned a client she has been seeing for quite a long
time, someone she enjoys working with although "she's a bit of a
storyteller." What the therapist means by this is that the client
rambles a lot and goes off on tangents until she is forcibly reminded to
return to the subject at hand. "She'll just talk and talk and talk and
talk, going on and on, sometimes never getting to any point that I can
figure out."

The therapist reaches a level of frustration where it is especially hard
to restrain herself.

::: prosequote
There was this one particular day when she was just impossible. And I
know that some of it was my own issues because I had expectations, and I
was getting very impatient. So after a while, I had tried a number of
different things to see if I could get her to focus, and absolutely
nothing was working. I just completely lost my empathy. And all I could
hear was my own voice inside of my head screaming, "SHUT UP! Shut up
shut up shut up!" For the next few minutes all I could hear was my own
voice inside my head screaming for her to just shut up. I don't even
know what she was saying the whole time.
:::

The therapist really had to work hard to calm herself down and regain
some composure, silencing the critical voice.

::: prosequote
I concentrated on my breathing and, you know, trying to find that
empathy again. But it was really difficult. I had to really pay
attention to my body and how I was getting frustrated and how it felt in
my body. It took a while, but eventually I grounded myself. I decided to
let it go and accept where she was and what her agenda was. Once I was
able to do that I could accept her again. But the whole experience was
agonizing.
:::

Another example of a different kind was related by a therapist who
discovered something about a client that she strongly objected to on
moral grounds. The client was talking about a family member she held in
the []{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_203}highest regard who believed in the
most sexist, oppressive attitudes imaginable. "When I heard my client
talk about this person with such admiration, I couldn't believe it! This
was my favorite client, and it felt like a betrayal. I could feel myself
putting distance between us. This was hardly the first time I disagreed
with a client's value choices, but this time I felt really disappointed
in her." This therapist was especially confused about this incident
because she had felt so unprepared to deal with it. "We learn in our
training about how clients put us on a pedestal, but here was a case in
which I had put *her* on a pedestal from which she fell." She had
idealized her client and then, after realizing that some of her own core
values were challenged, found herself becoming quite critical to the
point that it definitely got in the way.

A third example of how a therapist's critical inner voice makes itself
known is related to an ongoing theme of envy toward others. All
throughout the week this therapist encounters clients who are far more
successful in terms of financial security than she will ever be. Yet
they are wounded and dysfunctional, possessing nothing special that she
doesn't have. "I feel like such a fraud and hypocrite, so petty even
admitting this, but you asked about secrets, right? So when I listen to
some of my clients talk about all their accomplishments and
opportunities, I think to myself, 'Why not me? Why don't I get to do
that?' "

The therapist admitted that this envy and critical voice are problematic
for her in two ways: "Not only does it feel bad to admit I am envious
about my clients' successes, but I tend not to believe people when they
say they are happy for my own accomplishments. I mistrust that. So I'm
not only limited in the joy I feel for others, but also in the good
wishes I am able to take in and appreciate."

Although most of the clients this therapist sees are from disadvantaged
backgrounds, it is the few from relatively privileged situations who
most activate her critical voice. "I really do want to fully embrace and
celebrate with my clients for what they are fortunate enough to have and
own, or the opportunities they have that I will never have access to. If
there is something I don't have and can't afford, the way to deal with
it is to convince myself I didn't want it in the first place. This, you
can imagine, creates its own world of 'things not said.' "

Sometimes the things we hear from clients are so disturbing that even a
saint would shrink in disgust. A therapist had been doing an intake with
a new client, listening to him go on and on for more than an hour about
how his drinking problem was the result of his wife nagging him all the
time. "Maybe he was trying to shock me or something, but he told me this
one story about how he just wanted some peace and quiet. So what does
this []{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_204}guy do? He tells me that he pulled
out a gun, put it up to his forehead, and pulled the trigger---twice! He
pulled the trigger of a gun pressed to his forehead twice just to get
his wife to shut up!"

All the while he heard this story, the therapist made the appropriate
sympathetic response, nodded his head, and kept his face blank, but
inside he was thinking to himself:

::: prosequote
What the hell? This guy is such a jerk, such a total jerk. I can barely
stand being in the room with him. I just wanted to get him out of there.
I was doing my best trying to be accepting and empathic, but I just
couldn't hold it together. For the rest of the interview, all I could
think of is what a lucky bastard he was that the gun didn't go off both
times. I really hate to admit this, but his wife sure would have been
better off if it had.
:::

In each of these examples, therapists are just admitting that they are
human and have personal reactions to what they hear, sometimes letting
their guard down. This is not really so surprising or unexpected. And it
isn't so much a secret as it is a subject that we don't talk about often
except when pressed by a supervisor or when we find that the critical
attitude is getting in the way of being helpful.

#### Feeling Superior {#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10-div2-32 .sec2}

We may act with appropriate modesty and restraint, but deep down inside
there is sometimes a feeling of being very special. Such a belief is
certainly understandable given that we do have singular skills and
extensive knowledge. We do understand things that most others will never
grasp. We hear nuances in language to which others are oblivious and
observe subtleties in behavior that are invisible to the untrained eye.
We can even appear to read minds because of our heightened sensitivity
and ability to discern hidden intentions and motives, uncover
unconscious thoughts, and predict what people might do or say next.

Ever since I was a little boy buried in comic books, I always wanted
superpowers, preferably x-ray vision or the ability to fly. The latter
desire left me battered and bruised as I launched myself off tables,
thinking if I just tried hard enough I would finally achieve lift off.
Alas, it was not to be---at least until I started training as a
therapist and realized that indeed we *do* have seemingly magical powers
that allow us to peer into people's minds and hearts. In addition, after
spending so much time in the company []{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_205}of
people who are wounded and dysfunctional it is reassuring to find we are
in much better shape than we might have imagined.

A therapist talked at great length about how listening to people's
problems all day made her feel much better about herself. "I've had more
than my fair share of failed romantic relationships," she said. "So when
I hear about celebrities who break up, or my clients who are having
trouble in their relationships, I don't feel like such a failure myself.
Of course I also like hearing about other people's troubles because it
helps me to forget about my own."

In this case, the therapist elaborated how she enjoys being with her
clients, in part, because they are in worse condition than she'll ever
be. "I do feel superior, and with good reason. Some of the clients I see
are barely functional. In some ways, I feel safe around them because
they can't hurt me. They defer to me. I feel confident and strong and
secure."

Indeed, we do spend most of our time in the company of those who are
crippled or unenlightened. We are used to being treated with a certain
amount of respect and deference; after all, we are the closest thing to
gurus that still exist in our culture. And we may come to believe over
time that we really *are* smarter and more capable than most others,
often because it feels like that is true.

#### Dysfunctional Colleagues {#17_chapter10.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-10-div2-33 .sec2}

One of the most poorly kept secrets in our profession is that we have
colleagues who are crazier than some of the most disturbed clients we've
ever seen. They may have gotten into this work in the first place for
reasons that have nothing to do with helping people. They enjoy
manipulating and controlling others because they feel so out of control
themselves. They feel a sense of power from exploiting others. In many
cases, they just can't seem to help themselves: They are victims of the
same kinds of mental disorders---major depression, personality
disorders, panic attacks, schizophrenia---that afflict the rest of the
population.

We certainly have more than our fair share of brethren who are
psychologically troubled. Some are struggling with addictions or act out
in ways harmful to themselves and others. As previously discussed,
people choose this field for a variety of reasons that may have little
to do with helping people but rather helping themselves. They may seek
to stabilize their own lifelong depression, anxiety, or dysfunctional
personality through the work they do. They may enjoy positions of power
and authority that allow them []{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_206}to control
and manipulate others. They may be trying to work out their own stuff by
trying to help others with parallel issues. They may exhibit rampant
narcissism that comes from taking themselves way too seriously.

The media absolutely love to ridicule therapists as unethical,
outrageous, insecure, self-indulgent, sadistic, personally flawed, or
seriously wounded, even as serial killers who eat their clients. In one
study of over 1,500 films in which there was a therapist as a character,
80% of them portrayed the professional in a negative light as unethical,
manipulative, incompetent, or evil ([Flowers & Frizler,
2004](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-77){#17_chapter10.xhtml_n0304};
[Stringer,
2016](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-298){#17_chapter10.xhtml_n0305}).
Perhaps this isn't all that surprising considering that within the
medical specialties, psychiatrists are the least respected physicians in
terms of their integrity, honesty, and ethics. Whereas generally most
doctors are rated quite high in these dimensions by 70% of those
surveyed, the majority of psychiatrists (59%) are perceived as lacking
in these traits ([Gallup,
2015](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-89){#17_chapter10.xhtml_n0306}).

Although the vast majority of clinicians are not only highly ethical and
professional but also personally masterful in their own lives, there are
a few among us who engage in the sort of bizarre behavior that makes our
clients seem tame by comparison. Some of these folks are relatively
harmless, even endearingly eccentric, but others are downright
dangerous.

I was assigned to supervise a therapist who was so anxious and fragile
that she insisted that we sit on opposite sides of the room with the
door open. I once dropped a pen on the floor, and when I stooped over to
pick it up, she went into a catatonic stupor, fearing that I was going
to hurt her in some way. I assume she had been abused by someone in a
position of power, but she would never agree to speak about that. In
fact, she would hardly speak at all.

The really amazing thing to me is that her clients seemed to improve in
spite of her personal problems. They must have felt safe in the presence
of someone else who was so vulnerable. It sure blew away one of my
cherished beliefs that the essence of our therapeutic work takes place
because of the ways we model our own personal effectiveness.

I've known therapists who scream at their clients, browbeating them into
submission. I have heard of others who do things that seem so bizarre
and inappropriate that it is amazing that anyone would ever come back to
see them again---yet they have full practices!

I saw a new referral a while ago, and when I asked her what she expected
from me, she said she hoped I would pay attention to her.

::: prosequote
"What do you mean?" I asked.

"You know," she said, "like look at me and talk to me."

"What else would I do?" I said, more than a little confused.
:::

[]{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_207}It was then she told me about her
previous therapist, who used to polish and paint her nails during
sessions. Once a month she would vacuum and dust the room during the
conversation.

::: prosequote
"And you put up with this for how long?" I asked.

"Not that long, just a few years."
:::

About this same time, a friend asked me a question about his therapy. I
was reluctant, of course, to get involved, but he assured me that he
just wanted to clarify something. He had been seeing the same therapist
for over 15 years, and she had been some help to him, but recently he
had been having some doubts about her approach.

Warily, I asked what they were doing together. He reported that this
therapist was seeing him, his wife, and two adult children (in their
30s) for individual sessions once each week, plus seeing all four of
them in a family session. That didn't seem unreasonable until he
confided that this had been going on for more than a decade and that she
insisted that he pay for everyone's treatment because he was responsible
for all their problems. He estimated that he had paid her hundreds of
thousands dollars. Even more disturbing, he admitted that things were
only getting worse.

I could go on and on, but any of us can name our own examples of weird
or dysfunctional therapists who can barely get along in their own lives,
much less help anyone else. This might be our profession's dirtiest,
darkest secret: There are those among us who are severely disabled, if
not predators who exploit others' vulnerability.

Our profession attracts the psychologically maimed and wounded for the
best of reasons. Some of us were abused, neglected, or damaged as
children. Others among us suffer from depression, anxiety, addictions,
and other emotional struggles that led us to seek help and, perhaps
ultimately, led us to seek training in therapy as a way to make the most
from our experiences. Such painful trials and tribulations have had
meaning and value in our lives to the extent that the lessons learned
provided authenticity and greater empathy toward our clients who suffer
in similar ways. Rather than disqualifying us, having been wounded can
provide us with special understanding and compassion for others---*if*
we are aware of these issues and work on them in supervision and our own
therapy.

Maybe it is because we are so used to multiple views of what is normal
or impaired that leads us to be hesitant about confronting colleagues
who appear out of control. Although we are ethically mandated to
confront (and report) colleagues who are dysfunctional, this rarely
happens. In bringing up these uncomfortable and negative aspects of
being a []{#17_chapter10.xhtml_page_208}therapist, my intention is not
to air our dirty laundry but rather to make it far easier for us to talk
about these issues with one another in more honest and constructive
ways. As the next chapter elaborates further, it is the lies we
tell---to ourselves and others---that eat away at our integrity and
congruence.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml}

## []{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_209}[Chapter 11](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0013) {#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11 .ch_title1}

![image](img/chaa.jpg)

## [Lies We Tell Ourselves---And Others](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0013) {.ch_title2}

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-div1-90}Some of the
negative personal consequences of being a therapist derive less from the
pressure of clients, supervisors, and work schedules than they do from
some form of self-deceit. We thus continue the discussion of some rather
taboo and uncomfortable topics that may sully our image of maintaining
the highest standards of honesty and truth.

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-020.jpg)

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_210}Most of these forms of self-deception
are harmless little fictionalizations that we are slightly aware of but
choose to ignore. Others are buried deeper, beyond our consciousness,
embedded within our system of denial, rationalizations, and distortions.
"We flatter ourselves, and each other," one therapist remarked rather
strongly, "we exaggerate, bluff, falsify, conceal, disassemble,
hoodwink, over-simplify, bury our heads and avert our gaze with such
skill and speed that we hardly notice" ([Marar,
2008](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-212){#18_chapter11.xhtml_n0307},
p. 3). Therapists may lie most often to protect not only others from
getting hurt, but also ourselves with inaccurate or skewed case notes,
carefully edited case presentations, covering up our mistakes, and
exaggerating our outcomes. Therapists, like everyone else, also lie to
ourselves and others about our abilities considering that something like
90% of practitioners believe they are better than their peers, which is
also similar to the number of drivers who think they are superior to
others on the road.

There are itty-bitty lies and those that are much more insidious. There
are lies that are so obviously untruthful that we do not really consider
them designed to dupe anyone. There are lies all around us---in the
charters and policies and procedure manuals of our facilities, in the
minutes of the board meetings and public advisory meetings, in the
purposes of an organization: not only to help people or make the world a
better place but also to make money, to provide tax write-offs, to pay
off political favors, to keep a few people's egos or bellies well fed,
or to satisfy some bureaucratic imperative.

We live especially with the lies that our clients bring to us every day.
The really honest clients do not even pretend to disguise their
fabrications. And we humor them as well, lying when we pretend to
believe that they had a happy childhood, that therapy is such fun, or
that the check they owe us is in the mail.

Nearly every initial session begins with a lie when the client says
things like, "I want some help," when he really means, "I want you to
fix me." If the client were really honest, the opening statement would
sound something like this:

::: prosequote
Look, I don't really want to be here. If you want to know the truth, I
don't really have a problem; everyone else does. They are the ones who
should be here, not me. So since you are asking me what I want from
these sessions, that's easy: what I want is for you to agree with me. If
that is not completely possible, then the next best thing is for you to
do whatever you do to fix me. But I don't want to have to do any of the
work. And most of all---absolutely no pain, please! I don't mind a
little polite conversation, but don't push me, don't argue with me, and
don't ever tell me that I'm wrong.
:::

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_211}After clients neglect to say out loud
what they really expect from us, then we respond in a similar deceptive
vein. After all, who would ever come back to see us a second time if we
told clients what we really think and what was really in store for them?

::: prosequote
I have no intention of doing what you want me to do. First of all, I
can't fix anything; only you can do that. Second, you are the problem.
I've only met you for 5 minutes, and already I have trouble liking you
because you blame everyone and everything for what's gone wrong in your
life but refuse to accept one shred of responsibility. Third, I don't
have a clue what is going on with you, nor do I know if I can really
help you at all.
:::

Because this opening would not go over very well, instead we tell
clients much of what they want to hear (in the first session, anyway).
We tell them that we're glad they came to us (a little lie because we
aren't so sure yet), that they definitely can profit from our work (a
bigger lie because we have no idea yet what is going on), and that we
think that they have a good understanding of their situation (a nice
compliment but a gross exaggeration). We lie when we tell them we
understand what they are going through (we really don't). We lie when we
invite clients to share their most shameful secrets and tell them we've
likely heard far worse (not necessarily).

We live with such frequent dishonesty from our clients' disclosures and
reports---some of them unconscious omissions, others deliberate
falsifications---that we sometimes forget the rough fit between a
childhood memory and its repetition years later after being squeezed
through the mind's protective sieve. This distinction between narrative
and historical truth totally debunks the myth of the client as unbiased
reporter and the therapist as unbiased listener. To support this idea,
[Spense
(1982)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-291){#18_chapter11.xhtml_n0308}
described the process of therapy in an interesting way: (a) the client
relates an unfinished story in completed form, creating meaning,
transitions, and reporting memories that are actually quite muddled; (b)
more of the historical truth is lost during the process of translating
images into words; and (c) finally, the therapist distorts the truth of
what actually occurred even more by supplying contextual assumptions to
fill in gaps. The whole basis on which therapy is built rests on very
distorted, deceptive, inaccurate, exaggerated, and subjective
information that may bear very little resemblance to whatever occurred
in the client's life. In addition, the whole historical foundation of
the profession was built on a lie---that repressed memories are real and
that we all want to have sex with our parents.

One of the most influential training films of all time, the *Gloria*
demonstration with Fritz Perls, Albert Ellis, and Carl Rogers, turned
out to be []{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_212}a huge lie. In one
investigation of the film's recording, [Rosenthal
(2011)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-270){#18_chapter11.xhtml_n0309}
interviewed the producer and participants, reviewed the transcripts, and
researched Gloria's own story of the experience. And what he discovered
was that Gloria was coerced and pressured by the producer, who was
actually her therapist, to say that Perls was the best therapist to help
her when that was not at all the case. In fact, she was fairly
traumatized by her interactions with the blunt-speaking Perls, who
called her a "phony" over and over as a way to provoke her.

Because it is difficult, if not impossible, ever to find out what really
happened in a client's life---given the lapses of memory, the limits of
language, the subjectivity of perceptions, and the influences of
culture---we become comfortable with a certain level of deception,
distortion, and half-truth. We settle for an approximation of truth, in
our clients and in ourselves. The result of this situation, coupled with
a mind trained to detect the intricacies of rationalization and
intellectualization, is a therapist who lives under the illusion of
truth and justice. But scratch us and we bleed. We are not all that we
appear to be.

### Games Therapists Play {#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-div1-91 .sec1}

We deliberately cultivate our aura of mystery and omnipotence, not to
deceive, but to increase our influencing power. No self-respecting
wizard or magician, or any professional for that matter, could expect to
be effective if she gave away the tricks of her trade. And we have a set
of special skills that we use to convince the Dorothys and Scarecrows in
the Land of Oz that we are indeed powerful wizards.

For example, clients are constantly amazed at how we seem to know
*exactly* when the hour is over, as if we had a special internal
mechanism to sense the subtle changes of time. After years of practice,
we are rarely caught glancing at the clock on the wall behind the
client's chair when they are temporarily distracted, especially since
the advent of smartwatches that provide discrete reminders.

We disguise our imperfections and lapses as well, believing quite
rightly that they would interfere with our image as powerful healers.
For example, we have developed an impressive array of options to
disguise yawns. As we do not wish the client to know that we may feel
bored or fatigued, we place the hand in front of the mouth in a pensive
pose. Strategically sipping coffee also works quite well, as does
pretending to glance in another direction.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_213}To counteract the temptation to yawn,
another subtle therapist skill is the ability to look attentive during
lapses into personal fantasy. We can keep head nods, furrowed brows, and
"uh-huhs" going at the same moment that we are fighting our own dragons.
Of course, sometimes we get caught, and the client may explicitly test
our powers of concentration with, "Do you know what I mean?" That is the
true test of the experienced clinician, which brings us to a whole new
category of maneuver: what to do when you did not hear what the client
just said. Even the most directive therapist will lapse back into his
best Rogerian response: "My opinion is really important to you." Another
excellent alternative goes something like this: "You've spoken at some
length about this issue. I wonder if you might summarize the essence of
what you think is most important?"

A knowing, mystical follow-up posture will often help us stall for time
until we can come up with a more acceptable response. To err may be
human, but it is not all that noble for therapists whose power may be
undermined by such lapses. A series of defensive ploys is often required
for slips when, for example, our interpretations miss the mark. We can
always backpedal and redefine the misjudgment as "only a working
hypothesis" or "a possible theory," but certainly the client will lose
confidence. One clever option is to reluctantly explain that the
interpretation was actually a paradoxical maneuver specifically designed
to elicit the reaction it did: "That's interesting that you reacted so
strongly to my observation. I wonder what that means?"

Two variations on this theme offer similar responses. Either when the
client does not understand something that we just said or when we do not
understand what the client said, we can act as though it's the client's
fault. A stony, quizzical face is quite effective in driving home the
point that in close calls the therapist gets the benefit of the doubt.
This implicit rule of thumb also allows us to sit silently when we don't
know what to say or do next. The client may feel the responsibility to
keep the ball rolling and say something emotional or intelligent.

Perhaps these strategies are necessary to increase the stature and
influencing capabilities of the therapist, but it is always at the
expense of the genuineness, humanness, and presence that are so crucial
in being with a client. People respond to us not only because of our
professional competence but also because of our uniquely personal aura.
The way we smile, frown, or laugh, the way our eyes twinkle, can teach
clients as much as the most sophisticated interventions. Similarly,
revealing our humanness, confusion, and ignorance can often be
interpreted by clients as permission for them to do the same in a more
open, honest relationship.

### []{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_214}Counterfeit Intelligence {#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-div1-92 .sec1}

Another self-deception is the most universal among therapist frauds.
There we sit among our diplomas, licenses, certifications, and
memorabilia acting as if we know exactly what we are doing. The
collection of books on the shelves and the wafting air of
professionalism attest to our expertise. The client comes in insecure
and off balance, a bit intimidated by this person who can allegedly read
minds and cure suffering. It takes the average client a few sessions
just to get his bearings, much less to decide whether this professional
who comes so highly recommended is really a lightweight.

I can quote chapter and verse of any masters I have studied. I know
exactly how to act like a therapist---that is, I have my penetrating
stares, monosyllabic grunts, charming smile, and wise demeanor down pat.
I know how to ask intelligent questions to keep the conversation
flowing, and every once in a while to say something fairly intelligent.
If pressed, I can even tell a persistent client what I think her problem
is and what she needs to do to make things better. Most of the time, if
she follows my direction, she will feel better (and---it is
hoped---behave more effectively). But the truth of the matter is that
throughout much of the encounter, I am actually quite confused,
uncertain, indecisive, and awkward. On the stage, or in the therapist's
chamber, the audience rarely discovers such lapses in performance.

A very prominent and successful psychoanalyst with 20 years in the field
admitted the following:

::: prosequote
I tell myself that because I've had so many years of experience, I can
handle whatever walks in the door. But I don't know if I will or I
won't. I lie to myself and to my patients to feel the confidence I need
to manage a professional practice. In truth, I am extremely anxious
every time I see a new patient. Will I understand him? Will I make an
asshole of myself? Will I make a serious error in judgment? Will I know
what to do? No. No. No. But I say to myself and to the client, "Of
*course* I can help you," even when I think I can't.
:::

Telling clients that we can definitely help them is certainly reassuring
even if it is not strictly true. Favorable expectations and placebo
responses are set up principally by the therapist's belief in herself
and the process. By communicating confidence, however false it might
feel, we try to instill hope and motivation in the client. We would lose
clients very quickly if after every bungled interpretation or
misjudgment, we muttered under our breath, but within earshot, "Yikes. I
blew that one." We would never []{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_215}get
clients to come back if we were completely honest with them in the first
sessions.

In other words, to get better, the client may need to believe in this
lie and the others we'll be examining. No physician in her right mind
would ever let her uncertainties slip out, not only because she needs to
protect herself from malpractice suits but also because people must have
faith in their healers. Just imagine if you overheard a physician say,
in the middle of a procedure on you, "Oops."

Without faith, there can be no magic. And that faith is just as
important in our own belief system considering that holding high
expectations for outcomes significantly increases the likelihood of
better results. That's the old placebo effect at work, affecting not
only the client's positive expectations but also our own.

Certain lies---to ourselves as well as to our clients---may therefore be
necessary, if not therapeutic. If lying to a client, deliberately or
unintentionally, is unethical because it promotes deception, perhaps it
is just as unethical to be completely truthful (whether it is in the
client's best interest or not) just so the therapist can feel pure.
Tactical deception, then, has its place in protecting clients from a
reality that they are not yet prepared to face or in the paradoxical
interventions that break stubborn destructive patterns that are
resistant to more conventional attacks. Although lies can be very
effective strategies, and quite useful in moving progress along, they
are not usually a first choice. No matter how we rationalize the
necessity of the lie, whether exaggerating our powers or our confidence,
a certain amount of caution, modesty, and uncertainty is very helpful in
keeping us from becoming too big for our britches. Just because we must
tell clients that we know we can help them does not mean we have to
believe it, too, but it sure helps.

Closely related to projecting a false sense of confidence is counterfeit
expertise. This occurs when we pretend to know or understand something
that is actually quite muddled. There are times we nod our head in
apparent agreement with what a client says and we actually have no idea
what was intended. We hide behind pregnant pauses, stalling, giving us
time to make up some response or answer to a question that is actually
beyond us. We might even turn the question back to the client in order
to hide our ignorance: "That's an excellent question! What do *you*
think?"

We are sometimes asked by a referral source or supervisor whether we can
handle a particular case and immediately respond, "Sure, no problem,"
and then run to the nearest sources to bone up on this issue. And how
often have you heard a client say after a week of reflection, "I finally
understood []{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_216}what you were doing last
session and what it meant," and had no idea what profound insight you
supposedly introduced?

The pretense of perfect confidence and intelligence may be for the
client's benefit, but it affects us as well. If we believed that we
really were as thoroughly competent and composed as the image we present
to clients, we would be insufferable. Yet if we were continuously honest
with ourselves regarding what we know, what we understand, and what we
can do, we would be so riddled with self-doubt that we could barely
function at all. The compromise position is to accept that we exaggerate
our capabilities at times and that such distortion is sometimes
necessary for the client's good, but that we should not for a minute
forget that we are just pretending. Milton Erickson was fond of saying
that if you can pretend very convincingly, then clients will pretend to
make changes in their lives. And when things go well, after a period of
time, they will forget they are pretending.

### Feeling Indispensable {#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-div1-93 .sec1}

Any time we act for reasons other than to promote the client's growth,
we dilute our honesty. This occurs occasionally, especially when we
become more familiar with a client we have known for a while. At the
same time we are taking care of clients, we try to take care of
ourselves as well. This happens sometimes at the invitation of the
client and sometimes by our own initiative.

Saying goodbye to a client is so bittersweet that many therapists
encounter difficulty in letting go. There is sometimes an actual
mourning process and sense of loss for a multitude of reasons when a
relationship ends. There is now a vacant hole in the schedule that will
likely be filled with someone less interesting and cooperative. It could
mean a loss of income. But mostly there is a genuine feeling of truly
missing the conversations that have grown to become so comfortable. The
client has learned his lessons well, accomplished his goals, obliterated
his suffering, and (it is hoped) weaned himself of dependency on the
therapist in the process. He now feels strong, confident, insightful,
and motivated to get on with the rest of his life. He also feels quite
grateful to his helper, sad, nervous, and ambivalent about ending this
relationship. Even when it is in the best interests of clients to leave
therapy, when a decision has been made to bring the relationship to a
close, the therapist may have some genuine concerns about relapse and
ongoing lack of support.

There are self-serving reasons for keeping clients in treatment for as
long as possible to maintain steady revenue flow for the agency, or
oneself []{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_217}It's also inconvenient to
replace a "good" client who knows the rules and does not demand very
much for her time or money.

We all know practitioners who keep their clients addicted to them for
years. They teach people to need them, to require a weekly or daily fix
just to function. Of course, some very disturbed people will need
therapy throughout their lifetimes just to keep themselves out of the
hospital. But in this case we are referring to those therapists who keep
clients long beyond the point where they are doing them any good. I
interviewed one such psychiatrist who had been seeing the same 20
clients two to four times per week for decades. His clients were so well
heeled (and he is so reluctant to lose income) that when he scheduled
his annual vacation to the Caribbean, he reserved the wing of a motel so
that his clients could join him and continue their treatment. It is his
opinion, and his clients readily agreed, that they just cannot function
for 2 weeks without their doctor.

To a lesser extent, any clinician in private practice struggles with the
issue of when to let clients go. It is easy to say that as long as they
keep coming to sessions, they must be getting something from the
experience. When I worked for a public agency, the longest I ever saw a
client was for 10 to 15 sessions. At the time, I thought I was doing
marvelous work. It can hardly have been a coincidence that when I moved
into full-time private practice, where my livelihood depended on my
ability to keep my schedule full, the average number of sessions I saw a
client jumped from about 10 to 30. I had, naturally, convinced myself
that this longer term approach was much better for the client; it was
more intense, more comprehensive, more elegant, more satisfying, more
effective, and, yes, more costly.

Even during these times of managed care, when brief therapy and
telehealth options are increasingly popular, practitioners make
different treatment decisions depending on their setting. If you are
working for a public agency or school with hundreds in your caseload,
your clinical decisions are likely to be different from those made by
your colleagues who earn a living from private income and have open
spaces in their schedules.

One psychologist in private practice who is driven toward a goal of
financial independence, and yet is also very dedicated to helping
people, admits with great discomfort, "I lie when I tell myself I can
see 13 clients in a day and not lose my effectiveness. I hypnotize
myself into believing that so I can continue with this ferocious
schedule I call my life. Especially, I lie whenever I say that I am not
doing this kind of work to make a lot of money. Because I am." This is
certainly part of what motivates many therapists in private
practice---not only to enjoy freedom but also to accumulate wealth and
financial security. And this attitude affects the pace and style of what
therapists do.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_218}Many things can be said about
therapists---that we are knowledgeable, dedicated, and
compassionate---but we have not been described as swift in our methods,
at least historically. Even with the popularity of brief therapies and
manualized treatments, we take our sweet time in getting to the heart of
the matter, embellish our insights with poetry and stories, following a
sometimes tortuous route to a client's underlying fears. We lie to
clients, and ourselves, when we tell them we will rid them of their
symptoms just as fast as we can. Even a first-year intern knows that if
you take away the client's presenting complaints too quickly, he will
not stick around for the best part of the show.

### Absolutes {#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-div1-94 .sec1}

A psychology professor revealed, "It's difficult to admit I lie. I can't
really think of any . . . well, maybe there's one. I tell my students to
have faith in the human capacity for healing. I talk about it as an
absolute, but it isn't really. There are a lot of people I don't trust
or who can't take care of themselves. Their instincts are all wrong."

There is a tremendous difference between our theories and our actual
behavior. To the public, to clients, and to colleagues, we disclose our
neat, coherent little model of why things work the way they do. Most
practitioners, with little prodding, can articulate fairly detailed
theories about human development, psychopathology, personality
development, and psychotherapy. Together with these models of
understanding, we also ascribe to specific systems of logic, morality,
and epistemology. Finally, we bestow ourselves with titles to summarize
the conceptual frameworks to which we owe allegiance, and therein hides
the lie.

If the truth were told, clinicians do not always apply their orthodox
theories in their sessions---and for good reasons. Once a person, *any*
person, applies a method devised by someone else, it becomes a different
entity altogether. Each therapist is simply too unique---with her
distinct values, personality, demeanor, and voice---ever to practice
therapy the same way another does. Moreover, the interactions with
clients force us to think on our feet, instantaneously, instinctually,
no matter what training we received. If we were to stop and think, to
reflect on our theories, we would interfere with the smooth flow of
action, as well as paralyze ourselves with complexity. In other words,
we do not really function exactly as we say we do or even as we think we
do.

In spite of our labels as social worker, psychologist, counselor, family
therapist, or psychiatrist, in spite of our identification with
particular []{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_219}theories, we act in
accordance with client needs and our own intuition at the time. Most of
the absolutes and rules that we say we follow are used only when
appropriate or convenient. The most nondirective of practitioners
occasionally gives advice. The most orthodox analyst reveals a
distinctly human character. The most rigid cognitive therapist will also
help people to express and honor their feelings. The most passionate
narrative therapist may still look at factors other than the dominant
story and unique outcomes. And then there are the absolute imperatives
of the profession that we all ignore at one time or another:

::: prosequote
[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-item1-199}[•]{.enumerator}*Don't
give advice.* We do it all the time when a client is about to do
something we feel would be incredibly stupid or self-destructive.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-item1-200}[•]{.enumerator}*Don't
answer direct questions.* But we do answer them when we get tired of
playing games or when we know the answer and are dying to tell someone.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-item1-201}[•]{.enumerator}*Don't
talk about yourself.* Although this injunction may be desirable, it is
idealistic and ultimately impossible.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-item1-202}[•]{.enumerator}*Trust
the clients' capacity for healing.* If they had sound judgment
concerning what is best for them, they would hardly end up in therapy.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-item1-203}[•]{.enumerator}*Don't
get involved in your clients' lives.* This is possible only if you sleep
through the sessions.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-item1-204}[•]{.enumerator}*You
have to like your clients in order to help them.* Some of them are
genuinely unlikable.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-item1-205}[•]{.enumerator}*Refer
those clients who are beyond your specialties and expertise.* If we did
this, we would grow very little and have very few clients left.
:::

For each of these absolutes, there are always exceptions. For many of
the rules, accepted standards of practice, or ethical codes, there are
times when we must make our own decisions in the best interest of our
clients and their welfare.

### Myth of Neutrality {#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-div1-95 .sec1}

One of the foundations of our work is that we are professionals and
experts who, like judges or arbitrators, purport to be objective,
detached, free of biases and prejudices, and morally neutral.
Generations of therapists and clients have been deluded into believing
the myth of neutrality in helping---that it is not only desirable but
also possible to attain. We are cautioned to guard against exposing our
true feelings, prejudices, convictions, and values so that we do not
impose our personal beliefs on others.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_220}Whereas those in the clergy and pastoral
counseling make no pretense of disguising their moral agenda, secular
practitioners also have strong values of their own. It may be to adopt a
particular lifestyle, a way of thinking or feeling, a political
orientation, or a preference toward particular ideas. But essentially,
we want to sell our values of health, honesty, emotional fitness,
autonomy, independence, and social justice. These are considered "good"
values, so they are exempted from the neutrality gag order. But "bad"
values, such as dependence, should not be communicated, even if we may
sometimes wonder if there is anything so terribly wrong with two people
contentedly stuck in a fused, parasitic marriage. There is room for much
philosophical debate here---and that is exactly the point. As therapists
feel differently about love, marriage, commitment, sexuality, and
relationships, so they will work differently in their sessions. Some
clients really do understand this phenomenon, so they ignore our lies.

::: prosequote
The phone rings.

"Do you do marriage counseling?"

"Yes, I do."

"Are you for or against marriage?"

"That depends on the marriage."

"Let me put it differently. Do most of your couples stay together or get
a divorce?"
:::

Some perceptive clients are right on target with their queries. There
are indeed therapists who stress commitment over divorce, abstinence
over sexual exploration, sexual affairs over boredom, religion over
education, travel over gardening, exercise over television, tea over
coffee, or brown rice over donuts. We are hardly neutral, even if we try
to keep our opinions to ourselves. We have opinions about almost
everything a client says or does: Should I quit my job or stick it out?
What do you think of my online dating profile? Don't you think my mother
is being unreasonable? This isn't really my fault, don't you agree? What
do you think about my new haircut? And in the midst of our posture of
supposed acceptance, unconditional positive regard, and neutrality, we
are sometimes thinking to ourselves, *I wish you wouldn't*.

In spite of the myth, therapists are hardly value free, objective, or
neutral and are, in fact, moral agents for their own beliefs. As human
beings and members of society, therapists hold strong opinions about the
nature of freedom, independence, responsibility, and productivity.
Furthermore, there are many practitioners who believe that part of our
role is to advocate on behalf of certain beliefs that are deemed
desirable for the greater good.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_221}A case could even be made that we ought
to be more forceful with our values and less morally neutral, or at
least do away with much of the pretense. If a suicidal client enters our
office, we will do our best to convince him to develop our respect for
life. Should a client who lives by her wits, a gambler, a risk-taker, or
a reckless sensation seeker wish our counsel, she will probably get a
lecture on living more responsibly. We recommend the books that are most
consistent with our life philosophy. In our hearts, we believe that what
is good for us is good for everyone. Therapists who enjoy traveling urge
their clients to travel more. Those who find peace running on a country
road or worshipping in a church would probably prefer to have their
clients do the same. If we choose not to impart any particular values,
then we will push the big ones: that values are a good thing or that
therapy is a marvelous experience.

If we do project our values during our work, what are the personal
consequences for clients and therapists? We must shoulder the burden not
only of relying on our clinical judgment and professional skills but
also of knowing that clients will adopt many of our most personal
beliefs. Are we really certain that the way we are living our lives
would be all that great for the rest of the world? We can justifiably
worry whether it is in anyone's best interest to adopt the values of a
typical therapist. Some of our clients come in as just plain folks,
naïve and sheltered. They may leave enlightened, but at the expense of
their innocence.

### A Therapist's Personal Skills {#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-div1-96 .sec1}

The preceding sampling of absolutes that are not strictly followed
illustrates the discrepancy between what we say and what we do.
Historically this has been most commonplace in the disconnect between
our espoused allegiances to particular theoretical approaches versus
what we actually do behind closed doors or on screens, actions that are
far more eclectic and integrative than they might claim ([Finnerty &
McCleod,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-71){#18_chapter11.xhtml_n0310};
[Norcross & Goldfried,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-240){#18_chapter11.xhtml_n0311}).These
distortions may contribute further to the stress and confusion that
therapists experience, given that a lot of the time we are not actually
following our prescribed templates. Maybe this is our ultimate
hypocrisy: While we push clients to expand their potential, strive for
greater honesty, and improve their personal effectiveness, we sometimes
continue a life of complacency. During our sessions, we are
stars---energetic, capable, creative, and powerful. Then we pack up our
stuff and head out into the world, fraudulent heroes.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_222}There is often a major gap between the
self that our clients come to know and love and the self that we expose
to the rest of the world. We are taught to keep our distance from
clients during accidental social encounters---supposedly to protect them
from embarrassment because we have such an intimate knowledge of their
lives. But another reason for this distance is to shelter them from the
disappointment of finding out that we are really quite mortal. We feel
shy and inept. We are not nearly as witty and wise outside our realm.

We are nevertheless aware of the myth of personal competence that we
perpetuate. When a client complains of some self-defeating behavior or
another, we smile knowingly and think to ourselves if not say out loud,
"So how can you live with yourself, impaired as you are?" But how many
times do we ask a client to learn a skill that we have not yet mastered
or confront a problem that is still unresolved for us? One charismatic
therapist revealed his most painful lie involves the dissonance between
what he asks his clients to do and what he is able to do in his own
life. "In relationships, for example, I encourage people to be less
defensive in their communication and more empathetic with their spouse,
while I'm aware in my own life I don't deliver on that stuff at all." He
notes a gigantic schism between his personal and professional selves,
much preferring the latter over the former. "I struggle to integrate the
two parts of me. If I weren't a therapist, I would do just fine because
I would be less in touch with the ideal self I want to be. But I *am* a
therapist and I'm trying very hard to do be more like the way I am when
I'm in my office."

Another therapist talked about the hypocrisy of teaching others what she
hasn't been able to do very well in her own life. She recalled first
going into practice in her early 20s, newly divorced with a 3-year-old
child. "I wanted to launch my career by specializing in parent--child
issues, an area that seemed to elicit a lot of questions with few
professionals to answer them. I developed my own talk show on positive
parenting and managed to convince a local newspaper that it needed a
parent advice columnist, namely me. Oh hell! What did I know about
parenting?"

Her career exploded on the national scene, which resulted in a
reputation as one of the country's foremost experts on parenting. Then
she remarried, to a man with two school-age children, and again she was
confronted with the paradox of being an expert in an area in which she
couldn't apply the knowledge to her own life.

::: prosequote
Suddenly I had a family of three children. We were definitely not the
Brady bunch. My new family was an example of what *not* to do when
blending two families. My greatest success was keeping my family from
the public eye. I even []{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_223}hid my feelings
of failure from my best friends. I continued to practice my lucrative
and expanding profession even though I felt like a fraud and a
hypocrite. I saw numerous therapists over those child-raising years and
concluded, ultimately, that I was the kind of client to whom therapists
refer as a failure.
:::

She hoped that eventually her own clients would provide the answers she
had been seeking by revealing their own successes, but it was not to be.
To this day, the therapist is filled with shame about how inept she
feels as a parent, even though she teaches parenting skills to others.

One final example of this lack of congruence is evident when comparing
the focused attention we sell to our clients versus the typical ways we
interact with loved ones. Through body posture, eye contact, and other
attending behaviors, we communicate total interest in whatever a client
is saying. All of this is quite wonderful: The client feels appreciated
and understood in a way that does not take place anywhere else. But then
a few hours later, you sit at home talking to your best friend on the
phone while doing a crossword puzzle. Your mother calls and you
half-listen to her while you open the mail. Your children, roommate,
spouse, or partner vies for your attention while you sit in front of the
television or computer screen. You absentmindedly listen to your loved
ones, all the while texting or emailing someone else. The focused
interest that you are willing to sell to your clients you will not give
away to the people who matter most.

### Compassion---Toward Self and Others {#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-div1-97 .sec1}

No matter how bizarre or abusive a client becomes, we usually turn the
other cheek. With total concern and complete empathy, we crawl inside
someone else's sandals, boots, clogs, heels, wingtips, boots, or oxfords
and feel what he or she is feeling. Because we try so hard to understand
the pain that is going on, we are able to access a far more
compassionate and nondefensive response to the anguish. We can duck the
anger and stifle our own frustration in not striking back.

A student comes to me upset about the grade he received on his paper. He
is absolutely livid---something was activated in him by the grade or
perhaps by some comment I wrote on the document. He yells at me so
loudly that I visibly cringe. He calls me names and tells me I am
worthless, incompetent, and prejudiced against him. And I take it all. I
just listen as calmly as I can. I don't defend myself. I don't respond
except to nod my head, letting him know that I am listening. Suddenly,
he literally collapses into a chair and begins to sob.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_224}Throughout this interchange, I resisted
the urge to fight back, to enforce respect and stop the verbal abuse. I
did this because I understood immediately what was going on (which is
certainly not always the case). I recognized that his outburst was not
really about this paper or even about me. And because I am a therapist,
I was able to let things run their course before I attempted to work
through the issue constructively.

We all feel self-satisfied after such a charitable gesture with someone
we are helping. We demonstrate serenity, clarity, and self-discipline.
We resist the urge to become punitive or even to defend ourselves. Then
we get in the car to drive home. Someone cuts us off on the freeway,
someone with an ax to grind for who knows what reason. We scream
obscenities, make rude gestures, and tailgate the offender in
retribution.

The other part of compassion that we feel toward others is less often
directed toward ourselves. [Neff
(2015)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-235){#18_chapter11.xhtml_n0312}
pointed out that certain myths may make it difficult for us to give
ourselves the benefit of the doubt the way we would for clients. There
is a common belief that practicing such self-compassion is somehow
selfish or narcissistic or implies complacency, self-pity, or weakness.
On the contrary, she said, "When we care tenderly for ourselves in
response to suffering, our heart opens. Compassion engages our capacity
for love, wisdom, courage, and generosity" (p. 47). It is about being
kind to ourselves just as we are to so many others.

### Patience {#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-div1-98 .sec1}

For someone who can sit still in a chair hour after hour, a therapist
may have a hard time waiting in lines. Or perhaps I should own this one:
I can sit in a therapy group that I am leading and wait as long as it
takes for the other members to catch on to something that I picked up a
long time earlier. I can wait months, even years, for a client to find
the motivation it takes to make needed changes. I can sit in my chair
for hours, sometimes five sessions in a row without a break, and
maintain much of my focus and patience. Yet once I'm outside my office,
I am a lunatic when it comes to waiting in line. I become impatient in
slow traffic. I refuse to wait for a table at a restaurant for more than
10 minutes. I will not wait in line at a movie or concert. So what's up
with that?

Because we must wait so patiently during work, we may be reluctant to do
so on our own time. Of all the qualities we must develop, patience is
among the most difficult: waiting for people to move at their own pace,
waiting years sometimes before we can see a noticeable difference in a
client's behavior. Yet put this expert "waiter" in a room full of
people, and []{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_225}she will elbow her way to
the front, if not to the center of attention, then to the head of the
line.

One therapist struggled with the disconnection between the way he is in
his office versus in the rest of his life. "I used to practice
outwaiting a client during silences just to stay in shape. Now I think
my greatest strength as a therapist is to allow my patients to take the
time they need. My interpretations are usually subtle and understated. I
wait for clients to hear them when they are ready. . . . If not
\[shrugs\], we've got nothing but time."

The strange part of this to him is that people constantly tell him that
he makes them nervous because he is always in such a hurry, the
prototype Type A personality. "I have only one speed outside of my
office---blazing fast. On the phone I refuse to be on hold for more than
a minute. That's my rule. I'd rather hang up and do something else. I
got in a bad habit of checking my watch during sessions. I time myself
going everywhere. People think I am the most impatient person alive.
Only my patients know what I'm really like."

Well, it's unclear what any of us are "really" like when we are able to
split ourselves into two very different individuals, depending on
whether the meter is running or not. It is an interesting exercise
indeed to compare the ways we typically function when on the job versus
those times we are off duty.

### Taking Charge of Our Own Lives {#18_chapter11.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-11-div1-99 .sec1}

This may have been the chapter that was as uncomfortable for me to write
as it may have been for you to read. We have this wonderful opportunity
to apply what we do with others to our own lives---and to do this more
systematically and consistently. The lies that we tell ourselves are not
terrible self-deceptions but rather strategies that allow us to work in
a field that holds so many paradoxes and complexities.

The self-control of which therapists are capable is obvious. We ignore
grumbling stomachs, the urge to yawn, and little voices whining, "Me,
take care of *me*." We restrain our impulses to hug, shake, kiss, or
strike a client. We sit immobile for hours on end.

How then do we excuse our frequent lack of self-control at home or in
social situations? Gone is the willpower to refrain from overeating.
Gone is our ability to hold our temper. Gone is the resolve to stick
with a diet or an exercise regimen. Where is the self-control that was
so much in evidence just hours earlier? We plead exhaustion or a desire
to escape from control---time to relax in front of the television with a
bowl of ice cream.

[]{#18_chapter11.xhtml_page_226}There are many other things that we do
regularly while working that we don't (or won't) do on our own time. It
probably could not be any other way. The lie is not in our
inconsistency, not in our laziness and indulgences, but in perpetuating
the myth of our invulnerability. In many ways, it is helpful for clients
to hold on to this myth. It empowers our role as models. It keeps their
attention and stimulates hope. It inspires their confidence. But it also
is very confusing for the therapist, who must lead a double life,
disguising a secret identity.

During a lengthy interview for this book, one therapist was startled by
being asked about his lies and self-deceptions. After several minutes of
thought, he shrugged and said that he really could not think of any
self-deceptions that he was aware of. He is a very honest person, and
after years in treatment and supervision, he felt very clear and
self-aware. I turned off the recorder and began to pack up when I heard
him clear his throat and whisper: "Everything I've said to you is a lie.
It is so important to me to sound and look good that on some level I'm
always suspect. I try my hardest, and I still can't overcome my need to
say and do things other people will approve of. I'm especially an
impostor whenever I act like I know what I'm talking about. Even this is
a lie."

This confession is familiar to me. And I realize that I've been unduly
hard on members of my profession by implying that our transparency and
integrity are somehow suspect because we are not always completely
honest with ourselves and others. Of course we are something less than
infallible, imperfect beings who sometimes shade the truth a bit in
order to do our jobs and live with ourselves. Yet most of us are also
intensely driven and committed to our own growth, just as we are for our
own clients.

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_228}Among the skills and knowledge base
required for preparing therapists are the standard content areas,
coursework, and field experiences that introduce beginners to the
research, theory, and practices of the profession. Thus students are
expected to develop competencies in a variety of areas, including
diagnostic systems, models of treatment, cultural adaptations, and
research methodologies, as well as navigate the complex and confusing
assortment of contradictory ideas and catalogue of interventions.
Unfortunately, there is one critical subject that is often ignored even
though it may be absolutely essential for remaining clearheaded and
excited about the work. Other than suggesting that students should seek
therapy for themselves (if they have the time, resources, opportunity,
and inclination to do so) and assigning a supervisor for their clinical
work, beginners are often left on their own to figure out how to manage
all the stress and overwhelming pressures that accompany their studies,
as well as personal and professional development. It is rare that
instruction in self-care methods is included as part of the curriculum,
leaving beginners both surprised and unprepared to deal with the
inevitable stressors of the job, which may include interpersonal
disputes, funding uncertainty, scheduling burdens, a toxic work
environment, abusive or ungrateful clients, incompetent or negligent
supervision, faulty administration, or excessive paperwork and
documentation, to mention just a few of the challenges.

Some of the problem areas that therapists face are the predictable
result of prolonged practice; some are the result of self-deception and
self-destructiveness; still others are the inevitable side effects of
being a therapist. These are, of course, in addition to the normal
crises that every human encounters: the usual variety of personal
conflicts, insecurities, mood swings, restlessness, health crises,
financial pressures, family problems, indecision, and stagnation and the
fears of love, of death, and of life. But unlike the public at large,
therapists can sometimes be well versed in the techniques of avoiding
therapeutic experiences---whether these involve counseling ourselves or
getting help elsewhere. In the aftermath of the global pandemic, with
the accompanying political upheaval, there emerged for many of us a kind
of "moral stress" or "spiritual despair" in which some of our most
cherished values related to advocacy, social justice, and inequities had
been demeaned, if not altogether repudiated.

Those therapists who do make personal growth a major life priority may,
in fact, only go through the motions of addressing the issues. For
example, one of the most popular alternatives for therapists who seek
greater self-awareness and clarity used to be undergoing a form of
psychoanalysis that is part of their training. Unfortunately, by and
large, therapists sometimes []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_229}make
miserable clients. When it comes to changing our own behavior, we can be
highly skilled at pretense and acting.

Taking care of ourselves is really not optional, but rather a mandate by
our ethical codes. It is widely recognized that if we are not
functioning at an optimal level, it is highly unlikely that we can be
all that helpful to others. Whether or not therapists seek enlightenment
in the formal contexts of supervision, support groups, or psychotherapy,
most are engaged, although not necessarily successfully, in counseling
themselves. We just cannot talk to people all day long without hearing a
little bit of what we say. We cannot teach people to talk to themselves
differently without doing so ourselves.

### The Challenges and Futility of Self-Care {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div1-101 .sec1}

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-34}We might as
well begin this discussion with an honest confession: Self-care programs
don't work very well most of the time. They create an extra burden and
obligation during a time when most therapists already feel overwhelmed.
Attempts to jumpstart exercise, diet, grooming, or nurturing efforts
don't usually last very long. That's one reason why 80% of those who
hold gym or fitness memberships don't *ever* use the facilities even
though they continue to pay their dues. It's why people typically
declare the same New Year's resolution at least 10 times in a row even
though such commitments don't seem to last. The prognosis is also
compromised because people (including therapists) have the misguided
belief that if they get a massage, light scented candles, take a bath,
lose a few pounds, or go on vacation that this will somehow rectify all
the poor scheduling decisions, chronic stress, overwork, and burdens
that continue to accumulate. Typical of these types of articles that
appear in magazines and online every week is one that appeared,
appropriately, in a publication called *Real Simple*, which said all you
have to do for self-care and "to set you up for success" is blow
bubbles, upgrade your closet, bang a gong, clean out the refrigerator,
or adopt a puppy ([Newman,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-236){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0313}).
If only it was really that simple.

Of course such promises are hardly supported by much legitimate
evidence, and these superficial gestures are almost never sustained over
time ([Kottler,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-173){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0314}).
Nevertheless, self-care mobile apps alone are a \$50 billion industry,
with the average person spending 20% of their disposable income to deal
with their stress, anxiety, and personal problems. Imagine what will
happen once we have biometric sensors installed, combined with retinal
scans that can read internal states, continuously
[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_230}monitoring what is going on inside and
then prescribing remedies that can be delivered via telehealth. This
leads one to wonder whether this will put us all out of business once
people get a better taste of self-administered interventions.

Now that I've gotten that off my chest, we can drill down to some of the
realities that actually do predict consistent, regular, self-enhancing
habits that become internalized. After all, one of the most important
things we do for our clients is help them to make changes in their lives
that lead to fully functioning behavior; it only makes sense that we can
practice this in our own lives.

The self-care movement (and it has clearly become an obsession) has been
influenced, in part, by the whole self-help phenomenon that has taken
over book sales, blogs, and instructional videos. Given that 98% of all
American adults experiencing substance abuse or mental health disorders
never receive any treatment whatsoever, it is no wonder that easily
accessible, self-administered, supposedly quick cures are so prevalent
([Edwards-Stewart & Norcross,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-61){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0315}).
Whereas at one time many therapists viewed such self-help options as
nothing but quackery and quick-rich schemes (which they often are), even
undermining professional treatments, such adjuncts have now been
embraced as potentially useful to prevent relapses. The increased
popularity of support groups and 12-step groups (Alcoholics, Overeaters,
and Narcotics Anonymous) attest to the demand for alternatives.
Naturally, the quality and effectiveness of these options vary
tremendously. Their efficacy often depends on the ways these suggestions
or strategies are personalized and customized to best fit the individual
needs, style, and preferences.

If you review the reasons why clients, therapists, or anyone else for
that matter, might be inclined to state definitively that they need to
take better care of themselves because of collateral damage from their
professional lives, there are some common themes for why these
commitments are not honored.

#### Expect instant relief. {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-35 .sec2}

Drink a green smoothie. Go for a walk. Schedule a manicure. There has
been an overemphasis on specific techniques and strategies, not to
mention self-care products, that are alleged to make all the difference.
And of course they don't do much---for very long---especially when we
return to the same conditions and forces that continue outside of our
control. As in every other aspect of life, it's rare that any quick fix,
tool, or technique will make much of a significant difference, at least
one that has enduring impact.

#### []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_231}Unrealistic expectations and impossible goals {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-36 .sec2}

One of the first things we learned was how important it is to help
people to settle on objectives that are within reach---or at least just
out of reach. Discouragement and frustration often occur when we set
ourselves up for failure by asking ourselves (or others) to do things
for which they are not yet ready or prepared.

#### Self-care requires honest and thorough acknowledgment of difficulties {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-37 .sec2}

Just as we are sometimes not very accurate in our assessment of how well
things are working in our helping relationships, we are inclined to
shrug off our own annoying and unpleasant symptoms. We engage in wishful
thinking that things will improve of their own accord if just given
enough time. We tell ourselves to just be patient, even when it is clear
this is an excuse to avoid decisive action.

#### Self-care implies something is broken {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-38 .sec2}

Let's face it: Something probably *is* broken in the sense that the
current situation isn't working. But we are supposed to be experts,
high-functioning muses, who represent the ideal of personal
effectiveness. Understandably we may be reluctant to admit to others,
much less ourselves, that things feel out of control.

#### Deeper issues {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-39 .sec2}

There are often underlying problems at work that lead to, or exacerbate,
stress reactions. Self-care strategies may get at the most obvious,
annoying symptoms but do not address the chronic, entrenched patterns
that are making things so much more difficult. These could be
unacknowledged problems from the past (trauma, abuse, neglect); chronic
health difficulties; family problems; interpersonal conflicts;
personality features; addictions or substance abuse; or more nebulous
existential questions in which there is loss of personal meaning in work
and life.

#### []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_232}Ambivalence and mixed messages {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-40 .sec2}

In spite of protestations to the contrary, there may be some secondary
gains as a result of remaining stuck. It's comforting in some ways not
to feel responsible for one's misery, to blame others or one's
circumstances for the dissatisfaction. Just like our clients, we may
adopt a victim mentality or welcome the distractions so we don't have to
address other issues that may be even more disconcerting.

#### Systemic and contextual issues {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-41 .sec2}

More than anything else, it is the work environment that is both the
source and anecdote to stress reactions. Across the spectrum of work
settings, three of the most common complaints employees make are (a) too
many meetings that are a complete waste of time, (b) incompetent or
neglectful leadership and supervision, and (c) a toxic culture within
the organization ([Kottler,
2018b](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-171){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0316}).
Conflicts, backbiting, lack of resources and support, and feeling
undervalued all make things so much worse.

#### Limits of self-help {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-42 .sec2}

There's only so much we can do for ourselves without assistance,
support, and guidance from others, especially professionals. We might
not have any compunction to take our car in for service or call a
plumber when the toilet needs repair, but there is sometimes reluctance
and resistance to get the help we need when we can't take care of things
ourselves. In addition to the items mentioned, sometimes we are just so
flooded and overwhelmed by work responsibilities and life experiences
that it just seems futile to try simplistic ideas or token efforts to
put a dent in the misery.

As we are already quite familiar, by the time clients seek our services
for intractable, chronic problems, the damage has been pervasive and
long lasting, compounding the difficulties to change the dysfunctional
pattern. Therapists, along with everyone else, only seem to think about
taking better care of themselves *after* stress levels are no longer
sustainable. Just as we tell our clients, self-care efforts are far more
useful when they focus on prevention rather than restoration ([Rupert &
Dorociak,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-273){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0317}).
The goal is to build hardiness, resilience, and a stable platform from
which to repel perceived assaults on one's well-being and protect
against the insidious []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_233}erosion or morale
that can take place in toxic environments or as a result of conflicted,
adversarial encounters.

All of this is predicated on the therapist's willingness to acknowledge
there is some difficulty in the first place. Such self-awareness is
absolutely necessary even if it has been discovered that we are not
necessarily very honest and clear about operating on all cylinders.

### The Therapist's Developmental Changes {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div1-102 .sec1}

Just as our clients will progress through a series of developmental
stages throughout life, so will therapists experience a series of
predictable, sequential, and logical changes during professional
careers. Usually we move through stages so gradually that we hardly
notice we are in the throes of a developmental crisis---at least until
such time that symptoms become noticeable and annoying. At other times,
these changes can be sudden, the result of crises, losses, or other
life-transforming events.

Several critical incidents universally shape a therapist's development,
the most obvious of which include the varied reasons and motives that
explain why the practitioner entered the field in the first place. As
discussed previously, usually there is some discrepancy that exists
between the publicly espoused motives (some variation of the theme "to
save the world") and the private, perhaps unconscious reasons (some
variation of "to save myself"). We all have some hazy personal agenda
that we have been following since graduate school that responds to an
internal force that pushed us into helping others. That agenda may be to
simulate the rescuer role that was familiar to us in our families of
origin or to get therapy for ourselves without having to risk the
inconvenience and cost of seeing another professional. There are other
incentives that are often mentioned beyond altruism and the desire to
make a difference in the world, such as enjoying being a voyeur to
others' most private worlds, needing to rescue others to feel good about
oneself, or being a know-it-all who others admire and respect.

Many of us received much of our earliest "therapy training" growing up
in our own families, where we acted as go-betweens, conflict mediators,
and helpers. "We kept the peace when our parents argued; we took care of
family members who were sick; we helped other family members avoid
confronting their pain" (Anderson, 1987, p. 19). Although this
configuration does not apply to every member of our profession, the
scenario of being elected to the role of rescuer is a common one.

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_234}During apprenticeship, interns usually
undergo radical transformation, only a small part of which involves the
mastery of theories and skills; most of the changes involve a dramatic
shift in thinking and self-concept. The fledgling therapist is exposed
to both positive and negative models. It is hoped she will find
sanctuary under the wing of a mentor and find solace in the books that
speak to her. She will work hard to win the approval of her peers and
instructors and, in so doing, may create a dependence on external
control. For the rest of her life, she may fight against the bondage
created by years of working for grades and affirmation. No matter how
accomplished she becomes, she may yearn for the approval that she grew
addicted to in her youth. She may look to her clients to find out how
well she is doing or measure her success by her income or scheduled
bookings. But forever she may wrestle with the need for validation. This
is the gift from her instructors, who taught her to depend on their
grades, their evaluations, their commentary, and their approval to know
how well she was doing.

Coupled with the need for external validation are the many internal
changes a therapist undergoes. There is nothing like having your hair
turn gray, your stomach turn finicky, your sleep habits change, or your
memory become unreliable to facilitate a change in life philosophy,
values, and therapeutic style. Spending day after day helping others
deal with their failing health, decreased vitality, and developmental
crises ought to make therapists better prepared to deal with their own.
Yet in some ways it is worse because the clinician must live through
someone else's midlife crisis a thousand times. We repeatedly
experience, albeit vicariously, menopause and prostate problems. We live
through the empty nest syndrome, the launching of adolescents, and the
meddling of in-laws more times than we can count. By the time we must
face these same problems, we are already weary. We know what to expect
and still cannot find ways to prevent those common conflicts between
parents and children.

We confront the big issues: death, the fear of going crazy, death, and
death again. And always around the corner lies angst---nagging, tugging,
and tenaciously holding on. Angst is the dread that accompanies a life
devoted to enlightenment. Without some form of ongoing treatment and
self-care, it can infect the heart, mind, and spirit, leaving the victim
in a state of permanent disillusionment. Yet it is precisely this
opportunity to look death squarely in the face, over and over again,
that ultimately encourages us to face our own mortality, as well as to
live our lives more intensely and passionately.

We must counsel ourselves through those endless existential
confrontations that "civilians" can easily hide from but that therapists
must face on []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_235}a daily basis.
Self-supervision is an integral part of what we do and how we operate.
This is certainly no substitute for the necessary monitoring and
supervision from other experts who are far more knowledgeable and
experienced than we are, but one of the distinct advantages of our
training is that it allows us to apply what we do with clients to our
own lives; it is a key means by which we demonstrate self-care.

Self-supervision and self-monitoring take place in so many different
ways. Each and every day that we talk to clients about their
self-defeating behaviors, we cannot help but examine our own. Each
session that we conduct leaves our heads spinning with all the things we
might have done differently, all the things we resolve to change in the
future. Each time we write case notes, we can't help but reflect on our
clinical decisions and intervention choices, making adjustments in
strategy or direction. And far more than that, we must continually
monitor our personal biases and prejudices, our unresolved personal
issues that get in the way, and our clinical skills that we are working
to improve. Is supervision with a wise mentor critical in this endeavor?
Absolutely. Is personal therapy desirable to help us look at our own
stuff that might be getting in the way? Most certainly. But the act of
internalizing the guidance of all our previous mentors and supervisors
is what allows us to apply what we have learned to the daily,
minute-by-minute process that we experience---in both our work and our
lives.

### How Therapists Take Care of Themselves {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div1-103 .sec1}

Just as our clients prefer to exhaust all other means before spending
time, money, and inconvenience getting into therapy, many practitioners
choose other options as a first line of defense. In many ways, we are
ideally equipped for such self-care, given our training, which has been
designed to promote growth in others. This may take the form of
debriefing with a partner, colleague, or loved one each day; working
diligently in ongoing supervision and personal therapy; or using
physical exercise, mindfulness activities, or personal diversions to
instill a sense of balance and control. Some therapists rely on travel
as a way to energize themselves, or they take up a musical instrument,
gardening, surfing, or another way to maintain a sense of peace.

These kinds of options set the tone for what is possible in
self-nourishment, regardless of their form, for professional helpers.
There are many ways that therapists work to counteract angst and manage
the transformations that are part of the helping lifestyle. Talking to
ourselves []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_236}as we would to clients is the
most direct and effective cure. This self-administered therapy is
especially advantageous in those situations in which we may be
needlessly worrying about clients or having difficulty separating
ourselves from others. If we find, during odd moments of the day or
while tossing in bed, that we are unable to let go of our work, we may
initiate a self-dialogue such as the following: How am I helping my
clients by spending time worrying about their welfare? If I'm not
helping them, then what is this behavior doing for me? Inflating my
sense of importance? Using magical thinking to prevent tragedy by
anticipating it? Distracting myself from something in me?

Consistent with, but not restricted to, the tenets of cognitive or
narrative-based approaches are the ways that therapists talk to
themselves internally when they are upset, either as a form of
self-soothing or to challenge assumptions, beliefs, or thinking that are
less than optimal. On a broader scale, those confrontations,
interpretations, and challenges that produce the most dramatic impact on
a client's behavior will do the same for us. After all, we are experts
at talking people out of their suffering. We give pep talks that
motivate clients to overcome their fears. We convincingly challenge them
to let go of beliefs that are not helpful. We teach clients to talk to
themselves so that they can carry our voices with them wherever they may
go. At times when they balk or stutter, our words of encouragement come
back to them. We repeat our favorite strategies of self-talk so often
that they have become our personal prayers. During moments of stress or
difficulty, they return to haunt us. There is nothing as uncomfortable
for a therapist as catching himself feeling self-pity and hearing his
own words in his mind, echoing exactly what he would say to a client in
a similar situation.

It's through the testing of a particular intervention on ourselves that
we first discover its possible utility in a session. A therapist who is
gnashing her teeth in frustration over a difficult client notices that
she calms down considerably when she reminds herself, "This is what I'm
paid to do." Not only does this reminder help her calm down, but later,
with the same client, she is able to urge the use of this identical
strategy: "You get so angry at the customers for complaining about their
purchases, so instead you transfer your hostility to me. But what do you
expect to hear while working in public relations? Customers are expected
to yell at you. So every time you let their whining get to you, just
remember, their job is to complain; yours is to listen without feeling
defensive."

When we listen to our own interventions and apply them to ourselves
during self-dialogues, we demonstrate the true effectiveness of what we
teach. After having said these things to ourselves and noted the
results, we []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_237}have greater conviction in
what we say to clients. Again we note the interaction between the
personal and the professional in our life as a therapist. As we stumble
across some way of expressing a motivational or insightful idea during a
session, we rub our hands in glee, knowing that we can use it again and
again with other clients and especially with ourselves. And when we
encounter a particularly poetic expression during social conversations,
while watching a movie, or while walking in the woods, we smile inwardly
and store it away for later use.

No other professional in any field works so intimately with the process
of constructive thinking. As applied philosophers, we not only
understand the intricacies of logic, ethics, metaphysics, and
epistemology but also are readily able to employ their methodologies in
solving everyday problems. We teach people how to think more rationally,
to feel more appropriately, and to behave more constructively. We can
sort out the complexities of that chaos we call emotional disturbance.
We know how to simplify the salient issues, shelve the distractions, and
focus on the core issues. We are experts at ranking priorities in terms
of their pertinence to desired goals. We can juggle the different loose
ends while we determinedly push forward with a plan of action, then
return to any number of related themes that were left hanging.

We are not only masters of deductive and inductive reasoning, practical
philosophers who can cut through the gristle to the real meat of an
issue, but also scientists by training and inclination. We use empirical
methodologies to objectively evaluate the effects of any variable or
intervention. We test hypotheses in our sessions with precision. We
systematically collect the data that are pertinent to a particular case,
isolate the dependent strategies, and then, with flexibility and
stubbornness, try out any number of treatment variables while
scrutinizing their impact on the client, on ourselves, and on the flow
and movement of the sessions.

That we can integrate so many skills and diverse bodies of knowledge
into a coherent system of problem-solving is testimony to our potential
for an ideally healthful existence. As stated, the hard part is applying
all that we can do to help clients solve their problems to the
resolution of our own issues. Even with our defenses and subjectivity,
with the limitations involved in using oneself as an object of
self-study, we can certainly accomplish more than most of us presently
do.

A social worker felt stuck in his job and couldn't see a way out. He had
tried talking to a friend about his concerns, then tried therapy for a
while, but nothing much changed except that he'd been able to develop
even better excuses and rationalizations for avoiding changes that felt
frightening. "Sometimes I hate being a therapist for just that reason,"
he []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_238}admitted. "Why can't I be more
innocent and trusting---just let things happen instead of analyzing
everything?"

At one point the social worker just gave up, lost hope, and accepted
that he was a failure as his own client---or anyone else's for that
matter. But then a breakthrough came when he decided to just surrender
to his feelings. "I'd done that lots of times before with clients. When
they fight back or become defensive, I just let go. I tell them to keep
their misery if they like it so much; they're just not ready yet to
change. When I told a client that again for the fortieth time last
month, it occurred to me I could do that with myself, too. I did. And
that's how I ended up in my new job."

Just as this social worker applied what she does with her clients to her
own life, we always have that same option, one not ordinarily available
to those outside our profession. As we've covered before, we know things
that most people don't know. We understand things that most people don't
understand. We can do things that most people can't do. All of this
knowledge and these skills are augmented and empowered by our own
personal qualities related to resilience and the commitment to continue
learning and growing from adversity ([Hou & Skovholt,

### Strategies That Often Lead to Taking Better Care of Ourselves {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div1-104 .sec1}

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-43}There have
been several notable efforts to encourage therapists to take better care
of themselves, most of them stressing the importance of ongoing
supervision and personal therapy ([Callan et al.,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-34){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0319};

[Skovholt & Trotter-Mathison,
2016](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-288){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0324};
[Ziede & Norcross,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-335){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0325}).
As mentioned repeatedly and persistently, among all the possible things
that we could do to take care of ourselves there is probably nothing
more constructive and helpful than having a mentor, supervisor, or
therapist to continually challenge our thinking and encourage more
healthful behaviors to immunize against the barrage of stress that comes
with the job. It also helps to have someone else available to hold us
accountable.

The vast majority of therapists, approaching 90%, heartily agree that
entering therapy as a client on a cyclical basis is an excellent way to
take care of ourselves, as well as to refresh and revitalize our work
([Ziede & Norcross,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-335){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0326}).
This is especially critical for students, interns, and beginners,
regardless of the favored method chosen. In fact, it doesn't really seem
to matter much *what* people do---almost *any* effort can help to reduce
the stress associated with studies or work---as long as it is maintained
over []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_239}time. This is similar to what is
now recommended for a healthy exercise regimen: Forget the 10,000 steps
a day, or 30-minute workouts three times each week---*anything* that
anyone does is better than nothing at all!

#### Journal Keeping {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-44 .sec2}

A number of painfully introspective writers, including Anaïs Nin, John
Steinbeck, Thomas Wolfe, Virginia Woolf, André Gide, and Albert Camus,
kept journals throughout their lives as a way to maintain their sanity
and clarity after pouring out so much of themselves in their work. Carl
Jung was the first to recognize the merits of the diary for a practicing
therapist. It was in his *Black Book* that he first developed his
theories, analyzed his dream and fantasies, recorded the events of his
life, and conducted imaginary dialogues with his unconscious. [Rainer
(1978)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-260){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0327}
found Jung's example inspirational, particularly when merged with the
creative self-therapy approach of Anaïs Nin, who devoted her life to
exploring psychological themes as a woman, a therapist, and a writer.
Other well-known therapists, such as Carl Rogers, kept journals
throughout their lives, providing us with a window to peer into their
most private struggles.

Writing letters or messages to colleagues and friends has also been a
form of self-therapy and catharsis for therapists who are struggling
with new ideas and insights or with personal pain. Freud began his
5-year correspondence with his best friend, Wilhelm Fleiss, to explore
his burgeoning theories and to promote his self-analysis. He did the
same with trusted colleagues such as Jung, until conflict between them
became untenable. These early pioneers quickly discovered that in the
role of confidant to others, they must create a structure for the
therapist to become a confidant to himself. Systematic journal writing
serves just that function in several different ways, as a means to
supervise ourselves through difficulties with particular cases and
explore the dynamics of feeling stuck. This is another kind of
self-reflection and analysis first advocated by Freud in his attempt to
make sense of his most disturbing feelings:

"My own analysis is going on, and it remains my chief interest.
Everything is still dark, including even the nature of the problems, but
at the same time I have a reassuring feeling that one only has to put
one's hand in one's own store-cupboard to be able to extract---in its
own good time---what one needs" (Freud, 1897/1954, p. 227).

Extracting what one needs becomes a much simpler task if there is some
repository where thoughts and feelings are stored. The journal becomes a
place to pour out your heart. It is the place for exploring hidden
motives, []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_240}unconscious desires, and
unresolved struggles. It is the place for catharsis and free
association, where dreams are expressed and analyzed, where the
structure and patterns of life become more evident.

In addition, writing in a journal, correspondence, or blog is a great
vehicle for developing and recording important ideas for theory
development, research, or personal insights. All practitioners are also
theoreticians. We harbor our own unique notions about how the world
works and how therapy ought to be conducted. No matter what school of
thought we align ourselves with, we have our own individual ideas about
how best to work. The journal is the best place to articulate these
ideas, to formulate our theories, and to grow as thinking beings. It is
also a place to keep a record of the most significant events and
experiences of our lives. These are the milestones of our lives, the
times we suffered or triumphed, the periods of growth and failure, and
the critical incidents that have shaped what we have become.

#### Physical Exercise {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-45 .sec2}

Therapists do their work in a chair, using their intellect and voice.
While the mind remains active through its diagnostic and reasoning
chores, the body remains inert, wasting away in some places and growing
in others through neglect. Thus many of us find relief in physical
exercise.

That therapists have jumped on the exercise bandwagon is not surprising.
We who understand that total wellness requires the interaction of mind
and body, who observe at close range how a sick brain can destroy a
healthy body, and how failing health can sap one's will, feel committed
to the nourishment of our total being. Whether the activity is intended
primarily for aerobic conditioning, aesthetics, entertainment,
rehabilitation, or distraction, a regular exercise program serves a
therapist's needs. The reasons for beginning such a program can be as
varied as those for the population at large: to control weight, improve
sleep, increase self-esteem, reduce stress, increase self-discipline,
and prolong life. But we have other reasons to exercise: to engage in
something nonverbal and to give ourselves silent time in an enlightened
state---time for processing the day, for calming down, and for beginning
or ending a day of confronting other people's troubles.

But then you've heard all this so many times before---the siren call
urging anyone, everyone, to take care of their bodies through movement.
Humans were never designed to sit in chairs. Our bodies evolved in such
a way to make us the ultimate endurance athletes. After global climate
changes and []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_241}food shortages, our
ancestors left the forest to hunt on two legs. We don't have sharp teeth
or claws. We can't run very fast. We aren't particularly strong. But we
can outrun over distance any other creature that inhabits the planet. In
fact, after we lost our fur we were able to control our respiration and
sweat glands in such a way that we could outrun any prey over far
distances, literally running them to death.

When we compare contemporary lifestyles to those of the past we can
readily see that our relative lack of movement and exercise, coupled
with a diet of processed foods, has taken a terrible toll on our health,
leading to an assortment of diseases that had never existed previously.
Once we gave up the lifestyle of hunter-gatherers and invented
agriculture, we not only enjoyed greater convenience and easier access
to food sources but also faced the unintended consequences. It has been
our close contact with domestic animals that has led to contagious
diseases and pandemics, including typhus, diphtheria, influenza,
leprosy, tuberculosis, the black plague, and more recently COVID. The
dramatic changes in our overprocessed diets led to other diseases that
had never existed before, such as allergies, obesity, and diabetes. And
the amount of time we spend sitting in chairs, attending meetings,
watching shows or movies, conducting business, and reading books like
this has resulted in chronic back pain and other structural
difficulties. There is only one remedy for this: to use our bodies as
they were designed.

"When I ride my bike," one therapist said, "the wind washes me clean.
Everything I have soaked in during the previous days, all the complaints
and pain and pressure, oozes out through my pores. I feel only the pain
in my legs and lungs as I climb a hill, pumping furiously. Then I coast
down as fast as I can, never knowing what is around the next turn."

"It feels to him like, at least for a few hours, he is no longer"

::: prosequote
a receptacle for other people to dump their suffering in. Nobody catches
me on my bike. There is no time to think, or I will miss a pothole in
the road. And it takes too much concentration watching for traffic,
pacing myself, switching gears, working on technique, saving my
strength, and breathing slowly for me to consider anything outside my
body. After a ride through the country, I feel ready again to face my
clients, my past, and my uncertain future.
:::

Just as we urge our clients to diversify their lives so they have
multiple sources of renewal, therapists need a variety of means to
recover from the demands of the job that don't rely on the same modes of
experience and activate other internal processes related to the body
rather than just the mind. Whether participating in spin or yoga classes
or taking up running, []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_242}walking, hiking,
or cycling, the goal is so work off excess energy and better center
ourselves.

#### Group Support {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-46 .sec2}

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-022.jpg)

In addition to attempting some form of self-therapy to promote serenity
and enlightenment, a therapist can initiate a number of changes to make
life easier yet more stimulating. If group members impose certain rules
to severely curtail endless complaints or criticism (like that in many
teachers' lounges), informal groups can provide a special source of
energy. Many find group support to be a tremendous healing force in that
there is a sense of sharing and of community; the embracing of
relationships; and a universal, dynamic, and focused energy that
everyone may draw inside his or her being. This is, of course, in
addition to the usual transformational powers of a group in which the
forces of cohesion and intimacy play such a significant role in creating
a sense of community, belonging, and mutual identification. Most feel
that certain key elements should be part of such a transformational
group: several multidimensionally enlightened people; a
[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_243}setting that is conducive to an inspired
process; commitment on the part of participants to release old patterns,
to trust, and to be together; the infusion of love; and grace.

Such support groups, in some shape or form, spring up spontaneously in
organizations. A room, a tree, or a bench may be designated as an
informal gathering place where clinicians can meet during breaks or
between sessions. This sanctuary is a place to get a back rub or to talk
about cases. It is a safe place to unload and release the negative
energy that has accumulated during previous sessions. Therapists who
work in isolation often organize a weekly meeting of minds and hearts
outside their offices. With the advent of "zoom" meetings and other
virtual formats, it has never been easier to organize groups of
long-lost friends, family members who live at a distance, or cherished
colleagues who live anywhere in the world.

We all need a place where we can go to cleanse ourselves, talk through
our concerns, and tune up our mental and emotional functioning. I tell
my students and supervisees all the time that they are not the only ones
in training---so too are their families. And unless we are all prepared
to keep our families informed about our struggles, to keep them part of
our journey of being a therapist, they will be left behind.

#### Adventure and Escape {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-47 .sec2}

One form of renewal that many practitioners prefer involves vicarious or
actual adventure. Camping out in front of the television for an evening,
or losing oneself in a 2-hour movie, is a wonderful way to turn off
one's brain, sit passively, and allow other people to provide the
entertainment. Escape fiction is an even better option because books
take longer to get through, and the "treatment" can be self-administered
as needed. I would expect that fiction writers have rescued more than a
few therapists from boredom or despair.

A similar phenomenon exists for practitioners who favor films that
illuminate our professional work. This include not only those TV shows
or movies that have therapists as main characters but also those that
resonate with the main themes of our work or those that transport us as
far as possible from these same issues. There is, of course, a direct
application to the kinds of movies we might prescribe to our clients for
similar purposes, to look at issues that are most salient in their
lives.

Many therapists enjoy more active forms of adventure and escape in
travel. Away from our office, home, clients, and colleagues, we regain a
perspective on what is important. Eventually, there comes a time when we
[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_244}grow tired of living out of a suitcase
and feel ready, if not eager, to return to that which we call work. In
the meantime, certain forms of transformative travel have elements
similar to those of good therapy and may have more lasting effects
([Kottler,
1997](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-161){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0328};
[Kottler & Marriner,
2009](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-189){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0329};
[Schaler,
2009](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-274){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0330};
[Wilson & Harris,
2006](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-323){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0331}).
It is during trips to new places that we break loose from our usual
routines, challenge ourselves to explore new opportunities, or get our
needs met in alternative ways. We enter heightened states of
consciousness, our senses more attuned to our surroundings. We face our
fears and learn to become more resilient and adaptable when we encounter
strange or novel experiences. There is something about being on the
road, away from the comforts and conveniences of home, that stimulates
us in ways that nothing else can touch.

Exploring these themes much of my life, I have begun to rethink ways to
revitalize the lives and careers of therapists and other helping
professionals by assisting them in planning and implementing
transformative travels. For a couple of decades I have been taking
groups of therapists, students, and volunteers to remote villages in
Nepal, where we provide scholarships for lower caste at-risk girls, to
refugee camps in the Middle East, or to homeless shelters in urban
areas. Whereas the stated goal is to advocate on behalf of marginalized
children and families, it never ceases to amaze me how the lives of the
team members are transformed by the experience in ways that are truly
remarkable. Some therapists return prepared to make major shifts in
their work, their lifestyles, their relationships, and the ways they
think about themselves and the world. These journeys have had such a
profound impact on me that I've reconceptualized the very foundation of
what I do as a change agent, applying concepts from what we do in
therapy to a different arena altogether.

It's interesting that one of the things that many of us have discovered
about therapeutic travel experiences is that they tend to exert the most
power and influence precisely when things go wrong or when you are
required to deal with new challenges that had previously been beyond
your capability. These are the times when growth and learning most often
occur, especially if the experiences are structured in a way that is
consistent with how we think about our work in more conventional
settings. This means specifically encouraging ourselves (or our clients)
to get *way* outside our comfort zones and visit places that will most
likely test us in new ways. It means trying to "go native" as much as
possible, meaning adapting to local customs and fully immersing yourself
in this novel world, all the while suspending the usual critical
judgments when things are different and unfamiliar.

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_245}One of the outcomes frequently reported
by therapists who undertake transformative journeys is that they make
new decisions about how they want to spend their time on their return.
It often takes getting away from our normal environment and influences
for us to sort out what is most meaningful and important. One common
realization is the importance of setting limits that we have not
introduced or enforced previously.

#### Setting Limits {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div2-48 .sec2}

Thus far, many of the options presented involve a commitment to do
something on an ongoing basis---another obligation of sorts---whether
that involves exercising, investing in relationships, self-talk, taking
breaks, or anything else. Yet for those who are overstimulated and
overwhelmed, the key is to set clear boundaries about what you are
willing and unwilling to do. This begins with knowing what your limits
are in the first place and making sure to stick within them. There are
some therapists who can comfortably see 15 clients a week and others who
can see double or triple that number without ill effects.

For those in private practice, it's always difficult to say no to any
new referral because of the fear that new clients might stop coming. For
those who work in the public sector, there is sometimes no choice
regarding workload. Nevertheless, it is important to do what we can to
create as much space as possible for recovery, reflection, and
revitalization. This means declining new referrals, new opportunities,
or new requests that are not a priority. It means reducing the number of
client contact hours and building in more breaks between sessions. It
means restricting availability to clients and colleagues after hours. It
could also mean cutting back expenditures and expenses so you have more
freedom to work fewer hours. It also helps considerably to set limits
with respect to your accessibility, turning off your mobile device at
times, choosing not to answer a message or call right away, and giving
yourself downtime with the usual distractions and disturbances.

The recurrent theme is modulating the amount of control in your personal
and professional lives. For those who have overly permeable boundaries,
this might mean shoring up the protective walls to allow time for more
self-care; for others whose boundaries are far too rigid, developing
flexibility might be the appropriate solution. Regardless of the desired
path, we have learned all too well that entrenched patterns are
difficult to change without a professional guide along the way.

### []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_246}Now What? {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div1-105 .sec1}

One key to any effective self-care program is to include multiple
options because of the different kinds of stress and adversity that are
most often encountered on the job (and in life). One reason why the
self-care commercial market is so flooded with products to sell us is
because they don't work very well, or at least for very long. It takes
determined effort and commitment, as well as a multidimensional program,
in order to make much of a sustained impact. This includes features that
address (a) internal chaos and disruption, (b) lifestyle choices that
either enhance or sabotage equanimity, (c) toxic influences within the
environment, (d) physical movement and stimulation, and (e) cognitive
monitoring and emotional regulation.

We are doing each of these things not only for our own health and
sanity, but also to demonstrate to our clients and supervisees that we
*live* what we endorse for others, practicing in our own lives what we
say is so important for others. Also, here are a few reminders of the
things we tell our clients when they undertake their own efforts to
institute self-care programs to stabilize their growth and personal
gains:

::: list1
[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-item1-206}[1.]{.enumerator}No
matter what you attempt to do within your own personal domain, there are
still the same dysfunctional, toxic influences and forces that may
undermine any commitments or progress.

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-item1-207}[2.]{.enumerator}Accept
the variables, factors, and individuals you can't change and do what you
can. Stop complaining and *do* something differently.

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-item1-208}[3.]{.enumerator}Insulate
yourself as much as possible from discouraging, negative influences.

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-item1-209}[4.]{.enumerator}Identify
just a few things you *know* you can stick with, no matter what: no
excuses, no apologies, no exceptions, no matter what!

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-item1-210}[5.]{.enumerator}Make
public commitments so you are held accountable. Recruit support to
sustain the effort.

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-item1-211}[6.]{.enumerator}Remember
that consistent repetition (an average of 60 times!) is required to make
changes stick and become habitual.

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-item1-212}[7.]{.enumerator}Plan
for relapses and rehearse how you will recover and continue efforts once
you inevitably "forget" to follow through.

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-item1-213}[8.]{.enumerator}When
all else fails, it's time to consider other options for yourself and
your future. You aren't stuck; it just feels that way.
:::

Of course all of these points are more than a little familiar to us
since we tell other people these things every day. Let's be realistic
about the prognosis for sustained self-care: It is dismal. Relapse and
neglect of []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_247}commitments are a certainty.
We make promises to ourselves all the time that we don't keep. Why
should this be any different?

Well, the answer is that your very ability to thrive as a therapist
depends on your willingness and ability to keep yourself fresh, engaged,
satisfied, and excited about your job, in spite of the challenges. And
if you truly want to thrive in the profession, to feel like you've hit
the jackpot in choosing this work, then you must maintain a way to keep
yourself on an even keel. Virtually all practitioners endorse the notion
that even with the burdens, stress, and annoyances that come with the
job, the rewards of helping others more than compensate---if we remind
ourselves to take pride in our achievements and forgive our lapses,
redoubling our efforts to move forward.

### When All Else Fails {#19_chapter12.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-12-div1-106 .sec1}

For any of us who specialize in treating other therapists with their
adjustments and challenges related to personal adversity, there are some
obvious challenges related to maintaining boundaries and clarifying
expectations for confusing roles. Therapist--clients would also be more
inclined to be critical, analytic, and challenging, wanting to pull the
curtain back to see what magic lies behind it. In some ways we are ideal
clients because of our degree of sophistication and the fact that we
speak the same language, whereas in other ways we can be quite resistant
and hard to pin down. Interestingly, the openness and willingness to
seek help for our own maladies is directly related to one's chosen
therapeutic approach. Not surprisingly, 90% of psychodynamic and
humanistic practitioners would readily enter therapy (and have already
done so), while only about half of behavior therapists would seek
consultation with a colleague for personal difficulties ([Norcross &
VandenBos,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-243){#19_chapter12.xhtml_n0332}).

One can only wonder about the number of practitioners who refuse to seek
therapy for themselves, even when they are struggling with something
they can't handle on their own. Several of those therapists interviewed
for this book declined to comment on their method of working through
their own problems. Just before abruptly terminating the interview, one
respondent exemplified the hostility and defensiveness that this issue
can arouse: "You ask me what I do when I encounter personal problems.
One thing I would *never* do is see another therapist. I might try to
work it through myself first and then talk to my wife, but I just
wouldn't go to anyone else. I just don't trust other professionals. And
even if I did, I've never had a reason to go."

[]{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_248}Although this response is hardly typical
of our profession, it occurred often enough to merit closer inspection.
We may not all be as rigid, threatened, and mistrustful as this
particular therapist, but some practitioners seem to believe that
therapy is for others rather than ourselves. No less than a dozen
therapists responded to the questions about their personal problems with
a simple, "I can't think of any."

At first, I wondered whether there might really be some among us who
have attained a state of nirvana, perfect specimens of emotional and
behavioral functioning who have transcended the problems of mortal
beings. More than likely, questions that ask therapists to look at their
vulnerabilities elicit the same kind of reactions as they would with our
clients. We deny that we have problems. Those that we grudgingly admit
to, we think we can handle ourselves. We become defensive and irritable;
we prefer our illusions of grandeur.

Because therapists both see behind the wizard's curtain and inhabit that
space, we can be particularly challenging clients in our own
psychotherapy. We have little tolerance for the usual practices that
might work with less sophisticated clients. There is a part of our
consciousness that is always observing the treatment methods critically,
naming the techniques, wondering about the choices made, and acting as
much as a spectator as a participant in the process. Furthermore, if we
really want to play games, there is nobody more skilled at doing so.

There was a time several years ago when I was quite unhappy with the
trajectory of my life and my career. I felt stuck and didn't know how to
extricate myself. Like most people, I first tried to handle things on my
own, offering the usual excuses that I didn't have time, couldn't afford
therapy, or could never find a professional who would meet my exacting
standards and see through my usual ploys.

Not content to consult with just one therapist, I was such a critical
consumer that I scheduled appointments with *three* different
practitioners in the same week. I was burned out with work and depressed
about my life situation; I felt trapped and helpless to do anything
about it. Like most prospective clients, I had already exhausted my
personal resources and most of the coping strategies mentioned in this
chapter. Nothing was working: I felt desperate and hopeless. After
getting in two serious car accidents within a short time, neither of
which seemed to be my fault, I was faced with the realization that I
*had* to get help.

The first therapist I consulted was a mean son of a gun---direct, blunt,
and, in my mind, heartless. It was just our first meeting, and yet he
was brutal in challenging and confronting me about some things he had
only just briefly heard. I left his office in tears, determined never to
return. []{#19_chapter12.xhtml_page_249}Fortunately, I had another
session scheduled a few days later, and this therapist was the exact
opposite---kind, warm, gentle, supportive, and annoyingly avoidant of
pushing me in any way. She totally agreed with me that the first
therapist had been out of line. It was clear to me she would agree with
almost anything I said, so I fired her as well.

If the first therapist was too cold and the second was too hot, then the
third was just right. Maybe it wasn't him at all, but rather my
willingness to do whatever it took to be a good client. I could hear
echoing in my mind all the admonishments of hypocrisy that have been
repeated throughout this book: What the heck was wrong with me that I
believed so passionately in my clients asking for help, when I was so
resistant to doing so myself? Or I would ask for help in a way that it
could never be acceptable to me.

There will be times in our lives when each of us will face challenges
that seem beyond our own capability. We shake our heads in befuddlement
when some clients express their extreme distaste and reluctance for what
we do, having been stubborn and unwilling to ask for help when they so
desperately needed it. Yet there is little doubt that our own reservoir
of energy is slowly depleted with every session, until such time that we
also need some replenishment.

In spite of the exaggerated and unsubstantiated claims, money-making
pyramid schemes, and overabundance of quackery, some form of self-care
is not only desirable but absolutely essential for therapists to
survive, much less flourish. There is so much empirical evidence to
support the most basic ideas of maintaining optimal weight, eating lots
of fresh fruits and vegetables, exercising regularly, and refraining
from smoking or excessive alcohol consumption not only to live a full
and healthy life, but also to reduce the premature risk of death by 75%.

Whether you find peace in a church, mosque, temple, or synagogue; a
theater, garden, sports arena, or on the road is beside the point. The
important thing is to do something for yourself so that you can take
things less personally, adjust your expectations to realistic levels,
break away as you need it, and talk to yourself as you do to your
clients. Most of all, by doing something for yourself, you demonstrate
that you take your own growth just as seriously as you do that of your
clients.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div1-107}The answer
is 17 years. What is the question?

That (17 years) is the average amount of time it usually takes for a new
health policy, medical procedure, medication, or other health practice
to become widely adopted after research is completed and first
disseminated ([Hanney et al.,
2015](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-115){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0333};
[Morris et al.,
2011](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-230){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0334}).
After infant incubators were first invented during the middle of the
nineteenth century, it took another 50 years before they were approved
for widespread use. Poor Ignaz Semmelweis, the physician who first
suggested that doctors wash their hands before beginning surgery to
prevent infection from suspected germs that had not yet been identified.
This eventually reduced mortality rates by 90%, but alas, the doctor was
involuntarily imprisoned in an insane asylum where he was repeatedly
beaten and died a few weeks later. There has been similar resistance by
the medical establishment to so many other innovations that took time to
become accepted---angioplasty, cancer immunotherapy, or recognizing
traumatic brain injuries in sports.

### The Evolution of Innovation---And Its Resistance {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div1-108 .sec1}

The Industrial Revolution, which propelled the rapid modernization of
human civilization, had three distinct phases, and we are currently in
[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_251}the midst of a fourth. The first such
cultural transformation took place during the eighteenth century when
manual labor began to be replaced by instruments, tools, and the
invention of the steam engine. The second revolution began with the use
of electricity to significantly increase the speed and scope of
production. The third was launched by the development of automation in
manufacturing. And now here we are on the cusp of another major
revolution launched by the proliferation of technology, to improve not
only efficiency and productivity in products, but also in the delivery
of services such as education and psychotherapy. With the advent of
three-dimensional (3D) printing, nanotechnology, quantum computing,
cloud computing, virtual reality, artificial intelligence (AI),
robotics, biological implants, and embedded sensors, the world is about
to become a very different place, even with the resistance to some of
these breakthroughs.

Just like our clients, we are sometimes resistant to change that
requires us to learn a bunch of new things or adapt our favored methods
to something entirely (or slightly) new. In many small ways we are
fairly familiar with this phenomenon, having adjusted over a relatively
short period of time from compact discs, minidiscs, DVDs, and Blu-ray to
cloud storage, with each requiring mastering new and different
protocols. And yet we also don't want to just blindly and naïvely leap
into the supposed "next best thing" without considering some of the
dangers, ethical restraints, and limited evidence thus far.

Within our own field, it isn't hard to imagine that it might take a
decade or longer before new technologies, breakthroughs, or innovative
procedures take hold. It seems to take even longer for mental health
professionals to abandon methods that have long since been discredited
as ineffective, if not dangerous, such as frontal lobotomies, cranial
drills, phrenology, tooth extractions, insulin shock therapy, and
hydrotherapy. So it is all the more remarkable that within a period of
*weeks* at the start of the global pandemic we were all required to
reinvent what we do and how we do it. There had already been not only
some experimentation and limited use of telehealth and distance delivery
systems prior to this crisis, but also many skeptics who were reluctant
to abandon face-to-face sessions because of all kinds of challenges.
Regardless of any reluctance or resistance, by the time of this writing
almost all clinicians and health personnel have at least experimented
with teletherapy, whether via phone, tablet, computer, or social
distancing outside.

Perhaps the most surprising thing of all is how much we have just
accepted that working via distance, virtually, or teletherapy is much
the same []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_252}as what we have already done in
our offices. It may indeed be equivalent---but it is hardly the same.

In surveys, it is pretty remarkable that over such a relatively brief
period of transition, two thirds of clinicians reported feeling
comfortable, confident, and satisfied with their teletherapy sessions.
Likewise, the majority of their clients say it was a "somewhat positive"
experience (Békés & Aafjes-van Doorn, 2020). Not surprisingly, most of
the complaints centered on feelings that this mode is more exhausting
and difficult to remain focused for prolonged periods of time staring at
a screen.

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-023-colour.jpg)

Whether therapists laud and broadcast the benefits of virtual types of
treatment or complain about its inherent limitations, depends, to a
certain extent, on their own attitudes and resistance to change and
adaptation. We know very well there are some clinicians who are always
exploring, searching, refining, developing their methods, and looking
for ways to improve what they are doing, while there are others who have
been operating essentially the same way for years, if not decades. There
are significant variables at play regarding the therapist's familiarity
and comfort with technology, as well as their particular style of
engagement with clients. Obviously, those therapists who specialize in
psychodrama and body work would have more difficulty adapting to
distance-based sessions than would those who follow a manualized,
structured set of cognitive behavioral therapy procedures.

There are all kinds of terms currently in use to describe alternative
therapeutic delivery systems, whether referred to as distance-based
therapy, telehealth, Internet therapy, online counseling, e-therapy,
zoom therapy, virtual therapy, mobile therapy, video therapy,
telepsychology, audio-video []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_253}synchronous
treatment, or distance therapy, among others. For the purposes of our
discussion, the generic term *teletherapy* is used.

### When Physical Distances Between People Bring Us Closer {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div1-109 .sec1}

Given the rapid pace of transformation that is currently taking place,
it is highly likely that much of what is described in this chapter will
very well become outdated or obsolete as dramatic advances continue
during the next few years. In fact, one of the major challenges we now
face is that "due to the speed of technological change; as soon as
findings are published, it is likely that they are already beginning to
show their age" ([Hanley,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-113){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0335},
p. 493). Thus far the training, technology, tools, research studies, and
strategies embedded in teletherapy are relatively primitive and
untested, coupled with considerable resistance by many practitioners who
have yet to embrace the new, relatively untested options. It is clear
that functioning remotely presents unique opportunities, as well as
limitations that must be addressed.

First and foremost to be mentioned are the ways that teletherapy, online
options, and remote delivery systems have absolutely expanded our
services to reach populations that have always been excluded or
neglected, whether on Native American reservations or among other
marginalized groups, such as the disabled. As discussed previously, the
vast majority of the world has historically had limited access to any
kind of mental health assistance whatsoever. This has especially been
the case for those who live in isolated or rural areas, those without
transportation options, and others who reside in the more than 60% of
the counties in the United States without a single psychiatrist or
trained professional.

In addition to the much greater convenience and accessibility, potential
clients have been able to eliminate travel expenses and time constraints
that made attention sessions in person unrealistic, if not impossible.
Some indigent clients may use unreliable public transportation, depend
on others for rides, or simply can't afford the expenses involved.
Teletherapy has not only made options so much easier and varied, but
also reduced costs. Once therapists have reduced their own expenses and
overhead, since they may no longer need an office with all the
accompanying support, they can also reduce their fees to make services
more affordable.

In addition to these obvious changes, therapists who are most
experienced and successful pivoting onto screens have reported dramatic
and powerful changes in the nature of their work, mostly for the better.
These []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_254}"true believers" have talked about
the unique nature of the relationships that have developed, how clients
are even more likely to open up about taboo topics that had previously
felt far more forbidden. There is something about the physical distance,
the images on screen, that seems to make it easier for some people to
talk about things that previously were inhibited by shame. They also
appreciate the literal "window" they have into clients' worlds, able to
view their personal spaces, meet some of their family members or
roommates, and get a sense of their home life. Likewise, clients have
reported their own appreciation for seeing at least a slice of the
therapist's own personal domain. In that sense, there are quite a number
of practitioners who have said they enjoy even closer connections and a
more solid alliance with many clients than when they worked face to
-face ([Chen et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-38){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0336}).

In a series of interviews with clinicians who have jumped into
teletherapy with great enthusiasm ([Gopnik,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-103){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0337}),
one psychologist commented, "It's utterly different and exactly the
same." *Of course* it feels different sitting in a favorite chair at
home, surrounded by all the usual comforts (and distractions). Another
therapist commented, "You're full frontal for 45 minutes. It adds
hysteria to an already hysterical situation."

Both clients, and their therapists, have mentioned other things they
prefer about teletherapy over the more traditional version:

::: prosequote
[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-214}[•]{.enumerator}It
is so much easier to attend sessions on a regular basis, without excuses
about traffic, parking problems, delays, and other life distractions;
almost anyone can commit to an hour if all they have to do is turn on
any device at hand. Even when people are sick or not feeling well, they
can still attend sessions if they are so inclined---all without
infecting anyone else.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-215}[•]{.enumerator}Clients
can choose therapeutic options from anywhere in the world, or at least
beyond their immediate local jurisdiction (depending on regulations and
laws).

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-216}[•]{.enumerator}Children
and younger clients adapt easily and quickly to technology and enjoy
playing with these tools that they often perceive as fun-to-play games.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-217}[•]{.enumerator}Therapists
appreciate the greater convenience in their own work lives, providing
many more options for scheduling and lifestyle, not to mention reducing
their own expenses. There is so much greater flexibility in what we do
and how we do it. There are also increased options for clients in
allowing them to determine when and how they will seek treatment,
whether in person or remotely. Obviously, some clients,
[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_255}disorders, and difficulties lend
themselves to teletherapy more than others. It sure is nice to have
different options on the menu.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-218}[•]{.enumerator}Therapists
can also offer their services to a much broader market far beyond their
own locale.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-219}[•]{.enumerator}It
is far easier to prevent relapses, engage in follow-up, and monitor
progress on a regular basis with new technological tools and teletherapy
options.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-220}[•]{.enumerator}Billing,
payments, appointment reminders, case notes, homework assignments, and

some ways, the privacy of clients is more secure when they don't have to
be seen in waiting rooms (much depends on space at home).

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-222}[•]{.enumerator}Clients
are more inclined to reach out for help much sooner than before because
it is so easy and convenient to contact someone by just opening a
device.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-223}[•]{.enumerator}In
all their various forms and structures, teletherapy is clearly more
efficient. Although it remains uncertain just how effective distance
treatments work in comparison to office sessions, it would appear that
we can see more clients and help them in a shorter period of time.
:::

The intrinsic informality of teletherapy opens up all kinds of new
rituals and procedures that were never possible before. Both clients and
therapists tend to dress more casually, jettisoning shoes (and pants!).
And what about snacks and beverages? We would never have considered such
things before the advent of these screens. We can relocate our settings
to a variety of different places, inside or outside, depending on mood
and privacy concerns, all of which could conceivably spice up and
redirect conversations into new directions.

A number of clients have wondered why, if teletherapy is so convenient
and wonderful, did it take a pandemic to get us to make the switch? One
reason for the previously slow adoption of the new technologies relates
to the same impediments that affect any other medical advance:
regulations and enforcement of regulations and bureacratic restraints.
Until the worldwide health crisis, teletherapy wasn't reimbursable by
Medicare and other insurance coverages. State licensing boards also
restricted treatments to only those within their local jurisdiction.
Once these federal, state, and local agencies relaxed their rigid
requirements, the whole idea of mental health treatment took on an
entirely new form.

Clients often say they enjoy a more satisfying and helpful relationship
online than they do in person, but this could actually reflect their
[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_256}appreciation for greater convenience and
accessibility. A representative example of testing this claim by
researchers investigated how teletherapy can best be adapted to treat
generalized anxiety disorder ([Watts et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-318){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0338}).
They found comparable levels of satisfaction compared to in-person
sessions, with clients saying they especially enjoyed the increased
sense of control they felt within their own preferred environment. The
clients liked the idea they could stand up any time they wished to make
a cup of tea or grab a snack, or even that they could just end the
session whenever they felt like it on their own terms. It may be lovely
that clients feel that way, but it isn't necessarily conducive to the
best treatment outcomes.

### Relationships in the Cloud {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div1-110 .sec1}

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div2-49}What we do
care about the most is the quality of the relational alliances that we
create and sustain, regardless of the particular style, format, and
structure. Just like any other aspect of what we do, the potential value
of teletherapy depends on the *client's* perceived strength of the
relationship. Any of the work we do must be embedded in a relationship
built on trust, respect, integrity, honesty, warmth, and all the other
usual suspects that are considered "common factors," combined with
consensual agreement of tasks and goals ([Andersson et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-5){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0339};
[Geller,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-91){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0340};
[Kottler & Balkin,
2017](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-174){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0341}).
Ultimately, what we most want to know is what leads to change and
maintains it over time, regardless of the setting and context in which
it takes place. These are the same questions that have been
comprehensively addressed in the past to determine what it is that we
do, or don't do, that matters the most, whether they are referred to as
ingredients, common factors, microprocesses, mediating variables, or
meta-analyses ([Castonguay et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-35){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0342};
[Norcross & Goldfried,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-240){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0343};
[Zimmerman et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-337){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0344}).

Although negotiating the parameters and objectives of therapy are not
much different via teletherapy than in-person sessions, there is little
doubt that the relationships established and maintained take on
different nuances than would be expected. As mentioned, there are
technical challenges to be managed during conversations, inevitable
screen freezes, audio or video fuzziness, dropped calls, low batteries,
power outages, and difficulties navigating the software system. These
little annoyances are not necessarily major obstructions, but they do
change the nature of interactions in ways that are not totally
understood.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_257}Rather than asking the question, "Can
therapy be effective online?" it is far more useful to be considering
how it is different and how can we best capitalize on its unique
features and opportunities to create a robust alliance. This means that
there are certain details that must be reviewed and planned, many of
which were not previously relevant.

::: prosequote
[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-224}[•]{.enumerator}What
sort of "broadcast studio" should be created to present a professional
image free of distractions? Considerations should be given to background

technical equipment (external camera and microphone, lighting, devices,

only at a client's face?
:::

In addition to the adjustments mentioned, the most important factor of
all is anything we do to communicate more clearly and consistently our
hovering attention and responsiveness during conversations. If the
quality of the relationship is the major factor that affects anything
else that we do, then it is absolutely critical that we use every part
of our being to fortify intimate connections to close the physical
distance. Things we might take for granted when sitting in the same room
with someone are not necessarily interpreted the same way when talking
through screens or messaging. In order to maximize attunement to the
client's experience, we must concentrate more than ever on mirroring the
rhythms, breathing, pace, tone, and patterns of the interaction. This
means nodding more than usual, exaggerating facial expressions, and
perhaps responding reflectively more than usual, all of which let the
client know we are tracking carefully and paying *very* close attention.

#### Some Curiosities and Limitations We Don't Yet Fully Know or Understand {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div2-50 .sec2}

There is little, if any, debate about whether alternative therapeutic
delivery options are useful, helpful, or even imperative during these
times. But there []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_258}are considerable
concerns about any therapist's degree of competence, experience, and
expertise to offer these services. One analogy ([Greenbaum,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-105){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0345})
compares our current situation as if we have all completed courses in
driver's training to operate passenger vehicles and now we are suddenly
being asked to drive semitrailers (or spacecraft!). We may know the
rules of the road, but not necessarily how to change lanes, park, or
onload the truck. We also don't yet have the skills and experience to
deal with emergencies and crises we've never anticipated or practiced.
We don't even know what we don't understand.

#### Some Therapies Work Better Than Others via Distance {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div2-51 .sec2}

One of the reasons why some therapists embrace these new delivery
systems relates to far more than their proficiency with the technology
or their attitudes about change. There are some approaches that are far
better suited to teletherapy than others. Much of the research thus far
has been focused on more structured, pedagogical, or systematic models
like cognitive or behavioral therapy, including some approaches like
"computerized cognitive behavioral therapy" that have been extensively
researched already ([Hanley,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-113){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0346};
[Schure et al.,
2018](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-279){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0347}).
The practitioners aligned with cognitive behavioral therapy, for
instance, are much more open and comfortable with teletherapy than their
colleagues who are psychodynamic. It makes sense that those who value
relational connections the most would be reluctant to use a system that
alters the nature of this intimacy.

Once it has been settled that teletherapy can be effective and, in some
cases, optimal for certain clients and particular conditions, research
is now being directed to applying the modality using specialized
treatments for specific disorders ([Andersson et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-5){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0348}).
There are thus studies exploring the use of acceptance and commitment
therapy for chronic pain, online support groups for social anxiety, or
cognitive behavioral therapy for agoraphobia. Over time, we will
eventually develop a systematic menu of options to determine how and
when to most advantageously employ which approaches, with which clients,
and with which disorders.

#### Let's Talk More About Privacy {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div2-52 .sec2}

Although many clients prefer the increased privacy of not having to
commute to sessions or sit in waiting rooms, there are also legitimate
concerns about complying with the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_259}Act (HIPAA) requirements,
not to mention who else in the household may be listening to (and
recording) the sessions. It is for these reasons that there are serious
ethical concerns related to confidentiality, privacy, safety, and
security ([Stoll et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-296){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0349}).
Imagine a client who wants to talk about the domestic abuse she has been
suffering, but her partner is sitting in the next room, accidently or
deliberately hearing what is being revealed in the sessions. Some people
don't have very secure, private places in their home, sometimes
resorting to sitting in their vehicles or walking around outside.

We can never really be certain who else is listening or watching what is
transpiring in sessions. Can we even trust clients' reassurance they are
alone if they have some reason or rationale for having witnesses or
"freeloaders"?

#### Impulsive Shopping for Consumers {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div2-53 .sec2}

It takes considerable work, effort, and motivation to schedule and
attend an in-person session, possibly leading to greater commitment to
the process. We know that the modal number of sessions that clients
attend is a single meeting, never returning again (for any number of
reasons). Making it so easy to begin therapy also makes it easy to
abruptly and impulsively end it. Since it requires less effort to
participate, it would also be so much easier to quit when things get
tough.

One thing that clients frequently mention they like the most about
teletherapy is the increased control they feel with respect to remaining
in their own personal space rather than venturing into the therapist's
domain. This not only can feel quite empowering and increase the
client's sense of comfort and safety, but also presents some interesting
challenges since the client can cut us off, shut down, literally mute
us, or cut the connection if things aren't going the way they prefer.
What do we do when a client feels disappointed, frustrated, angry, or
shamed and decides to just disappear without explanation or a chance to
work through what happened? What happens when we can so easily be
dismissed or fired?

#### Lack of a Stable Holding Environment {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div2-54 .sec2}

Some of our more disturbed or traumatized clients might very well do
better via teletherapy in some ways, yet for those cases in which a
"stable holding environment" is the most important part of treatment,
this could []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_260}be problematic. Just imagine
how a particularly devious, manipulative client with borderline
personality disorder could work this system to create some unique forms
of chaos and disruption we've never imagined. In addition, those who are
potentially suicidal, self-harming, or a danger to others require clear
safety measures that are not easily maintained or enforced when we are
not in the room with them. What are we to do when a client
decompensates, falls apart, freaks out, or begins sobbing uncontrollably
while we view them from the distance of a screen?

There are also apparently some rather unique and interesting
transference and countertransference reactions that can occur via
teletherapy. This is hardly surprising considering the possibly
distorted ways that people might view one another on screens versus in
person. It is as if we are each part of a television show, playing a
role, interacting in this strange space that is both artificial and
real. This can increase the risk for dissociation among clients who are
less than stable or whose trauma can be triggered by cues we'd hardly
anticipate ([Svenson,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-302){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0350}).

#### One Size Doesn't Fit All {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div2-55 .sec2}

Of course not everyone is suitable for the same therapeutic structures.
One true believer of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
(EMDR) offered through teletherapy expressed some concerns and
cautionary tales of traumatized clients who can become triggered by the
screen-based conversations and experience unintended negative
consequences ([Laliotis,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-198){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0351}).
She described a woman who had been sexually abused as a child and made
steady progress in their previous in-person sessions, but when they
began working via distance, she found the relationship no longer the
safe haven that was experienced previously. Interestingly, once this was
noticed and they switched to phone conversations instead, she once again
felt the closeness and trust that were so important to her. "The phone
allowed her to use my voice to feel into our connection and more readily
access her memories despite the absence of visual cues" (p. 22). She
concluded with a warning that clients should be thoroughly and routinely
assessed regarding their suitability for teletherapy given their
tolerance for virtual connections and their ability to thrive under
those conditions.

In the past, we would have carefully interviewed and assessed a new
referral to determine the best treatment options, whether to see the
person alone, with a partner, with the extended family, or in a group.
We made []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_261}some preliminary estimates about
whether this was going to be a relatively short-term or long-term case.
In addition, we made decisions regarding which approach we might best
employ, depending on the diagnosis, time availability, and mutually
negotiated goals. Now we must add to these menu options whether the case
is best handled in person, on the phone, via teletherapy, via virtual
reality, or by other configurations that best address the client's
issues, concerns, and preferences.

#### Restricted Data {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div2-56 .sec2}

There is significant meaning in people's posture and body position, what
they are doing with their hands, how their feet might be jiggling.
Likewise, we are constantly scrutinizing all kinds of additional cues
when clients are in the room with us. We can see dilated pupils in their
eyes or smell alcohol or cannabis on their breath. We can also catch the
scent of whatever is going on within their bodies. Yet when we are at a
distance, we are limited by the data available to us, just as clients
are missing valuable information about our own nonverbal responses. This
can easily lead to inaccurate assumptions and poorly conceived clinical
choices.

When our interactions are essentially reduced to staring at one
another's faces and listening to words without other sensory cues, we
are definitely limited in other ways. There are times when appropriate
physical contact or touch are quite useful and reassuring---a handshake
in greeting, a soft touch on the arm during a critical moment, even a
hug after a particularly draining session.

#### Tech Glitches {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div2-57 .sec2}

As much as we may be delighted and enthused by new teletherapy
technology, we also have to deal with the realities of what sometimes
happens during meetings and sessions. Some people really struggle to
make things work, becoming increasingly frustrated when equipment breaks
down or doesn't work the way it was intended. Sometimes, the Internet
goes out, electricity fails, sound kicks out, images are blurry, or
video stops working, abruptly ending conversation during a particularly
important moment. This can become an endless source of frustration,
especially for those who don't have access to reliable connections or
just don't have the disposition to fix the inevitable disruptions.

#### []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_262}Intrusions and Distractions {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div2-58 .sec2}

Participants in telemeetings and online classes think they are being so
sneaky when they multitask during discussions. They think we can't see
them texting with the phone on their laps or writing reports on their
computers. Sometimes in multiperson meetings, they just turn off the
video so they can get other work done.

At least when clients are in the room with us we can see what they are
always doing; this is not so when we only have access to their faces. It
is also sad but true that therapists are known to multitask during
sessions, replying to a message asking a question or changing an
appointment; clients either don't notice or accept this behavior as the
new normal and just assume this is now part of what is to be expected.

#### What Are the Evidence-Based Best Practices? {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div2-59 .sec2}

Short answer to what the best evidence-based practices is---we just
don't know.

The single most important question we want to know is how well
teletherapy is actually working and how that compares with our previous
sessions. So far we know that mental health services *can* be delivered
via distance modalities, but we just don't know, or fully understand,
how the process works differently. This leads to a number of other
questions:

::: prosequote
[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-229}[•]{.enumerator}Who
are the best candidates for teletherapy, and who should be excluded?

do we gain, and what exactly do we lose?

are our alliances and services different when we offer them via phone,

:::

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_263}These are just a few of the questions
that currently require some guidance, and so far, we've just scratched
the surface of their literal, much less symbolic, meanings.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has been comparing treatments of
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that are delivered online to those
offered in person and, so far, has found the results to be similarly
effective (D. [Murphy & Turgoose,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-231){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0352}).
Likewise, a number of other studies have initially demonstrated positive
outcomes for teletherapy with depression, anxiety, adjustment disorders,
and substance abuse ([Greenbaum,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-105){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0353};
[Varker et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-315){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0354}).
Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we will
learn during the next few years.

### Living Beings Inside Little Boxes {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div1-111 .sec1}

Just stop for a moment and consider what your brain was doing during the
early days of the pandemic, trying to make sense of what was happening
in daily life. Put aside the mask wearing, social distancing, avoidance
of contact with others, the fears of getting sick and dying, the losses,
and the disappointments. After millions of years of relating to one
another, connecting to one another face to face, all of a sudden we all
became these tiny images on screens. When we communicate with one
another in this way, clarity becomes fuzzy in all kinds of ways that may
be barely noticeable to us but is sending our neurons into a frenzy of
confusion because of the split-second time delays, blurred images, and
missing nonverbal cues that help us make sense of communication. This
may not seem like such a big deal as we still get our work done and our
session completed, but our brains are being forced into a sudden stage
of evolutionary development that usually takes hundreds of thousands of
years.

What are the consequences of this required sudden adaptation? We just
don't know. What has been apparent are the cognitive, emotional, and
physical drains on one's psyche after prolonged exposure to screen
conversations all day long. This not only results in a certain amount of
stress and frustration with our brains working overtime to process what
is happening, but also leads to impaired sensory attunement, eye strain,
and physical exhaustion. During these interactions, because we don't
have access to hand gestures, fidgeting, breathing rhythms, and other
such cues, our ingrained abilities to maintain attention and decode
meanings are disrupted, forcing the brain to focus exclusively on words
and limited facial expressions that are visible and recognizable
([Sklar,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-287){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0355}).

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_264}This has led to what has been called
"zoom gloom," the condition that results from excessive time talking and
meeting on devices. The effects are magnified on multiperson screens,
whether in group therapy, support groups, conferences, or staff
meetings. When using the "gallery view" in which a dozen (or hundreds)
of postage stamp size faces overwhelm our ability to process what is
going on, the brain becomes even more confused about where to focus
attention. The eyes keep flitting all over the screen, continuously
checking one's own appearance, figuring out who is talking, monitoring
what others are doing, noticing some are barely listening, and directing
continuous partial attention as things may begin to feel a little
overwhelming. Once other immersive technologies are coupled with
teletherapy, the brain is further burdened with novel meaning-making
responsibilities.

In the limited research thus far, it has been discovered that there are
a number of neuropsychological effects that take place inside the brain
during teletherapy or screen-based meetings and consultations ([J. Lee,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-200){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0356}).
There is some reassurance and comfort in understanding and explaining
why we may feel so tired and depleted after several hours online:

::: list1
[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-236}[1.]{.enumerator}Millisecond

:::

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_265}In some ways, the human brain is already
somewhat adapted for these sorts of remote interactions considering how
much time people already spend on screens pretending they inhabit
simulated worlds via television, movies, and video games. Technology is
evolving so rapidly it is hard to catch our breath or master new systems
and software updates. Just think: whereas now virtual reality can be
experienced by just wearing glasses or a watch, the first attempts
required equipment that was bulky, heavy, glitchy, and prohibitively
expensive. Users often developed "cybersickness," which is similar to
motion sickness and caused by low resolution and slower frame rates.
Over time, just as the equipment has improved, so have our brains become
at least somewhat exposed to these alternative forms of interaction.

The main task that challenges teletherapists is how to capitalize on the
unique benefits and advantages of this mode of delivery in such a way to
make the experience as powerful, evocative, and immersive as possible.
When utilizing virtual technology systems as part of distance-based
treatment, the ultimate goal is to more closely approximate what clients
might encounter in their daily lives---all with the ongoing support,
instruction, and guidance that we can provide along this journey
(Lindner, 2020).

There are some strategies that help to reduce the discomfort and
fatigue, many of which follow the guidelines of basic self-care
described in a previous chapter. This includes things like the
following:

::: prosequote
[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-245}[•]{.enumerator}*Know
your personal limits and consistently enforce them*. Some therapists can
see 10--12 clients a day, while others have a maximum of 6--8 sessions.
Regardless of the pressure to be more productive, to bill more hours,
and to help more people, all practitioners reach a set point when they
can no longer operate at the usual efficient and most effective levels.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-246}[•]{.enumerator}*Adjust
your schedule according to the demands of the teletherapy.* Instead of
squeezing a bunch of clients into the same day to maximize efficiency
like in "olden" times, it is now possible to spread sessions across
different days during the week. This is so much easier to do when
working remotely.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-247}[•]{.enumerator}*Design
a space that is comfortable.* It is indeed a different world in which
therapists have become entertainers and screen performers, broadcasting
our images and messages across cyberspace. As such, our professionalism
is now either diminished or enhanced by the lighting, sound, and
background that become an integral part of our presentation. It's
important to design and build a "broadcast studio"
[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_266}of sorts, one that includes a
comfortable chair, advantageous and flattering light sources, clear
sound, an appropriate background, and a high-definition image.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-248}[•]{.enumerator}*Schedule
active breaks.* This doesn't just mean the usual 10-minute pause between
sessions in which you race to complete case notes and get your head back
together for the next person waiting for attention. It is important to
plan for at least occasional times throughout the day for something more
than stuffing food inside your mouth and instead do some stretching
exercises or jumping jacks, go for walks, practice some yoga postures,
or just take some personal time to get your blood flowing.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-249}[•]{.enumerator}*Avoid
multitasking*. In spite of the temptation to do so, trying to take care
of multiple simultaneous tasks adds to the cognitive pressure, as well
as wear and tear on the system. Besides the fact that no matter how
sneaky you think you are, viewers can see your attention is divided.
This can be interpreted as disrespectful, if not downright rude.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-250}[•]{.enumerator}Talk
to someone face to face. Give your brain and senses a chance to
recalibrate themselves to the reality in which it had previously been
accustomed. Spend a few minutes between sessions chatting with a
colleague, friend, or anyone who is within physical reach.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-251}[•]{.enumerator}*Play
with settings on the software system so you aren't always staring at
your own face.* One reason this is so common is because it is really
about the only thing familiar to your brain that grounds it during this
pretty novel and confusing means of interaction. It isn't just
narcissism that leads our eyes to keep checking our own appearance, but
rather a kind of default position that is at least recognizable. It
helps to change the screen view from "gallery," "grid," and "speaker" at
times just to provide some sensory variation. Hide your own face at
times just so you stop staring at yourself in the mirror.

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-252}[•]{.enumerator}*Related
to the suggestions above, guide clients to follow the same rules and
rituals.* Fatigue, predictability, and just going through the motions
are not conductive to long-term memory retention. Urge clients to alter
their own routines, settings, and physical positioning to maximize
interest, attention, and energy level.
:::

In addition to the suggestions mentioned, it is important to remember
that we are pretty much making this stuff up as we go along. Teletherapy
has only been functionally operational during the past few years, at
least by the majority of practitioners. This creates opportunities for
very novel and creative contexts for what we do. There are no longer
strict rules for []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_267}where therapy takes
place, making it possible for sessions to take place while walking,
stretching, or sitting in nature.

### Novel Strategies, Unique Options, and Adaptive Methods {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div1-112 .sec1}

In whatever context and setting that therapy takes place, its relative
success is most contingent on the relational trust developed between the
participants. Furthermore, this is a *mutual* process. Although we talk
a lot about earning the client's faith, in some ways it is also
important that we also feel a sense of trust in the relationship. If we
question the client's commitment and intentions, if we sense clients are
misleading or outright lying to us, if it seems they have some hidden
agenda, or if they are inclined to go on the attack for any little
perceived affront, we are going to be far more cautious, conservative,
and self-protective in our approach. So, in all kinds of ways "epistemic
trust," acquiring useful and relevant knowledge that facilitates
intimacy, is central to all that we do ([Fonagy et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-78){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0357}).

Given the unique requirements and limitations of teletherapy that take
place on a screen, there are some specialized skills, behaviors, and
strategies that we must employ somewhat differently---in some cases
exaggerated---in order to establish and maintain the perception of
mutual trust in the alliance. One way we do this is through "ostensive
cuing," which has been described as the clear physical, nonverbal
signals that are communicated with verbal speech to convey understanding
([Fisher et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-76){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0358}).
These are the authentic reactions we demonstrate to reveal our responses
to what we hear, see, feel, and experience as a result of interactions
with clients.

Once again, it is important to mention that although teletherapy is
*equivalent* to in-person sessions in most of the ways that matter the
most, *it is still not the same*. With less information revealed during
interactions, the fewer tools at our disposal must be used more
strategically and effectively---and this includes the increasingly
dramatic, exaggerated ways we express our reactions on screens. Whereas
previously a slight shrug, minor head nod, or muttered "uh huh" might
have been enough to signal that we were following what the client said,
these behaviors may easily be missed within the smaller window of
interaction.

One of the ways that therapists must adapt their style is to
deliberately and intentionally use our bodies, facial expressions, and
movements to continuously communicate tracking responses. We have always
done this "quietly" in our work, but it takes on much greater
significance in []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_268}distance-based systems.
Examples of nonverbal, ostensive cuing include the following:

::: prosequote
[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-253}[•]{.enumerator}Raised
eyebrows: surprise

[]{#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-item1-254}[•]{.enumerator}Leaning

do?"
:::

Our nonverbal behavior, gestures, and onscreen actions must be adapted
for different media; the same holds for the strategies for those working
with children, in which play therapy has been the central focus. It's
not as if the standard tools of water and sand play, or building
structures together, would work the same ways, if at all, but many other
strategies that employ visualization, storytelling, role playing, dolls,
puppets, and costumes could smoothly feature into teletherapy sessions
without any noticeable loss of power ([Straus & O'Neil,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-297){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0359}).
After all, kids are often highly adaptable these days to *anything* that
involves a screen.

It is precisely children's openness and willingness to accept new
technological tools that makes working with them remotely so much easier
in some ways. This even allows for the introduction of avatars and
socially assistive robots to help children overcome disruptive behaviors
and fears that have previously been unresponsive to more direct verbal
interventions ([Lyford,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-206){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0360}).

### Virtual Is the New Reality {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div1-113 .sec1}

Distance-based therapy is hardly the only dramatic change in the ways we
can now offer treatment options. Almost every week we hear about another
innovation relying on virtual reality, mobile phone apps, and other
breakthroughs that are designed to enhance the immersive experience and
simulations and provide ongoing communication between therapist and
client via messaging or even sensors. It may now come to pass that
specific coursework, seminars, workshops, and continuing education will
be focused on ways for professionals to best harness and integrate these
new technologies into practice.

Picture this: A woman is sitting eerily still in a straight-backed
chair. Her fists are clutched, and her lips are pressed tightly
together. She is staring []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_269}intently at a
single capsule lying on a table directly in front of her. She reaches
out her hand and, with a single finger, pushes it away. A few friends
sitting nearby on a couch urge her to swallow the pill, "Come on
already, it won't hurt you!"

The woman crosses her arms and almost nods her head---just a tiny
movement. Suddenly, she hears another voice inside her head, one that
sounds like her therapist. "Very, very good," the voice says. "Now, what
exactly are you thinking and feeling right now?"

Just a few years ago, it cost about \$30,000 to experience virtual
reality technology with all the equipment required. Now for just a few
hundred dollars people can experience a "controlled stimulus
environment" from which to experiment with new behaviors and adventures,
many of which are indistinguishable from the real thing as measured by
physiological indices: Your body really *does* think you are
hang-gliding or covered with spiders. With respect to treating phobias,
fears, addictions, and trauma, the idea is to put people in those
contexts in which they become activated and then practice relapse
prevention skills. This is an absolute game changer!

Researchers have been experimenting with the earliest versions of
virtual reality for several decades, noting that retention of learning
far exceeds that of the usual verbal conversation, lectures, or reading
because of its ability to simulate immersive experiences that better
correspond to real-life situations. Like most of the focus of this
discussion, the therapist can direct the treatment from a distance,
leading experts to proclaim this will be the next revolution in
healthcare ([Spiegel,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-292){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0361}).

Some of the latest breakthroughs in this virtual reality technology
provide both clients and their therapists with head-mounted displays
that allow them to create avatars based on their appearance and
characteristics, after which they are teleported into a virtual
environment for sessions ([Matsangidou et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-216){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0362}).
During initial trials participants found that both the physical
separation and the use of avatars helped certain clients to feel more
open and comfortable, as well as less shame and judgment about their
bodies.

However innovative and interesting this format might be for a limited
audience that doesn't wish to be "seen" as they are, it also presents
some challenges for those professionals who utterly depend on accurate
readings of behavior that are only revealed in person. Nevertheless,
this study is mentioned as one example of the type of specialized
treatments that can be developed for issues related to body image,
obesity, and eating disorders.

The global market for reality exposure type therapies is expected to
grow by more than 35% in just the next few years, which is not
surprising with major players like Apple, Oculus, Google, and Microsoft
ramping []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_270}up their virtual reality devices
for the next wave of innovation. Whereas most of the plans center on
entertainment and adventure experiences, the implications for therapy
are limitless. Of course, with any new technology there are risks and
dangers involved; in this case, there is the need to understand more
about creating false memories. In addition, as with any new technology,
there are some initial challenges since, in this case, clients can
become disoriented and confused after a few minutes, unable to continue
wearing the equipment.

### The Evolution of Innovation {#20_chapter13.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-13-div1-114 .sec1}

It is not as if we are completely surprised by the transition to virtual
formats since they have been around in various permutations for over 60
years in order to provide a more immersive experience for exposure
therapy methods ([Wittson et al.,
1961](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-324){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0363}).
Of course the quality of these simulations have evolved considerably
from the most basic videoconferencing to virtual reality breakthroughs
that targeted phobias, social anxiety, and trauma. Similar treatments
have been developed specifically for a variety of other conditions,
including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism,
developmental disorders, and neurocognitive disorders ([Dellazizzo et
al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-51){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0364}).

It has been challenging to investigate treatment options based on
virtual reality thus far, in part because studies have been poorly
designed with no control groups, featured researcher bias, and relied on
skewed or homogeneous samples. Nevertheless, the initial results have
been impressive even if they don't necessarily appear to be superior to
more traditional sessions ([Dellazizzo et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-51){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0365}).
In truth, this is all so new we don't know yet know how to best assess
impact, which is one reason why the studies typically end with the
caution that much more research is needed before any definitive
conclusions can be drawn.

It only makes sense that the more realistic and immersive the experience
rehearsing new behaviors is, the more potent the effects will be,
especially recovering from trauma. It is also the case that, compared to
traditional therapy, virtual reality methods designed to reduce anxiety
create a safe space for imagery tasks to be completed ([Frewen et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-87){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0366}).
It is one thing to ask a client to imagine walking along a deserted
beach or trail through a redwood forest versus transporting the person
there in a way that almost feels as if they are physically present.

Another whole realm of teletherapy options are embedded in popular,
for-profit, online therapy programs in which people pay a monthly fee
for []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_271}access. Many of these programs, like
Talkspace, Doctor on Demand, and BetterHelp, provide brief, intermittent
consultations on a prescription basis. They rely on an assortment of
communication modalities that include live chats, audio or video
sessions, messaging, or virtual reality. They are kind of like dating
services, matching professionals to clients based on stated needs and
preferences. They offer specialized services to specific populations,
including teens; couples; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
queer/questioning (LGBTQ); or the disabled, providing individual
consultations, group support, or psychiatric and other telehealth
services.

The future of our profession is very much uncertain and confusing for a
variety of reasons related to the rapid pace of technological evolution,
cultural development, and lifestyle changes, not to mention health
crises that demand radical changes to better serve clients in need. Some
therapists are beginning to rethink their roles from that of an
office-based, face-to-face individual practitioner to a professional who
offers a variety of services linked to a "positive virtual ecosystem"
composed of multiple resources, online forums, computer-mediated
interactions, mobile apps, and augmented AI ([Hanley et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-114){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0367}).

This leads to the question about where our profession is headed. Is it
to be driven by manualized treatments? Algorithms? Avatars? Artificial
intelligence? Self-care apps? Customized chemicals? Hallucinogens?
Online support groups? Or perhaps there is something we can't even yet
imagine. Some have even wondered whether we will all eventually become
replaced by AI-driven programs. Already, smartwatches can detect
physical anomalies and health difficulties long before anyone becomes
symptomatic. How long will it be before devices can detect suicidal
intent or the earliest indications of depression and anxiety?

There is some speculation that one day we may all be replaced with
robots since researchers have predicted that almost everything that we
do in our jobs can be automated ([Innes & Morrison,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-139){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0368}).
They break down each of our activities into component parts---assessment
of conditions and problems, formulation of a diagnosis and treatment
plan, therapeutic interventions, and evaluation of
outcomes---discovering that each of them can be programmed into AI
"machines." They warn of an "AI tsunami" that is gaining momentum along
the horizon, fueled by the development of sophisticated, deep-learning
algorithms, access to "big data," advanced predictive analytic systems,
as well as the dramatic increase in demand for alternative accessible
mental health services as a result of the pandemic.

Muddling the issues and research evidence even further is the inherent
conflict between professionals and those entrepreneurs and tech
companies that are driven primarily to monetize their products for
profit []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_272}and growth. Remember this is an
industry that generates a half trillion dollars a year (that's
\$500,000,000,000,000)! This has been described as the primary battle
that lies ahead between commercial interests versus the "centrality of
unique and responsive human relationships" that are so much a part of
our profession ([Essig,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-66){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0369}).

One critical, scathing investigation into so-called therapy apps
revealed that marketing promises that are offered by these profitable
enterprises are rarely actually delivered ([Fischer,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-73){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0370}).
They are more like a hybrid of self-help programs, placebos, scented
candles, and a confession in which "users" are invited to spill their
guts followed by rather pedestrian advice supposedly personalized for
each individual. One such program, BetterHelp, declares in its
promotions that "mental health is finally cool . . . but it doesn't have
to be just sitting around talking about feelings. It can be whatever you
want it to be."

Now, wouldn't *that* be nice?

We have always been envious of our medical colleagues, who have all
kinds of diagnostic and treatment tools at their disposal---magnetic
resonance scans, blood tests, x-rays, robotic surgery, medications and
vaccines, triage bots, sensory implants, 3D bioprinting, remote patient
monitoring, drone-delivered medical supplies, global biobanks, wearable
biodevices, and virtual reality rehab, to mention just a few. And what
do we have at our disposal besides our relatively primitive assessment
instruments and our psychologically enhanced minds?

Speaking of our envy toward those in medicine who have tools to assist
in diagnosis and treatment, what about those chemical enhancements that
are currently on the rise for treating emotional disorders? Nonmedical
therapists have long had an ambivalent relationship with pharmacological
treatments for mental health conditions and emotional disorders. We are
certainly well aware of the abuses that result from overprescribing
antidepressants, antianxiety medications, and especially pain
medications. So often when we receive referrals from medical
professionals, the patients show up with a prescription already in hand.
Many of these psychopharmacological options have literally been
lifesavers, especially for those with organically based depression,
anxiety, panic disorder, and similar conditions. On the other hand (you
knew this was coming), the number of people taking Xanax, Valium,
Prozac, and similar drugs has been skyrocketing in recent years. Any
patient who shows up at a doctor's office and complains of feeling sad,
jittery, anxious, depressed, or otherwise chronically upset about
something in their lives will likely leave with a prescription for a
drug. That's what doctors get paid to do; they can't just bill for
listening to a patient. In addition, the vast majority of people attempt
to self-medicate []{#20_chapter13.xhtml_page_273}themselves with
alcohol, cannabis, or other substances long before they reach out to
seek help.

There are also a few new innovations in psychotherapy that are designed
to treat disorders like PTSD, anxiety, or nonresponsive depression with
psychedelics. There are a number of experimental trials going on that
employ ketamine, MDMA (Ecstasy), psilocybin, and cannabinoids in
conjunction with therapy that have been finding rather dramatic results
in some cases ([Krediet et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-194){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0371};
[Marseille et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-214){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0372};
[Monson et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-227){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0373}).
Similar to the other novel treatments that were mentioned, it is way too
soon to comprehensively determine their benefits and dangers.

Teletherapy and other virtual options are clearly solutions for
providing mental health care to those who previously have been ignored
or excluded, but it won't solve the epidemic of emotional disorders on
their own. The majority of new clients are experiencing mental health
treatment for the first time and generally are quite pleased with the
convenience, accessibility, and simplicity of just opening up a device
to talk to someone. This may be "simple," yet until such time that are
changes in state and federal laws regulating telehealth options, coupled
with advances in scientific studies and technological innovation, we
will not achieve the "delicate mix of software and human touch"
([Resnick,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-266){#20_chapter13.xhtml_n0374}).

Teletherapy will not replace traditional psychotherapy, just offer
alternatives for those who don't have access or resources to attend
sessions in person. There are obviously certain clients and particular
conditions for which distance-based treatments are not feasible; there
are also some (many?) practitioners who still (and will always) prefer
the deeper (or different) intimacy and relational connections that take
place when participants are physically occupying the same space.

Well, the times, they are a changin'. The distinctions between online,
virtual, Internet, and face-to-face therapies are blending, providing
diverse options for clients (depending on their complaints, disorders,
preferences, resources, context, needs, and interests) as well as those
of their therapists. This makes it virtually (literally and
figuratively!) impossible to predict what lies in store for us in the
future in terms of available delivery systems for our services. One
thing for certain, however, is that the market for skilled, trained
mental health professionals will only increase dramatically, regardless
of the particular ways we offer our help.

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml}

## []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_274}[Chapter 14](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0016) {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14 .ch_title1}

## [Toward Creativity and Personal Growth](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0016) {.ch_title2}

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div1-115}There is a
long and distinguished history within our profession of famous
therapists doing some pretty unusual things to get through to their
clients. Stories of Milton Erickson, Carl Whitaker, and Fritz Perls
abound about some of their stunts---slapping a client in Perls's case
and breastfeeding a client or sleeping during a session in Whitaker's
case; and there are so many books written about Erickson's creative
interventions, they are impossible to catalogue. In more recent times,
this tradition has continued through the work of brief and
solution-focused practitioners who resort to all kinds of innovative
ways to get through to resistant clients. In spite of such interesting
stories and case histories that attract our attention, creativity is
almost never taught, or even discussed much, during the training years,
when the focus seems to be more often concerned with the precision and
reliability of skills. Whereas other "performance arts" like stand-up
comedy, art, music theater, dance, debate, and public speaking consider
creativity at the heart of what they do, therapists usually claim sole
devotion to the gods of scientific rigor.

There are some writers who believe that therapy, as a profession, could
quite legitimately be housed in an academy of dramatic arts instead of a
school of education, health, social work, medicine, or liberal arts. "In
this setting, therapists would speak of their craft as professional
conversation, strategic rhetoric, or even a genre of interactional
theater" ([Keeney,
1991](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-146){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0375},
p. 1). Indeed, when Jeff Zeig, Ericksonian therapist and founder of the
Evolution of Psychotherapy conferences, wanted to take his clinical
skills to the next level, he did so not only by studying the recordings
of all the []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_275}most prominent clinicians but
also by taking acting lessons to increase his capacity for
improvisation, spontaneity, creativity, and innovation.

Treating the practice of therapy as a creative or dramatic art certainly
has as much merit as viewing it as an applied science. If science is
therapy's brain, then creativity is its heart. It is the source of our
intuition, the flexibility that leads to innovative models, and the
energy that drives our most inspired inventions. Creativity is the
essence of what makes each of us so uniquely powerful and influential.

![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-024.jpg)

Therapists must be creative because so much of what we do is spontaneous
and improvisational; we react and respond in the moment to whatever is
happening. We are creative in the ways we organize our knowledge and
research base so that we can retrieve ideas on demand. We are creative
in the ways we frame and understand client issues, in the ways we modify
and refine our clinical style, and certainly in the methods by which we
deal with the impasses that inevitably occur. Creativity also plays a
role in the ways we maintain a freshness in our perspective, in the ways
we stay energized and continue growing, learning, and improving our
effectiveness. Finally, we are creative in the sometimes ingenious ways
we help clients break loose from their rigid, self-defeating patterns to
think, feel, and act differently.

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_276}Everything comes together for us in the
creative process since, by definition, it represents an integration of
disparate elements in unique and meaningful ways. When we experience a
major insight it neutralizes boredom, burnout, and other professional
hazards. Through an innovative procedure, we share our passion for
discovery with the client. It becomes an "everyday elixir" that
fortifies us against complacency, laziness, and accumulative stress or
boredom ([Holm-Hadulla,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-130){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0376}).

The creative journey toward a new understanding, for the client or the
therapist, follows a progression from the familiar to the unknown.
During this passage, there is a movement from stable ground to
confusion, frustration, and self-doubt. It takes courage, and a certain
degree of risk, to be creative given that we are breaking new ground or
experimenting with something that has not been tried before. Whether
part of a gradual evolution or a period of stunning insight, creative
breakthroughs are what keep us most engaged in the process of doing this
work.

### The Urge to Create {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div1-116 .sec1}

Therapists are, at least theoretically, self-actualizing people. Abraham
Maslow eloquently connected this intrinsic growth motive with the urge
to create. He described one of his subjects, a psychiatrist and pure
clinician, as follows: "This man approached each patient as if he were
the only one in the world, without jargon, expectations, or
presuppositions, with innocence and naïveté and yet with great wisdom,
in a Taoist fashion. Each patient was a unique human being and therefore
a completely new problem to be understood and solved in a completely
novel way" ([Maslow,
1968](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-215){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0377},
p. 136).

Personal growth and creativity are synonymous in the life of a
therapist. The very process of therapy involves discovering and creating
new meaning in people's experiences. We do this in our office as well as
at home. A child therapist works in solo practice but never feels lonely
or isolated; instead she finds the solitude more conducive to trying
things her own way. Like many of the therapists I've interviewed, she
didn't think of herself as particularly creative but admitted that
sometimes she does things she might agree are a little unusual. "The way
I do therapy always changes. I use art or music or movement or anything
that strikes me at the time in my sessions. I trust that aspect of
myself." She also tries to be congruent between the creative spirit she
tries to empower when working and how she practices that in her daily
life. "I think the way that I live is creative. I have a great sense of
humor. I do a lot of sometimes wacky things. There have been
[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_277}times I've awakened the kids at 2:00
a.m. to search for ice cream. Or sometimes I like to do crazy things
like hide from my husband when he comes home from work and then jump out
and scare him."

Why do we experience the urge to create? On the simplest level, the most
basic of all human drives is to create another life in our own image, to
perpetuate our gene pool. Our survival as a species has depended on not
only the persistence of our progeny but also our abilities as versatile,
cunning, and creative problem-solvers.

Therapists have more than their share of creative energy. Our ideas live
for generations through every client we help. People may forget their
grocer, fourth-grade teacher, or neighbor, but they *never* forget their
therapist. What clients will remember about us is likely to be a
particularly novel idea that was introduced or a familiar concept that
was presented in a memorable way. For this reason, therapists will live
as long as their ideas survive.

### Resistance to Creativity {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div1-117 .sec1}

Initially, creative acts are often viewed as a form of deviance. Almost
by definition they tend to color outside the existing lines. A brief
glimpse into our field's history reveals a number of contributions that
were initially scorned and ridiculed. Neither Freud nor anyone who has
come on the scene since has had an easy time finding a sympathetic
audience for their novel or radical approaches to helping.

Carl Rogers once agreed to present a lecture at the University of
Minnesota, home of E. G. Williamson, the founder of advice-giving
counseling and the guidance movement. At the time, in addition to this
directive style of treatment, the other dominant therapies were the
behavioral techniques of B. F. Skinner and Freud's psychoanalysis, which
were firmly entrenched as the standards of care. Perhaps with some
naïveté, Rogers ventured into this territory to talk about a focus on
the present instead of the past and an emphasis on emotional expression
rather than on behavior or thinking. "I was totally unprepared for the
furor the talk aroused," Rogers wrote. "I was criticized. I was praised.
I was attacked. I was looked on with complete puzzlement." Yet it was
precisely this controversy that got his attention and inspired him to
develop his ideas further: "It would seem quite absurd to suppose that
one could name a day on which client-centered therapy was born. Yet I
feel it is possible to name that day and it was December 11, 1940"
(quoted in [Kirschenbaum,
2009](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-151){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0378},
p. 109).

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_278}People are threatened by new ideas that
challenge what they think they already know. Resistance to creative
thinking is much more the norm than the exception. Especially in the
evolution of science, professional thinkers have much preferred
aesthetics and symmetry in their ideas to the chaos of reality.
[Boorstein (1983, p.
86)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-23){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0379}
commented on why it took so long for explorers, who long had the
necessary technology, to find and plot the geographical world:

::: prosequote
The great obstacle to discovering the shape of the earth, the
continents, and the ocean was not ignorance but the illusion of
knowledge. Imagination drew in bold strokes, instantly serving hopes and
fears, while knowledge advanced by slow increments and contradictory
witnesses. Villagers who themselves feared to ascend the mountaintops
located their departed ones on the impenetrable heavenly heights.
:::

In the previous chapter we briefly examined the tragic consequences for
Ignaz Semmelweiss, the physician who was the first to suggest that it
might be a good idea for doctors to wash their hands in chlorinated lime
water before beginning surgery in order to reduce the risk of infection
from yet undiscovered bacteria. Rather than being honored or rewarded by
his colleagues, he was denounced for implying that doctors were
"murderers" since they were allegedly killing their patients with
so-called germs on their hands. A similar, but no less dramatic, fate of
ostracism befell many other creative geniuses---Copernicus, Galileo,
Darwin, Mozart, and van Gogh, to name but a few representatives of their
fields. In most cases, a creative idea is first viewed with suspicion
and resentment. Perhaps this probationary period is constructive in that
it filters out many worthless eccentricities; innovators who can stand
the test of time and the criticism of their peers endure.

Creativity is often resisted in therapy, and elsewhere, because it
usually involves breaking existing rules. Our culture may
enthusiastically endorse the *idea* of creativity, but it certainly does
not embrace new structures that render the old ones obsolete. [Bloom
(1975)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-20){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0380}
mentioned how creative acts within our field often stand in opposition
to the structures that were built by those currently in power.
Inevitably, there will be tension and conflict before the new ideas can
be accepted. If you are going to stick your neck out and experiment with
something new and different, you must be prepared that some people are
not going to like that very much. Creative innovation efforts almost
always involve some risk because of the potential they could do more
harm than good.

### []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_279}Risking and Creativity {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div1-118 .sec1}

It makes sense that beginners would wish to avoid creative or risky
behavior for fear of harming somebody. The midcareer professional may
also avoid creative or risky activities in favor of what is tried and
true. In both instances, the clinician is locked into a safe,
predictable style of working that may produce consistent if unremarkable
results.

Risk and fear are inseparable. There cannot be the possibility of gain
without the possibility of loss---no matter how carefully one
anticipates and prepares for what is anticipated and unexpected. Taking
risks means the likely possibility of making a mistake, or at least
being a bit awkward doing something that is untested or unfamiliar. In
almost all cases, it means breaking away from the status quo. It also
means dealing with unknown consequences.

The risk in trying something new in therapy is that it is possible, if
not probable, that it won't work very well during the first few
attempts. We risk losing our way. Yet it's just such mistakes that
groove a pathway for creative innovation and often lead to breakthroughs
([Patrick,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-251){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0381}).
In an endeavor like therapy that employs conversation as the main tool,
it is inevitable that the process is unscripted and improvisational no
matter how much planning took place ahead of time.

After attending a workshop, or reading a new book, there is often
initial excitement about applying some new idea. The first few times we
practice what we have learned, it feels contrived. After some period of
time, we are able to incorporate the method into a style that is
reasonably smooth. Finally, in the last stage, we are able to
internalize the technique, to make it part of ourselves, in such a way
that it no longer belongs to someone else.

The process of doing therapy awakens in us the sense of ourselves as
explorers. We teach others to discover uncharted territory, to learn new
skills and apply them in conditions of maximum stress. We teach people
about their limits and their capabilities. We help people take
controlled risks, for which it is hoped much of the danger can be
anticipated.

Risk---the possibility of failure or loss---cannot be avoided if the
possibility of success is to have any meaning. There are risks of
emotion that involve honestly and spontaneously expressing feelings,
admitting fear, or professing love. There are risks of growth in giving
up control, in being yourself, or in trying something that has never
been attempted before in that unique way. There are risks of intimacy in
working through vulnerability, jealousy, and trust. There are risks of
autonomy in cutting off dependencies and being more responsible. And
there are risks of change that []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_280}involve
breaking old rules, patterns, and habits and moving into the world of
the unknown.

There have been certain conventions within the profession that have been
considered sacrosanct, for example, that sessions are 50 minutes long or
that the interaction should only take place between participants sitting
in chairs in an office even though there is no particularly compelling
evidence that those factors must be honored; after all, they are more
for the convenience of the therapist than they are for any reason
related to better outcomes. Jacques Lacan stirred quite a controversy
when he suggested that sessions should only take as long as a client
actually needs on any given day. He would thus refuse to take
appointments and just ask people to show up in his waiting room if they
wanted to see him. He would then determine if they needed just 5 minutes
or 2 hours, depending on the nature of the problem and their willingness
to do deep work that day.

Changing the format, structure, or context of therapy is certainly risky
when it is outside the usual expectations of what is considered standard
treatment. Yet some therapists are pushing those bounds and still
remaining carefully attentive to any possible ethical breaches or the
consequences of boundary "crossings." One investigation looked at those
therapists who take their clients on field trips or conduct their
sessions outside the office, even if just going for a walk ([Revell &
McLeod,
2016](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-267){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0382}).
Would such an activity increase the risk of possible improprieties or
misunderstandings within the relationship? Possibly. But the study also
offered quite a number of advantages: helping work through an impasse,
improving the relationship, building deeper trust and intimacy,
fostering greater openness, and creating an overall sense of well-being.
Likewise (and perhaps not surprisingly), the therapists really enjoyed
these kinds of sessions as a change of pace, creating more variety in
their day, invigorating their energy, and reducing stress. In addition,
if we may rely on their self-reports, they said fairly consistently that
they were easily able to concentrate and focus on the conversations
without feeling distracted and also did some of their best work during
these "walk and talks."

Nevertheless, there are risks associated with doing anything creative or
innovative that is not currently in widespread use or empirically
tested. Yet we all find ourselves in situations where we use our best
judgment and take a leap of faith, certain (it is hoped) that we are
doing this for the client's own best interests rather our own
convenience and preference. Our intuition---or perhaps
impulsiveness---leads us to try something we've never done before, not
at all sure about what will happen.

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_281}I have a home office where I
occasionally see clients, and I was having some work done on the house,
so I notified a scheduled client (another therapist) that we could
reschedule in the future or else just walk to a nearby coffee shop where
they had a private room in the back. I felt a bit uneasy suggesting this
option, but the client readily agreed, so off we went. During the walk
itself, I could tell we both felt awkward with this novel arrangement,
but things quickly loosened up, and we ended up talking about things we
never had before. When the next week the construction was still not
completed, I offered another alternative to sit on our back patio since
I still felt uneasy about going to a public place. Once again, the
session was groundbreaking in a number of ways. But the thing that
struck me most about these two very different conversations is that we
both had almost perfect recall of everything that was said and
frequently referred back to the "coffee shop session" or the "patio
session" once we resumed our normal structure. It got me thinking that
if the goal of what we do is to create novel interaction experiences,
the kind that produce lasting changes, wouldn't we better off changing
things up once in a while to keep things fresh and exciting?

I don't mean to advocate specifically for conducting sessions outside
the office or via teletherapy, but just to stimulate thinking about ways
we could be more innovative, creative, and experimental without
jeopardizing client safety and welfare. This goes far beyond trying out
a few new ideas in sessions and means adopting a position of braving the
unknown, testing innovative ideas, and experimenting with breakthroughs
that might make all the difference.

So, *how* do we do this exactly? How do we take constructive risks with
our clients, and ourselves, to stimulate greater creativity---and do so
without causing harm?

It all begins with constantly questioning what we do and why we make
such choices. It means honoring our own unique style and way of being,
not only honoring all the voices from previous instructors, mentors, and
supervisors inside our heads, but also muting them during times when we
discover something completely novel and unique in our own thinking that
may directly contradict what we've been told or taught previously. It
means going beyond the masters, the figures we've learned to emulate and
imitate, in order to find our own singular therapeutic voice. The secret
to developing this signature, personalized style of creative practice
involves giving yourself permission to challenge the status quo,
disrupting habits and routines that have become all too comfortable.
This is, in part, what makes therapists truly exceptional: finding and
honoring their own unique voice.

### []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_282}Creative Problem-Solving {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div1-119 .sec1}

What we do, in part, is help people solve problems for a living---or if
not to resolve them, at least to learn to better understand and live
with them. Since by the time clients first contact us they have already
likely exhausted most of the obvious solutions and tried whatever
they---or anyone else---could think of, our task is often to help them
consider far more creative options.

Some of the best examples of creative problem-solving come from the
family therapy practitioners who seek to break rigid hierarchies of
power and vicious circles designed to repel any outside intervention.
This takes place through (a) finding new ways of getting unstuck from
their perceived hopeless situations; (b) employing multiple models and
approaches; (c) accessing unexpected and unknown resources; (d)
embracing the complexity and paradoxes inherent in family issues; (e)
being flexible about the ways conflicts can be resolved; (f) questioning
everything and why things are done that way; (g) thinking outside
traditional parameters of what is supposedly appropriate; (h) being
spontaneous and doing things that are improvisational; (i) embracing
humor and playfulness in interactions; and (j) trusting intuition as
well as logic. Innovation and experimentation are the hallmarks of these
strategic efforts that rely on strange, novel, and sometimes hilarious
means to initiate change in difficult clients.

The most basic and simplest form of this idea is found in just the ways
we frame questions to clients ([McCarthy et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-221){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0383}).
We all get stuck in our routines and familiar habits. We have our
refined, standard assessment practices, our favorite queries and prompts
intended to collect information and aid our diagnostic process. For
beginners, in particular, this can become quite regimented and rigid, as
if intake procedures follow the formulas of mental status examinations.
During early training, interns and students are taught to distinguish
between "open" questions to encourage deeper exploration ("What meaning
did you make of that?") versus "closed" prompts ("Did you make sense of
that?"). Although the timing, frequency, and focus of these questions
are certainly critical, so too are the creative ways they may be formed
and introduced.

We could catalogue the way this singular, simple questioning skill
becomes its own art form when constructed in varied, creative ways,
depending on goals:

::: prosequote
Soft warning: "I'm going to ask a few question that you might find
strange or uncomfortable."

Impasse: "What if you *did* know the answer to
that?"[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_283}

Existential: "What *would* give your life greater meaning?"

Brainstorming: "What are five crazy options that you haven't yet
considered and probably wouldn't work anyway?"

Curiosity: "I wonder how it's possible that you managed to survive so
long given how 'damaged' you say that you are?"

Mindfulness: "What are you experiencing in your body right now?"

Seminal: "What haven't I asked you yet that seems especially important?"
:::

Each of these examples highlights just some of the creative choices that
are available to us once we break loose from conventions, habits, and
familiarity. Of course changing things merely for change or because we
are bored with routines is not the same way of doing so because we feel
stuck and need to discover alternative means of making a difference.

When intuition and creativity are combined with our natural heritage of
empiricism, philosophical inquiry, and the rigorous application of
scientific methodology, we have at our disposal a process that is both
creative and cautious, radical and responsible. As mentioned, clients
come to us only after they have already exhausted the more traditional
and obvious problem-solving strategies. They have discovered that drugs
do not always work for very long, and blaming others or wishing that
problems would magically vanish also does not work. Hiding under the
covers feels safe until you have to change the sheets. Faced with
nowhere else to go, all other options eliminated, they already feel
defeated. Obviously, the cure will be found in something that the client
has not yet tried or, in the case of very difficult cases, in what no
other therapist has yet discovered.

While doing trauma work after an earthquake, one woman approached me
with a paralyzed hand that she claimed no longer worked at all and had
no sensation whatsoever. She had already been checked out by our
surgeon, who found no organic cause for the problem. When I asked her
what she had already tried to fix her hand, she repeated a long list of
things that others in her village had suggested to her, none of which
had any effect whatsoever.

Since she claimed that she had not actually been injured by any falling
debris, I asked her how she came to end up with a "broken" hand. She
told me that at the moment of the shock waves that brought buildings
down all around her, she had grabbed hold of her mother to steady them
as the ground rocked back and forth. Ever since that terrible moment,
her hand had stopped working.

"Hmmm," I muttered, having no idea what to tell this woman. This was
like one of Freud's earliest cases of hysteria in which someone develops
psychosomatic symptoms as a result of some trauma. Since I had always
[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_284}treated such cases as "fairy tales," I
was now completely at a loss for how to proceed. Given the language
difficulties we already had communicating, her extreme level of anxiety,
and her insistence that the problem was likely the result of some act of
the gods, it was pretty clear that nothing I had ever tried before would
likely be very useful in this case. So instead I threw everything into
the wind to see what might blow back at me. Before I could even consider
how bizarre this was going to be, I instructed the woman as follows,
based on some hazy recollection of what a shaman might do to promote
spiritual intervention: "For the next 3 days and nights, I want your
mother to rub warm oil into your hand, slowly massaging each part. I
also want you to take one of these pills each evening, which will also
help considerably." I then ceremoniously handed her three aspirin.

Did this rather strange intervention have the desired effect of curing
her broken hand? I have no idea because we had to move on to the next
village where there were hundreds of additional people requiring medical
and trauma care. It was out of desperation that I was forced to come up
with an intervention that, rationally, made little sense but, in a
strange way, made perfect sense to the client as a viable solution to
her problem.

### Creative Thinking {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div1-120 .sec1}

In spite of the common belief that creativity is some sort of innate
trait that one either has or doesn't have, it can be more functionally
thought of as a type of mental process that we engage in every day in
all sorts of ways. In most cases, it doesn't represent some major
innovation or breakthrough as much as it involves an adaptation of
something that's been tried before; in the context of therapy, it is
almost always a collaborative partnership.

In an essay for researchers on breaking out of their conceptual ruts and
away from the tendency to think as clones of one another, [Wicker
(1985)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-321){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0384}
offered the advice that may be applied with equal usefulness to the
fostering of creativity in therapists:

::: prosequote
[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-item1-259}[•]{.enumerator}Adopt
a playful, whimsical attitude by exploring unusual metaphors.

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-item1-260}[•]{.enumerator}Constantly
tinker with the assumptions of your operating principles, especially
those you hold most sacred.

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-item1-261}[•]{.enumerator}Attempt
to expose hidden assumptions by increasing your awareness of implicit
processes in your work.
:::

The therapist functions much of the time as a detective. First, she
attempts to figure out the "crime" that a client feels he has committed
[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_285}that is bad enough to warrant
symptomatic punishment. She interviews the suspect, reconstructs the
scene, and carefully gathers evidence. She formulates a motive, a
hypothesis regarding how and why the symptoms appeared. She deduces a
modus operandi, a signature to the crime, a pattern in which the current
symptoms fit the client's characteristic style. She gently interrogates
the client, squeezing out a confession that will exhaust the need for
continued self-punishment. In these activities, it is the therapist's
willingness to enter the client's world, to sift through all the
information available, and finally to connect events and intuitively
interpret their meaning that will often help resolve or lessen the
problem. To accomplish these tasks, the therapist must be a creative
detective and must be able to see beyond the obvious to the often
disguised and subtle clues that lie embedded in a client's behavior.

Embracing the role of creative thinking in therapy practice expands the
ways we view our work and objectives. Typically, outcomes have solely
been defined in the language of medicine (e.g., measuring symptom
reduction, residual severity of disorders, degree of baseline change, or
deviance from the norm), even though much of what we do goes far beyond
mere problem-solving and symptom treatment. Many of our clients are
after growth and learning. They strive for increased personality
development, optimal functioning, improved well-being, and, yes, also
creative expression. Even though such outcomes are rarely listed on
treatment plans or case notes, they can be considered one of the common
factors of almost approaches ([Holm-Hadulla,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-130){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0385}).

### Creative Reflections and Practices {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div1-121 .sec1}

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div2-60}Just as
critical for creative innovation is the sensitivity and responsiveness
to the specific impact of anything we do or say, becoming far more
reflective on the nature of our choices, decisions, and behavior. This
means being committed to the scrupulous and honest assessment of our own
limitations and weaknesses, as well as soliciting continuous feedback
from clients to find out how well things are going, what is working
best, and what is not.

One of the most powerful processes for promoting our personal and
professional development has been described as "deliberate practice"
([Clements-Hickman & Reese,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-39){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0386};
[Miller & Rousmaniere,
2014](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-225){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0387}).
This involves systematically identifying those behaviors, skills, and
practices among the most creative and expert practitioners who have
managed to achieve extraordinary levels of success way beyond mere
competence. The idea is to devote oneself with passion and commitment to
lifelong growth []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_286}and innovation, mostly
in the realm of our interpersonal skills and empathic responsiveness.
The good news relates to major themes embedded in our work in that
almost everything we learn professionally to increase our knowledge,
wisdom, skills, and creative potential improve our functioning in all
other areas of daily life. All the ways that we become more flexible and
innovative responding to clients opens up similar potential in
sustaining and growing other relationships. Everything we come to
understand about human nature, about well-being, self-care, and a
meaningful life, work equally well when applied to ourselves.

As if this isn't nearly enough, all the creative pursuits and interests
we pursue in art, music, dance, writing, public speaking, cooking,
athletics, or any other activity in our personal lives only encourage us
to apply the spirit in our sessions. Those therapists who are most
resilient and creative also seem to be able to better immunize
themselves against the depletion and burnout we covered previously (Hou
& Skovholt, 2019). They are fortified by their insatiable desire and
interest in their own personal growth and creative potential, seeking
outlets for their unique expression of self. They fight against
complacency with an insatiable curiosity driven by their reflective
nature, trying to make sense of what is happening and what they can do
better to move things along in productive directions.

The dimensions of this creative practice can take on many forms but
often include the following positions:

#### Admitting you're lost {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div2-61 .sec2}

Before you can invent something new, you first must be willing to
recognize that you have already run out of available options. You have
already exhausted what you know, repeated your favored methods, and now
realize that you are going to have to find a way out of this maze by
trying something that you (or maybe anyone) have never tried before.
That feeling is both exhilarating and sometimes terrifying.

#### Questioning cherished assumptions and conventional wisdom {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div2-62 .sec2}

Most people make particular choices, follow grooved habits, and behave
in certain ways because they've always done it that way. We get locked
into routines that effortlessly guide the ways we work and live our
lives. We drive the same routes to get to familiar places. We order the
same things off the menu and prepare our meals in the same way. When
doing therapy, we []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_287}sit in the same place
and begin sessions the same way, doing what we can to maintain
stability, predictability, and sameness. Rarely do we question why we do
things this way and why we can't make adjustments, or even radical
shifts, in our procedures. If the goal is often to shake things up for
clients, to provide novel and memorable learning experiences, why can't
the participants sit in different places each session? Or better yet,
why not rearrange the furniture or even the location of each session?
There are infinite ways we can change what it is we do, not for change's
sake, but rather to keep our clients alert and engaged. After all,
memories and experiences tend to be far more likely to stick over time
when they are perceived as unique, different, and interesting: Evolution
programmed our brains to attend more carefully and intentionally to
anything we've never encountered previously in that same way.

#### Embracing mystery and confusion {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div2-63 .sec2}

Therapy is often described as an enterprise that helps clients make
better sense of their lives, among other things. We are all about
promoting understanding and insight, finding or creating meaning. Yet
most healers within other cultural traditions around the world see their
jobs as honoring the mystery of life; rather than making sense of
things, they do things that are deliberately and strategically designed
to be confusing ([Keeney,
2009](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-147){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0388},
2021; [Kottler et al.,
2004](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-187){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0389}).
Their goal is to turn off the analytic brain and instead embrace direct
experience with all its uncertainty, confusion, and power. Thus
therapeutic tasks and ordeals are designed *not* to follow logically
from the presenting problem but rather to emerge from intuition and a
felt sense of what might be useful.

A self-respecting shaman would tell you that rather than reading these
words about creativity, what you should do instead (and feel free to
follow these instructions) is (a) tear this page out of the book; (b)
write down in the margins of the page free-associated words and images
that have come to mind as you read this far on the page; (c) carefully
fold the page in half, then into quarters; (d) place the folded piece of
paper between your pillowcase and your pillow; (e) go to sleep with the
page under your pillow and allow yourself to dream whatever is
stimulated by this procedure; and (f) don't attempt to make sense of the
dreams you have---just follow them wherever they may lead you.

Okay, maybe I just lost you. But my point is that creativity often
involves doing things that are designed to honor mystery and confusion
rather than always trying to erase them by providing the illusion of
understanding. []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_288}This helps not only our
clients but also ourselves to increase our tolerance for ambiguity,
complexity, and confusion---which is much of what life is about.
Certainty is an illusion. And as we've learned in this recent post-truth
era, even "facts" are subject to debate and conflict.

#### Cognitive flexibility and fluency {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div2-64 .sec2}

Most studies of creativity define the process as the ability to generate
multiple solutions to a problem, as many as possible. One of the things
that clients soon realize is that the more options they have at hand to
deal with a situation, the more empowered they tend to feel. It is
similar with therapeutic practice: The more different ways we can look
at an issue, the more flexibility we have in addressing it from multiple
perspectives. This is the essence of reframing seemingly intractable
problems in different ways, leading to more creative solutions. Also,
the lesson learned from some kinds of solution-focused therapy is that
if you try something and it doesn't work, try something
else---*anything* other than what you are already doing. This is
something we try to teach to clients but don't practice as often as we
could in our own behavior. There are times we do something in
sessions---challenge, confront, interpret, explain---and the client
doesn't respond as expected, even withdraws, argues, or pushes back
against us. So what do we do? Try again with the same intervention, but
this time more forcefully. And when this doesn't work either, rather
than backing off, we may continue to push harder and harder.

#### Thinking outside the box {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div2-65 .sec2}

This is a common description of creativity, but such thinking is
sometimes difficult to imagine when we are *inside* the box. Among the
interviews we conducted with master therapists about their most creative
breakthroughs ([Kottler & Carlson,
2009](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-183){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0390}),
a few examples of this phenomenon stood out. Ericksonian Michael Yapko
described how he demanded that his client give him \$1 million in order
to demonstrate how unrealistic it was to keep asking someone for
something that he will never give, in this case a father's approval.
Narrative therapist Steve Madigan talked about the way he worked with a
hospitalized patient who was inconsolable in his grief over the death of
his young daughter. Madigan gathered together all of the man's friends
and relatives to initiate a letter-writing campaign of support. Feminist
therapist Laura Brown heard a client talk about how she felt stuck in a
box and []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_289}so structured several sessions
in which the client actually sat inside a huge box, finally breaking
through when she felt ready. Researcher Scott Miller mentioned a case in
which he pretended to be Sylvester Stallone in order to challenge a
client's insistence that he was actually Rambo. In these and so many
other cases, the therapists tried things that previously had been
unimaginable; they were encouraged to experiment with new strategies
that they'd never considered before. They did so not for their own
amusement but rather because everything else had already been attempted
previously, with little impact.

#### Uncertainty and ambiguity {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div2-66 .sec2}

Almost by definition, being creative means we are operating in the
unknown, without familiar landmarks or guides. The more we learn to
increase our tolerance for this uncertainty, the more likely we are to
be willing and able to visit new places in our work with clients. This
is much easier to do if we fully accept and acknowledge that much of the
time in our work we are making stuff up as we go along. Of course this
is informed by training, experience, and evidence, but nevertheless we
are still hardly ever sure that what we are currently doing might not
necessarily be replaced with something else different and better.

One counselor describes how she lives with this position of "not
knowing" the true impact of her work, yet still forges onward to be as
creative as she can. She considers herself fortunate (in some ways) that
she actually lives with her clients, who are students in a boarding
school, since she can chat with them in their natural environment and
learn all kinds of things about their lives that would otherwise be
unattainable. "It's like being surrounded by a hundred teachers. It's
the perfect environment to work collaboratively, experientially, and
creatively. I can work from canoes, on the beach, by the campfire. I
meet the families and friends."

As much as she enjoys the diversity of options, she still admits that
it's hard to tell when she's making a real difference in their lives.
"Every time one of them stumbles, I worry that I haven't done enough for
them so, sometimes, I return to traditional cognitive strategies. I stop
trusting the process or get lazy or scared," which she admits almost
always backfires. "Emotions escalate, heels dig in, trust is lost. And
even when formal interventions do unfold gloriously, within a day or
two, a new crisis develops. So I never have a sense of completion,
efficacy, or acknowledgment. And I know that growth is in the hands of
the client, so I may never attain a sense of competency or equilibrium.
That off-balance feeling is always hovering."

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_290}It may very well be that it isn't what
superlative therapists do *in* sessions that is as important as all the
reflective time and energy they spend *between* sessions thinking
creatively about their cases ([Miller et al.,
2007](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-224){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0391}).
So if the goal is to be more creative, one way to do that is to work at
it and make it a major priority in your life and work. This is true not
only with respect to clinical practice but also when it comes to using
our skills to make a difference in the wider world.

### On Wisdom and Creativity {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div1-122 .sec1}

Whereas creativity is often a learned or developed trait or behavior,
most philosophers have struggled to define the nature of wisdom, much
less its particular attributes. One can be wise without demonstrating
creative thinking; likewise, one can demonstrate creative actions
without any semblance of wisdom in how they can be useful.

Being a therapist is as much a lifestyle choice as it is a job or
profession. It means a life devoted to the pursuit of wisdom, especially
the practical kind that can be passed on to others. Although wisdom is
usually associated with being highly experienced or elderly, there are a
number of other facets that have been identified as components of this
characteristic. Wise elders and therapists have a far more nuanced view
of their accumulated experience, able to recognize patterns and subtle
differences with a certain clarity and vision. They are able to
demonstrate both a high degree of emotional regulation and tolerance for
individual and cultural differences. They have a highly developed
understanding of life's priorities and yet can face existential despair
with faith and humility.

This description of wisdom is actually the ways that older, more mature
practitioners display their creativity. Originality has been normally
associated with the energy and passion of youth, yet older therapists
make their own innovative contributions by relying on their signature
strengths instead of dwelling on their age-related losses that may make
daily functioning more challenging in some ways. For older therapists,
this means possible compromised memory functioning or reduced energy,
but it also means having far more diverse life experiences and "messier"
minds that can lead to extraordinarily creative behavior when several
internal strategies are frequently employed, the first of which includes
lots of daydreaming. It turns out that the creative mind needs downtime
to roam in undisciplined, unstructured ways. We must give ourselves the
time, space, and permission to sit or walk around with no other agenda
except to let our thoughts and feelings wander where they will.

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_291}Whereas behaviors that promote creative
thinking and action involve a marked lack of structure, this must be
tempered with some degree of careful, critical analysis of what we have
noticed, observed, and sensed is going on. Therapists are ideally suited
for such scrupulous observation and analysis because of the nature of
our training: Who else is more qualified and experienced in figuring out
the meaning and nuances of behavior or life's most challenging
questions?

Creativity is most often triggered by seeking the "silver lining" in any
situation or opportunity, looking for the learning experience or lesson
that might prove useful. That is one reason why many master therapists
prefer not to look at their so-called failures as anything other than
valuable feedback regarding what needs to be altered or changed. With
successful aging comes an acceptance of one's limitations and
unrealistic expectations, helping to convert some novel idea into a very
practical and realistic application. But there are still certain risks
associated with any new or experimental strategy that has uncertain
outcomes.

Erik and Joan [Erikson
(1998)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-65){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0392}
wrote eloquently about the wise and creative spirit associated with
later maturity that is driven by the developmental stage of
generativity. In most cultures around the world (except increasingly in
the West), elders are afforded status and honored, not only for what
they have accomplished in their lives, but also for their role within
the community as advisor and sage. Elders are expected to devote their
later years to serving others, using what they have learned to mentor
and guide the next generation.

As therapists age and attain "senior status," many find a yearning to
apply what they know and understand to settings outside the usual and
customary province of psychotherapy. With time running short, the aging
clock ticking away, they may feel a commitment to make a difference on a
larger---or at least different---scale. It's one thing to work with a
single individual for an hour and quite another to devote time to
promote systemic changes within a group, organization, or community.
This is one of the ways we've covered that therapists remain vibrant,
creative, and professionally engaged through a process of periodically
reinventing themselves. This has been especially the case with
clinicians reaching way beyond the restrictions of traditional sessions
to "do good" in other contexts.

There's been a lot of talk (but a lot less action) about the therapist's
role and responsibility to advocate on behalf of the marginalized and
oppressed, as well as promote an agenda of social justice. Most
therapists are so busy and overwhelmed with their day jobs that it's
hard for them to find the time, much less the opportunity, to intervene
creatively on a more systemic level. Yet therapists are becoming
increasingly involved in community and
[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_292}world affairs and finding this to be
among the greatest satisfactions of their lives. Mary [Pipher
(2013)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-253){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0393}
mentioned how there have been times she has felt such despair at the
hopelessness of addressing certain environmental or social issues that
it just made her head and heart hurt. "So I decided to get to work," she
says, "because action has always been what pulls me out of despair."
This realization is what led her to use her therapeutic and leadership
skills to organize efforts in her community.

Therapists are redefining their roles, embarking on spiritual quests as
concerned citizens of their communities. This is what Alfred Adler first
referred to as "social interest," the commitment that professionals
devote to making their communities and the wider world more responsive
to the needs of the oppressed and marginalized. Creative energy is thus
directed toward transformational changes in global human rights and
becoming catalysts for systemic change. This not just the usual talk but
serious and sustained action to address issues of poverty, deprivation,
inequity, racism, oppression, violence, genocide, starvation, abuse, and
catastrophes.

### Creativity and Technological Innovations {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div1-123 .sec1}

We happen to be living during a time of tremendous upheaval that has
been sparked by political movements, health crises, cultural shifts, and
technology that is evolving at an unprecedented pace that seems, at
times, to be disorienting and overwhelming. Who would have ever
anticipated what our field would become even a decade ago? Who can
accurately predict what things will look like another decade in the
future?

As much as we might find change to be annoying, inconvenient, and
exhausting at times, creative surges are now taking place as a result of
the options provided by ready access to mobile devices. Considering the
tens of thousands of apps available for mental health treatments and
interventions, millions of people are now receiving care for emotional
dysregulation through these profit-making systems. It's definitely a
concern that there are no definitive, reliable sources for credibility
of these options when the overriding motive is to make money. Yet the
potential and creative benefits can be harnessed in such a way to extend
our reach, reduce the burden on clients, encourage work between
sessions, and conduct follow-up on progress ([Pappas,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-249){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0394}).
This is all quite useful, but unfortunately most of those who use these
tools are predominantly white females rather than people who would
normally never have access to therapy ([Schueller et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-278){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0395}).

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_293}There are also serious privacy
considerations related to the ways therapists might harness these
"pocket tools" in their work to augment or even replace scheduled
sessions. What happens to users' most personal and intimate disclosures?
It turns out that three quarters of these apps share their data with
Google, Facebook, YouTube, and other companies for compensation
([Huckvale et al.,
2019](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-135){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0396}).
Even with these challenges and concerns, there is clearly a creative
revolution taking place that will dramatically alter the landscape for
more creative options.

Just as previous discussions have focused on the ways that technology
will expand our creative options, we have also reviewed the potential
for chemical breakthroughs that can jump-start treatments that are
lagging. Who would have imagined a decade ago that mental health
professionals would be prescribing LSD, mescaline, or other psychedelics
as adjuncts? These drugs have always been associated with creative
potential during their earliest days of experimentation, but it is only
recently that hundreds of trials have been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, describing them as "breakthrough therapies" for
conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and severe depression
that have been unresponsive to traditional treatments ([Reiff et al.,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-264){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0397}).

Of course drugs, apps, programs, virtual reality, and other technologies
are just tools that are intended to strengthen our work in sessions.
Ultimately, it is still the quality of our relationships with clients
that will likely always be our most important resource that empowers
anything and everything else we do, whether conducting sessions in
person, via distance, mobile devices, or an avatar.

### Doing Therapy as a Creative Enterprise {#21_chapter14.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-14-div1-124 .sec1}

It often seems like there are two opposing points of view related to
practicing therapy. One approach emphasizes reliability and consistency
in interventions. Some believe that to minimize chance variables and
maximize intentionality, it is crucial for therapists to be able to
replicate what they do. When you find something that works---a
particular anecdote or metaphor, a structure or intervention, or an
interpretation or technique---you should use it again and again because
of its demonstrated effects. Not to do so is to cheat the client of an
empirically tested remedy that is known to be useful.

On a smaller scale, we may tend to rely on the same anecdotes, examples,
and verbalizations that we have honed over time. One standard and
reliable []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_294}response to the client
complaint, "I'm not getting any better," might be to reply, "Then the
therapy must be working because it is helping you become uncomfortable
and therefore more motivated to change." Relying on this well-tested
response may be consistently effective, but in time the therapist using
it may begin to feel like a programmed robot that spits out a canned
answer in response to any given button that is pushed.

Some dedicated and very successful therapists do not mind sacrificing
their own fresh involvement in the spontaneous process of change for the
sake of telling a client something they have told a hundred other
clients previously. One clinician explained his rationale for
consistency in his therapeutic formula: "Look, I've worked a long time
to perfect my favorite metaphors. I have no right to exchange them for
as yet unproven examples just for my own amusement. Of course I get
tired of saying the same things to all my clients, but that's what I'm
paid to do."

Another perspective conceives of each therapy session as an individual
masterpiece. It may (and probably will) contain elements in common with
many other works of art in the same style. The same themes repeat
themselves. The process of change generally follows a predictable
pattern, even if the client's individual history and the therapist's
characteristic style vary. Such a clinician attempts to translate her
energy authentically in every session, to create each therapeutic work
of art with personalized appeal. In the words of one practitioner, "I
have this rule never to repeat myself, or at least not in the precise
way I expressed something before. Even if I don't alter the story, I
will tell it in a different way or relate it more specifically to the
life of a particular client."

This sounds like a lot of additional work, but she can't get the fantasy
out of her head that someday her clients might somehow meet one another
and compare notes about what she said to them. "I can't stand the idea
that they might discover I told them the same thing. It is much harder
on me to stay on my toes and think of new ways to get points across, but
it's worth it: I'm always learning and getting better. And I never get
bored."

The practice of therapy can indeed be an exercise in
creativity---especially in the ways we play with language. We are
playwrights in that we spontaneously compose and direct dialogue, acting
out various roles of nurturer, authority figure, or a character from a
client's life. We are poets in that we create images and metaphors to
illustrate ideas. Over the years, most practitioners have compiled in
their heads a wonderful library of helping stories and therapeutic
anecdotes that they have borrowed or invented. These represent the sum
total of a practitioner's lifework. One of the things we do so well as
we walk through life is collect things that may be useful in a session
at a later time.

[]{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_295}Considering that creativity is
essentially the discovery of an analogy that connects along multiple
planes, therapists are original thinkers of the first order. We use
humor and parody to defuse tension with a client, to confront the client
in a less threatening way, or to discuss taboo subjects that might be
more difficult to approach from a more direct angle. Implicit in a
humorous anecdote or pun could be the nucleus of a major insight, one
that the client may first laugh at before considering the painful truth
that the punchline contains.

Laughter, we know, has a cathartic value of its own. The therapist's
occasional role as a court jester who seeks to coax a smile out of the
frozen features of despair represents only one way that humor can be
used in the therapeutic process. [Koestler (1964, pp.
91--92)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-153){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0398}
found humor to be the best single example of how the creative mind
works:

::: prosequote
To cause surprise the humorist must have a modicum of originality---the
ability to break away from the stereotyped routines of thought.
Caricaturist, satirist, the writer of nonsense-humor, and even the
expert tickler, each operates on more than one plane. Whether his
purpose is to convey a social message, or merely to entertain, he must
provide mental jolts, caused by the collision of incompatible matrices.
:::

The preceding theory of humor could also be a description of therapy
itself: helping people break away from stereotyped routines, providing
mental jolts, and especially encouraging thinking on multiple levels. In
this routine, the therapist is a scholar and practitioner of originality
par excellence. Each and every client presents us with her perception of
a disturbing crisis or a serious problem that has no solution. Because
we are capable of viewing any behavior on many levels, we do not
experience the same feelings of being stuck as the client does. We can
reframe the problem in a different light, change its shape in such a way
that it may be solved more easily. Often this simple maneuver of looking
at the same old problem from a different angle is sufficient in itself
to provide immediate relief.

Originality is evidenced in the therapist's thinking and behavior in
other ways as well. When we stop to consider the conditions that are
likely to spawn creative acts---that is, permissiveness, absence of
external criticism, openness to new experience, acceptance of novelty,
an emphasis on internal control and individual autonomy, flexible
problem-solving, integration of cognitive--affective dimensions, and
psychological safety and support---we realize that we are describing the
experience of therapy in all its glory. The client and the therapist
interact within an environment that is designed to promote the maximum
amount of creative thinking. []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_296}Each gives
the other permission to experiment with new ideas and novel approaches
to problem-solving. The client is encouraged to consider unusual ways of
looking at her life, her goals, and the methods of getting where she
wants to be. While a client is attempting to go beyond previously
defined limits and choices, the therapist is busy processing all the
information that has been presented: Past history, current functioning,
complaints and symptoms, and interaction style are collated in the brain
until finally there is a startling moment of revelation. By combining
all the data in a unique and organized way, the therapist invents a
creative interpretation of the client's behavior. Further innovation is
required to determine the best way to facilitate the client's insights
and, later, to help her act on the knowledge in a constructive manner.

For those therapists who value creativity in their work, innovative
strategies become second nature ([Gladding,
2021](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-100){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0399}).
More importantly, such therapists become less certain of what they
already know. For centuries, helping professionals were absolutely
convinced that the mentally afflicted were possessed with demons that
needed to be exorcised. It is arrogance of the intellect that led to the
Dark Ages. In contemporary times, those of us who are possessed with the
single-minded devotion to a particular rigid way of doing things,
without consideration for revision and evolution, will hardly advance
the state of our profession. Creative therapists now employ all kinds of
alternative modalities to promote *shared creativity* in the
relationship, whether through movement and dance, visualization and
imagery, dramatic enactments, play, writing, art, experiments, and the
use of all kinds of technology as adjuncts.

Creative therapists listen to the voices inside them. They pay attention
to what does *not* make sense, even though things may have always been
done that way. They are constructive rule breakers. They take cases that
make them feel uncomfortable. They treat each case as if it were unique.
And most of all, they enjoy the company of other people who challenge
their ideas. They find their creativity nurtured in their interactions
with colleagues and especially with clients. Even more challenging and
potentially disruptive to routines, they fully expect---and embrace---a
lifetime of struggle, uncertainty, and confusion that they know will
lead to greater self-awareness, growth, and periods of self-renewal that
foster creativity in every way possible.

The mutual creative energy fostered in the client and therapist as they
encounter each other is a final factor in the chain of consequences that
are part of their reciprocal influence. For [Bugental
(1978)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-31){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0400},
being a therapist was much more than earning a living or belonging to a
prestigious profession. It is "an arena for my creativity and endless
raw material to feed it. []{#21_chapter14.xhtml_page_297}It has been the
source of anguish, pain, and anxiety---sometimes in the work itself, but
more frequently within myself and with those important in my life in
confrontations stimulated directly or indirectly by the impact of the
work and relationships with my clients" (pp. 149--150). According to
[Bugental
(1978)](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-31){#21_chapter14.xhtml_n0401},
being a creative therapist involves the process of becoming more aware.
It is not necessary for us to do anything to ourselves, to change
anything in our lives, or to alter our style of helping. Rather, we can
be more aware of ourselves just as we are. This process involves
recovering our own vision, which has become unduly influenced by our
mentors and not influenced enough by our own experiences.

This is where the book actually begins, not concludes. This is the part
of our journey together where you decide what to hold on to, what to
remember, and what to make your own. And as you well know, the prognosis
is pretty poor given how little we remember of any of the books we've
read, workshops we've attended, or training experiences. What will you
take with you from this exploration to access greater compassion? To
embrace the unknown, the complex, the inexplicable? To seek out new and
more diverse mentors among staff, as well as from the larger world? Most
importantly, what aspects of our conversation (and it was a dialogue
between us) will you share with trusted friends, family, and colleagues?

The creative process is such an integral part of *being* a therapist
that it is difficult to avoid integrating what we learn in our work to
our personal lives. Our clients do indeed change us almost as much as we
change them. Even though we know, understand, and enforce the rules and
guard against infection by clients, and even though they are amateurs at
influence, befuddled and distracted as they are with their own concerns,
we cannot remain completely unaffected. We are touched by their goodness
and the joy and privilege we feel in being allowed to get so close to a
human soul. And we are sometimes affected by their malicious and
destructive energy. Whenever we enter a room with another life in great
torment, we will find no escape from our own despair. And we will find
no way to hold down the elation we feel as a witness to another person's
transformation---just as we are the catalyst for our own.

[How to Get the Most From Therapy](#04_Contents1.xhtml_n0017)

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div1-125}"I've been
in therapy for several months and I've been seriously wondering if my
therapist really gets me. He seems like a nice guy and all, and he came
highly recommended from a friend, but it feels like most of the time we
are just having conversations about stuff but I don't feel any better.
How do I know if it's worth continuing with him? Or, I guess a better
question is how do I tell him that our sessions aren't helping me?"

Although the main audience for this book has traditionally been
therapists and counselors, it has been available to the general public
for many decades, leading people who are currently in therapy, or
contemplating such a decision, to search for advice about their current
and future therapeutic experiences. Such clients, or prospective
consumers, sometimes feel confused or dissatisfied in some way with
their current course of treatment and want to know what they could---or
should---do to change the way things are going. In many cases, they just
want to know when it's time to quit altogether and find someone else who
might be a better match or else the best way to inform their therapist
how unhappy they are with the way things have been proceeding.

These are always very delicate questions to address because, on the one
hand, I want to be supportive, yet on the other hand, I realize I only
know a very small part of the story, and I also don't want to do or say
anything that might somehow compromise the therapist's efforts. I am
aware that sometimes I'm just a convenient means by which some people
might "tattle" on []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_299}their therapist or use
me as an excuse to get out of something that they find uncomfortable. I
also realize that the client's perception and experience of what is
happening---or what is *reported* to me in an incomplete message---is
just one part of the whole relationship and its meaning.

Nevertheless, there is considerable research to support the idea that
therapy doesn't work very well if both (or all) parties are not on the
same page, are not (mostly) honest with one another, and don't regularly
share their reactions to what is going on and how they feel about it.
Often clients simply don't tell their therapists about things they
like---and those they don't---because they don't want to disappoint an
authority figure.

Like any other professional guild, therapists are a pretty diverse group
(perhaps even a *lot* more varied that others). We have not only dozens
of different approaches but also some rather unique and personalized
styles in terms of the ways we like to work. It is no surprise that a
client might consult several different professionals and become
increasingly confused after hearing just as many diagnostic impressions
regarding the presenting problem and even more ideas about the best way
to deal with the issues. In addition, it is certainly true that some
professionals are more capable than others. How is someone who is
currently involved in therapy, or considering the possibility, to
determine if he or she is getting the most out of sessions? And if
benefits and results are being compromised in some way, how can one take
the initiative to get more from the experience?

There's a lot of training to become a therapist, but not much in the way
of preparation for how to become a great client. Some sources review the
basics for how to choose a therapist, what to talk about while you are
there, and how to optimize the sessions to better meet desired goals The
following discussion is designed to demystify some of the secrets.

### Some Key Questions That Clients Might Have About Therapy {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div1-126 .sec1}

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-67}Let's
acknowledge at the outset that psychotherapy is a pretty strange
enterprise. You sit with someone whose job is to listen to your story,
ask questions, and then talk to you about what is most upsetting. This
professional doesn't actually *do* anything besides talk---she doesn't
apply any procedures, surgical interventions, or, in most cases, even
offer any drugs. It's just about talking with one another, with the
anticipation that such conversations will cure, if not ameliorate, any
disturbing symptoms of depression, anxiety, loneliness, or confusion.
That's pretty remarkable []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_300}in itself, but
then consider that there is not necessarily universal, much less
standard, agreement on the best way to proceed. As mentioned repeatedly
in this book, we don't even fully understand how and why the process
works---and if we think we do, there's likely a half-dozen alternative
explanations that may directly contradict what is offered. So, if you
aren't confused, you aren't paying attention. You should have *lots* of
questions. I've been doing this an awfully long time, and I *still* have
lots of questions.

#### 1. First of all, how do I know if I need therapy? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-68 .sec2}

Not many people actually *need* therapy, but it sure is useful and
helpful to most people much of the time. Whereas it used to be the case
that therapy was for those with severe emotional disturbances or mental
illness, nowadays the field has expanded to serve a wide variety of
concerns, problems, and issues. This can---and still does---not only
include rather serious emotional or behavioral problems but also covers
those who are experiencing some adjustment difficulties, problems of
daily living, or just want someone to talk to about ideas and feelings.

Rarely does anyone seek therapy as a first, or even a second, choice. It
is often expensive, if not in money then in expenditure of time. And it
often hurts, or at least is uncomfortable at times. But if you are
suffering in some way, just plain confused or lost, or perhaps just have
something on your mind you'd like to sort out, then therapy is indeed an
excellent option. Most people are very satisfied with their experience,
and, contrary to popular belief, it doesn't need to take a long time;
some people get what they want in just a few sessions, while others
enjoy the process for years, as long as they are making continued
progress.

With that said, you probably could benefit from therapy if you are
consistently not getting what you want in life or if you don't feel you
are satisfied with the way things are going. Whereas mild or severe
depression, loneliness, anxiety or severe stress, previous trauma or
abuse, addictions or bad habits, ruminations, interpersonal conflicts,
family problems, career dissatisfaction, poor school or work
performance, and physical symptoms that appear to have some
psychological component to them are all common reasons why clients seek
help, some people also do so because they need a place to work things
out without concern for being pressured by someone who might not have
their best interests at heart.

You might also consider therapy if others in your life, especially
friends or family members who know you well, believe that you have
problems that you appear to be unwilling to address. While it may be
true that this []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_301}pressure is more related
to *their* difficulties rather than your own, when you receive
consistent feedback from more than one reliable person, it is time to
consider that there might be something worth examining.

Could you talk with a friend or colleague instead? Of course you can.
But the reasons why people seek a therapist, and even pay for that
privilege, are because they want someone who is reasonably objective,
who won't meet his or her own needs, and who will likely respond in a
caring yet honest way. It also helps that a professional has so much
more training than a "friend," especially with regard to differential
diagnosis, treatment strategies, listening and responding skills, and
especially a deep understanding of the issues presented.

#### 2. What do people talk about in therapy? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-69 .sec2}

In the past, what people talk about in therapy has often been about
feelings of depression or anxiety, family conflicts, addictions and
destructive habits, or a sense of frustration about some aspect of one's
job, living situation, or lifestyle. During the past few years, we've
seen a crop of new and different issues that are brought to sessions,
such as the following:

:::

As perceived threats, societal disruptions, political conflicts, and
fears and uncertainty about the future continue to evolve, so too will
the effects spread to personal well-being and the need for support and
assistance. No matter how unusual you may think your problems might be,
most experienced therapists have pretty much already seen and heard it
all before.

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_302}There is usually a balance between the
therapist and client each talking to one another, and it is usually not
a good idea if only one partner in the process carries all the
conversation. Some clients complain that their therapist never says or
offers much and appears rather passive; others don't like that their
therapist talks constantly, almost all the time, rarely allowing them to
get a word in. Probably either extreme is not ideal since there should
be an exchange of thoughts and feelings during the interaction, one in
which each partner has a chance to engage with one another in a
spirited, meaningful way.

It is certainly the case that some approaches emphasize a more active
role for the therapist and others encourage the client to do most of the
work. Likewise, each therapist has evolved a somewhat personal style
that (it is hoped) best suits his or her personality and creates
sufficient space for the clients to share whatever is on their minds.
This could include anything that arose during the week, things that are
bothersome or confusing, or perhaps just something that comes up in the
moment. The whole idea of therapy that makes it so wonderful and special
is that you can talk about absolutely *anything* without fear of
critical judgment. It is, perhaps, the one safe place where you can
unload whatever is most upsetting or worrisome, talk about any subject
on your mind, or bring up any issue that is confusing.

What should you talk about in therapy?

Whatever you want, but especially whatever you *don't* want to talk
about.

#### 3. How do I find not only a good therapist, but also a truly *great* one---and how will I know the difference? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-70 .sec2}

Unfortunately, it is initially really, really difficult to tell a good
therapist from a lousy one, much less identify one who is truly
exceptional. Famous therapists, or those who write books or give
lectures, aren't necessarily the best practitioners by any means. It may
very well be that some of us reduced clinical practice to move into
other areas because we weren't very good at it or grew tired or bored
from the routines. Whereas I'd like to think that I was (and am) pretty
good at clinical work, I also admit that I diversified my professional
life precisely because I no longer wanted to do sessions all day.

Our field is extremely confusing, not only because there are so many
different theoretical orientations and treatment approaches numbering in
the hundreds, but also because there are so many disciplines in this
profession. Should you see a social worker, a psychologist, a counselor,
a family therapist, or a psychiatrist? Should you see someone with a
master's degree []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_303}or someone with a
doctorate or medical degree? And what about the particular license that
the clinician holds? It turns out that although each of these degrees
and disciplines comes from a different academic tradition, there really
isn't much evidence to support that one is necessarily superior to the
others, although it depends on the client needs and complaints.
Psychiatrists should be considered as a first option for those who may
require medication or medical treatments for a problem that has organic
origins, such as biologically based depression, panic disorder, or a
similar diagnosis. But even these problems still require therapy along
with any prescribed drugs. Likewise, each of the other professional
specialties may be more suitable for certain issues. For instance, a
couple having difficulties would often be advised to seek a couples
therapist to work on the relationship as a first option rather than
seeing someone who specializes in individual therapy.

If you can't rely on reputation, then how do you find a professional who
is really good? Therapy is all about relational connections, and that is
a highly personal level of engagement that is often hard to predict. It
is usually a good idea to ask a friend, colleague, family doctor, or
someone you trust, to offer a referral---but that is only a place to
begin since each person has different preferences.

Master therapists, those who are truly exceptional in what they do and
how they do it, are indeed unusual because of several things they tend
to do on a regular basis. It turns out that a lot of things don't really
predict excellence very well, such as the particular approach that is
favored, the particular degree or license, or even the number of years
in the field. What *does* matter the most is that the therapist takes
the time and effort to find out from you regularly and systematically
what is working best for you and what is not working much at all.

Truly exceptional therapists not only are masters of technique,
brilliant theoreticians, and extremely knowledgeable about human
experience, but also holders of certain personal characteristics that
empower their influence and interventions. You will notice, almost
immediately, that they exude an aura of wisdom and reassurance. They are
compassionate and caring, utterly composed, even in the face of crises
you discuss. They have the ability---and the willingness---to remain
completely and fully present in the moment, often in such a way that it
feels like they are reading your mind and heart. They are highly
flexible and pragmatic, which makes them well equipped to continually
adapt what they are doing and how they are responding, depending on
exactly what is required. Just as important, they are able to model and
demonstrate in their own lives what they consider most critical to teach
you. And yet---and yet---even with all these
[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_304}skills and capabilities, they remain
modest and humble, recognizing that, ultimately, it's the client who
deserves most of the credit for any progress gained.

Really great practitioners also don't limit themselves to options that
are embedded in a single approach, regardless of their preferred
orientation. They combine and integrate features and interventions from
a wide assortment of approaches that may include relational engagement
(humanistic), unconscious desires (psychodynamic), beliefs and attitudes
(cognitive), unresolved attachment issues (emotionally focused), family
dynamics (systemic), story reconceptualization (narrative), issues of
meaning and purpose (existential), issues of oppression and cultural
indoctrination (feminist), as well as task facilitation (behavioral) and
several others. In each and every case, the clinician is continuously
making assessments regarding what is best indicated, what is most
effective, and what is not. What distinguishes master therapists from
the rest more than anything else is their willingness to experiment with
a variety of strategies, according to what is needed most.

#### 4. How do I know which therapeutic approach is best for my situation? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-71 .sec2}

In addition to the particular "type" or model of therapy, there is a
decision to be made regarding whether to attend sessions remotely or in
person. As discussed throughout this book, the two formats are
equivalent in many ways, but clearly not the same since there are
particular advantages and limitations of each option. Keep in mind that
you get what you pay for, not only in terms of fees paid but also
related to the effort invested in the process. It may be incredibly
convenient to "attend" sessions within the comfort and safety of your
favorite chair, but there is also something to be said for the extra
work and additional commitment involved in going to sessions in an
office. Clients often report they do some of their best work during the
commute back and forth, when they have idle time to reflect on what they
wish to cover and what they think and feel after the session is over.
There are never interruptions or distractions. And your therapist has
access to a lot more information and options when you are both in the
same room.

You probably don't know the answer to this question about which model,
approach, or format might be best---although, in all fairness, depending
on the presenting problem there are certain interventions
[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_305}and strategies that are considered
optimal, often supported by empirical research. You should keep in mind
that although therapists do sometimes identify strongly with a
particular theory or model, most of us are fairly flexible in adapting
what we do, and how we do it, to fit each client and issues.
Nevertheless, there are indeed some approaches that are a better fit for
certain concerns, depending on how much the person is in crisis, how
much interest there is in exploring the past, or whether there is time
to delve into one area or another. It's a good idea to ask the therapist
to explain his or her approach, as well as to do some research on your
own.

#### 5. Among other options besides the style or approach, is individual, group, or family therapy preferred? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-72 .sec2}

The choice of individual, group, or family therapy depends on several
factors. I know you are tired of these evasive answers (although that's
often what therapists do), but the reality is that it's difficult to
determine which theoretical orientation, or which delivery system, is
ideal for a particular client. In one sense, depending on the
practitioner, almost any particular approach can be suitable for a
particular case. Yet it is also true that some kinds of issues respond
best to certain modalities. For instance, group therapy provides all
kinds of opportunities to deal with interpersonal issues, receive lots
of honest feedback from others, and actually try out and rehearse new
behaviors. We live and operate in a world of groups most of the time, so
this structure provides the best possible simulation to practice new
skills. On the other hand, for those who are shy and reticent or those
who may have what are called more "florid" styles of personality
(meaning they can be overbearing and controlling), groups may not be the
best option.

There are many practitioners who think of *all* therapy as taking place
within a family context, no matter who actually attends sessions.
Nevertheless, when the main difficulty is related to family disputes or
conflicts, it makes sense to get as many parties into the room as
possible to deal with the underlying systemic dysfunctions and patterns
that are contributing to the impasse. Finally, ongoing individual
therapy sessions are almost a luxury these days with such an emphasis on
cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and delivering services that are most
culturally appropriate, although they do provide excellent opportunities
to address an individual's self-defeating behaviors.

#### []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_306}6. What about doing therapy online or via videoconference? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-73 .sec2}

Doing therapy online or via videoconference is a mixed blessing, as
discussed previously. Clearly, it is the wave of the future, offering
increased convenience and efficiency. I can imagine a time in the
not-too-distant future when perhaps most therapy and services will be
delivered via avatars, simulations, or distance-based systems.
Therapists especially appreciate the flexibility of these options
because they can just schedule sessions from anywhere they have Internet
access. Likewise, clients can save commuting time and expense and also
access more qualified professionals from anywhere in the world. Many
clients also report anecdotally that they are often willing to share
things online or via videoconferences or audio conferences that they
likely wouldn't be able to do in person.

Although I do see (and have seen) a few clients online and enjoy the
experience, I also find it quite different. I acknowledge all the
advantages and yet still see definite limitations to this modality,
however convenient it might be. One therapist ([Borges,
2020](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-24){#22_chapter15.xhtml_n0402})
conveyed some of the frustrations that are sometimes mentioned: "Why do
I hate virtual therapy? Let me count the ways. My Wi-Fi connection sucks
and cuts out when I'm trying to have a freaking breakthrough! Body
language is lost! Silences are awkward! I get distracted by my own face
on video chat! I could go on and on."

There is indeed something to be said for being in a room with someone,
including access to all the cues, nonverbal behavior, sights, sounds,
smells, and feelings that may not be nearly as visible on a screen and
not accessible at all on the phone. I've also never really conceived
therapy as being limited to the actual sessions---I think so much of the
work takes place when people are on the way to the appointment,
considering what they want to talk about, reviewing the last session, or
planning how they want to best use the time. And on the way home,
clients also review what was said, consider what it all means, and
continue to process the conversation afterward. Can this happen anyway
after the client disconnects online? Of course it can. But I still think
that the more we invest of ourselves in a process, including commitment
of time and energy, the more we often get out of it.

In summary, seeking a therapist for distance-based treatment is becoming
increasingly popular, but, as yet, there are a number of ethical,
procedural, and legal issues still being sorted out considering the
different licensing jurisdictions and lack of solid empirical research
(and training) on best practices. In addition, many insurance and
third-party payers will not support online or video-based treatment, so
it is best to check. []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_307}Finally, there are
confidentiality and privacy issues that have yet to be fully addressed
and remain a concern.

#### 7. What do I do if my financial resources are limited and I can't afford much of a fee? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-74 .sec2}

See Question 6. There is often far more leverage and negotiating room in
fees if you are not limited by your local options. In addition, almost
any good therapist has a sliding scale based on ability to pay and
financial resources; many practitioners take pro bono cases for those
who can only afford a few dollars.

Most schools, institutions, and communities offer free mental health
services for students, employees, or residents. Whether through
religion-affiliated organizations (Catholic Social Services, Jewish
Family Services, Muslim Family Services, Institute for Buddhist Studies,
Christian Counseling Services, etc.), state or county mental health
services, or those agencies supported by grants, charters, public
donations, or charities, a host of options are available for those who
can't afford private pay or don't have health insurance that covers part
or all of the cost.

In other words, some people may use money as an excuse for not seeking
the help they need, but there are always affordable and viable options
available.

#### 8. How do I know if my therapist is a good match for me? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-75 .sec2}

If you are already in therapy and asking that question, there very well
could be some concerns about whether the relationship is compatible.
Ideally, a solid alliance is one in which you can talk about most
anything. You would trust your therapist to the point that almost
nothing is off limits, and you feel you can reveal any part of yourself.
You feel respected by your therapist and allowed to move at your own
pace. In addition, you genuinely like this person and admire him or her.

Therapeutic relationships are delicate matters, at least during their
inception and initial negotiation. Patterns are established. Rules and
boundaries are established. And sometimes what clients agree to do, and
how they were told things would go, are not necessarily what they want
and desire. That isn't usually much of a problem as long as it feels
like there is an opportunity to renegotiate the contract, so to speak.
Just to be able to say, []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_308}"I'm not happy
with the way this is structured," is usually enough to change the
established template. But often clients don't speak up for a variety of
reasons. They don't feel safe doing so. They don't want to disappoint
their therapist. Because of the perceived inequity of power, they don't
feel comfortable challenging an authority figure who is supposedly an
expert.

If something doesn't feel right, then it is absolutely critical to say
so. Every time someone complains about their therapist, that they don't
feel heard or understood, that their therapist seems quirky or
confusing, or that they aren't making progress, my first reaction is to
ask if they'd said something about that in session. Of course, maybe if
it felt safe and comfortable to do so, then there wouldn't be a problem.
But perhaps the single most important thing a client can do to maintain
control over his or her own therapy is to tell the therapist when things
aren't working out as anticipated or hoped. Sometimes that is the result
of unrealistic expectations, but at other times it can mean that there
is some misunderstanding or disconnection in the relationship.

As awkward and uncomfortable as it felt at the time, I recall a few
instances when I was confronted by clients telling me they weren't happy
with the way things were going and were ready to quit. I resisted trying
to talk them out of that, or becoming defensive, and instead simply
asked them what we could be doing---or should be doing---instead.
Inevitably such discussions led to breakthroughs that allowed us to
alter the path we were taking and instead to head in a different
direction that was more suitable. But without such honest and direct
input, nothing much will change; the client will drop out, perhaps give
up the search for help; and the therapist will never find out what he or
she was doing (or not doing) that proved so ineffective.

#### 9. How do I know if therapy is working or not? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-76 .sec2}

The question of how you know if therapy is working is an easy one: If
you are getting better and feeling better, then therapy is working---and
that should start happening within a relatively short period of time,
often just a few weeks. Clients often report they already feel much
better just making a first appointment, making an effort to get help.
The first few meetings usually instill some hope and provide some
structure for work to be done. If that is not the case, it's time to
reassess.

On the other hand, it is sometimes the case that you might feel worse
before you start to feel better. After all, growth, learning, and change
are often uncomfortable, so there can be a transitional period of
disorientation []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_309}when symptoms may not
improve right away until new skills and knowledge are mastered and put
to work. It is important to be patient, but only within reasonable
limits before considering other options.

It isn't enough to rely solely on your own judgment regarding how you
feel. Ask the therapist about his or her own impressions of initial
progress. It's just as valuable to solicit input from significant others
who know you best: What have they noticed has changed or is different
about you? One of the legitimate criticisms of therapy over the years is
that some people report that they feel better and that they thoroughly
enjoy their sessions after attending diligently for months, if not
years, and yet there is little noticeable change in their self-defeating
behaviors. They may have fantastic insight into their problems, talk up
a storm during sessions, and appear cooperative and responsive, but
nothing has fundamentally been adjusted in the outside world. They
continue to engage in the same kinds of ways that got them in trouble in
the first place.

Feeling better and enjoying sessions is important. So, too, is the
therapist's assessment that definite progress is being made. But,
ultimately, the true test is whether you have actually internalized what
you've learned and started applying those new skills and ideas on a
daily basis. Talk is fine, but it's action that counts most.

#### 10. What might I be doing---or *not* doing---that is limiting the potential progress I could be making? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-77 .sec2}

It's one thing to blame your therapist because you aren't getting what
you want and quite another to examine your own contributions to the
impasse. Keep in mind that virtually all interpersonal disagreements or
conflicts represent a collective effort; it is never exclusively one
person's fault. As easy it might be to accuse your therapist of
incompetence or cluelessness, it is usually far more helpful to examine
your own role in the struggle, particularly with regard to what you are
doing to make things difficult.

What might you be doing to deliberately/unconsciously/inadvertently
sabotage therapy? Try out a few of the following to see how they fit:

:::

What is sometimes operating during impasses is that clients may very
well be enjoying benefits or payoffs as a result of remaining stuck.
That may sound strange, but it is actually quite common that we tend to
avoid change if it is at all possible because it's so much work to learn
new coping strategies. Even when behaviors are clearly counterproductive
or self-defeating, human beings are still inclined to continue them in
order to avoid the unknown or possible alternatives they believe could
be worse. People stay in abusive, neglectful, or limiting situations
because they have learned to tolerate the present circumstances (with
complaints), however unpleasant, and fear that things could become far
worse. Clients []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_311}may also slow things down
in sessions, sabotage progress, deceive, play games, or engage defenses
in order to distract from other issues or control things on their own
terms. They have a ready excuse for behaving badly ("I can't help it.
That's just the way I am"); can blame others for the problems ("It's not
my fault they don't understand me"); and avoid responsibility for their
plight. Until such time that people become aware of what they're doing,
even if unconsciously (which is often the case), it's pretty hard to
address the underlying ambivalence that is undermining the therapy.

#### 11. What are some things that you might not realize can heighten the impact of therapy and help you get more out of the experience? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-78 .sec2}

If the examples above are some of the reasons why you are not getting
the most from therapy, then there are certainly some things you can do
to alter that scenario. It is important to understand, for example, that
what you do outside of therapy is even more important than what you talk
about during sessions.

A second suggestion, if your therapist has not yet mentioned this, is
that it really helps a lot to keep a journal in which you continue the
work on your own. This is the place where you can process and apply the
things you are learning, keep a record of themes and issues you are
addressing, set goals for future sessions or your life, and continue the
conversations with your therapist---and yourself. Years in the future it
will be fascinating to go back and follow the threads of your journey.
This is quite different from posting updates on social media for the
benefit of others; a journal is a *private* space to wrestle with the
questions and concerns that bother you the most.

If you wish to intensify and magnify the effects of therapeutic work, it
really helps to write about your own internal thoughts, as well as what
you might be holding back during sessions. What are the issues you are
avoiding? There are always certain events, actions, or experiences in
your life about which we feel shame or regret. You may reason they are
not worth mentioning, but they can also signal areas worth exploring. If
there is one thing that holds people back from more open and honest
disclosure it's the fear of judgment, that once your therapist figures
out what you are *really* like you will be scorned and rejected, just as
has happened previously in life. Instead of avoiding those problems that
are most disturbing, therapy is the place to lean into them.

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_312}Ask yourself: What are some of the
topics you wish you could bring up---if only you felt more trust and
greater safety and were willing to take additional risks? Now, imagine
that you *did* feel increased courage and commitment: What would you
talk about that you are avoiding? What's stopping you from doing so?
What would it take for you to be more open, honest, and forthcoming? And
if the answer to these questions is that you just aren't getting what
you want and need, or that you just can't go there, maybe it's time to
take a break or try something else.

#### 12. When is it time to quit? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-79 .sec2}

I like the question concerning when it is time to quit a lot because I
find it so endlessly interesting and complex. When is it time to stop
therapy? Maybe when you first start contemplating this question? Or
perhaps that's a sign that you are avoiding something important that you
wish to escape?

One standard response to such an inquiry usually challenges a client's
resolve: "So just when things are getting tough you want to quit?" That
might prompt a certain amount of guilt and then invite a discussion
about the work left to do before closure could and should be considered.
But over the years I've changed my tactics: When a client wonders if it
is time to quit, I usually support that choice immediately: "Maybe
that's an excellent idea! Why don't we take a break for a while and see
how things go?"

I want clients to assume complete responsibility for their sessions, so
I put them in charge of what we do and how we do it, even how often we
meet. It's not like I don't have my own opinions and expertise on these
matters, but I also think it's more important that clients remain in
charge of their own recovery and treatment. Of course I don't like to
see clients leave; it hurts in its own way. I also don't like to see
people abandon ship, especially when there is so much work left to do.

Traditionally, therapy is ended after the treatment goals have been met,
however those were identified and operationally defined. Yet there are
often two levels of therapeutic work, the first of which includes the
so-called presenting problems. These are the symptomatic concerns that
were disruptive enough for the person to seek help. Depending on the
issue, problem, or disorder, treatment usually lasts a few weeks or
months, at least during this era of brief therapy and empirically
supported treatments. However, aside from what was initially presented,
therapeutic explorations often excavate other issues that may be worth
examining. These can involve existential questions such as, "What is the
meaning of my life?" "What do I want to do before I die?" "How can I
take more responsibility for my []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_313}life
choices?" "What can I do to make life more satisfying?" These sorts of
questions represent the meaning-making efforts that can be investigated
once initial problems are resolved---assuming you want to stick around
long enough to get into these areas.

With all these points acknowledged, sometimes it makes sense to take a
temporary break from sessions to give yourself time to integrate what
has already been learned and to internalize the lessons and practice the
new skills. Unlike other activities, therapy doesn't necessarily have a
clear and definitive endpoint, so it's difficult to tell when you are
"done." In one sense none of us ever completely "graduates" since we
always have unresolved issues that could be explored and addressed. On
the other hand, there usually comes a time when progress feels stalled,
when conversations feel repetitive, and this may be time for an
intermission. This may not be so much an escape from discomfort, or
avoidance of necessary work, but may genuinely reflect the need to
process everything that has occurred thus far or to just refresh oneself
after what might have felt like a grueling marathon.

It's a good idea before you decide to take some time off to first
discuss this with your therapist. Together you can make a collaborative
decision about whether this is to be a temporary break or permanent
ending. In many cases, a compromise position adjusts the frequency,
duration, or type of sessions to change things up.

#### 13. What do I do if I relapse or fall back after the sessions end? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-80 .sec2}

A better question than what to do if you relapse or fall back after
sessions end might ask the following: What do you do *when* relapses
inevitably occur? It is a virtual certainty that even after spectacular
progress there will be some backsliding. It is almost impossible to
avoid setbacks and not slip back into old, familiar patterns. This is
not necessarily a problem---unless you are unprepared and unrehearsed
for how to handle the relapse.

Prior to ending sessions, there is often some discussion of aftercare.
Some therapists help their clients to role-play and practice failure
scenarios, recovering almost effortlessly to demonstrate that such fears
are unwarranted:

::: prosequote
So what if you slip up and lose your temper again? That is only a
temporary lapse which you can easily recover from by practicing the
self-talk strategies that we've gone over so often. Let's practice that
again now. I want you get mad at me over something, anything, just the
way you used to during our early meetings.
[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_314}And then I'm not going to respond at all
because I want *you* to regain control on your own, just as we've
practiced.
:::

### Common Reasons Why Clients Drop Out of Therapy {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div1-127 .sec1}

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-81}![image](img/oso-9780197604458-graphic-025.jpg)

There are varied estimates about how often clients end therapy
prematurely, ranging from about 5% to 60%, depending on the therapist
and the kind of treatment offered. It is a difficult figure to settle on
considering that clients may end their sessions for all kinds of reasons
that don't necessarily signal a problem. Maybe they relocated to another
area. Heck, maybe they already got what they wanted and didn't feel the
need to return. Most of the time therapists don't find out why clients
never returned and are left to wonder. After all, it is so much easier
for someone to just cancel an appointment and say they'll
reschedule---or just send a text, email, or leave a message saying that
he or she intends to take a little break but will call back when ready
and available so you can continue the work together.

In ideal circumstances, several sessions are devoted to deal with
closure. There would first be a summary of what was accomplished,
comparing those outcomes to what was expected and planned. There are
always unresolved issues that can be identified and described, even if
there is a choice not to deal with them at this time. In such an
intimate relationship, with deep feelings by both parties, it is
important to have a ritual for saying goodbye in a caring, supportive
way. As mentioned, it is also critical that time is spent preparing for
what follows next so that clients can internalize what
[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_315}was learned and function independently
without needing the therapist's support any longer.

Even with all this planning during optimal circumstances, the reality is
that somewhere around one quarter to one third of clients prematurely
(according to the therapist's perspective) end sessions before goals
have been (apparently) attained. There are several very good reasons why
clients might choose not to return, at least according to their own
views.

#### My Therapist Doesn't Understand Me {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-82 .sec2}

If your therapist doesn't understand you it would indeed be a serious
problem if it feels like all the therapist is interested in doing is
talking, advising, lecturing, instructing, and challenging, but doesn't
seem to demonstrate much compassion, empathy, and hovering attention.
People often go to therapy in the first place because they don't feel
heard and understood by others in their lives. So apart from anything
else that happens related to the presenting problems, it is really
important that you feel like your therapist really and truly hears and
understands you in a way that has never quite occurred previously.

One corollary of this theme is not so much connected to feeling
misunderstood as the realization that the therapist doesn't seem to
agree with you about certain matters. I would say this is not only a
frequent complaint but also one that is to be expected. *Of course* the
therapist doesn't necessarily agree with the client's view of what's
wrong and what needs to be done, especially given that this perspective
usually involves blaming others. There is usually some negotiation that
takes place in the beginning, with the client presenting his or her take
on things: "It's not my fault I'm in this situation. If only. . . ."
Then the therapist presents an alternative view, one that usually
emphasizes greater self-responsibility and personal control. Naturally,
this is disappointing to hear when you hoped the therapist was on your
side. And of course the therapist *is* on your side, which is why he or
she disagrees with any assessment that means a further loss of control.

#### I Feel Judged {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-83 .sec2}

*Feeling* judged versus actually *being* judged might be two different
entities. But if someone's feeling judged by another, whether that is an
accurate assessment or not, that doesn't make it feel any less real.
Therapy is all []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_316}about sharing secrets,
some of them shameful, others very difficult to even mention. It is easy
to imagine that when talking about a sensitive subject for the first
time that the person listening must be repulsed by the disclosure. "I'm
having an affair." "I drink almost every night." "I hate my father."

The truth of the matter is that most therapists have heard it all
before, usually many times before in every imaginable permutation, so we
really aren't thinking to ourselves that you are naughty or unlovable.
Clients disclose the most unusual, interesting, and yet uniquely human
foibles, for most of which they feel terrible shame. We try to normalize
these feelings as much as possible, communicate acceptance and
understanding, as well as help the person make different choices if that
behavior is counterproductive in some way.

But this is an easy one to address: If you feel judged, speak up and say
something! That is a very inhibiting obstacle to being more authentic,
honest, and genuine, which, after all, is the purpose of attending
sessions in addition to solving problems.

#### It Hurts Too Much {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-84 .sec2}

I don't know about hurting "too much," but therapy *does*
hurt---Sometimes a lot. After all, you are digging up the past, talking
about the forbidden, scrutinizing every aspect of your behavior,
processing conflicts, and talking about failures. You are constantly
being challenged, sometimes confronted vigorously.

The tender places that are touched, the wounds that are not yet healed,
and the unresolved issues of the past all bring with them a certain
discomfort, if not suffering. But, it is hoped, it is the kind of pain
that ultimately leads to growth and deeper understanding. As you well
know, some of the healthiest things that we must do---exercise, diet,
complete chores, or resolve conflicts---involve sacrifice and hurt.
That's how healing often takes place.

#### My Therapist Talks Too Much---Or Doesn't Talk at All {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-85 .sec2}

Some therapists do talk a lot, maybe even most of the time; others may
not talk at all. There are certain approaches that emphasize
instruction, tutoring, coaching, and learning new skills and ways of
being, just as there are others where the therapist takes a far more
measured role, listening, []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_317}cuing,
facilitating, but perhaps speaking mainly to offer an interpretation,
analysis, or summary. It's up to you to locate a therapist whose style
matches your preferences and particular needs. Once you find such a
professional, it's also up to you to negotiate a pattern of interaction
that is most helpful and fits best. If you find yourself talking all the
time in session and rarely getting anything back, that could reflect a
particular therapeutic style that might be worth exploring further or
else looking elsewhere for something more compatible. And if your
therapist talks too much and doesn't appear to want to listen,
interrupting you constantly, telling stories you've heard before, and
lecturing you in a condescending way, then it may also be time to seek
help elsewhere.

#### I Don't Understand What Is Expected---Or Where This Is Going {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-86 .sec2}

Ask, just ask if you don't understand what is expected or where the
therapy is going. Often the most interesting, stimulating, and impactful
conversations are those in which you take a risk and reach beyond what
is initially uncomfortable. There may be several times, in every single
session, when your therapist will do or say things that you don't quite
understand, but you nod your head anyway, pretending you grasp where
things are going. I encourage every client to think of him- or herself
as a therapist in training as well as a client, which means thinking
critically about what has worked best and what hasn't worked much at
all. Therapists should have a clear rationale for everything they say or
do, one they can articulate or explain if you take the time to ask them.

#### My Therapist Keeps Asking Me to Do Things I Can't (or Won't) Do {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-87 .sec2}

One of the most frequent mistakes that therapists make is to ask clients
to do something for which the client is not yet ready or prepared. We do
become impatient and want things to move along. We are under pressure to
get this work done as quickly as possible, and we understand how
important it is to convert talk into constructive action.

Some therapists prescribe homework assignments: "Why don't you talk to
several of your friends to find out what they think about your new
decision?" Some therapists push, persuade, or challenge clients to
experiment with new behaviors: "Let's try that now. I'm going to ask to
borrow something from you and I want you to stay no---and then refuse to
feel badly []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_318}about that." Other therapists
suggest courses of action directly related to the presenting problem:
"Given that your anxiety seems much worse when you have to speak in
front of large groups, maybe it would be best if you avoided putting
yourself in those situations for a while."

However well intended, clients---and their therapists---become
frustrated when the assignments are not actually completed. Excuses
abound: "I forgot." "I didn't have time." "The opportunity never came
up." "I changed my mind." That last comment is probably pretty accurate
in that no matter what people say is important, if they don't actually
follow through then it wasn't very important in the first place. We find
the time and opportunities to do the things that really matter most to
us. Therapists also sometimes need reminders from their clients that
they may not feel ready to do what is clearly in their best interests.

#### It's Too Expensive {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-88 .sec2}

Even if the fee is paid by a third party or is a free service, time is
money. It is a major commitment to devote priorities and energy to
therapy sessions. It often feels like a luxury that takes time away from
other things that are also important. Yet people squander their time and
money on all kinds of things that are far less helpful, spending hours
each day watching mindless television or playing video games, adding to
their wardrobe collection, or blowing limited funds on empty
entertainment that does nothing but use up time.

Therapy is as much an investment in your future as any stock, savings,
or retirement account. It represents a commitment to continued growth
and an improved sense of well-being and life satisfaction. It is just
about the most useful and practical education that anyone could possibly
desire.

#### I'm Actually Becoming Worse {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-89 .sec2}

The vast majority of therapists are highly professional and competent,
not to mention really nice people. But we have a few colleagues within
our midst who engage in dubious or unethical behavior. Let's be clear on
the rules: *Everything* that a therapist does is supposed to be designed
to protect your welfare and promote your best interests. Therapists are
not permitted to meet their own needs in any way. If you experience your
therapist as self-indulgent, manipulative, dishonest, or seductive or if
you have some []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_319}qualms about his or her
professionalism, then those are definite warning signs that it may be
time to end the relationship.

#### "They" Don't Want Me to Come Back Any More {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-90 .sec2}

Many clients don't necessarily want to stop therapy, but they are being
pressured or "blackmailed" into doing so by another family member. It is
often the case that significant others feel confused, disoriented, or
even threatened by changes that are made in sessions. When one person in
a family or system changes in some way, it requires others to
accommodate and adapt to this shift. That usually involves some degree
of discomfort and work, something they would prefer to avoid. Given a
choice between sabotaging the therapy and pulling the family member back
into the fold---however dysfunctional the system---or allowing the
growth to continue, it is far easier just to end the therapy. Partners
or significant others may forbid the client from returning or do their
level best to undermine the progress. In such cases, that is a strong
indicator that a joint family session would be desirable to work on
these issues.

#### How Do You Say Goodbye? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-91 .sec2}

Regardless of the reasons why, when, and how therapy ends, this is
usually a challenging transition to manage. There is an understandable
fear of backsliding once regular support and sessions are finished. If a
solid relationship has been established over time, then it can also be a
painful time of grieving and adjustment---for *all* the participants
involved. I will confess that although I act joyful and prideful when
clients are about to be sent on their way, I also feel my own sense of
loss. I miss the regular, intimate conversations, and since it is quite
rare that ex-clients remain in touch, I frequently wonder how they are
doing and must live with the uncertainty.

From the client's perspective, there are often not only increased
feelings of freedom and independence---not to mention banking time and
money---but also reoccurring fears and setbacks. When this last stage of
therapy is handled well, there is considerable time devoted to planning
for this process. This may include relapse prevention strategies as well
as rehearsal of predicted problems that may inevitably arise. Just as
important is an open discussion of some feelings that were yet to be
brought into the open, unresolved issues that may be addressed in the
future, and simply saying goodbye in a meaningful way. Finally, there
are sometimes plans made for []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_320}follow-up
sessions in the future just to make sure that progress and growth
continues.

### Some Secrets About What Therapists Like Best in Their Clients {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div1-128 .sec1}

Parents are known to respond to a certain thorny question by answering,
"Well, my kids are all different but I love them all the same." That's
not quite the case, even if it is the only truly acceptable answer. Of
course the same is true about the way that therapists feel about their
clients---some are liked and appreciated differently from others.

Let's face it, some people who often end up in therapy do so because
they do some spectacularly annoying things. Some were referred in the
first place because everyone else is tired of dealing with their antics.
While it is certainly true that many clients, attending sessions for
learning and growth, are among the most interesting, joyful, and fun
people you could ever meet, others are seriously disturbed and
constantly play games, lie, manipulate, and otherwise do their best to
make everyone around them as miserable as possible.

It is clearly important to be liked by your therapist, or at least
*feel* liked by him or her. As you might imagine, that's not always easy
to do, especially when the particular client is doing his level best to
be as difficult as possible. Nevertheless, ask a therapist who her
favorite clients might be, theoretically speaking, and you will usually
get a carefully crafted response, something like this: "I do specialize
in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \[fill in the blank\] and like
working with those issues, but I pretty much enjoy seeing almost
anyone." Of course that's not quite accurate.

It used to be that therapists in the olden days were quite clear about
who they preferred as ideal clients. Given that a few decades ago almost
all therapists were older white males, it probably isn't surprising that
their stated preference for clients included individuals very much like
themselves (educated, intelligent, white, middle class, and highly
verbal). Things haven't changed much over the years considering that
therapy *is* an endeavor that involves a certain degree of insight and
verbal fluency. Nevertheless, in a survey in which therapists were asked
to supply three adjectives to describe their ideal client, most of these
adjectives could be easily guessed ([Howes,
2009](#24_bibliography.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-bibliography-1-bibItem-132){#22_chapter15.xhtml_n0403}).
Therapists want their clients to be completely honest and forthcoming,
open-minded and flexible, highly motivated and determined, with a high
tolerance for both discomfort and ambiguous, uncertain issues. Yeah, who
wouldn't want to hang out with someone like that?

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_321}Of course, therapists like particular
clients for different reasons: because they remind them of someone,
because they appear similar in values and interests, or because they are
seen as attractive or interesting in some way. Yet there are also some
stated preferences that vary considerably. For instance, I've always
enjoyed working with rebellious adolescents, the kind who are defiant
and (perceived as) obstructive even though I find them wildly
entertaining. My office partner would refer all her adolescent referrals
to me, perhaps not surprisingly because she had three teenage children
of her own. Likewise, as the parent of a toddler at the time, I would
refer all my young kids to her because I was so tired of playing
Candyland, hide-and-seek, and other games at home at night.

Many clients don't return to therapy after a session or two because they
don't feel their therapists truly grasp the nuances of their cultural
backgrounds. There is considerable research supporting these reports
considering that the majority of people of color don't last very long in
sessions because they didn't feel comfortable or understood by their
therapists, especially when the therapists were members of the majority
culture. In some cases, the perceived slights, often called
"microaggressions," were inadvertent but nevertheless offensive and
off-putting.

Each therapist develops a specialty based not only on interests and
training, but also on personal preferences. There are specialists who
work exclusively with eating disorders, multiple personality disorder,
panic disorder, addictions, or trauma, not only because of their
expertise but also because of what they are drawn to personally.
Therapists who most enjoy working with clients with drug and alcohol
issues talk about how much they appreciate the drama of these cases.
Some therapists admit that their stated preference is based on efforts
to continue self-healing or explorations that parallel the issues of
their clients. For instance, at this stage in life my perfect client is
a mature adult who wants to explore and find meaning in new life
challenges; in other words, my perfect client is just like me!

Although many therapists do have their favorites, other client
characteristics that are most appreciated include a willingness to be
patient as results might accrue slowly and unpredictably. We like our
clients to be not only driven and desperate for change but also willing
to be patient and forgiving with us when things don't necessarily
proceed according to plan. We want clients to be responsible and
dependable, at least with respect to showing up on time and paying their
bills. We like them to be curious and reflective, interested, and
willing to look critically at their own behavior and its impact on
others. We'd definitely prefer clients to be upbeat, joyful, and funny
(who wouldn't?), but that is often not likely until perhaps the end,
considering that most clients are highly anxious, confused, or
depressed.

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_322}Here's the bottom line if you are
comparing your own "condition," personality, and style to this ideal and
are feeling definitely inadequate in these areas: Therapists want their
clients deeply invested in the process and willing to work hard on
themselves; the rest of these factors don't matter much at all if
motivation and commitment are present. This is more than a little
difficult to assess considering that *everyone* feels ambivalent about
changes that are contemplated---they may be desirable, but they also
involve a lot of discomfort, unfamiliarity, and hard work.

### Initiating Difficult and Really, Really Honest Conversations {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div1-129 .sec1}

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-92}Most
relationships eventually become entrenched into patterns that can become
both predictable and often limiting. During therapy sessions, those
habits become established rather quickly. Clients almost always sit in
the same spot, just as therapists always sit in their favorite chair.
Sessions usually begin ("What would you like to talk about today?") and
end ("Let's reschedule for next week. Same time?") a similar way. The
participants fall into routines that are, at once, comforting as well as
restrictive. This sometimes makes it difficult to abruptly change the
subject and bring up something that is disturbing or bothersome but not
necessarily on the planned agenda.

Clients are often reluctant to challenge or confront their therapists
due to the power inequity posed by the therapist's status as expert and
authority figure. There are exceptions, of course, especially with those
clients who are rather assertive, if not flamboyant and aggressive.
Generally speaking, therapy gets stuck, and stays that way, until one or
both participants decide to change the trajectory of the process. This
means stirring things up, taking risks, and bringing up a subject that
has been neglected but is clearly the unspoken elephant in the room.

#### How Do I Know That You Are the Best Therapist for Me? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-93 .sec2}

You can't possibly know the answer to if a therapist is the best one for
you until a few weeks into the process, any more than you can determine
after a single blind date that the relationship will flourish. However,
you can invest a little time during the initial contact, whether on the
phone or during the intake interview, to find out some basic information
that helps []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_323}you make a more informed
decision about whether to continue with this professional or not.

You likely wouldn't want to turn the tables interviewing the therapist
for too long or you'll end up using up all your time. Nevertheless,
there are several questions you might address:

::: prosequote
[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-item1-287}[•]{.enumerator}Would
you please tell me about your background, training, and credentials?

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-item1-288}[•]{.enumerator}What
kind of therapy and approach do you favor, and why do you think it is
appropriate for what I'm experiencing?

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-item1-289}[•]{.enumerator}Given
what you already know about me and my issues, how would you propose to
help me and what would this look like over time?

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-item1-290}[•]{.enumerator}I'm
Christian/Muslim/Jewish/gay/Republican/homeless/vegan/a lawyer \[pick a
term that fits you and perhaps your issue\]. How do your own values mesh
with my background?

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-item1-291}[•]{.enumerator}What
are some of your rules related to paying fees, late or canceled
appointments, and other such issues?
:::

What makes this type of conversation a little awkward is that you are
deliberately altering the nature of the interaction to make it clear
that you are an informed consumer who intends to take your own clear
responsibility for the encounter. You aren't willing to make a
commitment to the process until such time that your questions and
concerns are adequately addressed. This could become excessive if the
interrogation went on more than a few minutes beyond these basic
questions, but most therapists would actually appreciate that you took
the time and effort to determine whether this was a good fit for you.

#### This Isn't Working and I Want to Quit {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-94 .sec2}

Indicating that the therapy isn't working and you want to quit would be
a difficult and disappointing declaration for any therapist to hear
(unless they are also anxious to end the collaboration). It's really
hard to tell someone that you don't like what they are doing and don't
much appreciate the way things have been going. That's one reason why
many clients don't bother being honest at all about their feelings and
instead just cancel their appointment and don't bother to reschedule
again. As mentioned previously, this is *not* an ideal way to manage an
unsatisfactory relationship, just to go away without any explanation or
closure. In fact, it's likely that if a
[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_324}client does this with a therapist it is
probably an ongoing life pattern that is less than desirable.

However anxious you might feel about telling a therapist you are unhappy
with the service, at the very least it provides an opportunity to share
feedback, come to a deeper understanding of what happened, and bring
things to a more satisfying closure. When sharing such honest (and
possibly awkward) input, along the lines of, "I don't much like what we
are doing and have not been getting much out of it," it is entirely
possible you could find yourself stuck in further disagreement about who
is at fault and then subject to persuasive arguments regarding why you
should give things more time. If this is the case, then you clearly have
the answer to your questions about whether this therapist hears and
understands you.

On the other hand, sometimes such a difficult conversation can lead to a
major breakthrough, whether you remain with this therapist or not. Just
to be able to assert yourself in an honest way, to say what you don't
like or appreciate, and to do so with a powerful authority figure can
very well change ongoing patterns in other relationships. In addition,
it is quite possible that after bringing up complaints and
disappointments there is still an opportunity to renegotiate the ways
you work together and customize the process to better meet your needs.
This all begins with you speaking up.

#### I Wasn't Exactly Truthful {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-95 .sec2}

People lie---a lot. They lie to their family, their friends, colleagues,
everyone. They lie to their dentist when they say they floss every day.
They lie to their boss when they say they can't come into work because
they aren't feeling well. They especially lie to themselves about their
real capabilities and flaws. They even lie to their therapists, which
seems rather strange if you consider that they can't improve or get much
from the experience until they are prepared to be open and honest.
Nevertheless, lying, deceiving, exaggerating, minimizing, and misleading
are part of the reality of human interaction when managing one's image.
Nobody in his right mind would simply blurt out all his foibles,
secrets, difficulties, and shameful behavior to someone he just met. It
takes time to build this trust.

Although it is certainly desirable, if not imperative, to be as honest
as possible with your therapist, it is also normal and common to shade
the truth at times, at least until such time that you feel truly
accepted and comfortable. One client said that although she likes and
trusts her therapist, she admits she frequently has been lying in her
sessions. She finds him rather detached and emotionally unavailable to
her, so she does her best to []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_325}shock him
into some genuine reaction. "I have yelled and cursed at him," she says.
"He said that he would never fire me because I am only 1 hour in his
week and he accepts his limits. I interpreted this that he doesn't
really care about me. It's also weird to say but I don't want to hurt
his feelings. Despite everything I have done to shock him I don't want
to tell him that almost everything I told him is a lie."

I collected stories from therapists about the most spectacular lies
their clients have ever told them and by which they had been thoroughly
duped. While somewhat amusing, the experiences were also painfully
disturbing because of the extent to which some people would
intentionally manipulate, disguise, and hide their true selves in order
to play games. In all their various forms and styles, psychotherapy is
essentially an interaction built on mutual trust; once that is
compromised, the work will inevitably become stalled. So if you are
aware that you have been less than honest about certain things in
sessions, it is time to reassess what that might mean.

#### I'm Really Hurt and Offended {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-96 .sec2}

Of course there are times you would feel hurt and offended, especially
if you consider that the therapist's job is to push you into areas that
you have been trying to avoid. Some therapists can be rather direct,
telling you things that you may not wish to acknowledge. There are times
when you will hear things that feel wounding, or perhaps more than you
can handle, and you may very well feel hurt or misunderstood. This
happens a lot in everyday life as well. But here's the interesting
growth experience: In therapy with a safe professional you have the
opportunity to speak your feelings aloud. It doesn't matter if they were
"justified" or represent "overreactions"---it is very important to be
able to tell someone that you don't like what they said. This gives both
of you the chance to work things through, to explain your positions, and
to come to some mutual understanding of what happened and why.

As a therapist I sometimes take risks with clients, meaning I challenge
them and say things that I know will be difficult to hear. Sometimes I
experiment with strategies though I'm not sure where they will end up. I
may offer interpretations or explanations that are just plain misguided,
if not wrong. And there are also times when I just say something that
might be construed as insensitive or rude, even when I try to be
careful. I'm not surprised when this happens, or when a client may be
offended by something I've said or done. If this doesn't happen, then it
means I'm being way too cautious and conservative in my approach. I say
this because in a solid, trusting relationship we sometimes make
mistakes, apologize, and []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_326}then move
forward. I actually love it when a client confronts me because it
presents such a great opportunity for us to be more direct and honest
with one another. Oops---that was a lie. Of course I don't "love" it
when someone, anyone, confronts me. It's scary and unnerving and
triggers for me feelings of inadequacy. What I mean to say is that
although I don't initially "enjoy" being confronted, I do love where it
can eventually lead if we stick with the feelings. Those can become the
most magical and helpful moments in a therapeutic relationship.

#### What Did You Really Mean by That? {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div2-97 .sec2}

It isn't unusual that there are times we don't understand someone,
especially a person who is well educated and uses lots of big words and
jargon. A doctor, lawyer, electrician, computer technician, car
mechanic, psychotherapist, or other professional is explaining something
to us and we nod our heads in acknowledgment, pretending we understand
even though we don't have the slightest clue what he or she is talking
about. Often in therapy, as well, clients find themselves carefully
scrutinizing their therapists' reactions and the meaning of what they
said, searching for the hidden clues. Since therapists go to great
lengths to maintain the most neutral and blank expressions possible,
this would certainly lead to a lot of confusion. That's why it's so
important whenever you don't understand something, or are puzzled by
what a therapist says or does, that you ask---every single time. We are
actually quite grateful for those queries, assuming they are genuine,
since it provides valuable feedback that we aren't being as clear as we
would like. These sorts of questions actually lead to far more
interesting interactions.

::: prosequote
"When you said that I'm the kind of person who would do something like
that, you kind of laughed. Was there something funny about that I
missed?"

"Absolutely not. I was just remembering when you told me that story
earlier about when your mother called to interrupt you and you told her
you couldn't talk right then because you had just poured milk on your
cereal. I thought that was pretty hilarious, and it reminded me how you
were less than candid with your friend who wanted to get together with
you. It just gets me wondering how you might be holding back with me as
well."
:::

It was precisely the probe and search for clarification that may very
well be a game changer in terms of understanding, at a deeper and more
meaningful level, the dysfunctional patterns of behavior.

### []{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_327}First Look at Your Own Behavior Rather Than Blaming the Therapist {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div1-130 .sec1}

As mentioned previously, very few people really want to change unless
they absolutely have to---and hardly anyone wants to go to therapy
unless they are somewhat desperate and have run out of other options.
Being a client in therapy is sometimes difficult because the rules
appear to be so elusive and the process so mysterious. It's not always
clear what's expected, much less whether you are actually doing what is
expected. It's not evident much of the time whether it's even helping.
Impasses, conflicts, and unsatisfactory progress in therapy are almost
always the result of an interactive effect, meaning that both (or all)
parties have some share of responsibility for the outcome. Therapists
tend to blame their clients for being resistant, obstructive, or
difficult when things get tough; likewise, clients blame their
therapists for not doing their jobs properly. Of course, in one sense
both are correct in that they each have a role in somehow perpetuating
the difficulty.

Generally speaking, people tend to avoid changing if they can continue
to get away with it. It just takes too much time and energy. It takes
too long. It's too damn hard. In some cases, they simply "enjoy" the
benefits that result from staying stuck, the so-called secondary gains.
This allows them to avoid responsibility for their problems and blame
others for their plight, whether parents, siblings, the weather,
economy, or the therapist. They have a great excuse for continuing to
behave badly and engage in self-destructive behavior: "I can't help it!"
They are able to distract themselves from other issues that may be even
more frightening. They can avoid the unknown and, in one sense, control
things on their own terms.

The experience of being in therapy (in either role) is one of the most
interesting, exciting, stimulating, confusing, overwhelming, and
challenging things you can do in your lifetime. It is absolutely
incredible to sit with someone, a trained professional, whose only job
is help you improve your life in a multitude of ways. This person
listens with an intensity that is unimaginable in any other setting and
relies on expertise, experience, and knowledge that allows her to
observe and hear things that would be inaccessible to anyone else
without this training. You can (it is hoped) talk about *anything*
without fear of judgment. Each week you have a completely open space and
forum to delve into the issues and concerns that weigh on you the most.
Who wouldn't want such an opportunity to learn more about themselves and
the source of their difficulties? Who wouldn't want a structure that
helps them to consistently improve their functioning across a wide
spectrum of areas?

[]{#22_chapter15.xhtml_page_328}If you are currently seeing a therapist,
or contemplating doing so, I applaud your commitment to personal growth
and refusing to settle for mediocrity, much less unnecessary suffering.
As any decent therapist will mention, *you* are the one who determines
the value of the experience and how much you get from it. Likewise, if
things are not proceeding the way you want, it is time to take a stand
and change the direction that things have been going. That begins not
only with pointing out your therapist's perceived inadequacies but also
examining what you are doing---or not doing---that is getting in your
own way.

### Final Thoughts {#22_chapter15.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-chapter-15-div1-131 .sec1}

As should be clear throughout this book, like many professional
services, one size hardly fits all. Every therapist operates in slightly
different ways, even if they subscribe to the same approach. Likewise,
each person who seeks help has particular needs, expectations, and
desires that can't be met by just anyone. Fit is everything. This means
feeling like you have chosen the kind of person who truly understands
you and responds to your needs. If this isn't yet the case, or you are
having some doubts, then before you consider quitting, much less just
canceling your next appointment and calling that the end, begin an
honest conversation about your frustrations and dissatisfactions. Even
if this doesn't resolve the difficulties, it provides you with excellent
practice in taking initiative and making a more concerted effort to
better meet your needs.

There is a learning curve for any therapist while trying to determine
the optimal treatment approach, relationship configuration, and
engagement style for any client. This obviously involves some trial and
error, experimenting with various strategies, and settling on what works
best and what appears to be least helpful. This process depends a lot on
how direct and honest you are about how things are going, what you like,
and what is most annoying and frustrating.

Regardless of whether you are a prior client, currently attending
sessions, or contemplating doing so, you now have a better understanding
of what is involved, how the process often works, and definite steps you
can take to get the most from your experience.

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-292}[1.]{.enumerator}What
are some things you learned about being a therapist that surprised you
the most?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-293}[2.]{.enumerator}Kottler
talks extensively about the power of storytelling to promote change and
transformation, and even included a chapter on the subject. What's one
story in the book that haunts *you* and has had the most significant
impact on your life?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-294}[3.]{.enumerator}What
are some of the ideas presented in the book that you are inclined to
disagree with? Instead of basing this criticism solely on personal
opinion, supply some compelling legitimate evidence to support your
position.

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-295}[4.]{.enumerator}Different
cultures have their own unique traditions related to helping and
healing, not all of which place the same emphasis on "talk therapy."
What are some other healing traditions that you know of that might
complement (or conflict with) the practice of Western psychotherapy?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-296}[5.]{.enumerator}Kottler
introduces the idea from the beginning that people choose to become
therapists in our culture, not only for altruistic reasons but also, in
part, to save themselves. What do you make of that idea?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-297}[6.]{.enumerator}Self-care
is discussed at length in this book, in recognition of the increased
understanding of secondary traumatic stress, transference, burnout, and
other risks inherent in this work. What are some of the ways you take
time for yourself, and what support systems do you have available when
you need help?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-298}[7.]{.enumerator}If
you've ever been in some form of counseling and psychotherapy yourself,
what do you wish your therapist could have---or should have---done
differently that would have been helpful to you?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-299}[8.]{.enumerator}There
is some discussion in the book about the ways that therapy and our
larger culture are becoming transformed because of advances in
technology and knowledge. What are some things you might predict will
continue to impact the way that therapy is practiced during the next
decade? What is your best prediction about what you think therapy will
actually be like in 10 years?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-300}[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_page_330}[9.]{.enumerator}What
are some ways you might take some of the ideas, thoughts, or content
from this book and apply them to quite different contexts of your life,
whether in business, family, leadership, or daily existence?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-301}[10.]{.enumerator}There
is a chapter in the book about the reciprocal nature of helping
relationships, how the clients who attend therapy often have tremendous
impact, for better or worse, on the therapist as well. What is an
instance in your life in which you helped, guided, or assisted someone
in a helping relationship and this experience had a *huge* influence or
effect on you?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-302}[11.]{.enumerator}What's
your own opinion (or best guess) about why you think therapy works and
why it sometimes doesn't work out too well?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-303}[12.]{.enumerator}In
the chapter on failure, there is a convincing case made about the ways
that mistakes, errors, and lapses can often be our greatest teachers.
What is an example of a major failure in your life that actually turned
out to be an important lesson for you?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-304}[13.]{.enumerator}The
point was made in the book that a so-called difficult client is in the
eye of the beholder, meaning that not all therapists struggle with the
same kinds of individuals or problems; much depends on their own
experience, personality, training, specialty, values, and interests. Who
do you imagine would be *your* most difficult person to help during a
time of crisis?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-305}[14.]{.enumerator}According
to Kottler (and some research), boredom and burnout often occur not only
when we are stressed, but also when our work becomes stale and
predictable. What are some routines and patterns that you have slipped
into in your life that actually prevent you from becoming more actively
engaged, taking more constructive risks, and living your life more
intensely?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-306}[15.]{.enumerator}Kottler
talks a lot about the paradoxes of the profession, for example, the need
to get close, but not too close---caring, yet detached---supportive
without fostering dependency. Can you recognize some of these same
tensions in your own relationships, and are there differences in
professional and personal dynamics?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-307}[16.]{.enumerator}What
do you think most (or many) therapists ignore or misunderstand regarding
their attempts to be helpful to others?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-308}[17.]{.enumerator}After
the COVID pandemic, how do you predict that the therapy profession will
continue to evolve and change during the coming years?

[]{#23_Other2.xhtml_oso-9780197604458-miscMatter-8-item1-309}[18.]{.enumerator}What
do *you* think are the relative advantages and benefits of delivering
therapy sessions via screens versus in-person sessions? What do you see
as the most concerning limitations, dangers, and disadvantages?
