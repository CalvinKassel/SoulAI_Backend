It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wis dom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the  epoch of incredulity.  

—Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities  

Dickens, starting his celebrated novel, used the rhetorical device called  anaphora: the repetition of a word or words at the beginning of two or more  successive clauses or sentences. In so doing, he created a cadence that not  only makes the passage more memorable—some might say immortal—in the  annals of literature but also intensifies the emotions he intends to evoke in  his readers. A Tale of Two Cities, as the opening foreshadows is in part a story  of dualities, set in a revolution at a defining moment in history. For many, this  moment meant opportunity, hope, a promise of change and modernization,  and a long-awaited shift in authority and control from the privileged to those  disenfranchised. For others, it was nothing more than turmoil, uncertainty,  loss of power, folly, the fall of the old order, and financial ruin.  

At first blush, citing Dickens's reasoned use of language and the French  Revolution might be seen as far removed from contemporary psychotherapy  and a singular approach to introducing the second edition of The Heart and  Soul of Change. Of course, students of the work of the late psychiatrist and  prominent exponent of common factors, Jerome Frank (1961,1973), and that  of Frank and his daughter Julia (Frank & Frank, 1991), would not find any  reference to rhetoric out of place in the present context. Frank maintained  

23   
that psychotherapists and rhetoricians both rely on the stimulation of emo tions and additional, shared methods to persuade and influence others to  achieve improvements in personal well-being (Frank & Frank, 1991, p. 68).  As in the first edition, how therapists, in partnetship with their clients,  achieve what they do is at the very center of this volume.  

The struggles experienced and endured in the profession of psychother apy hardly compare with the great adventure called the French Revolution.  Yet, it is true that in this period of our history, it is the "best of times" and the  "worst of times." This is neither a cliche nor a literary technique. Over the  past decade, advances in knowledge and social changes congenial to the prac tice of psychotherapy are contrasted to instability, monetary anxieties, and a  crisis of confidence. To date, the solutions proposed to address this dilemma  are falling far from the mark. How this state of affaits has come about and  what it bodes for our future is a matter of considerable debate. We are at the  point that knowing what works in therapy is not enough. Delivering what  works, the subtitle of this edition, is the next revolutionary step. In stark  terms, taking this step is critical both for the continued success of psychother apy as a profession and for the clients we serve.  

This introductory chapter begins with a summary ofthe current status of  the field of psychotherapy: the encouraging developments (the best of times)  and the areas of concern (the worst of times). We then present briefly an inte grated model ofthe common factors. The ensuing chapters elucidate its struc ture. In so doing, we avoid the dichotomy of common versus specific factors,  to the extent possible, to emphasize aspects of psychotherapy that are respon sible for the benefits clients experience. Our principal intent in this volume is  to focus on what is therapeutic and how to deliver what works for each and  every client. It is proposed that practice-based evidence brings accountability  to the practice of psychotherapy and improves the quality of services.  

THE BEST OF TIMES  

A discussion of the circumstances—fortunate or favorable for the  field—comes first. It is by no means exhaustive or intended as comprehen sive, and the order ofthe review is not determinative of importance. Rather,  it summarizes the major positive changes seen since the publication ofthe first  edition of The Heart and Soul of Change (Hubble, Duncan, & Miller, 1999b).  

The Decline of "Model Mania"  

If anything can be said of psychotherapy, it is maturing. The days when  models and theories arrived and were pursued with all the alacrity that only  

24 HUBBLE ET AL.   
the latest designer drugs could excite on the stteets are over. New therapeu tic approaches are still emerging, but the fire for the novel, different, and  exotic therapies has for the most part been extinguished.  

The University of Chicago's David Orlinsky has provided insight into the  teasons for a downturn in model development. Citing Thomas Kuhn, author  of The Structure o/Scienti/ic Revolutions (1970), Orlinsky (2006) suggested  that psychotherapy has moved from the earliest stage of science, termed pre 

parodigmatic, to the next, termed normal science. Thirty years ago, Orlinsky  and Howard (1978) tendered that "the difficulties encountered in \[the\] earli est stage of science arise not from the absence of a model for research, but from  the multiplicity of basic models dividing the allegiances of researchers" (p. 283).  When the foregoing observation was made, schoolism—that is, immersion in  and loyalty to a therapeutic orientation (be it psychoanalytic, behavioral, cog nitive, etc.)—was the rule of the day. Those entering the field at that time  tended to "work within one or another of these competing orientations, accord ing to personal preference and the historical accidents of their training and  work environs" (Orlinsky &. Howard, 1978, p. 283). It is not surprising that  debates were rampant and discourse was of the puerile "mine's better" sort. In  this period, Strupp (1978) suggested that a newcomer's first impression of mod em psychotherapy was bound to be bewilderment. One would observe "a wel ter of theories and practices that seemingly have little in common...; a  melange of practitioners whose philosophical leanings, training, and activities  are grossly divergent " (p. 3). So much disagreement provided fertile ground  for the sincere, the ambitious, or the merely narcissistic to advance new thera pies and inflate assertions of their effectiveness.  

Gradually, the field of psychothetapy has "settled down," for lack of any  better way to characterize this change. In particular, with the great "battle of  the brands" (Hubble, Duncan, & Miller, 1999c, p. 5\) waning, Orlinsky  (2006) posited that the ptofession has entered a stage of "normal science":  

Research by and large has become devoted to incrementally and system atically working out the details of a general "paradigm" that is widely  accepted and largely unquestioned. The research paradigm or standard  model involves the study of (a) manualized therapeutic procedures (b) for  specific types of disorder (c) in particular treatment settings and condi tions. This is very different from the field that I described three decades  ago (Orlinsky &. Howard, 1978\) as "pre-paradigmatic."(p. 2).  

His assessment of this evolution, however, does not imply endorsement.  Orlinksy (2006) made abundantly clear in his essay that despite an "implicit  paradigmatic consensus," as the turnaround in the science might imply, the field  is at risk of trapping itself in a "constricted and unrealistic model" (p. 2). For  the purposes of the present discussion, it is sufficient to say that this phase or  

INTRODUCTION 25   
current instantiation of normal science has helped quash model propagation.  (Further elaboration and critiques of this "unrealistic model"—as embodied in  much of the empirically supported treatment movement—are found through out this volume, with a pointed and detailed evaluation provided by Wampold  in chap. 2.) Even so, the attenuation of proliferation does not reduce the threat  that one existing model, say cognitive-behavioral treatments, might be privi leged over other, well-established treatments, such as humanistic and psycho dynamic approaches (Wampold & Bhati, 2004).  

No More Stigma  

Concomitant with the profession standing down from its faddist pursuit  of new treatments, another welcome change has come about. Specifically, the  stigma associated with psychotherapy and psychological complaints has sig nificantly decreased (Slife, Williams, & Barlow, 2001). A recent survey by  the American Psychological Association (APA) attests to this fact (Penn,  Schoen, & Berland Associates, 2004). When queried in the APA's 2004 poll,  more than 9 in 10 Americans (91%) said they wete likely to consult a men tal health professional or recommend that a family member do so if they or a  family member were experiencing a problem. The same percentage stated  they would opt for a mental health professional who would emphasize talk  therapy as a first course of action rather than medication. Ofthe respondents,  30% said they would be concerned about others finding out if they had con sulted with a mental health professional, and only 20% identified stigma as a  very important reason for not choosing to seek assistance. Of 12 possible rea sons for not seeing a mental health professional, stigma and concems about  others' opinions ranked, in order, 11th and 12th. Lack of insurance coverage  and cost of treatment were at the top of the list.  

The "Therapy in America 2004" Harris Poll, acclaimed as the first of its  kind to examine consumer trends and attitudes toward mental health treat ment in this country, yielded similar findings (Harris Poll, 2004). On the basis  of these results, the sponsors (Psychology Today and PacifiCare Behavioral  Health) concluded that psychologically informed treatment had become an  important part of American life. In effect, psychotherapy had gone main stream, as evidenced by the following results. Fitst, more than 1 in 4 Ameri can adults (27% of adults, or an estimated 59 million people) had received  tteatment for a mental health problem in the 2 years preceding the poll,  through talk therapy, medication, ot a combination of the two. Almost half  of those surveyed (49%) knew someone who has been in treatment, and  approximately two thirds (61%) said they did not view the choice to receive  therapy as a mark of character weakness. Close to 4 out of 5 (79%) respon dents believed that if a coworker were in therapy it would make no difference  

26 HUBBLE ET AL.   
in his or her ability to do the job, and 7% of respondents said it would actu ally make the coworker better able to do the job. Forty percent of adults  thought that their parents would have benefited from therapy. As to stigma,  just 22% expressed the fear that therapy would go on their "record," and 19%  were concerned that family or friends could find out if they attended therapy.  

The Profession Grows and Diversifies  

Hand in hand with psychotherapy's greater acceptance in society, more  and more people are entering the mental health professions. Since the publica tion of the first edition of this volume, the number of mental health practition ers has nearly doubled. The latest estimate pins the total at more than 800,000  (see chap. 9, this volume), with an additional 200,000 in the substance abuse  field (Mulvey, Hubbard, & Hayashi, 2003). With this increase, the demograph ics are changing. In psychology, for example, women are becoming the major ity, a development seen in other mental health professions and not only in the  United States but also in Europe and Latin America. The entry of minorities  into psychology and the other professions has grown as well, which reflects a  change to be more representative ofthe culture at large. For example, the 2008  report from the APA Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Reten tion, and Training in Psychology indicated that between 1998 and 2003,  minority student affiliate membership increased by 28.7% (APA, Office of Eth nic Minotity Affairs, 2008). Additionally, between 1996 and 2004, ethnic  minority recipients of master's degrees in psychology increased by 90.8%, and  ethnic minority doctoral recipients in psychology increased by 16.6%. Whether  these changes in the overall numbers of clinicians, including the composition  of the workforce, speak to an affirmation of psychotherapy or to perceived  opportunities for a career, we see here further evidence of therapy viewed as a  viable and vital profession.  

It Works  

More good news: Psychotherapy continues to prove its effectiveness. The  weight of quantitative studies consistently produces an effect size of about  0.8 standard deviations, which means the average treated person is better off  than 80% of those who do not have the benefit of treatment (see chap.2, this  volume; Lambert & Ogles, 2004; Wampold, 2007). These substantial benefits  extend from the laboratory to everyday practice. For example, Minami et al.  (2008) found clinicians in a managed care context attained effects that were  comparable with those reported in randomized clinical trials for the treatment  of depression. Furthermore, a real world study in the United Kingdom (Stiles,  Barkham, Mellor-Clark, & Connell, 2008\) comparing cognitive-behavioral  

INTRODUCTION 27   
therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, and person-centered therapy as  routinely practiced reported large effects comparable to those attained in  clinical trials.  

When such findings are contrasted with results widely heralded as  advances in the medical arena, psychotherapy yields significant benefits hand  over fist. Rosenthal (1990) pointed out, for instance, that the large-scale clin ical trial of aspirin as a prophylaxis for heart attacks produced an effect size of  .03 (compared with .80 for psychotherapy as a treatment for mental health  problems). It is interesting that the magnitude ofthe effect was thought to be  so astonishing that the trial was stopped prematutely because it was decided  that delivering the placebo was unethical. Such findings are not the result of  cherry-picking studies from the literature. In medicine, comparatively mea ger outcomes are the rule rather than the exception (e.g., statins for reducing  heart attacks; Carey, 2008; Lambert et al., 2003; see also Wampold, 2007, and  chap. 2 of this volume).  

Common Factors Come of Age  

From the very beginning of psychotherapy, speculation has abounded  on what causes change. With some notable exceptions (e.g., Allen Betgin,  Jerome Frank, Sol Garfield, Michael J. Lambert, Saul Rosenzweig), most of  the discourse has championed methods derived from theoretical approaches.  The abiding faith that specific treatments that target particular psychological  disorders—a kind of psychological formulary—have been or will be devel 

oped is remarkably strong. And why not? The prospect of having on hand a  special psychological intervention for a given problem is very appealing  (Hubble & Miller, 2004). Also, that therapists might possess the equivalent  of a pill for emotional distress is one that resonates with the public and poli 

cymakers, both in government and in the insurance industry. Notwithstand ing, after more than 40 years of research, evidence that specific ingredients  are needed for resolving particular disorders remains conspicuously missing.  The conclusion is inescapable: "Psychotherapy does not work in the same way  as medicine" (Miller, Duncan, & Hubble, 2005, p. 22; see also Wampold,  2001, 2007; and chap. 2, this volume). Bluntly put, the existence of specific  psychological treatments for specific disorders is a myth.  

By contrast, the empirical case for the common factors is compelling. In  professional parlance, common factors refer to ingredients or elements that exist  in all forms of psychotherapy. These shared, curative factors drive the engine  of therapy. The body of research amassed on the subject since the publication  of the first edition of The Heart and Soul of Change affirms that a core group of  factors shared by all treatment approaches is responsible for change. It also calls  

28 HUBBLE ET AL.   
for a major reconceptualization of psychotherapy, with particular emphasis on  what constitutes the pantheoretical ingredients, how they are structured, and  the way in which they interact to foster positive outcomes. Owing to the impor tance of these developments, an entire section (What Works in Therapy  Redux) is devoted to their discussion later in this chapter.  

Evidence-Based Practice Defined  

Amid the evidence-based practice movement in medicine and other  health professions, APA President Ronald Levant appointed the Presidential  Task Force on Evidence-Based Practice (hereafter Task Force) in 2005\. The  Task Force (2006) defined evidenced based practice in psychology as "the inte 

gration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of  patient characteristics, culture, and preferences" (p. 273). The APA policy  reflected the "best of times" because it recognized the importance of clinical  expertise, defined evidence broadly, and considered the client's contribution.  

The first part ofthe definition regarding best research evidence was con structed to include "scientific results related to intervention strategies, assess ment, clinical problems, and patient populations in laboratoty and field  settings as well as to clinically relevant results of basic research in psychology  and related fields" (Task Force, 2006, p. 274). Of importance, primacy was  not given to randomized clinical trials aimed at establishing the superiority  of a particular treatment, as has been the standard in establishing empirically  supported treatments, and the types of research that are used to investigate  the importance of the common factors were honored.  

Evidence-based practice recognizes the therapist as a critical element in  the therapeutic equation through the importance of clinical expertise. That  is, interpersonal skill—combined with the competence attained through edu cation, ttaining, and experience—forms an essential part of psychotherapy.  Clinical expertise also includes using the best research evidence in practice.  One purpose of this volume is to show how research evidence can lead to  better outcomes in psychotherapy.  

The third component ofthe definition recognizes the importance ofthe  client's characteristics, culture, and preferences. This entails what the client  brings to the therapeutic stage, as well as the fit of any intervention with the  client's expectations. As indicated in the APA policy, "Services are most  effective when responsive to the \[client's\] specific problems, strengths, per 

sonality, sociocultural context, and preferences" (Task Force, 2006, p. 278).  As in the prior edition, this volume emphasizes the client as a critical part of  the equation. The Task Force added that "the application of research evi dence to a given patient always involves probabilistic inferences. Therefore,  

INTRODUCTION 29   
ongoing monitoring of patient progress and adjustment of treatment as  needed are essential" (Task Force, 2006, p. 280).  

Proponents representing both sides ofthe common versus specific factors  debate recognized that outcome is not guaranteed, regardless of evidentiary  support of a given technique or the expertise ofthe therapist. Monitoring out come and adjusting accordingly on the basis of client feedback—practice-based  evidence—must become routine. Monitoring and feedback are primary  emphases of this volume.  

THE WORST OF TIMES  

The suggestion that something could be amiss for professional psycho therapy must strike the reasonable person as preposterous. The field's com pulsive fascination for the new and different has ended, and for many, the  stigma associated with using mental health services is a relic—gone and  mostly forgotten. The ranks of the profession are growing. Therapy works as  well, if not better, than any other intervention aimed at promoting health  and well-being. All who do therapy, or consider themselves friends ofthe pro fession, should feel buoyant, flushed with optimism, and proud of the many  accomplishments of psychotherapy as a profession.  

Owing to these encouraging developments, is it right to conclude psy chotherapy has entered a golden age? Surely, with the discipline's greater  maturity and certainty about the results of therapy and, for that matter, what  works, clinicians are enjoying respect and prosperity. For the most part, it  seems, therapists have the freedom to practice how they want and when and  where they choose. This is an illusion, however; the mood among many ther apists, far from upbeat, is best captured in one word: despair.  

Psychotherapy as a Viable Profession  

In the 1990s, reports emerged about the declining incomes of psycho logists. A survey conducted under the auspices of The National Psychologist  (Saeman, 1998), for instance, determined that the average income in this group  had plunged notably in the preceding 30-month period. In that polling, the  majority of respondents also viewed their future job prospects as negative and  would not recommend that their son or daughter try psychology as a career.  Leon Vandecreek (2005), then president of Division 29 ofthe APA (Psycho therapy), later wrote that during the past 15 years, practitioners had seen their  income levels turn down and the opportunities for employment in traditional  practice shrink. In the same year, Norcross (2005) documented decreased  incomes for private practitioners. For those acknowledging a decline, "the mean  

30 HUBBLE ETAL.   
and median reduction in net income was 15%" (Norcross, 2005, p. 665).  National surveys yielded similar results (Minami & Wampold, 2008).  Managed care and the tight-fisted financial policies of third-party payers  are often cited as the usual suspects behind psychotherapists' financial woes.  Doubtless, their impact is a reality, keenly felt throughout the health care indus try. Nonetheless, as much as those nefarious "bean counters" might provide an  easy enemy to rally against, the answer does not conveniently end there.  Changes in demogtaphics and the sheer size ofthe therapist workforce are con tributory. Regarding the latter, as much as the profession has grown, the pro fession may have grown too much (see chap. 10, this volume). In short, there  are more clinicians than are needed. Combined with flat utilization rates, the  supply of therapists far exceeds demand, creating unrelenting downward pres sures on reimbursement. The Therapy in America Survey (Harris Poll, 2004\)  also revealed that among those who needed treatment but chose not to pursue  it, doubt about its efficacy was cited as the deciding factor after cost. If that were  not enough, the APA's 2004 Survey (Penn, Schoen, & Berland Associates,  2004; a comprehensive, nationally representative telephone study) found that  78% polled identified lack of confidence in the outcome as the major reason for  not seeking treatment—nearly 8 out of 10—and this figure was up 1 % from the  2000 APA Survey. In comparison, only 20% identified stigma.  

These data may explain why Americans are choosing to spend billions  on alternative health care remedies rather than psychotherapy (Duncan,  Miller, & Sparks, 2004). The data may also account for why nearly half of  those who begin psychotherapy quit (Wierzbicki & Pekarik, 1993). Like it or  not, this is the perception of a large segment of consumers: Psychotherapy is  unable to fulfill the need for change.  

These adverse findings are coinciding with other events in the mental  health marketplace, which are all potentially unfriendly to the practice of  psychotherapy. For one, here and abroad, and more than at any previous time  in the history of the field, policymakers and payers are insisting that to be  paid, therapists and the systems of care in which they operate must "deliver  the goods." As Hubble, Duncan, and Miller (1999b) predicted more than a  decade ago, accountability is the watchword of the day, and real returns on  investment are the guiding metric. The chickens have since come home to  roost. This goes beyond the mere cost-cutting and containment methods of  managed care. Those who underwrite mental health services want proof.  They are not willing to listen to the expert claims ofthe mental health guilds  and their officers, especially whiny complaints that practitionets ate being  treated unfairly or insufficiently reimbursed for their fine work. The assertion  that overall psychotherapy has proven its effectiveness year after year, study  after study, is also not enough. In all, it is as though the Missouri state motto  has become the mantra of the industry: "Show me."  

INTRODUCTION 31   
Underutilization  

Clearly, psychotherapy is an effective treatment for psychological distress.  But are clients receiving the mental health services they need? Nationally,  about 20% of the population obtains some service for emotional or substance  abuse problems (Minami & Wampold, 2008). However, many presenting with  what would be classified as a mental disorder (e.g., a Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders diagnosis) do not receive any mental health treat 

ment, and those who do are often treated in the medical system (i.e., with  psychotropic medication, chiefly by primary care physicians). It is estimated  that of those with psychological or behavioral problems, less than 16% are seen  by clinicians who would offer psychotherapy (Minami & Wampold, 2008).  

On the basis of national survey, Wang et al. (2005) noted that "most  people with mental disorders in the United States remain either untreated or  poorly treated" (p. 629). Wang et al. also reported that the problem is worse  for clients most in need: "Unmet need for treatment is greatest in tradition 

ally underserved groups, including elderly persons, racial-ethnic minorities,  those with low incomes, those without insurance, and residents of rural areas"  (p. 629). These findings give little cause to be sanguine.  

Therapist Competency  

As will be discussed later in this chapter and in several subsequent chap ters, much of the variability in outcomes in therapy is due to the therapist  (Kim, Wampold, & Bolt, 2006; Okiishi, Lambert, Nielsen, & Ogles, 2003;  Wampold & Brown, 2005). This is a result found in day-to-day practice and  in clinical trials in which therapists are first selected for their skill and then  later receive training with ongoing supervision. Although it is not surprising  that therapists should vary considerably in their abilities, the disturbing news  is that the poorest performing therapists consistently deliver a quality ofserv ice that would be classified as second rate. Indeed, Okiishi et al. (2003) noted  that "therapists whose clients showed the slowest rate of improvement actu ally showed an average increase in symptoms among their clients" (p. 361).  Wampold and Brown (2005) found that approximately one fifth of clients  receiving care from the lowest quartile of therapists achieve a reliable change  in their level of functioning. This may also explain why many clients who  begin therapy drop out before experiencing significant benefit. In this volume,  much attention is given to the proposition that to improve outcomes, effort  should be directed to the person of the therapist.  

In conclusion, it is safe to say that the tide is slowly beginning to turn but  the ship remains at risk of going under. Will the profession reach safe harbor  before sinking? Fortunately, science and a little common sense are showing the  

32 HUBBLE ETAL.   
way. The profession has the means to (a) instill trust in the public that therapy  works, (b) improve results, and (c) be accountable. To these issues we now turn.  

WHAT WORKS IN THERAPY REDUX  

Proving that psychotherapy is deserving of the public's confidence will  not come from more attempts to design the "right" treatment. No "right"  treatment exists anyway. The data are unequivocal: All treatment approaches  have won, and all deserve prizes. It is time to bury once and for all the doc 

trine of specificity—the idea that specific treatments have differential effects  for specific disorders. As Wampold (2001) reported, "Research designs that  are able to isolate and establish the relationship between specific ingredients  and outcomes... have failed to find a scintilla of evidence that any specific  ingredient is necessary for therapeutic change" (p. 204; see also Ahn &  Wampold, 2001; Wampold & Bhati, 2004; Wampold, 2007). For this reason,  the public must learn how psychotherapy really works. Here again, the evi 

dence is indisputable: Change as a result of psychotherapy derives from key  ingredients or elements that transcend all approaches. Sharing such findings  will foster the public's trust. Even more, such sharing is a professional duty  owed to the consumets of psychological services.  

Lambert (1986, 1992), following an extensive review of outcome  research spanning decades, identified four therapeutic factors. He ranked  their importance on the basis of their estimated percentage-wise contribution  to outcome. The four factors were extratherapeutic variables (40%); common  factors (30%); hope, expectancy, and placebo (15%); and model or technique  (15%). Conceding that the percentages were not derived from a strict statis 

tical analysis, he suggested that they embody what studies indicated at the time  about treatment outcome. The first edition of this volume used Lambert's  proposal as a framework for the common factors but with modification. His  common factors were amended to relationship factors, a change that reflected  how he actually described these variables in his works (i.e., "empathy, warmth,  acceptance, encouragement of risk taking, etc." \[1992, p. 97\]).  

As previewed earlier in this chapter (in the section Common Factors  Come of Age), research findings published since the first edition of The Heart  and Soul of Change necessitate major revisions in the conceptualization of the  factors responsible for change. Specifically, data accrued from meta-analytic  studies call for another look at how these elements interact and contribute to  success. A reassessment of what factors to include is also required. Of singular  import, Wampold's (2001) investigation of psychotherapy outcome, which  serves as the foundation for the current volume, extended the understanding  ofthe common factors—broadening an appreciation ofthe potency of client,  

INTRODUCTION 33   
therapist, and alliance factors—while elucidating the limited impact of model  differences. His analysis revealed that the differences among models accounted  fot only 1% of the variance of outcome, dramatically reducing Lambert's  (1986, 1992\) estimate ofthe contribution of specific effects.  

There is more. The simple pie chart used to depict the relationship among  the factors (Asay & Lambert, 1999; Hubble et al., 1999c) allocated to each an  invariant or fixed percentage, implying that the factors were independent and  the percentages additive. This apportionment of percentages also suggested that  the factors were, or could be, rendered as discrete elements and thus individu 

ally operationalized. It is not surprising that over time the empirically unsub stantiated logic of specificity came to be applied to the common factors. It was  as though they could be distilled into a treatment model, used to create tech niques, and then administered to the client. From this point of view, if one  wants a good outcome add a little more therapist-client alliance (a potent ther apeutic factor), and this is how to do it: Be a good listener, reflect, nod, smile,  and maintain eye contact; offer a tissue; validate; and serve coffee, tea, or bot tled water. Similarly, as an antidote to despair, add client and extratherapeutic  factors. Mix in two parts client strengths and a pinch of social support, all the  while being sensitive to the client's stage of change.  

In reality, the common factors are not invariant, proportionally fixed, or  neatly additive. Far from it, they are interdependent, fluid, and dynamic.  Unlike a manufacturing operation, with linear inputs and predictable outputs,  therapy is a reciprocal process, in which the inputs are changed in and by the  participants' interaction. In short, the role and degree of the influence of any  one factor are dependent on the context: who is involved; what takes place  between therapist and client; when and where the therapeutic interaction  occurs; and ultimately, from whose point of view these matters are considered.  Much like raw materials in nature, the common factors exist in an unprocessed  or minimally processed state and must be used or acted on to create a product  or structure. The eventual form a treatment assumes is thus entirely depend ent on the materials available; the skills of the artisan; and most important,  the desires and preferences of the end user.  

To illustrate, any treatment involves specific components (e.g., reality  testing in CBT), but the manner in which they unfold or are manifested  depends on the interaction between therapist and client. In this respect, the  therapist and client produce the treatment collaboratively. A CBT provided  by an empathic and skilled therapist to a motivated client, with sufficient  social support and cultural sensitivity, is considerably different from a CBT  provided in a context in which those factors do not exist.  

The first edition of The Heart and Soul of Change anticipated the transi tion from discrete common factors to interdependent factors that are mobi lized by the delivery of a treatment. Hubble et al. (1999a) asserted that  

34 HUBBLE ET AL.   
in contrast with the tradition of separating models and techniques from  the common factors... theoretical models and their related techniques  are included here as part ofthe family of common factors... models and  techniques help provide therapists with replicable and structured ways  for developing and practicing the values, attitudes, and behaviors consis tent with the core ingredients of effective therapy. This nontraditional  role for models and techniques suggests that their principal contribution  to therapy comes about by enhancing the potency of the other common  factors.... A way to view techniques is to see them as something akin to  

a magnifying glass. They bring together, focus, and concentrate the forces of  change, narrow; them to a point in place and time, and cause them to ignite into  action \[italics added\], (pp. 421-422)  

The Common Factors in Context  

What the latest science has to say about the common factots comes  next. In particular, we briefly discuss four elements: client and extratherapeu tic factors, models and techniques, therapists, and therapeutic relationship or  alliance. Although presented sequentially, bear in mind that they cause and  are caused by each other, exerting their benefits through their joint and insep arable emergence over the course of therapy. It may well be that the specific  ingredients of particulat therapies are related to outcomes and yet, that con tribution is negligible (i.e., less than 1% ofthe variability; Wampold et al.,  1997\) compared with the potency ofthe common factors working together.  

Client and Extratherapeutic Factors  

These factors encompass all that affects improvement independent  of treatment. As any therapist knows, clients come to therapy with varying  degrees of motivation and with varying degrees of intemal and external  resources. Once clients are in therapy, events beyond the control of the ther 

apist and the client occur, and these events influence the outcome of therapy.  Research has demonstrated the importance of clients' readiness for change,  strengths, resources, level of functioning before treatment, existing social sup 

port network, socioeconomic status, personal motivations, and life events.  As discussed in chapter 3 of this volume, in many ways clients are the  most neglected therapeutic factor in studies of psychotherapy. Descriptions  of consumers are frequently circumscribed, limited to portrayals as the poster  children of dysfunction. It is more realistic to describe clients as people who  are having trouble in life, have made valiant attempts to change, and use ther apy constructively (Bohart & Tallman, 1999; Duncan et al., 2004; Hubble &  Miller, 2004; Linley & Joseph, 2004; Seligman, 2002). The latest data chal lenge the field to leave behind the belief that therapy is reducible to a set of  

INTRODUCTION 35   
diagnostic or classification schemes and formulaic practices. To quote Lambert,  Garfield, and Bergin (2004), "Clients are not inert objects or diagnostic  categories on whom techniques are administered. They are not dependent  variables on which independent variables operate . .. people are agentive  beings who are effective forces in the complex of causal events" (p. 814).  

As basic as it is to adjust therapy to the client—a complete commitment  to "starting where the client is at"—it is critically important. In practical terms,  without preconceptions, this means organizing clinical services to clients: who  they are, what they want, and what constitutes and influences the circumstances  of their lives. It also means that assessments of the quality and the outcome  must come from the client, the ultimate beneficiary ofthe service. The field can  no longer assume that therapists know what is best independent of consumers.  As later chapters show, regardless of the theoretical orientation, therapies that  include the client's ongoing evaluation of progress, as well as feedback to the  participants with that information, achieve significantly superior results.  

Models and Techniques  

Over the past decade, while the profession as a whole has confined its  search for what works to a handful of specific treatments for a circumscribed set  of disorders, the editors' understanding ofthe role of models and techniques has  evolved in a major way. Since the first formulation of the common factors,  any discussion of models was considered separately from the contribution of  placebo, hope, and expectancy (see Asay & Lambert, 1999; Hubble et al.,  1999b; Lambert, 1986; Miller, Duncan, & Hubble, 1997). The latest evidence  indicates that this division is no longer warranted. Models achieve their effects  in large part, if not completely, through the activation and operation of  placebo, hope, and expectancy. In fact, when a placebo or technically inert  condition is offered in a manner that fosters positive expectations for improve 

ment, it reliably produces effects almost as large as a bona fide treatment  (Wampold, 2007). Studies further show that when researchers and practi tioner's allegiance to a method is added, the variability attributable to differ ences in models is almost, if not entirely, explained (see, e.g., Miller, Wampold,  \&Varhely,2008).  

At the core, model or technique factors induce positive expectations  and assist the client's participation in healthy and helpful actions. Common  to all treatments, they offer the client an appropriate explanation for his or  her difficulties and set forth strategies for problem resolution (Frank & Frank,  1991; Wampold, 2007). Because comparisons of therapy techniques have  found little differential efficacy, they may all be understood as healing rituals—  technically inert, but nonetheless powerful, organized methods for enhanc 

ing expectations of change—the so-called and perhaps poorly named placebo  36 HUBBLE ETAL.   
factors. That they are not specifically curative should not be construed to  imply anything goes in a therapy. Packaging is important. In fact, studies con ducted have indicated that a good predictor of a negative outcome is a lack  of structure and focus in treatment (e.g., Lambert & Bergin, 1994; Mohl,  1995; Sachs, 1983).  

Owing to these findings, we conclude that what happens (whether a cli nician is confronting negative cognitive schema, addressing family boundaries,  or interpreting transference) is less important than the degree to which any par ticular activity is consistent with the therapist's beliefs and values (allegiances)  while concurrently fostering the client's hope (expectations). Allegiance and  expectancy are two sides ofthe same coin: the faith of both the therapist and  the client in the restorative power and credibility of the therapy's rationale  and related rituals. Though rarely viewed in this way, models and techniques  work best when they engage and inspire the participants.  

The Therapeutic Relationship/Alliance  

Of those factors directly related to treatment outcome, one ofthe largest  contributors to outcome is the therapeutic relationship, which encompasses  a wide range of variables found among therapies, no matter the therapist's  theoretical persuasion. Therapist-provided variables, especially the core con 

ditions popularized by Rogers (1957), have not only been empirically sup ported but are also remarkably consistent in client reports of successful  therapy (Norcross & Lambert, 2005).  

Evidence regarding the power of the alliance is reflected in more than  1,000 findings (Orlinsky, R0nnestad, & Willutzki, 2004). Researchers repeat edly have found that a posirive alliance—that is, a partnership between the  client and therapist to achieve the client's goals (Bordin, 1979)—is one  of the best predictors of outcome (see chap. 4, this volume; Horvath &  Symonds, 1991; Martin, Garske, & Davis, 2000). Depending on which study  is cited, the amount of change attributable to the alliance is five to seven  times greater than that of specific models or techniques (Horvath &  Symonds, 1991; Martin et al., 2000; Wampold, 2001).  

Consider several other interrelated findings. First, studies indicate that  clients' evaluations ofthe alliance are better predictors of outcome than ther apists' (Bachelor & Horvath, 1999). Second, little or no correlation exists  between the length of treatment and the strength of the alliance. Third, the  alliance is predictive of outcome across different types of therapy and is even  predictive of outcome in psychopharmacotherapy. And finally, alliance for mation at the initiation of therapy is predictive of outcome and not merely  an artifact of improvement (Baldwin, Wampold, & Imel, 2007; Horvath &  Symonds, 1991).  

INTRODUCTION 37   
The alliance, however, is not independent of other factors. Clients come  to therapy with an attachment history and varying capacities to form a rela tionship with the therapist. However, it is the therapist's ability to forge a col laborative relationship with the client that is predictive of outcome (Baldwin  et al., 2007). Because the alliance involves agreement about the tasks and goals  of therapy, it is not really possible to form an adequate alliance without a treat ment; that is, the alliance comes about within the context of the treatment.  The therapist needs to present a cogent rationale to the client, offer an ade quate explanation for the presenting problems, and implement a set of proce dures consistent with the rationale and explanation to develop properly a  working alliance.  

Taken together, these data, yet again, point to the importance of starting  where the client is. Therapists cannot presume that given enough time a good  alliance will develop. Instead, they must ensure that from the first moments of  the therapeutic encounter, the client is experiencing the relationship as mean ingful and positive. The simplest course of action is to solicit the client's per 

spective regarding the relationship (see chaps. 4 and 8).  

Therapist Factors  

In this volume, a new addition to the list of curative factors is the person  of the therapist. That the therapist was previously overlooked tums out to be  a particularly egregious omission. Available evidence documents that the ther apist is the most robust predictor of outcome of any factor ever studied. As  Wampold (2005) summarized, "The variance of outcomes due to therapists  (8%-9%) is larger than the variability among treatments (0%-l%), the  alliance (5%), and the superiority of an empirically supported treatment to a  placebo treatment (0%-4%)" (p. 204).  

Research confirms what everybody knows but at the same time is unwill ing to acknowledge or explore: Some therapists are more effective than others.  Clients of the most effective therapists, for instance, experience 50% less  dropout and 50% more improvement than those seen by average clinicians.  Many variables widely and enthusiastically believed to be determinative (e.g.,  age, gender, years of experience, professional discipline, degree, training, licen sure, theoretical orientation, amount of supervision, personal therapy, specific  or general competence, use of evidence-based methods) do not account for  the variability among practitioners (Beutler et al., 2004; Miller, Hubble, &  Duncan, 2007). Unfortunately, the characteristics or actions ofthe most effec tive therapists are not really known (Beutler et al., 2004), but the evidence  suggests that better therapists use the common factors to achieve better  outcomes. Take, for example, the alliance. Baldwin et al. (2007) found that  variability among therapists in terms of outcome was explained by the therapists'  

38 HUBBLE ET AL.   
contributions to the alliance; that is, better therapists formed better alliances  with a range of clients. This finding suggests that helping therapists in  building relationships may represent an arena for influencing outcome due to  the therapist. Several chapters in this volume (8,9,10,11,12, and 14\) address  how systematic client feedback can improve individual therapist performance.  

MOVING FROM WHAT WORKS TO DELIVERING WHAT WORKS  

Understanding and disseminating the science ofthe common, therapeu tic factors—how therapy really works—can go a long way toward restoring  public confidence. It does not, however, address the issue of accountability.  Meeting that challenge requires a major shift in the traditional way psy chotherapy has been conducted and researched. It is no longer a matter of  which therapeutic approach is best. Rathet, it is about showing that a treat ment, conducted by a given therapist with particular client at specific time and  place, yielded positive results. A little reflection reveals that what payers and  consumers want is the "right" outcome. They could not care less how it comes  about, they simply want it. In this case, "right" means that a treatment worked  and that the money paid was well spent.  

Building a practice around the right outcome is not difficult. It is part of  the culture; people are accustomed to it and expect it. It is the way businesses  are successful. They begin with the customers and concentrate on their needs.  Then, they concern themselves with the delivery of what the customer wants  (Levitt, 1975; Miller, Duncan, & Hubble, 2004). Those who succeed in a  competitive market stay results driven and people focused; work with their  customers to create enduring partnerships; and, when required, are ready to  act as champions for their customers.  

Within the profession, researchers are already making the shift. They are  setting aside evidence-based practice, in which the emphasis is placed on the  treatment itself, in favor of practice-based evidence (Anker, Duncan, & Sparks,  2009; Barkham et al., 2001; Duncan et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2005). In prac 

tical terms, this means not only gatheting data on how tteatment is working  for a particular client and thetapist pairing but also then providing feedback  to the therapist about the client's improvement (Howatd, Motas, Brill,  Matinovich, & Lutz, 1996). The results ate imptessive (Anker et al., 2009;  Lambert, 2005; Miller, Duncan, Brown, Sorrell, & Chalk, 2006). The combi nation of measuting progress (i.e., monitoring) and providing feedback consis 

tently yields clinically significant change, with treatment effects outstripping  whatevet has been seen in the so-called empirically supported psychotherapy  literature. Rates of deterioration ate cut in half, as is dropout. Include feedback  about the client's formal assessment of the relationship, and the client is less  

INTRODUCTION 39   
likely to deteriorate, more likely to stay longer, and twice as likely to achieve  a clinically significant change (see chaps. 8, 10, 11, 12, and 13, this volume).  Feedback also allows psychotherapy to be individualized taking into  account treatment response and client preference. Client-based feedback,  therefore, remedies any rigid interpretation of the common factors, enabling  a reliable and valid method of tailoring services to the individual. It allows  

the therapeutic factots to be delivered to one client at a time.  Monitoting combined with feedback is a simple method, divotced of  theoretical baggage, for providing accountability. The results are apparent to  all who have an interest in the outcome: therapists, consumers, administra tors, and payers. Accepting the premise that therapeutic factors constitute the  engine of change, then monitoring and feedback offers the means to delivet  them. Many are anxious about the future and deservedly so. At the same  time, the profession has the oppottunity to establish itself in its own right.  Psychotherapy works. It wotks. Therapists now have the ability to show it  and the means to banish the despait in the workforce. The challenge is to put  it into practice.  

In the end, monitoring outcomes may provide a common ground for  those who advocate empirically supported treatments and those who espouse  the importance ofthe common factors. Improvement in the results attained  by clients in actual practice is and should be the shared goal. Leaving behind  the polemic of what is specific or common, this edition of The Heart and Soul  of Change focuses on methods for promoting excellent outcomes across all  systems of care. In short, we want the best fot those who seek help from  psychotherapists.  

ORGANIZATION  

The Heart and Soul of Change, Second Edition: Delivering What Works in  Therapy is intended, as was the first edition, as a crossover work for researchers,  teachers, students, and practitioners. Each chapter provides thorough cover age of the research on the topic under review. Plus, the chaptets specify the  day-to-day implications of the latest research findings. As before, all chaptets  end with questions from the editors and the contributors' responses. These  questions, requesting further reflection, provide the authors an opportunity to  candidly discuss the implications raised in theit work. The organization ofthe  book follows, with synopses of each chapter.  

The book is divided into four parts. Part I, What Works and What Does  Not, consists of six chapters. In chapter 2, Wampold reviews the evidence  regarding the efficacy of psychothetapy, contrasting the medical model with a  common factots patadigm and setting the stage for the rest of the book. In  

40 HUBBLE ET AL.   
chapter 3, Bohart and Tallman argue that despite their powerful contribution  to treatment outcome, clients are without doubt the most neglected therapeu tic factot in studies of psychotherapy. Norcross follows in chapter 4 with a dis cussion ofthe importance ofthe thetapeutic relationship and the research that  supports this factor. Rounding out the common factors covered in this section,  Anderson, Lunnen, and Ogles, in chaptet 5, thoughtfully address the role of  models and techniques, arguing convincingly that the power of treatments  

resides largely in the provision of a credible myth and a healing ritual.  The next two chapters in Part I challenge popular claims about psy chothetapy and psychopharmacology. In chapter 6, Littell provides a practi cal template and examples for scrutinizing the claims regarding the superior  efficacy of empirically supported treatments. Sparks, Duncan, Cohen, and  Antonuccio, in chapter 7, demonstrate that drug effectiveness is overstated  and vatiables other than the psychoactive properties of medications account  for a significant portion of the outcomes. Like Littell, the authors provide a  method for evaluating the claims of psychopharmacotherapy.  Part II, Delivering What Works, covers the newest common factor: the  therapist. It also describes how the field can shift toward practice-based evi dence. In the first of three chapters in this section, Lambert (chap. 8\) answers  the question he and his colleagues posed in an influential previous article  (Lambert et al., 2003): Is it time for psychotherapists to routinely track out come? He reviews the evidence about client feedback, making a strong case for  an affirmative reply. Lambert also surveys available systems of outcome man agement. Building on a review of therapist variability and current trends in  managed care, Brown and Minami (chap. 9\) assert that achieved outcome is  emetging as the ultimate arbiter of reimbursement. They make the provocative  atgument that therapist variability points to a need to validate psychothera pists, not psychotherapies. Bohanske and Franczak (chap. 10\) uniquely  combine the consumet and recovery movements to present an innovative  application of the common factors in public behavioral health. They demon strate through the experiences of two large community behavioral health  organizations that transformation of public behavioral health can occur when  a consumer-directed, outcome-informed infrastructure is in place.  Part III, Special Populations, reviews the common factors and their  application with diverse groups and differing modalities of service. Kelley,  Bickman, and Norwood (chap. 11\) cover child and adolescent thetapies;  Sparks and Duncan (chap. 12\) address marriage and family therapies; and  Mee-Lee, McLellan, and Miller (chap. 13\) discuss addiction services.  Finally, Part IV, Conclusions, contains the last chaptet: In it we distill  the implications from all the conttibutors. The final chaptet also comments  on the exciting findings emetging from practice-based evidence and explores  the new frontier of therapist variability. Identifying the best from the rest and  

INTRODUCTION 41   
studying how they do therapy provides insight into what makes fot excellence  as a therapist. Finally, we speculate on what the future might hold, and  although caution is warranted, hope is in the forecast.

THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR  THE COMMON FACTORS MODELS:  A HISTORICALLY SITUATED  

PERSPECTIVE  

BRUCE E. WAMPOLD  

Daring as it is to investigate the unknown, even more so it is to question  the known.  

—Kaspar  

The development of psychotherapy as a modem treatment is complex.  One strand of this development has been closely intertwined with the devel opment of modem medicine since the late 19th century; this strand appears to  be the most apparent in scientific discussions of psychotherapy. However,  another strand—embedded more in culture, humanism, and traditional heal ing practices—has been present since the origins of psychotherapy, and  although it is tenaciously holding fast, it is often not apparent. Indeed, this later  strand may form the core of the psychotherapy rope and be the hidden source  of strength.  

In this chapter, a brief history of psychotherapy is presented to show the  influence of modem medicine on the development of psychotherapy (the first  strand) and to demonsttate that othet influences (the second strand) have  been ever present, although frequently ignored. The research evidence is pre sented to demonsttate that the medical model that is the fabtic ofthe medical  strand of psychotherapy is not generally supported, whereas the contextual  model, which emanates from the second strand, is supported by this evidence.  Finally, there is a brief synopsis of the factots involved in the second strand.  This common factor strand forms the basis of this book.

BRIEF HISTORY OF PSYCHOTHERAPY  

This brief history reviews the origins of a medical model of psycho therapy and the origins of a contextual model, with as much emphasis on  what was omitted as what transpired. As will be clear, what is omitted is often  more important than what is apparent in the development of psychotherapy  as a profession.  

First Strand: Medical Model  

From the middle to the end ofthe 19th century, medicine, attempting to  cast aside the shackles of practices predominated by myth (Hatrington, 2008;  A. K. Shapiro & Shapiro, 1997), increasingly concentrated on the physio chemical causes of illness. Because medicine was not yet dominant, an increas ing number of Americans during this period turned toward practices that healed  through the mind and contained aspects of spirituality and religion, the most  popular of which were Christian Science and the New Thought movement  (Caplan, 1998; Taylor, 1999). At first, medicine deliberately dismissed these  movements, fot the most part, as unscientific attempts to cure illnesses, whether  physical or mental. Legitimacy lagged behind popularity, but gradually the  involvement of American psychologists lent credibility to the idea of talk  therapy as distinct from the religious movements. The Boston School of Psy chopathology, which was initiated in 1859 and included the psychologists  William James and G. Stanley Hall as well as neurologists and psychiatrists, was  followed by the Emmanuel Movement, which was initiated in 1906 as a collab oration between physicians who recognized the importance of the psyche and  Christian ministers who recognized the moral aspect to behavior (Caplan, 1998;  Taylor, 1999).  

Medicine was particularly threatened by treatments provided by non physicians for physical as well as mental distress and exerted its professional  privilege to conduct psychotherapy (Caplan, 1998; Wampold, 2001a). The  sentiment was expressed by prominent physician John K. Mitchell, "Most  earnestly should we insist that the treatment of a patient, whether it be sur gical, medical, or psychic, should for the safety of the public, be in the hands  of a doctor" (Caplan, 1998, p. 143). Conspicuously missing at the origins of  psychotherapy as a medical practice was a scientific explanation—that was  provided by Sigmund Freud in his lectures at Clatk University in 1909\.  Within 6 years of these lectures, psychoanalysis had become the ptedomi nant form of psychotherapy in the United States: "Psychoanalysis appeared  to be mote proper and civilized than mind cute, more scientific than Chris tian Science and positive thinking, and more medical than advertising"  (Cushman, 1992). Moreover, the practice of psychotherapy in the United  

50 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
States was restricted in those years to physicians for the most part (Frank,  1992; VandenBos, Cummings, & DeLeon, 1992), which shows that at the  origins of psychotherapy there existed a cozy relationship with medicine. The  cozy relationship between psychotherapy and medicine has varied by country  and over time. To be certain, however, the manner in which psychotherapy is  understood and delivered reflects a history closely entwined with medicine.  

Although psychoanalytic theory provided medicine with what was at the  time a scientific explanation for mental disorders,1 the validity of the theory  quickly was challenged by emergent behaviorists. On the basis of the experi mental work of Thomdike, Pavlov, and Skinner, various behavioral treatments  were developed, notably systematic desensitization (Wolpe, 1958). This and  subsequent behavioral treatments were categorized as scientific because they  were based purportedly on learning theory, which emanated from scientific and  empirical psychology (Eysenck, 1961, 1966; Fishman & Franks, 1992\) rather  than from the mentalistic and decidedly theoretical concepts posited by Freud  and othet psychoanalysts.  

It is interesting that behaviorists presented their techniques as distinct  from a medical model, in the sense that they claimed that mental disotders were  the result of learning (i.e., an interaction with the environment) rathet than  the result of biology. Nevertheless, at a higher level of abstraction, behavioral  treatments confotm to the medical model (Wampold, 2001b), as they are com posed of five crucial components. Fitst, there is a disorder, problem, or com plaint (e.g., the client is suffering from intrusive thoughts, distiactibility, and  depression). Second, there is an explanation for the problems; in medicine the  explanation would be biological (e.g., the patient's stomach pain was an ulcer  caused by bactetia), whereas in psychotherapy the explanation would be  psychological (e.g., the patient's insomnia is the result of traumatic experi ences). Third, there exist mechanisms of change that are consistent with the  theoretical explanation for the disorder (e.g., extinction). Fourth, the mecha nisms of change suggest that particular therapeutic actions should be used (e.g.,  prolonged exposure). Fifth, and most important, the therapeutic action is  responsible fot the benefits ofthe psychotherapy and not other factors, such as  the alliance with the therapist (i.e., the decrease in symptoms was caused by  prolonged exposure and not other therapeutic actions or conditions). The last  component, which is referred to as specificity, is in many ways the hallmark of  medicine (Wampold, 2001b). After all, Franz Anton Mesmer was not exposed  as a chatlatan because his treatments were not effective but because the pur portedly causal mechanism (viz., animal magnetism) was not responsible for the  

'In this chapter, the term disorder is used because research on mental health services is organized around  that concept. However, the term is affiliated with a medical model and is not descriptive of many mod els of psychotherapy. Indeed, the diagnostic systems used to identify disorders are flawed, as discussed  briefly later in this chapter.  

RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR THE COMMON FACTORS MODELS 51   
improvement experienced by Mesmer's patients (Wampold &. Bhati, 2004).  The five-component model (complaint, explanation, mechanism of change,  therapeutic ingredients, and specificity), which forms the medical model in  medicine as well as psychotherapy, is emblematic not only of behavioral treat 

ments; the advocates of particular treatments for particular disorders typically  offer such models in treatments manuals and desctiptions of their treatments.  The adoption of a medical model of psychotherapy also necessitates cer tain methods. The gold standard to establish specificity in medicine is the ran domized double-blind placebo control group design, often referred to simply  as a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Such designs are required by the Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) to demonstrate that the effects of dtugs are  due to their specific ingredients, rathet than to patient expectations, hope,  remoralization, or other psychological factors that are independent ofthe spe cific ingtedients of the drug. In the past few decades, RCTs have similarly  become the gold standard in psychotherapy research, at least among those  who wish to establish that a particular treatment is efficacious fot a particu lat disorder (Goldfried & Wolfe, 1998).  

The notion that therapies need to be validated by the use of RCTs was  institutionalized by the Society of Clinical Psychology (Division 12 ofthe  American Psychological Association) in the mid-1990s when the Task Fotce  on Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures was charged  with developing criteria for establishing treatments as empirically validated  treatments (which ate now called empirically supported treatments \[ESTs\]) and  compiling a list of treatments that satisfied the criteria (Task Force on Pro 

motion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures, 1995). The EST  movement clearly aligned psychotherapy and psychotherapy research with  the medical establishment. The criteria, which are in most respects indistin guishable from the criteria used by the FDA to approve drugs, clearly oriented  psychotherapy to a mental illness: "We do not ask whether a treatment is effi cacious; rather, we ask whether it is efficacious for a specific problem" (Cham bless & Hollon, 1998). Although use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders (DSM) as the nosology for assigning disorders was not  required, Chambless and Hollon (1998) indicated the DSM has "a number of  benefits" for determining ESTs (p. 9). Moreover, the notion of specificity is  inherent in the criteria for ESTs, as it was important to show that psychother apeutic treatments were not simply efficacious but added something above  and beyond the effects produced by placebo (i.e., what could be achieved by  hope, expectation, alliance, or relationship):  

We \[The Task Force\] believe establishing efficacy in contrast to a wait ing list control group is not sufficient. Relying on such evidence would  leave psychologists at a serious disadvantage vis-a-vis psychiatrists who  can point to numerous double-blind placebo trials to support the valid 

52 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
ity of their interventions. (Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination  of Psychological Procedures, 1995, p. 5\)  

It is cleat that the development of psychotherapy in the United States  has been closely associated with medicine. Indeed, some have atgued that psy chological treatments (in the main, ESTs), although built on characteristics  found in a variety of treatments including "the thetapeutic alliance, the induc tion of positive expectancy of change, and remoralization," contain "specific  psychological procedures targeted at the psychopathology at hand" (Barlow,  2004, p. 873). Treatments lacking the specific psychological procedures to  which Bailow refers would be designated as generic psychotherapy, whereas  those containing the ingredients would be referred to as psychological treat ments. In this conceptualization, the focus is on the patticulat therapeutic  ingredient that is purportedly critical to client change and relegates to an infe rior status therapist qualities and actions, the working alliance ofthe therapist  and the client, the client's active participation, and othet factots that often  are assigned to the common factots. As presented here, however, the status of  superiority of treatment method, above all else, may well indeed be a conse quence of history rather than of science. Indeed, as the next section discusses,  the research evidence has shown convincingly that the particular tteatment is  relatively unimportant and the combination of thetapist, the client, and their  work together is critical to the success of psychotherapy.  

Second Strand: Common Factors Models  

The strand that is obscured by the medical model of psychotherapy is the  one that emphasizes the humanistic interaction of therapist and client. In  1936, Saul Rosenzweig, having observed that advocates of the vatious psy chotherapies all claimed great success, suggested that there were commonali ties among various treatments and that these commonalities were responsible  for the benefits of psychotherapy. Over the years, a number of luminaries have  offered various common factors models, including notably Jerome Frank  (Frank & Frank, 1991), Judd Marmor (1962), and Sol Garfield (1995).  Although there are differences among the various models presented, they  shate the principle that the specific ingredients stipulated in various treat ments are relatively unimportant and instead give primacy to the engagement  of a therapist and client in a healing process. The common factors models  emphasize the collaborative work of thetapist and client, and thus there is a  focus on the therapist, the client, the transaction between them, and the struc ture of the treatment that is offered.  

Despite the pioneering work of Rosenzweig, Frank, Marmor, Garfield,  and others, scientific discussions of psychotherapy have been focused most  prominently on treatments. As in medicine, the question is, "What treatment  

RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR THE COMMON FACTORS MODELS 53   
is indicated for a given disorder?" This emphasis places the common factors  in the background, relegated to a status sometimes expressed as "necessary to  deliver the treatment but not sufficient to remediate psychological distress."  The thesis of this book is that these common factors are indeed the "heart and  soul" of therapy, a conjecture that is fully supported by the research evidence,  as demonstrated in this chapter.  

PSYCHOTHERAPY EVIDENCE FOR SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS  

The research evidence fails to support the conjecture that the focus on  treatment is related to outcome and instead suggests that the common fac tots, as Rosenzweig (1936) presciently predicted, are critical to successful psy chotherapy. Briefly, the research evidence related to several critical questions  is reviewed in this section.  

Does Psychotherapy Work?  

Healing practices, which have existed since the origins of the human  species and which are indigenous to every culture, past and present, have only  recently been subjected to scientific scrutiny to determine whether or not they  are effective. Of coutse, the history of modem medicine is closely tied to the  empirical documentation that the various medical treatments are effective.  Indeed, in a perspicuous way, it has been the documentation of effectiveness  that distinguishes modem from premodern medicine; the development of the  double-blind randomized placebo control research design in the 1950s allowed  researchers to document that various drugs are superior to a placebo that is  indistinguishable from the active medication (A. K. Shapiro & Shapiro, 1997;  Wampold, 2001b; Wampold & Bhati, 2004). The result has been to establish  the effectiveness of many medical drugs and procedures.  

The only other healing practice that has been subject to scientific  scrutiny that approaches the rigor of modem medicine is psychotherapy,  although the journey to scientific establishment has not been without some  tortured tums. In the 1950s and 1960s, Hans Eysenck (1952, 1961, 1966\)  claimed that research demonsttated that psychotherapy—which included for  his purposes predominantly psychodynamic and eclectic treatments but not  treatments based on learning theory (i.e., behavior thetapies)—was not only  ineffective but possibly harmful.  

It was about 2 decades after Eysenck's original claims about the ineffec tiveness of psychotherapy that Mary Lee Smith and Gene Glass (Smith &  Glass, 1977; Smith, Glass, & Miller, 1980\) used meta-analyses, an emerging  statistical technology, to test Eysenck's claim. They examined the extant  

54 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
research that compared psychothetapy with no treatment control groups; the  results demonsttated that psychotherapy was, in fact, remarkably effective,  yielding an effect size estimate of .80, which has proven to be remarkably  robust (Wampold, 2001b).  

As with any quantitative index, it is important to understand the prac tical implications of an effect of this size. Literally, an effect size of .80 means  that the average score on whatever outcomes measure (or measures) used to  assess functioning (e.g., symptoms, well-being, functioning) of those who  teceive treatment is 0.8 standatd deviation bettet than the score of those who  do not received any treatment. Of course, the practical application of such an  interpretation is limited, but there are several ways to convert this index into  something more useful (see Wampold, 2001b). An effect size of .80 indicates  that the avetage client receiving a treatment would be better off than about  79% of untreated clients, which should be quite impressive to researchers, cli nicians, and clients alike. Another means to understanding an effect is to  convert it to an index called the number needed to treat (NNT), which is the  number of clients who need to receive the treatment to achieve one better  outcome than would have been accomplished in the absence of treatment.  NNT is becoming the common metric of evidence-based medicine. An effect  size of .80 cotresponds to an NNT of approximately 3 (Kraemer & Kupfer,  2006), which indicates that three clients need to receive psychotherapy to  achieve a better outcome than would have been attained without treatment.  Although psychotherapy clearly does not lead to success with every client,  psychotherapy compares well with established medical practices. Indeed, psy chotherapy is as or more effective than many medical treatments highlighted  in teviews of evidence-based ptactices in medicine, including many intet ventions in caidiology, getiatric medicine, and asthma as well as aspirin as  a prophylaxis for heart attacks, the influenza vaccine, and cataract surgery  (Wampold, 2007). Moreover, psychotherapy typically is as effective as dtug  treatments for emotional problems and is more enduring and creates less  resistance to multiple administrations than drugs (Barlow, Gorman, Shear, &  Woods, 2000; Hollon, Stewart, & Strunk, 2006; Imel, Malterer, McKay, &  Wampold, 2008; Leykin et al., 2007). Finally, clinicians treating depression  in a managed care environment achieve outcomes comparable with the out comes attained in clinical trials of established and evidence-based treatments  fot depression (Minami et al., 2008).  

The answer to the question "Does psychotherapy work?" is a resounding  "Yes." Psychotherapeutic treatments have been subjected to tigotous clinical  trials, and the benefits are demonstrably large. The effectiveness of psychother apy exceeds that of many accepted medical practices. Moreover, and impor tant fot clients, it appears that psychotherapy delivered in naturalistic settings  produces outcomes comparable with the outcomes attained in clinical trials.  

RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR THE COMMON FACTORS MODELS 55   
Psychotherapy is truly a remarkably effective healing practice. But the next  logical question is, "Are some psychotherapies more effective than others, and  if so, which ones?"  

Are Some Psychotherapies More Effective Than Others?  

In medicine, it is clear that some treatments are more effective than  others, and indeed some have been found to be harmful. The notion in med icine, as discussed earlier, is that the critical aspect of a treatment is the spe cific ingredient; if some of those ingredients are more potent than others, then  treatments that rely on the more potent ingredients produce better outcomes  than other treatments. As medicine progresses, more effective treatments are  developed, and the less effective treatments are discarded; gastric ulcers are  now tteated with antibiotics rather than acid-neutralizing antacids because it  was discovered that ulcers are caused by bacteria living in the gut.  

A medical model of psychotherapy predicts that some types of psy chotherapies will be more effective than others because superior specific ingre dients will result in better outcomes. This actually was the point of Eysenck's  (1952,1961,1966) denunciation of psychotherapy: He was claiming that psy chotherapy (meaning psychodynamic, humanistic, and eclectic, primarily)  were ineffective or harmful, whereas scientifically designed treatments (which  to his reckoning were behavioral treatments emanating from learning theory)  were effective and therefore preferred to psychothetapy (Wampold, 2001b).  This is an argument not too different from Barlow's (2004) distinction between  psychological treatments and generic psychotherapy, discussed earlier.  

On the other hand, a model that emphasizes the common factors pre dicts that, with some qualifications, all cogent treatments, embraced by ther apist and client and competently delivered to a client motivated to engage in  the process, are equally effective. The logic is simple: It is the common factors  discussed in this book that lead to successful outcomes, and as long as those  common factors are capably used by therapist and client, the treatment will be  beneficial. To those steeped in a medical tradition, as most people are in West em societies, the notion is counterintuitive: The potency of some medications,  particularly newly developed, must surely be more effective than the treat ments offered to our parents and grandparents. But, as Saul Rosenzweig  observed in 1936, counterintuitively, the dodo said, "All have won, and all  must have prizes." And it indeed appears that the evidence leads to the con clusion that all treatments intended to be therapeutic are equally effective.  

The evidence for the equivalence of all treatments has been accumulat ing since the time that researchers rigorously examined the outcomes of psy chotherapy. When Smith and Glass (1977; Smith et al., 1980\) conducted  

56 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
theit meta-analyses that showed that psychothetapy was effective, they also  examined the relative efficacy of various types of treatments. Although at fitst  it appeared that behaviotal treatments were superior, as Eysenck suggested,  when confounding variables (such as the reactivity of the measures) were  controlled, there were no significant differences among treatments. A num ber of meta-analyses conducted aftet Smith and Glass have found a similar  result: When differences among studies are controlled, treatments appear to  be remarkably equivalent (Robinson, Berman, & Neimeyer, 1990; D. A.  

Shapiro & Shapiro, 1982; Wampold, Minami, Baskin, & Tiemey, 2002).  The effects of confounding variables have been illustrated, for example,  by Robinson et al. (1990), who found that fot the treatment of adult depres sion, cognitive-behavioral approaches were superior to behavioral approaches,  and both of these treatments as well as cognitive therapies were supetior to  general verbal therapies. However, the differences were entirely accounted for  by the allegiance of the researcher. Allegiance of the researcher is present  when the researcher is an advocate for one of the treatments being studied.  Often, this occurs when the researcher developed one ofthe treatments or has  argued for the superiority of the treatment; this allegiance is often conveyed  to therapists in the study when the researcher trains and supervises the thera pists, and the therapists know that there is a belief that one treatment is  believed to be superior to the others. In Robinson et al.'s (1990) study, when  allegiance of the researcher to a particulat treatment was accounted for, the  differences among treatments disappeared (see Wampold, 2001b, for a discus sion of allegiance effects more generally).  

One way to control for many of the confounds among studies is to limit  meta-analyses to only those studies that directly compare two or more psy chotherapies (Shadish & Sweeney, 1991). This is a strategy used by Gloaguen,  Cottraux, Cucherat, and Blackburn (1998), who compared cognitive treat ments for adult deptession with other treatments and found that cognitive  therapies were superior to a class of therapies that were labeled as other thera pies. Unfortunately, sevetal ofthe other therapies were not really therapies  intended by the researchers to be therapeutic but were rather administered to  control for common factors by providing a warm and empathic therapist, but  one who delivered no particular treatment. This is particularly problematic  because psychothetapy trials are not blinded, and the thetapist generally  knows that he or she is delivering a treatment the researchers consider to be a  sham. It is no wondet that the researchers' favored treatment is supetior to  these controls, as the comparison treatment is not a treatment at all and cet tainly not one that a therapist would choose to use. A good example of such a  bogus treatment is "supportive counseling" used by Foa, Rothbaum, Riggs, and  Murdock (1991) in a clinical trial of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for  

RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR THE COMMON FACTORS MODELS 57   
women who were sexually assaulted and experiencing posttraumatic stress  disorder (PTSD):  

Patients were taught a general problem-solving technique. Therapists  played an indirect and unconditionally supportive role. Homework con sisted of the patient's keeping a diary of daily problems and her attempts  at problem solving. Patients were immediately redirected to focus on cur rent daily problems if discussions ofthe assault occurred, (p. 718\)  

Clearly, this "supportive counseling" is not a means that therapists would use  to treat recently assaulted women.  

Wampold et al. (1997) addressed the issues of confounding and treat ments not intended to be therapeutic by examining only studies that directly  compared two treatments intended to be therapeutic fot adult disorders. They  found that the differences among treatments were consistent with a hypothe sis that all treatments are equally effective and that the upper bound for the dif ference among treatments was an effect size of .2, which is an extremely small  difference. Moreover, the comparisons of treatments that were very different  did not produce larger effects than comparisons of treatments that were simi lar, anothet finding consistent with equality of effectiveness.  

Wampold et al.'s (1997) meta-analysis was criticized because it asked the  general question "Are all psychotherapies equivalent?" rathet than the specific  question "Are all treatments for a particular disorder equivalent?" or an even  the mote specific question "Are all treatments for a particular disorder for a par 

ticular population equivalent?" The argument can be made that genetically all  treatments are about equally effective, but for specific disorders, some treat ments are more effective because they contain "specific psychological proce dures targeted at the psychopathology at hand," which is the argument made  by Barlow (2004, p. 873\) and Crits-Christoph (1997). This argument is made  most perspicuously with regard to anxiety disorders, in which it is claimed that  behavioral and cognitive-behavioral treatments are more scientifically justified  and more effective. An argument has also been made that the dodo bird con jecture may apply to adults, at least to some adult disorders, but not to children.  Nevertheless, recent meta-analyses and primary studies have produced evi dence that suggests that these criticisms of the dodo bird conjecture do not  threaten the validity ofthe conclusions that all treatments are equally effective.  

First, look at the literature with regard to particulat disorders, especially  those that are most prevalent. It appears that there are absolutely no differences  among treatments intended to be therapeutic for the treatment of adult depres sion, one of the most prevalent of all mental disorders. Earlier meta-analyses  demonstrated that when comparing the effects of treatment versus control  groups, the relative advantages of cognitive treatments were due to allegiance  ofthe researcher (e.g., Robinson et al., 1990). Later meta-analyses of direct  

58 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
comparison appeared to demonstrate that cognitive treatments were superior  to verbal therapies (i.e., noncognitive, nonbehavioral treatments; Gloaguen  et al., 1998); however, when treatments that were not intended to be therapeu tic (e.g., supportive counseling used as a control for common factots) were omit ted, verbal therapies were as effective as cognitive therapies (Wampold et al.,  2002). Indeed, it seems that all treatments that have been examined in clini 

cal trials meet the criteria to be classified as an EST; by 1998, the EST list  included cognitive therapy, intetpetsonal therapy, brief dynamic therapy, psy choeducational treatment, self-control therapy, and reminiscence therapy for  geriatric clients (Chambless et al., 1998), a list that spans much ofthe atray of  psychotherapy orientations. Moreover, process-experiential treatment, a treat ment derived from the humanistic tradition, has been found to be as effective  as CBT, the gold standatd in depression treatment (Watson, Gotdon, Stermac,  Kalogerakos, & Steckley, 2003). Thus, it appears that for the treatment of adult  depression, many treatments from a variety of theoretical otientations are  equally effective.  

It should be noted that there have been isolated instances in which one  treatment for depression has been found to be superior to another treatment;  for example, Dimidjian et al. (2006) found that behavioral activation was  supetior to cognitive-behavioral therapy for severely depressed clients. In  these instances, however, no cogent explanation for the differences has been  provided, and no systematic pattern of results has suggested any treatment is  superior to another for the treatment of depression (Wampold, 2007).  

With regard to anxiety, Wampold (2001b, 2006a) reviewed the meta analyses for various anxiety disorders and found no evidence that one pat ticular treatment fot any of the anxiety disotders has been shown to be more  effective than any other. Particularly informative is the research on PTSD  because PTSD is a disorder that is attributable to a discrete event or series of  events and thus it would appear that treatments based on classical condition ing paradigms would be particularly effective. Accordingly, Foa and her col leagues have developed a treatment protocol involving prolonged imaginal  exposure and in vivo exposure along with cognitive restructuring. As expected,  this treatment has been shown to be quite effective (Foa et al., 1991, 2005).  Nevertheless, several treatments with very different treatment rationales have  also been shown to be effective, including eye movement desensitization and  teprocessing, cognitive thetapy without exposure, hypnotherapy, psycho dynamic therapy, and present-centered therapy. A recent meta-analysis exam ining direct comparison among these treatments found all of them to be equally  effective (Benish, Imel, &. Wampold, 2008). It is interesting that two of the  aforementioned treatments—namely cognitive therapy without exposure and  present-centered therapy—were designed to exclude any therapeutic actions  that might involve exposure, which is actually difficult to accomplish in any

psychotherapy (e.g., clients are not allowed to talk about their traumas because  that involves imaginal exposure). Nevertheless, the two treatments without  exposure were as effective as the treatments in which exposure was incidental  (e.g., psychodynamic) or central (CBT including prolonged and in vivo expo 

sure; Benish et al., 2008). As vatious treatments for anxiety disorders are rigor ously tested, they are found to be effective; recently, psychodynamic therapy for  panic disorder has been found to be effective (Milrod et al., 2007).  

With regard to childhood disorders, it has been claimed that cognitive  and behavioral treatments are superior to other treatments (Weiss & Weisz,  1995; Weisz, Weiss, Han, Granger, & Morton, 1995). However, recent meta analyses have again indicated that all therapies intended to be therapeutic for  youth are equally effective. Spielmans, Pasek, and McFall (2007) examined all  direct comparisons of CBT for childhood depression and anxiety with other  treatments and found that (a) CBT was not superior to non-CBT bona fide  treatments and (b) full CBT treatments were not superior to one ot mote of  the components of these treatments. Miller, Wampold, and Varhely (2008)  meta-analyzed studies that directly contrasted two or more treatments for  youth with diagnoses of depression, anxiety, conduct disorder, and attention  deficit disorders (i.e., the most prevalent disorders of youth) and did find small  differences among tteatments, but these differences were due entirely to alle 

giance effects. For a more complete summary related to children, see chapter  11 in this volume.  

It appeats that for the most prevalent disorders of adults and children, all  treatments intended to be therapeutic are equally effective. It is important to  note that treatments intended to be therapeutic are cogent treatments (a) pro vided by a clinician who believes in the treatment and (b) accepted by the  client. The finding of equivalence of psychotherapy effectiveness is contrary to  the medical model that stipulates that some ingredients are more potent than  others and suggests that the common factors play a critical role in producing  the benefits of psychotherapy. Before taking up the evidence for the common  factors, however, the evidence for specific ingredients is considered.  

Is There Evidence for Specificity in Psychotherapy?  

As discussed earlier, the hallmark of modem medicine is the notion of  specificity, which stipulates that the effectiveness of treatment is due to the  specific ingredients in the particular treatments. There are two complemen tary ways that medicine documents specificity: The fitst involves showing the  supetiority of the drug or procedure to a placebo and the second involves a  prototypic system-specific sequence (Wampold, 2007). The evidence in each  of these two areas is now reviewed.  

60 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
Placebo-Controlled (and Related) Research in Psychotherapy  

Placebo-controlled group designs in medicine have three interrelated  requirements: blinding, indistinguishability, and randomization. The double blind requirement in medicine stipulates that neither the patient not the  administrator of the treatment is knowledgeable about whether the specific  treatment (e.g., a particular drug) or the placebo is being administered. This  is necessary to rule out differential expectations of success by either the admin isttator ofthe treatment or the patient. Furthermore, the drug and the placebo  must be indistinguishable to accomplish blinding. Finally, to be valid, the  experiment needs to assign participants randomly to conditions. The develop ment ofthe randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design was critical to  establishing modem medicine as scientifically based because it ruled out such  threats as increased hope and expectations for success of patients and the  charisma and personal influence of the physicians. Shortly after medicine  adopted this design, Rosenthal and Frank (1956) recommended that it be used  in psychotherapy to establish specificity. In psychotherapy, the placebo con trol is a treatment that involves a therapist and client but contains no specific  ingredients; typically, the therapist responds empathically but does not pro vide a cogent treatment to the client. Such treatments are often called non specific, supportive counseling, or common/actor controls.  

Several reviews of the placebo literature have shown that treatments  intended to be therapeutic are superior to these placebo-type control  groups (Lambert & Bergin, 1994; Stevens, Hynan, &. Allen, 2000). Many  tesearchers interpret this as evidence for the specific effects of treatment tech 

niques included in bona fide therapies (Stevens et al., 2000). However, three  critical issues rendet this claim for specificity problematic. The first issue is that  psychotherapy trials cannot be blinded, and the placebos are not indistinguish able from the treatment, as discussed previously (Baskin, Tiemey, Minami, &  Wampold, 2003; Imel & Wampold, 2008; Wampold, 2001b; Wampold,  Minami, Tiemey, Baskin, &. Bhati, 2005). Most important, the therapists are  necessarily aware of the treatment they are providing and consequently are  aware in the placebo condition that they ate delivering a treatment that is not  intended to be therapeutic and fot which the expectation exists that it will not  be as effective as the real treatment. Thus, a therapist's belief in the effective ness of the placebo-type treatment is compromised. Moreover, because the  treatment and the placebo ate not indistinguishable, the client also likely  knows that he or she is receiving the less desirable treatment. Consequently,  differences between tteatments could be due to a therapist's lack of belief  in the treatment or a client's knowledge that he or she is receiving the control  treatment, rathet than to the specific techniques included in the experimen tal treatment.  

RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR THE COMMON FACTORS MODELS 61   
A second issue is that one ofthe common factors is the delivery of a treat ment of some kind: a treatment that has a cogent and convincing rationale  (see chap. 5, this volume). Without a treatment, there can be no collabora tive effort to establish goals of thetapy, and the therapist and client cannot  agree on the tasks needed to accomplish the goals, which ate two components  ofthe therapeutic alliance, a critical common factor (see chap. 4, this volume).  Thus, these placebo-type controls lack two of the most important aspects of  common factors models: a treatment intended to be therapeutic and two com ponents of the therapeutic alliance.  

A third issue is that in studies comparing a specific treatment with  placebo-type controls, the two treatments are not structurally equivalent.  Structural equivalence refers to the similarity of two treatments in terms of thet apist training, number and length of sessions, format (group vs. individual),  and the degree to which clients are allowed to discuss topics getmane to their  treatment (Baskin et al., 2003). Often, the placebo-type control is deficient in  one or more of these areas (e.g., fewer sessions), in which case the superiority  of the treatment to the control may be due to this deficiency father than to the  potency ofthe specific ingredients in the treatment. Baskin et al. (2003) eval uated the effect of structural equivalence in a meta-analysis and found that as  the structural equivalence of a placebo-type control condition approached  that of the bona fide therapy, differences between conditions became quite  small (i.e., not statistically different). That is, if the placebo-type control was  similar to the bona fide treatment, it was as effective, even though it did not  contain all the common factors. Thus, the differential effectiveness of placebo type controls and bona fide psychotherapies is not likely due to the effects of  specific techniques.  

A rigorous way to examine specificity that avoids many of the problems  associated with placebo-type controls is to either remove a critical ingredient  or to add a theoretically important component to an established treatment.  These designs, often called component designs, are used occasionally to test for  specificity. An exemplary component study was conducted by Jacobson et al.  (1996), who dismantled CBT fot depression by comparing CBT with behav 

ioral treatment (BT). CBT and BT were structurally equivalent except that BT  lacked the cognitive components thought to be essential fot the effectiveness  of CBT. The results, which were surprising to the authors, revealed that the  treatments, with and without the cognitive components, were equally effective,  calling into question the specificity of CBT for depression. In 2001, Ahn and  Wampold meta-analytically examined all component studies in adult psy 

chotherapy and found no evidence to support the claim that removing or  adding a specific ingredient to a treatment altered outcomes.  In conttast to medical research, in psychotherapy it is difficult to design  trials to establish specificity. Nevertheless, a rigorous examination of placebo 

62 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
type control research and component studies provides little evidence fot  specificity.  

The Prototypic System-Specific Sequence in Psychotherapy  

Although in medicine placebo-controlled research provides evidence  for specific ingredients in a treatment, typically the notion of specificity also  requires a theoretical and empirical demonstration of how the ingredient  affects the biological system to cure the patient or remediate the symptoms  (Wampold, 2007). According to Wampold (2007), in medicine the proto 

typic sequence is as follows:  

(a) A biological explanation for the illness, based on scientific research,  is established, (b) a treatment is designed or a substance is hypothesized  to remediate the biological deficit, (c) administration of the substance  demonstrably alters the biology of the patient in the expected way and  other substances do not, (d) the change in the biology remediates the ill ness (a cure or management of chronic illness), (p. 867\)  

It is interesting that when Rosenthal and Frank (1956) suggested psy chotherapy researchers use the placebo to establish specificity in psychother apy, they also indicated that psychotherapy researchers needed to detetmine  a chain of empirical results that would establish the specificity sequence in a  mannet similar to that used in medicine. However, establishing the specificity  in psychology is more difficult than in medicine. Nevertheless, efforts in this  regard have not provided evidence that the specific actions prescribed in var ious psychotherapies are responsible for the benefits of psychotherapy.  

As a first example ofthe difficulties with the specificity sequence, consider  the case of systematic desensitization, which was one ofthe first, if not the first,  behavioral "talk" treatments (Fishman & Franks, 1992\) and one that has been  empirically tested and found to be effective, as evidenced by its designation as  an EST (Chambless et al., 1998). The otiginal rationale for systematic desen sitization proposed by Wolpe in 1958 was based on classical conditioning (more  specifically, reciprocal inhibition), but by the late 1970s it had been shown  quite unequivocally that this explanation was flawed (Fishman & Franks,  1992). Several other explanations were offered in its place, including extinc tion, expectancy effects, cognitive reassessment, and treatment credibility  (Kirsch & Henry, 1977; Wampold, 2001b). To date, there have been no con clusive studies demonstrating how systematic desensitization works. Systematic  desensitization is a relatively simple psychotherapy that is delivered in a con strained manner, yet the specificity sequence cannot be established because the  psychological bases for the benefits cannot be established.  

One ofthe profound difficulties that underlie attempts to determine the  specificity sequence for psychological treatments is that it relies on a flawed  

RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR THE COMMON FACTORS MODELS 63   
diagnostic system. In medicine, the biological etiology for many diseases has  been established, and if it has not been established, there are empirically based  theories that guide treatment development. In the area of mental health dis orders, diagnostic nosologies (e.g., the DSM) are descriptive rather than etio logical (Widiget & Trull, 2007\) and often reflect cultural notions of what is  dysfunctional (Wakefield, 1992,1999). Not having a definitive psychological  model for dysfunction prevents confirmation of the specificity sequence, as is  illustrated by panic disorder, in which the six best psychological explanations  provided for this disorder have either been falsified or are not falsifiable (Roth,  Wilhelm, & Petit, 2005). It is not surprising, therefore, that a variety of treat ments based on a range of explanations for panic have been shown to be effec tive, including the seemingly theoretically polar opposites CBT (Barlow,  Craske, Cemy, &. Klosko, 1989\) and psychodynamic psychotherapy (Milrod  etal., 2007).  

One way to avoid the dilemma presented by diagnostic systems is to  examine subtypes of disorders, in which the subtypes are based on etiolog ical rather than descriptive factots. This is an argument made by Follette  and Houts (1996) with regard to the dodo bird effect in the treatment of  depression:  

If one assumed that depressive symptoms were one possible endpoint  from a number of etiological pathways and that any group of persons with  depression contained a number from each pathway, then comparative  outcome studies are forever doomed to get equivalent results because  those who might have had a biological cause might respond to medica 

tion but not those were interpersonally unskilled, and so on. So far there  is little evidence that there are common etiological pathways that  describe a uniform course or response to treatment for any reasonable  proportion of the DSM-IV categories, (p. 1128\)  

Specificity would be strongly supported if etiological subtypes moderated  treatment efficacy, as suggested by Follette and Houts (1996). Nevertheless, the  many attempts to establish that etiological subtypes are more effective in one  type of treatment (e.g., clients with dysfunctional cognitions receiving CBT)  than in anothet (these clients in non-CBT) have not confirmed the matching  hypothesis (Wampold, 2001b). Simply put, there is little evidence that any par 

ticular treatment can be matched to any client on the basis ofthe nature ofthe  disorder (i.e., etiological subtypes). There is some evidence that vatious types  of persons do bettet with certain types of clients, as suggested by technical eclec ticism (Beutler & Clarkin, 1990). For example, there is some evidence to sug gest that so-called characterologically resistant clients have better outcomes in  structured father than unstructured treatments (Beutler, Harwood, Alimo hamed, & Malik, 2002), but such a finding does not establish the specificity of  

64 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
any particular ingredient of a treatment. Indeed, that some types of clients find  some types of treatments more acceptable and useful is consistent with many  common factors models (see chap. 3, this volume); corroborative efforts ofthe  therapist and client are critical to the success of therapy, and client acceptance  of the explanation of treatment is therefore critical (Baldwin, Wampold, &  Imel, 2007; Imel & Wampold, 2008; Wampold, 2007).  

There have also been claims made that two treatments could be equally  effective because the purported mechanisms of each are equally potent. Fof  example, CBT and response prevention/exposure (RPE) are both treatments  with empirical support for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder.  It is hypothesized that CBT works by focusing on the cognitive aspects of  obsessive-compulsive disorder (i.e., the obsessions), whereas RPE works by  focusing on the behavioral aspects (i.e., the compulsions). However, the appli   
cation of both CBT and RPE first reduces compulsions, which in turn leads to  a reduction in obsessions, suggesting that the two treatments work through the  same mechanism (Anholt et al., 2008).  

There is a final area of psychotherapy research that sheds light on the  specificity sequence. If an ingredient is critical to the success of a treatment,  then the degree to which the therapy contains the ingredient (i.e., the degree  to which the therapist includes the ingredient in his or her delivery of the  treatment) should be correlated with outcome. The degree to which the treat 

ment contains these critical ingredients is referred to as therapist adherence to  the treatment protocol. Although some evidence has suggested that some degree  of adherence is important, other findings have indicated that there is either no  relationship between adherence and outcome or that high and possibly rigid  levels of adherence may even be detrimental (Imel & Wampold, 2008;  Wampold, 2001b).  

A number of studies have found adherence unrelated to outcome (Imel  & Wampold, 2008; Wampold, 2001b). An interesting result in this regard was  reported by Shaw et al. (1999) in an analysis of data for the CBT condition from  the National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Depression Collabora tive Research Program. After controlling for pretreatment symptoms and the  provision of support by the therapist, Shaw et al. found that adherence mea sures were unrelated to outcome. However, in this study competence was also  assessed, and although competence in delivering CBT was unrelated to  outcome, including adherence and competence in the model simultane ously revealed a significant correlation between competence and outcome,  which is the classical suppression effect. Adherence suppresses the relationship  of competence to adherence, suggesting that aspects of competence unrelated  to adherence (i.e., general competence in therapy rather than competence in  CBT) are important. So, it appears that adherence to the CBT protocol may  actually detract from the competence ofthe therapist.  

RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR THE COMMON FACTORS MODELS 65   
The suggestion that adherence might exert a negative influence has been  shown in sevetal early studies of adherence (Castonguay, Goldfried, Wiser,  Raue, & Hayes, 1996; Henry, Schacht, Strupp, Butler, & Binder, 1993; Henry,  Strupp, Butler, Schacht, &. Binder, 1993). A recent report related to adher 

ence is informative because it occurred in the context of a rigorous clinical trial  of an EST. Huppert, Barlow, Gorman, Shear, and Woods (2006) examined  client motivation and adherence to CBT in the treatment for panic. Among  clients who were less motivated to change, therapist adherence to the treat 

ment ptotocol resulted in poorer outcomes, whereas for more motivated  clients, therapist adherence was unrelated to outcome. This result suggests that  for clients who do not seem to believe the treatment will work, the greater the  degree to which the therapist continues to deliver the ingredients ofthe treat 

ment, the less the client will benefit, probably because the agreement on the  tasks of therapy is low.  

Conclusions for Specificity  

A thorough review of the literature provides precious little evidence for  the specificity of any psychotherapy, thereby suggesting that the common fac tors are the potent aspects of treatment. However, the absence of research  evidence for specificity is not sufficient; there must actually be evidence  that supports the common factors. Through the years, this evidence has  been accumulating (Norcross, 2002). Unfortunately, the evidence has  become quite diffuse because integrated models ofthe common factors have  not been emphasized. That is, evidence for a particular factor has been stud ied isolated from other factors, creating a potpourri of results that limits the  utility of common factor research to improve the quality of psychotherapy  (Imel & Wampold, 2008). The purpose of this volume is to examine how  the common factors can be integrated in such a way as to lead to improved  outcomes.  

COMMON FACTORS  

The remainder of this chapter briefly reviews the literature on common  factors models and research. This sketch foreshadows the various chapters in  this book in that the evidence supporting the importance of various common  factors is presented.  

The Nature of the Common Factors  

As noted, Rosenzweig in 1936 originated the common factors notion  (see Prologue, this volume); he described a number of implicit common factors  

66 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
that explain treatment successes, including the following: (a) the inspiting ot  stimulating aspects ofthe therapist's personality, (b) the reintegration of per sonality through the systematic application of some therapeutic ideology,  (c) implicit psychological processes such as cathatsis ot social reconditioning,  and (d) the reformulation of psychological events. Although common factors  models have never been a predominate force in psychotherapy (Arkowitz,  1992), there has been enough interest that by 1990 Grencavage and Norcross  found nearly 90 common factors referenced in the literature. A number of  attempts have been made to classify the common factors into categories to  make sense of the structure of the common factors (Grencavage & Norcross,  1990; Lambert & Bergin, 1994; Tracey, Lichtenbeig, Goodyear, Claibom, &  Wampold, 2003; Weinberger, 2002; Weinberger, Rasco, & Hofmann, 2007).  

Missing from these attempts to list and then categorize the common fac tors is that the common factors are not analogues of specific ingredients that  can be added and removed singularly (Imel & Wampold, 2008). One often  reads that the most prominent common factor is the relationship with an  empathic healer, but quite obviously this ingredient cannot be removed from  psychotherapy and still have a practice that would be classified as psychothet apy. Consequently, the common factors cannot be experimentally manipulated  in the same manner as specific ingredients, but this does not suggest logically  that such factots cannot be responsible for the benefits of psychotherapy.  

Anothet issue with listing and categorizing common factors is that such  factors are intertwined with each other and with the specific treatments that  are delivered. Over the years, there have been several attempts to develop  integrated models involving the common factors. The most notable integrated  model has been presented by Frank and Frank, most recently in 1991\.  Wampold and colleagues (Imel & Wampold, 2008; Wampold, 2001b, 2007;  Wampold, Imel, Bhati, & Johnson Jennings, 2007\) and Duncan, Miller, and  Sparks (2004) have extended this model by emphasizing the contextual nature  of psychotherapy. In the remainder of this chaptet, the intertwined nature of  the common factors is discussed by examining the most prominent common  factors, research in support of these common factots, and the ways in which  the common factots ovetlap with each other.  

The Intertwined Common Factors  

The intertwined nature of the common factors can be demonstrated by  choosing any prominent one and examining the research and theory related  to it. In this chapter, the investigation begins with the focus on therapist  effects, that is, the professional psychotherapist.  

Historically, the development of clinical trials focused on the interven tion being studied and ignored the provider of the intervention (Wampold,  

RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR THE COMMON FACTORS MODELS 67   
2001a; Wampold &. Bhati, 2004). For example, an early application (circa  1920s) of randomized designs examined the relative worth of various educa tional programs and ignored the provider (i.e., the teacher) ofthe programs.  That is, it was assumed that the teachers would deliver the educational pro grams uniformly so that the outcomes would not be dependent on the teacher.  Later, farmers and physicians were ignored, whereas emphasis was placed on  farming methods (e.g., crop varieties and fertilizers) and medical interventions,  respectively. Psychotherapy followed suit, emphasizing clinical trials of partic ular forms of psychotherapy (Goldfried & Wolfe, 1998). Indeed, analyses of  clinical trials rarely examined the degree to which therapists were responsible  for the benefits ofthe treatment (Wampold, 2006b), leaving unanswered the  question of whether some therapists consistently produce better outcomes than  other therapists, regardless of the type of psychotherapy.  

Essentially, it appears that even in clinical trials in which therapists are  selected for their skill, are trained and supervised, and are monitored to main tain adherence to the treatment protocol, a significant proportion ofthe vari ability in outcomes is attributable to therapists within treatments, and this  therapist effect is at least one order of magnitude greater than any differences  among treatments in these trials (Crits-Christoph et al., 1991; Huppert et al.,  2001; Kim, Wampold, & Bolt, 2006). Similarly, in naturalistic settings, it is  becoming clear that some therapists are more effective than other therapists,  regardless of the type of therapy administered (Lutz, Leon, Martinovich,  Lyons, & Stiles, 2007; Wampold & Brown, 2005).  

The presence of therapist effects raises the critical question, "What are  the characteristics and actions of effective therapists?" Although we do not  know for certain (Beutler et al., 2004), one good candidate is related to the  working alliance, a prominently mentioned common factot. The working  alliance is defined as the bond between the thetapist and client as well as the  agreement about the tasks and goals of therapy (Bordin, 1979; Bordin, Horvath,  & Greenberg, 1994; Hatcher, Barends, Hansell, & Gutfreund, 1995; Hatcher  & Barends, 2006; Horvath & Bedi, 2002; Horvath & Luborsky, 1993). Sev 

eral meta-analyses have shown that the alliance, measured early in therapy,  is strongly associated with outcomes (Hotvath & Bedi, 2002; Horvath &  Symonds, 1991; Martin, Garske, & Davis, 2000). It is important to note that  the alliance-outcome relationship is robust in that it appears across various  therapies, including those that do not emphasize this aspect, such as CBT, as  well as the more relational therapies, such as psychodynamic and humanistic  treatments; indeed, the alliance is related to outcomes in psychopharmacol 

ogy (Blatt, Zuroff, Quinlan, & Pilkonis, 1996; Klein et al., 2003; Zuroff &  Blatt, 2006).  

DeRubeis, Brotman, and Gibbons (2005), howevet, raised the possibil ity that the alliance is not critical to outcome in therapy because there is ambi 

68 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
guity about cause and effect ofthe alliance and outcome. First, it may be that  the alliance is due to prior gains made in therapy and therefore is the effect of  therapeutic progress rathet than the cause. That is, the alliance measured, say  at Session 3, is a consequence of early symptom reduction, and this reduction  is responsible for ultimate improvement ofthe client, rather than the alliance.  Various analyses that have examined the time course of alliance and symptoms  have produced convincing evidence that the alliance is not the result of early  improvement and that subsequent improvement can be traced to the alliance  rather than early improvement (Klein et al., 2003; Zuroff &. Blatt, 2006). A  second issue taised by DeRubeis et al. (2005) was that the alliance between  therapist and client may be due, in fact, to the client; that is, some clients come  to therapy with an ability to form an alliance (Mallinckrodt, 1991), and it is  these clients who progress in therapy. Baldwin et al. (2007) showed, on the  contrary, that client contributions to the alliance were not related to outcome;  those clients who formed a better alliance with a particular therapist did not  have better outcomes than did clients who formed a poorer alliance with the  same therapist. A third possibility is the one that places the emphasis on the  therapist: Therapists who get better outcomes generally are the therapists who  are better able to form an alliance with a variety of clients. Indeed, it is this  possibility that was demonstrated by Baldwin et al. They found that therapists  who generally form better alliances also had better outcomes. So, a client who  has difficulty forming relationships has a bettet outcome with a therapist who  can form better alliances across clients. This client has a relatively poot  alliance with the more effective therapist but that alliance is better than it  would have been with a less effective therapist, and the ultimate outcome will  also be bettet. Baldwin et al. showed that much of the variability in therapist  effectiveness was due to their variability in forming an alliance.  

It appeais that the alliance is a robust common factor and that the thera pist's conttibution to the alliance is important. However, the alliance is  dependent on the delivery of a particulat treatment. Although it is possible to  form a relationship with a healer, there can be no agreement about the tasks  and goals of therapy and critical aspects of the alliance without a particular  treatment. As Frank and Frank (1991) emphasized, two common factors are the  myth and ritual. The myth is the rationale for the treatment and the explana tion for the client's difficulties, which ate communicated to the client by the  therapist in a convincing way. In the common factors perspective, the ration ale and explanation need not be scientific truth; what is important is that  the myth be accepted by the client and lead to adaptive responses (Imel &  Wampold, 2008; Wampold, 2007; Wampold et al., 2007). The acceptance of  an alternative and adaptive explanation for one's problems is insight, accord ing to the common factors model (Wampold et al., 2007). The adaptive client  actions ate part of the ritual, which is roughly equivalent to the therapeutic  

RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR THE COMMON FACTORS MODELS 69   
actions. Psychological treatments all have in common some rationale and  explanation and some therapeutic actions; these are the aspects of treatment  that make treatment per se a common factor, as explained in chapter 5 in  this volume.  

A good working alliance is an indication that the client has accepted the  rationale for the treatment, the explanation for the disorder, and is willing to  participate in the process of therapy. A critical component of how this leads to  change is involved in replacing a maladaptive explanation with an adaptive  one. The maladaptive explanation is discouraging because the client cannot see  how any action will lead to progress: Put simply, they are stuck. Frank and Frank  (1991) would say they are demoralized, whereas Bandura (1997) would say  that they have low self-efficacy for change. Acceptance of an alternative  explanation changes the client's expectation, which is a ctitical component of  any healing practice (Wampold, 2007). Over the yeats, modem medicine has  discounted the importance of expectations, and indeed medicine is based on  the demonstration that medical interventions are more effective than placebos,  which are designed to control for expectations. However, research on placebos  has demonstrated that expectations themselves result in demonstrable change  in the body and account for much of the benefits of many medical procedures  (Wampold et al., 2005). It is then not surprising that expectations are critical  to the effectiveness of psychotherapy (Greenberg, Constantino, & Bruce, 2006;  Kirsch, 2005), as discussed in chaptet 5 in this volume.  

Another critical component ofthe alliance involves agreement about the  tasks and goals of therapy; that is, therapist and client are on the same page with  regard to the process of therapy. Research indicates that successful psychother apy involves collaborative and purposeful work (Hatcher & Barends, 2006),  which raises the ctitical point that psychotherapy is not a treatment adminis tered to a client but a process in which the client is engaged (Wampold, 2007).  This leads to the conclusion that critical common factors involve the client  (Bohart & Tallman, 1999; Duncan et al., 2004). If one considers that in any  study of psychotherapy, the largest amount of variance is what in research  design is called error variability. In actuality, this is client variability. Although  not all of unexplained variance is easily identified as due to clients per se, with out a doubt one cannot undetstand what makes therapy work without under standing the client's contribution, as discussed in chapter 3 in this volume.  

Mobilizing the Common Factors  

If the common factors are critical to the success of psychotherapy, how  can they be mobilized to increase the benefits that accrue to clients? Of  coutse, education and training in the common factors is important. There is  

70 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
some evidence, for example, that specific manualized training in the alliance  leads to better alliances (Crits-Christoph et al., 2006).  

Discussion of education and training in an important way begs the ques tion because such efforts are concentrated in the graduate training of therapists.  It has become clear that despite the training and despite the fact that practic ing therapists are achieving admirable outcomes, there is much variability in  outcomes among therapists. How can the quality of outcomes be improved  across the board for practicing therapists?  

The answer to this question may be quite a simple one and one that  applies to learning most any skill: continued practice with feedback. Learn ing to sail involves practice with feedback from the environment and from  experts. Without feedback, learning any skill is almost impossible. Yet the  field of psychotherapy has only recently begun to measure the outcomes of  clients in practice and use these outcomes as feedback to therapists (Lambert,  Hansen, & Finch, 2001; Miller, Duncan, & Hubble, 2005). It is not sutpris ing, perhaps, that feedback has been found to improve the quality of services  (Lambert et al., 2001\) often dramatically, as discussed in chapter 8 and other  chapters in this book. Clearly, feedback is an effective means to mobilize the  common factors in psychothetapy.  

IMPLICATIONS  

A brief review of the history reveals that psychotherapy and medicine  are intertwined. It is not surprising then that psychotherapy has focused on  establishing particular treatments for particulat disorders. Nevertheless, the  research evidence indicates that a variety of tteatments, when administered  by therapists who believe in the treatment and when accepted by the clients,  are equally effective. Indeed, there is little evidence that the specific ingredi 

ents of any treatment are responsible for the benefits of therapy. On the other  hand, there is a plethora of evidence that suggests that therapists vary in the  outcomes that are produced and that these differences are due to common fac tors, such as the therapist's ability to form an alliance with his ot her clients.  These results have several implications for research and practice:  

• Clinical trials comparing two treatments should be discontinued.  Much money has been spent on clinical trials, with the same  result: "Both treatments were more effective than no treatment,  but there were no differences in outcomes between the two  treatments." Continued research that looks at new vatiations of  old treatments will yield little that can be transported to systems  of care to improve the outcomes of clients.  

RESEARCH EVIDENCE FOR THE COMMON FACTORS MODELS 71   
Research should be devoted to understanding the process of therapy  and how outcomes can be improved. Therapy has been shown to  work, but it is now time to understand how the common factors  can be mobilized to increase the benefits. In many of the chap 

ters that follow, innovative research is reported that is beginning  to shed light on what works and what does not. For example,  feedback to therapists about their clients' progress has been  shown to improve outcomes (see chap. 8 and 12, this volume).  Such results have enormous implications for improving mental  health services and will lead to a bettet understanding of the  important elements of psychotherapy.  

Particular treatments should not be mandated. Because there is  absolutely no evidence that one tteatment for a particular dis order is more effective than any other, it makes no sense to  mandate treatments. The notion of tequiring clinicians to use  empirically supported treatment or evidence-based treatments  simply is not supported by the research evidence.  

Clinicians should be accountable for the outcomes of their services.  Rather than accountability deriving from documentation  that a particular treatment was delivered, accountability should  emanate from the therapist (see chap. 9, this volume). Of course,  to be accountable, therapists need to have access to information  about their outcomes. This information is a critical component  of effective services because, as discussed in several chapters,  knowing the outcomes of clients results in better outcomes. That  is, to a great extent, therapists are self-correcting.  

QUESTIONS FROM THE EDITORS  

1\. Given the significant contributions of common factors to outcome, how can  the historical and current paucity of research on these factors be explained?  First, characterizing the amount of research on common factors in terms of  paucity is not quite right. There is a great deal of research on the common fac tors, particularly on the therapeutic alliance. What seems to be lacking, in some  contexts, is recognition that the evidence supports the common factors rather  than specific ingredients. As discussed in this chapter, clinical science seems  focused on identification ofthe most effective treatment for particular disorders,  as in medicine. The research supporting common factors is often ignored.  The focus on treatment is fostered by funding agencies, such as the  National Institute of Mental Health, which are partial to RCTs. Research on  the common factors typically is not experimental; that is, the presence or  

72 BRUCE E. WAMPOLD   
absence of a common factot cannot be manipulated. Thus, this research is not  privileged by being classified as experimental. However, this should not detract  from the fact that common factors may be causal to outcomes in psychothet apy. Indeed, as shown in this chapter and in many ofthe other chapters in this  

volume, there is a wealth of evidence supporting the common factots.  2\. What role, if any, does researchers allegiance play in studies on the com mon factors?  

As mentioned in this chapter, researcher allegiance in RCTs has been  shown to be strong. Researchers who have an allegiance to one treatment in  a compatison of treatments typically find that theit treatment is mote effec tive. How this works is not quite cleat, but it appeals that the thetapists  in the study are influenced by the teseatchet's allegiance. For example, a  researcher who may have developed one of the treatments often ttains and  supervises therapists, and the thetapists are quite aware that this treatment is  expected to be bettet. That is, the researchers have communicated to the  thetapists the expectation that the favored treatment is superior, and the  therapists in turn convey that expectation to the clients.  

It also is not cleat how allegiance affects studies that investigate the com mon factors. My own meta-analyses showing that all treatments are equally  effective have been criticized as being influenced by my allegiance to the dodo  bitd conjecture. However, there is a difference between this allegiance and the  allegiance of researchers in RCTs of particulat treatments. In a meta-analysis,  the critics have access to the studies and can expose any research bias by rean alyzing the data. Indeed, Smith and Glass (1977) were roundly criticized when  they found that behavioral tteatments were not really more effective than  othet treatments. Howevet, a number of reanalyses, aimed at exposing Smith  and Glass's bias, failed to reach a different conclusion.

CLIENTS: THE NEGLECTED COMMON  FACTOR IN PSYCHOTHERAPY  

`ARTHUR C BOHART AND KAREN TALLMAN`  

Facts don't cease to exist because they are ignored.    
—Robert Louis Stevenson  

Professional discoutse and practice have long ptivileged the position and  point of view ofthe therapist. In the "dtama" of therapy, clinicians restructure  clients' cognitions, extinguish fears, bring forth insight, unlock repressed  affects, help restore brain functioning, and loosen the bonds of familial terror.  Clients, in contrast, have nearly always played Nell Fenwick to the field's  Dudley Do-Rights, bound to the tracks of destruction by weak ego stmctutes,  regressive potential, borderline defenses, lack of skills, and other presumed  deficits. Thus, therapists "intervene," whereas clients "respond," or worse,  "resist" the heroic efforts ofthe helper (cf. Angus, 1992). Told in this way, it  is hard if not impossible to imagine a countemarrative, one in which the con sumer of thetapeutic services is more protagonist than prop, managing at least  some wotkable accommodations no matter how debilitating his ot het prob 

lems (Rosenbaum, 1996).  

Yet the fact is that clients' active involvement in the therapeutic process  is critical to success. Indeed, in a comprehensive review of 50 years of literature  on the subject for the fifth edition ofthe Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behav ior Change, Orlinsky, R0nnestad, and Willutzki (2004) stated, "the quality of  the patient's participation . . . \[emerges\] as the most \[italics added\] important  

83   
determinant of outcome" (p. 324)—more so than therapist attitudes, behav iors, or techniques. The authors identified 11 additional variables linked to  outcome. These included the following 10: client suitability, client cooperation  versus resistance, client experience ofthe therapeutic bond, client contribution  to the bond, client interactive collaboration, client expressiveness, client affir mation ofthe therapist, client openness versus defensiveness, therapeutic real izations (clients' in-session impacts of therapy events), and treatment duration.  

Note the number of factors that are directly related to the client.  Furthetmore, the client and factors in the client's life account fot more  variance in therapeutic outcome than any othet factor. Asay and Lambert  (1999), on the basis of their assessment of the literature, portioned 40% of  variance of outcome to the client and to factors in his or her life. Wampold's  (2001) meta-analysis suggests that about 13% of total outcome variance is  explained by treatment (therapist, alliance, model or technique, allegiance,  and placebo), leaving 87% ofthe variance attributed to client or extrathera peutic factors as well as unexplained and error variance. It is not unreason able to suppose that a substantial portion of the unexplained variance is due  to the client.  

Years ago, researchers Bergin and Garfield (1994) called for a reforma tion in psychotherapy. Aftet teviewing the evidence, they challenged practi tioners and theoreticians to think anew:  

Clients are not inert objects upon which techniques are adminis tered. ... \[Therefore\] it is important to rethink the terminology that  assumes that "effects" are like Aristotelian impetus causality. As therapists  have depended more upon the client's resources, more change seems to occur  \[italics added\], (pp. 825-826)  

Although this call is finally beginning to be heeded, client contributions to  therapy continue to be neglected in most theoretical models of change, with  a few exceptions (cf. Bohart & Tallman, 1999; Duncan, Miller, & Sparks,  2004; Duncan & Moynihan, 1994). The therapist and his or her techniques  are still seen as the primary curative factors. This emphasis on the primacy of  techniques has unfortunately intensified as the proposition of evidence-based  practice has risen in popularity.  

Once more, the time has come to set the story straight, to spotlight the  largest yet most neglected factor in treatment outcome: the client. Although  experimental studies of client factors are few and far between and most research  favors correlational, qualitative, and retrospective designs, a strong case emerges  for the potency ofthe human client in successful psychotherapy. This chapter  begins with a short survey ofthe potential fot self-righting and self-healing. We  then consider research regarding the client's role as an active contributor to the  therapy process. We review data regarding the factors traditionally thought to  account for the effectiveness of psychotherapy and offer an alternative account  

84 BOHART AND TALLMAN   
highlighting the importance of the client. The chapter concludes with the  assertion that the client offers the best explanation for the dodo vetdict as  well as a discussion ofthe implications of a client-centered paradigm for psycho therapy practice, training, and the broader field of mental health.  

HUMAN POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE  

Research on the human potential for self-healing is considerable. It comes  from several sources, including the following: (a) self-generated change and  spontaneous recovery, (b) placebo effects, (c) resilience and posttraumatic  growth, and (d) the corrective effects of self-expression or disclosure.  

Self-Generated Change and Spontaneous Recovery  

Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that people overcome significant  problems without the benefit of professional intervention. When asked, 90%  of individuals polled report having overcome a significant health, emotional,  addiction, ot lifestyle problem in the prior year (Gurin, 1990). Data provide  support for such self-reports, even for problems most view as extreme. For  instance, many individuals overcome problems considered chronic, such as  antisocial behavior (J. T. Tedeschi & Felson, 1994\) and substance abuse.  About the latter, researchers Miller and Carroll (2006) noted, "Most people  who tecovet from drug problems do so on theit own, without fotmal tteat ment" (p. 295). Even the coutse fot people who receive personality diagnoses  is more benign than commonly believed. Most individuals diagnosed with  personality disorders improve over time (Perry, 1993; Skodol et al., 2007).  Zanatini, Ftankenbutg, Hennen, Reich, and Silk (2006) found that over a  10-year period, 88% of those diagnosed with borderline personality disorder  achieved remission. These studies are confounded because in many cases the  individuals studied had teceived some kind of treatment. Nonetheless, given  that peisonality disorders are conceived of as engrained, difficult to change  personality characteristics, this is encouraging. In this regard, Fonagy and  Bateman (2006) pointed out that the natural course of borderline personal ity disorder is more benign than previously believed and that the treatment  tesistance of people with this diagnosis may have mote to do with the iatro 

genic effects of therapy than with the condition itself.  

Prochaska (1999) studied how individuals overcome problems without  the aid of psychotherapy. People use the same methods and processes used in  therapy. As an illustration, though exposure is a common procedure used for  treating phobias and ttauma, the field of psychotherapy cannot lay exclusive  claim to it. The popularity ofthe old saying "If you are thrown off a hotse, get  

CLIENTS: THE NEGLECTED COMMON FACTOR 85   
back on" indicates that people have long understood the beneficial effects of  the method. Prochaska, Norcross, and DiClemente (1994) have made a com pelling case that all change is self-change: Therapy is simply self-change that  is professionally coached.  

Additional support for the role ofthe client in the change process is pro vided by data on spontaneous recovery. Lambert, Shapiro, and Bergin (1986)  estimated that about 40% of people recover without professional intervention.  Moreover, a strong endorsement of the impact of client resources is found in  the pretreatment change literature. Several studies have shown that 60% or  more of clients reported the occurrence of improvement in the period between  scheduling and attending theit first session (Lawson, 1994; Weiner-Davis,  de Shazer, & Gingerich, 1987). Finally, Miller and C'de Baca (2001) reported  a phenomenon they termed quantum change. This refers to the experience of  a sudden, significant personal transformation. Interviews with 55 individuals  in the Albuquerque, New Mexico, area led the authors to conclude that such  experiences were common—further testament to the human capacity fot  self-change.  

Placebo Effects  

Placebo effects, or the benefits resulting from the client's expectation that  treatment will help, offet more evidence ofthe significant role that clients play.  In a review of 46 meta-analytic studies, for example, Grissom (1996) found that  the effect size (ES) of placebo conditions was 0.44 compared with no-tteatment  control groups. In two ofthe largest randomized clinical trials ever conducted—  the Treatment of Depression Collaborative Research Project (Elkin, 1994\) and  the Collaborative Cocaine Treatment Study (Crits-Christoph et al., 1999)—  participants in the placebo and minimal clinical management conditions  achieved outcomes roughly equivalent to those in psychotherapy. The strength  of such findings led Honos-Webb (2005) to conclude that placebo control and  minimal clinical management meet the criteria for classification as an empiri cally supported treatment.  

Similarly, Kirsch et al.'s (2008) massive review of all studies about selec tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) submitted to the Federal Drug  Administration reported comparable results of SSRIs and placebos, with diffet ences found between SSRIs and placebos only for the most severely depressed  clients, and even these differences were small (Kirsch et al., 2008). The simi larity of results between sugar pills and SSRIs suggests that change is far more  about the individual and his or her expectations regarding change than the  treatment provided. One way of undetstanding the placebo phenomena is that  the client's expectation for change stimulates innate self-healing capabilities;  in other words, the placebo effect represents the client's personal agency in  

86 BOHART AND TALLMAN   
action. Considet also that when active placebos, which mimic the side effects  of the experimental drug, are used, no differences between drug and placebo  conditions emerge (see chap. 7, this volume). It is thought that side effects sig nal that a powerful drug has been ingested, heightening expectations and  releasing client's regenerative processes. Going one step further, techniques in  psychotherapy may be also viewed as active placebos that similarly initiate  client self-healing. The consistency ofthe placebo effect demands that it should  no longer be denigrated. More attention might be paid to understanding its  potency in mobilizing and supporting clients' innate, self-curative processes.  

Resilience and Posttraumatic Growth  

Evidence regarding human resilience provides extra support for the  human potential for self-healing (Bonanno, 2004). For instance, being exposed  to trauma does not necessarily cause posttraumatic stress disorder. Ozer, Best,  Lipsey, and Weiss (2003) noted that "roughly 50%-60% of the U.S. popu 

lation is exposed to traumatic stress but only 5%-10% develop PTSD \[post traumatic stress disorder\]" (p. 54). In theit literature review, Masten, Best, and  Garmazy (1990) concluded, "studies of psychosocial resilience support the  view that human psychological development is highly buffered and self righting" (p. 438). A good example is found in a longitudinal study conducted  by Vaillant (1993) of 456 men. Though all were regarded as broken beyond  repair at age 25, most self-righted. Approximately 64% were rated in the top  25% of mental health by the time they had entered theit 60s. So compelling  are the data that Masten (2001) posited that resilience is "a common phenom enon .. . development is robust even in the face of severe adversity" (p. 227).  

Petsonal factors do play a role, such as the person's temperament and dis position, intelligence quotient, and level of self-esteem. Environmental fac tors such as the presence of a good social support network, a mentor, a role  model, or even a therapist are also important. Yet, even children without good  environmental buffering often show some resilience (Masten, 2001). Similar  results are found in the literature on recovery from traumatic life events. R. G.  Tedeschi, Park, and Calhoun (1998) reported, for instance, that 40%-60% of  people who suffer a trauma recover on their own or report personal growth  following the experience. Such changes include positive self-perception,  improved sense of personal strengths, and better interpersonal relationships  (Calhoun & Tedeschi, 2006).  

Corrective Effects of Self-Expression or Disclosure  

Added support for human resilience comes from research on the bene ficial effects of both self-exptession and disclosure. Several studies have  

CLIENTS: THE NEGLECTED COMMON FACTOR 87   
shown that writing or discussing a troubling or traumatic event facilitates  healing (Harvey, Orbuch, Chwalisz, & Garwood, 1991; Hemenover, 2003;  Pennebaker, 1997). In one, Segal and Murray (1994) wrote that giving indi viduals an opportunity to talk into a tape recorder worked about as well as  cognitive therapy in managing traumatic expetiences.  

In sum, as this brief survey shows—encompassing spontaneous recovery,  self-generated change, placebo effects, resilience, posttraumatic growth, and  the corrective effects of self-expression and disclosure—humans have a good  deal of potential for righting themselves when struck by adversity.  

THE CLIENT'S CONTRIBUTION TO  

THE EFFICACY OF PSYCHOTHERAPY  

Additional substantiation of the defining role that clients play in ther apy is found in research supporting client (a) involvement and patticipation;  (b) perceptions of psychotherapy; (c) agency, activity, reflexivity, and cre ativity; (d) integration of therapy experiences into everyday life; and (e) early  change.  

Client Involvement and Participation  

Recall Orlinsky et al.'s (2004) review of therapeutic process and treat ment outcome. They concluded that the quality ofthe client's participation is  "most detetminant of outcome" (p. 324). Client participation encompasses  openness and willingness to engage in the tasks of psychotherapy, cooperative  involvement, and a collaborative versus dependent disposition. In each case,  the majority of studies show a positive relationship with success in therapy.  

Client Perception of Psychotherapy  

Historically, client perceptions of the therapist and therapy were consid ered suspect, distorted by psychopathology. The data show otherwise. As an  example, the client's perception of the therapeutic relationship has been con sistently found to correlate more highly with outcome than the therapist's  (Busseri & Tyler, 2004; Zuroff et al., 2000). On a related note, research has  shown that client ratings of therapist empathy and the collaborative nature of  the relationship correlate as, or more highly, with outcome than ratings by ther apists and objective observers (Bohart, Elliott, Greenberg, &. Watson, 2002).  

Similarly, Levitt and Rennie (2004) reported that when therapists and  clients looked at tapes of their interactions, the perspectives of the therapists  and clients only partially ovetlapped. They noted, "Three stoties may be occut 

88 BOHART AND TALLMAN   
ring at once: the stoty ofthe dialogue between the client and the therapist, the  client's inner story, and the therapist's inner story" (p. 308). Others have also  reported only a modest relationship between the clients' and therapists' views  of the therapy process (Elliott et al., 1994; Rosenbaum & Talmon, 2006).  

Combine these two findings—that clients perception ofthe therapy rela tionship predicts outcome and that clients perceive therapy differently than  do therapists—and the implication emetges that clients select from therapy  what they need to get better. For instance, Mackrill (2008) had clients keep  diaries on theit experiences both inside and outside of therapy. He found that  clients were highly active in integrating their therapy expetiences in their own  ways into their everyday lives. As an example, one client focused on the impor tance of positive thinking before starting therapy. Later in therapy, the client  interpreted what was happening in terms of learning to use positive thinking.  Positive thinking was not one of the therapist's goals. Clients, apparently,  entet thetapy with theit own ideas about what they need (Philips, Werbart,  Wennberg, & Schubert, 2007), and these ideas influence how they construe  and use what therapists offer (Hubble, Duncan, & Miller, 1999). Similarly,  Bohart and Boyd (1997) established that clients perceived empathic responses  from therapists as supportive, if they felt in need of support, and as insightful,  when insight was needed.  

Client Agency, Activity, Reflexivity, and Creativity  

Clients, therefore, are anything but passive recipients of therapeutic wis dom. On the contrary, they continuously evaluate what is happening in ther apy and then actively work to arrange events to suit their purposes. Hoemer  (2007) found that clients perceive themselves as agentic, valued their own con tributions to the process, and attributed the results to their efforts. Consider a  classic study conducted by Garfinkel (1967). Participants posed problems to a  therapist whose responses were limited to a simple yes or no answer. In a wrin kle sure to be rejected by any modem institutional review board, the therapists'  answers to the queries were entirely random. Despite this less than helpful  experimental condition, participants pieced togethet cohetent accounts of  their experience and derived solutions to their presenting problems.  

Since Garfinkel's research, qualitative studies (Levitt, 2004; Levitt &  Rennie, 2004; Rennie, 2000\) have shown that clients are highly active, albeit  often at a covert level, during sessions. This literature indicates that clients  often enter therapy with a plan and work to steer sessions in directions that they  perceive will be beneficial. They even redirect theit therapist if he or she is off  course. Greaves (2006) found in het study of 13 clients, that  

the clients exhibited initiative and engaged in meaning-making processes  to make sense of their difficulties, redefine and remoralize themselves, and  

CLIENTS: THE NEGLECTED COMMON FACTOR 89   
try out new ways of being. Not only did they act in planning and manage ment capacities, they also played the role of truth-seeker, motivator, advo cator, and negotiator to further the pursuit and attainment of their goals.  They blended their own wisdom with their therapist's expertise in idio 

syncratic ways, after having prepared their therapist to potentially offer  the most appropriate assistance. These clients also nurtured a strong thera peutic relationship and utilized learning and healing opportunities within  the context of that relationship, (p. xii)  

Research shows, too, that clients tework therapeutic blundets in ways that  enhance therapeutic success (Levitt, 2004; Levitt &. Rennie, 2004; Tallman,  Robinson, Kay, Harvey, & Bohart, 1994).  

Closely related to agency, activity, and reflexivity is client creativity.  Although tately examined, much of the evidence cited previously supports  the role that client creativity plays in successful outcome. How else can one  explain clients using therapeutic errors to positive effect? It is as though clients  give their therapists the benefit of the doubt. In short, they want their thera 

pists to be successful; the therapists' success means their success. Most practic ing clinicians have also experienced what Talmon (1990) found in interviews  with former clients. He noted that many "reported following suggestions that  I could not remember having made. They created theit own interpretations,  which were sometimes quite different from what I recollected and sometimes  more creative and suitable versions of my suggestions" (p. 60). More directly,  Selby's (2004) qualitative analysis showed that half of clients exhibited  creativity ot inventiveness that both altered the direction and facilitated  the success of therapy.  

How Clients Relate Therapy to Their Everyday Lives  

As Mackrill (2008) observed, we do not know much about how clients  actually integrate their therapy experiences with everyday life. Dreier (2000),  on the basis of his studies of family therapy, concluded that therapy does not  take place primarily in the therapist's office. Clients actively transform what  they have learned in therapy and apply it to their life situations. "Clients con 

figure the meaning of therapy within the structure of their ongoing social prac tice" (Dreier, 2000, p. 253).  

For example, Moertl (2007) found that clients talked over their day treat ment experiences with friends and family and reflected on these clinic experi ences while at home. Clients also participate in activities such as reading  self-help books, reflecting and self-questioning, thinking about dialogues with  the therapist, or allowing time before or after the session to prepare (Levitt,  Butler, & Hill, 2006). Conversely, Moertl (2007) found that clients also trans ferred experiences from everyday life into the day clinic. For instance, they  

90 BOHART AND TALLMAN   
compared theit relationships at home with relationships at the clinic, using  strategies at the clinic that were effective at home. Mackrill (2008) had  clients keep diaries and found that they actively learned through their own  efforts of integrating information gleaned from their own experiments,  friends, movies, clairvoyants, television, and other outside sources of ideas  with what they were learning in therapy. Finally, Kuhnlein (1999) inter 

viewed 49 clients who had received cognitive-behavior therapy and found  that participants did not blindly adopt what was presented in therapy.  Instead, they took what they found useful and combined it with their own  previously existing schemas.  

Early Change  

One significant bit of evidence fot the importance of the client's contri bution and resources to success in psychotherapy can be found in the emetg ing evidence fot early change (e.g., Brown, Burlingame, Lamberg, Jones, &  Vaccaro, 2001; Howard, Kopta, Krause, & Orlinsky, 1986). Consider the clas sic Howard et al. (1986) article on the dose-effect relationship: First, 30% of  clients, now called early responders, improved by the second session; 60% to  65% of people experienced significant symptomatic relief within one to seven  visits, which increased to 70% to 75% after 6 months and to 85% at 1 year.  Now consider, as an example, that in 1986, one of the most prevalent orien tations of therapists was psychodynamic, which traditionally views change in  tetms of years rather than weeks. The majority of clients in Howard et al.'s  study achieved change duting the very preliminary stages of therapy, perhaps  even before, according to the model, the transference relationship was set and  therapy had really begun. The point, that these eatly changes occutred  before the major mechanisms of a theoretical approach had time to become  operative, can also be made about other orientations (Snyder, Michael, &  Cheavens, 1999).  

Not all clients are early responders. In fact, different clients follow differ ent change trajectories (Stulz, Lutz, Leach, Lucock, & Batkham, 2007). How ever, the fact that eatly change is so common reinforces the idea that clients  and their resources frequently are more responsible for change in therapy than  therapists' models, techniques, and theoties. Why not all clients are early  responders and what to do about that is an important issue and awaits fiitthet  investigation.  

In a related finding, the best predictor of change appears to be higher  levels of distress at the start of therapy, more so than the client's diagnosis,  chronicity ofthe problem, or the treatment population (Brown et al., 2001).  On the other hand, others have reported that clients who are rated as more  functionally impaired, who are diagnosed with personality disorders, or who  

CLIENTS: THE NEGLECTED COMMON FACTOR 91   
have had poor early relationships with caregivers do more poorly in therapy  than those without these histories (Castonguay &. Beutlet, 2006).  It is not clear what these findings mean or how to reconcile them. Do  diagnoses of functional impairment, personality disorder, and early relationship  issues imply that clients are so impaired that they are robbed of a capacity to  engage in proactive self-healing efforts? Are there clients who lack the capac ity for self-healing? Not necessarily. The fact that higher levels of distress are  the best predictot of outcome suggests that being motivated to get involved in  therapy may be more important than hypothesized personal deficits. At the  same time, it may be that long-engrained patterns of behavior may make  change more difficult. It may also be that therapy administered in the studies  of client impairment was not what was needed to support these clients' self healing efforts. Finally, it may also be that some clients elicit negative therapist  relationship behaviors that in turn interfere with their ability to make use of  the therapy environment (see chap. 4, this volume). Further research and  analysis is needed. The fact remains that many clients respond positively very  quickly in therapy, before most models of psychotherapy would predict. This  only makes sense if it is the client who is driving the bus and the therapist and  treatment approach are but passengets on the ride to change.  In sum, available evidence shows that clients are not dependent variables  on which the independent variable of therapy operates. Far from it; they are  active, generative agents, working to get what they want and need, protecting  themselves when needed, and even supporting the therapist when they deem  it necessary. Clients modify old concepts and use their revisions, create new  concepts, think of alternatives, and integrate what they learn.  

EVALUATION OF THE TRADITIONAL  

MODEL OF PSYCHOTHERAPY  

The traditional model, patterned after physicians' treatment of physical  diseases, holds that specific interventions are needed for the treatment of spe cific disorders. In this worldview, the therapist, an expert, diagnoses the client's  problem and then chooses and delivers the appropriate intervention. In com bination, therapist expertise and the technique itself are considered the forces  behind successful psychotherapy.  

Traditional beliefs notwithstanding, the empirical evidence does not  support this view of the factors responsible for the efficacy of psychotherapy.  First, as Wampold argues in chapter 2 of this volume, all bona fide thera peutic approaches work about equally well, regardless of diagnosis. Second,  research also challenges the importance of technique. Indeed, estimates  based on meta-analytic studies have shown that specific techniques or models  

92 BOHART AND TALLMAN   
of therapy contribute little to thetapeutic success. Fot instance, Wampold  (2001) attributed 13% of variance in outcome to treatment, and of that, only  about 8% is due to techniques; in othet words, ofthe total vatiance of change,  model differences account fot but 1% ofthe variance (ot an ES of 0.20). In a  review for the fifth edition of the Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavior  Change, Beutler et al. (2004) reported correlations ranging from 0 to .11  between specific techniques and outcome.  

These data fit with what clients say about therapy. Even when prompted,  clients rarely mention particular techniques when asked to reflect on the help ful aspects of psychotherapy. In an analysis of client interviews, for example,  Levitt (2004) found that clients did not focus on ot even recall specific inter ventions. They did attend to the tenot ofthe therapeutic relationship and new  insights they achieved. Instead of procedures, studies have consistently shown  that clients emphasize (a) feeling understood, accepted, and being heard;  (b) having a safe space to explore feelings, thoughts, behaviors, and experi ences; (c) support for dealing with crises; (d) support fot trying out new behav iors; and (e) advice (e.g., Cullari, 2000; Elliott & James, 1989; Kagan, Angus,  & Pos, 2007; Levitt et al., 2006; Rodgers, 2003; Timulak, 2007; Westra, Angus,  & Stala, 2007). Specific activities such as therapist confrontation ofthe client  (Moertl, 2007; Werbart & Johannson, 2007), doing practical exercises (Levitt  et al., 2006; Von Below & Werbart, 2007), and getting tools and strategies from  their therapists (Carey et al., 2007; Timulak, 2007\) are sometimes mentioned,  but they are not emphasized as often as factors such as feeling understood.  

Two additional sources of evidence undermine conventional beliefs  regarding the importance of the therapist's expertise and technique. First,  although therapists have been shown to exert significant effects on success,  the field has struggled to provide any consistent evidence that professional  training, experience, discipline, licensure, or certification impacts outcome  (Beutler et al., 2004; Chtistensen & Jacobson, 1994; Horvath & Bedi, 2002;  Najavits & Strupp, 1994; Wampold, 2006). Second, although considerable  research has supported the contribution of the therapeutic relationship to  improvement, there is evidence that neithet a therapist nor thetapeutic rela tionship ate necessary for change to occur.  

On this score, Norcross (2006) reviewed research on self-help books and  programs, and reported effects as strong as, or almost as strong as, those deliv ered by a therapist. These results have been supported by meta-analyses (Gould  & Clum, 1993; Gregory, Canning, Lee, & Wise, 2004). For instance, Gregory  et al. (2004) found an ES of 0.77 for bibliotherapy and concluded that that  "compares favorably with data from studies of individual psychotherapy"  (p. 277). In one representative study, Jacobs et al. (2001) found that a simple  form of computer-assisted thetapy produced ovetall outcomes equivalent to  those provided by a therapist, although thete was more clinically significant  

CLIENTS: THE NEGLECTED COMMON FACTOR 93   
change in the group of clients who saw therapists. The computer program  prompted clients to think about what they wanted and how to obtain it. Clients  in these studies presented with a wide range of problems, including depression,  anxiety, and substance abuse.  

However, a recent meta-analysis of studies for depression and anxiety  suggested that therapy with professional therapists does better than self-help.  Menchola, Arkowitz, and Burke (2007) found that compared with control  groups, self-help had an ES of 1.0. This is a large ES and comparable with those  

found for psychotherapy in other research reports (e.g., Wampold, 2001). How ever, the ES fot professionally provided psychotherapy compared with self-help  was 0.31. This suggests that therapy does provide something over and above  self-help. It is important to note, though, that although the 0.31 difference  between the self-help and psychotherapy ES was statistically significant, it is  small compared with the large effect of self-help. Furthermore, the 0.31 differ 

ence is less than the difference of 0.4 considered necessary to be of clinical sig nificance (e.g., Elliott, Greenberg, & Lietaer, 2004). Overall, the data support  the conclusion that self-help is as effective or almost as effective as psychother apy for many disorders, again supporting the significant role of the client in  therapeutic change.  

THE CLIENT AS ACTIVE SELF-HEALER: CONCLUSIONS  

Although the research may appear at times to be a potpourri of findings  from unrelated research areas, it is important to recognize that investigating  client factors is not easy and is hampered by largely ex post facto analysis and  nonexperimental designs. Nevertheless, evidence from multiple sources con verges to make a convincing case for client centrality in clinical change, pro viding a parsimonious explanation of why all bona fide approaches to therapy  work about equally well and self-help procedures nearly as well as professional provided therapy.  

In short, it is the client, more so than the therapist or technique, who  makes therapy work. The client's abilities to use whatever is offered surpass any  differences that might exist in techniques ot approaches. Clients use and  tailor what each approach provides to address their problems. Thus, for exam 

ple, a client can use cognitive, interpersonal, or antidepressant therapies  (Elkin, 1994); emotional exploration procedures; or empathically based  client-centered therapy (Greenberg & Watson, 1998\) to move him- or  herself out of depression.  

We have argued (Bohart, 2000; Bohart & Tallman, 1999; Tallman &  Bohart, 1999; cf. also Duncan et al., 2004\) that these findings call for a new  paradigm, one that takes as its central assumption that it is clients who make  

94 BOHART AND TALLMAN   
therapy work. Clients are not submissive recipients of an intervention. They  actively operate on therapists' inputs, transforming bits and pieces of the  process into information and experiences which, in turn, are used to make  change occur. Their effort, involvement, intelligence, and creativity enable  them to accommodate and metabolize different therapeutic approaches and  achieve positive outcomes. In other words, clients are the common factor  across varying forms of psychotherapy. Such a view is not meant to minimize  the importance of therapists. Clearly, clients come to thetapy because they  have not been successful resolving problems with the resources available to  them. Clients need support and, often, some kind of useful structure that they  can use to resolve their problems (see chap. 5, this volume). Instead of tech nical know-how, the therapist helps primarily by supporting, nurturing, or  guiding and structuring the client's self-change efforts. This may include the  suggestion of techniques.  

IMPLICATIONS  

Viewing the client as the common factor has immediate implications  for clinical practice, training, and the field at large.  

Implications for Clinical Practice  

Therapists should enlist and promote client strengths, resources, and personal  agency.  

Perhaps the single largest implication of the view of the client as the  active self-healet is that therapists should rely more heavily on client resources  and strengths. Consider a study by Gassman and Grawe (2006). They con ducted minute-by-minute analyses of 120 sessions involving 30 clients treated  for a range of psychological problems. They found that unsuccessful therapists  focused on problems but neglected client strengths. When the unsuccessful  therapists did focus on clients' strengths, they did so more at the end of a ther apy session. Successful therapists focused on their clients' strengths from the  very start of an appointment. Gassman and Grawe (2006) concluded that suc cessful therapists "created an environment in which the patient felt he was pet ceived as a well functioning person. As soon as this was established, productive  work on the patient's problems was more likely" (p. 10).  

Strength-based approaches are increasingly becoming a part of many psy chotherapies. It has always been a part of some, such as Duncan, Solovey, and  Rusk's (1992) client-directed approach, the solution-focused approach (e.g.,  Berg & Miller, 1992), narrative therapies (e.g., Anderson & Gehart, 2006), and  person-centered therapy (Bohart, 2007). No matter the therapy, recruiting and  

CLIENTS: THE NEGLECTED COMMON FACTOR 95   
promoting client strengths means, at times, tapping into resources and abilities  of which clients may not be aware. Therapists can note and then share such dis coveries with clients. An aspect of this work is finding strength in seemingly  dysfunctional behaviors (Honos-Webb, 2005,2006; Mosher, Hendrix, & Fort,  2004\) and recognizing that clients' identities and innate abilities transcend  descriptions of pathology (Duncan et al., 2004).  

Therapists should believe that clients are motivated and capable of proactive  change.  

There is no such thing as an unmotivated client. His or her motivations  might not match the therapist's, but clients are indeed driven by personal  desires. Understanding and honoring those motivations is ctitical to client centered clinical work. Several authors have suggested that there is even some  underlying sense or positive rationale underlying negative, self-defeating, or  dysfunctional patterns of behavior (Linehan, 1997; Miller & Rollnick, 2002).  This underlying sense or rationale is often implicit. Recognizing that this sense  exists and then helping clients access and unpack the implicit meanings  involved can help them mobilize positive motivation for change. As Cantor  (2003) noted,  

What observers of human behavior often lose sight of are the alternative  routes that different individuals take toward personally fulfilling ends. By  focusing on the process of working on goals, how individuals see their tasks,  what they are trying to do, what kinds of social supports they mobilize in  the process—it is often possible to see meaning and positive purpose in  what may appear to an observer to be at best unnecessary or at worst self 

defeating behavior, (p. 52\)  

Moreover, and in concert with embracing the client's motivations fof  change, therapists should also believe in the client's innate ability to change.  Too many pathology-based prognostications about clients pervade the field.  It would seem that a field dedicated to helping people change would believe  that change is not only possible but probable. Believing in the client's propen 

sities for change seems to follow the data presented in this chapter. Given the  amount of variance accounted for by the client relative to models, allegiance  to this belief is pethaps more important that any commitment to a given  approach.  

Therapists should promote client involvement: Psychotherapy is a collabora tive endeavor.  

As Orlinsky et al.'s (2004) review makes clear, psychotherapy is most  effective when it nurtures and supports maximum client involvement and par ticipation. Therapists facilitate client involvement by providing an atmos phere in which clients can be open, participate, test ideas, and make mistakes.  Bachelor, Laverdiere, Gamache, and Bordeleau (2007) found that the major 

96 BOHART AND TALLMAN   
ity of clients (76%) could be classified as either active or mutual collaborators,  placing the primaty emphasis in treatment on their own efforts or on joint  involvement with the therapist. Thus, therapists are in line with the empiri cal evidence when they listen to clients, establish common ground, and work  together to forge solutions. Although some therapeutic models are more didac 

tic in nature than others, all can be pursued collaboratively.  Therapists should listen to clients and privilege their experience and ideas.  Therapists must listen in a different way to clients. Instead of hearing    
pathology, they must also hear strengths; instead of deficits, they need to listen  to clients' experience; instead of seeing what they know, they must know (i.e.,  be aware of) what they see. Additionally, therapists must show clients that they  not only understand their experience, view ofthe problem, and potential solu 

tions, but that they will also privilege those perspectives. Easier said than done;  therapists can demonstrate theit ptivilege of clients through careful listening,  attending to feedback (see chap. 8, this volume), and being willing to adjust  services to bettet fit clients' sensibilities. This includes identifying what clients  value and incorporating it into how they proceed.  

Listening to clients also entails paying attention to research about what  clients say is important. Fot example, although insight is often maligned as  an insufficient condition for change, clients, the evidence indicates, value  attaining it (Levitt, 2004; Timulak, 2007; Westra et al., 2007). Werbart and  Johansson (2007) found that people in therapy viewed increased self-knowledge  as a positive change. Learning about patterns of behavior has also been shown  to be valued by clients (Moertl, 2007).  

As for emotions, research has found that clients value being able to access,  accept, understand, experience, and express painful feelings (Kagan et al, 2007;  Werbart & Johansson, 2007; Westra et al., 2007), although this may be culture specific to Euro-American cultures. Conversely, clients consider being unable  to "reach" their feelings or having trouble expressing them significant hin drances (Von Below & Werbart, 2007). Other helpful aspects of therapeutic  process reported by clients include the following: taking risks and trying out  new behaviors, sharing with others (Moertl, 2007; Werbart & Johannson,  2007), gaining a sense of empowerment (Timulak, 2007), and developing  new strategies fot attaining goals (Moertl, 2007; Timulak, 2007; Werbart &  Johannson, 2007).  

Regatding helpful therapist behaviors, research yet again points in the  direction of nonspecific factots. Clients have emphasized being understood,  accepted, and actively supported. These findings were corroborated in a study  (conducted and published by Psychology Today) of more than 2,200 clients  (Hatris Interactive, 2004). Using data gathered online and via telephonic sut   
vey, researchers found that clients considered listening skills (63%), peisonal ity (52%), personal connection (45%), and activity level (38%) as the most  

CLIENTS: THE NEGLECTED COMMON FACTOR 97   
essential qualities of a good clinician. Other studies have found that clients'  progress in treatment is hindered when therapists (a) make hurtful remarks;  (b) are authoritarian; (c) do not listen; (d) remain silent, distant, or unrespon sive; (e) refuse to give advice, ideas, or practical exercises; (0 differ significantly  from the client in personality; and (g) are distant and untrustworthy (Conrad  & Auckenthaler, 2007; Von Below & Werbart, 2007). In all, research about  client preferences suggests that clients want a safe space to talk with someone  who will listen and appreciate what they think is important. Is that too much  to ask?  

Implications for Training  

Train therapists to value clients: their strengths, resources, ideas, and propen sity for self-healing.  

Therapists in training should be encouraged to do the following:  

• Begin with the assumption that clients make therapy work—  that clients are both resilient and reasonable, but stuck in a dif ficult situation.  

• Take seriously the client's perspective on the problem and  honor that petspective. Encourage clients to understand that  there are multiply correct points of view. Certainly no one  point of view offeted by approaches to psychotherapy can be  said to be "the" correct one.  

• Expect clients will get better, and believe that therapy works  and that the person sitting across from them will change.  Trainees can gain confidence in knowing this by tracking client  progress via outcome measures and making notes of the new  skills, ideas, goals, and insights clients mention each week.  

• Support the clients' efforts so they can leave thetapy and be  effective problem solvers on their own. Allow clients to origi nate some of the solutions.  

Train therapists to listen; listening is an art.  

Therapists in ttaining should be taught the following:  

• Be effective, supportive listeners instead of being diagnosticians  or interventionists. Diagnosis encourages an external petspec tive on the client as well as a view of the client as broken ot  damaged. The introduction to pathology and diagnosis should  be delayed until the therapist gains skills in relating to clients.  Instruction in the art of dialogue and the study of communica tion should be included before the introduction of models and  

98 BOHART AND TALLMAN   
techniques. Put models and techniques in their place—not dis counting them, but undetstanding their relative importance in  psychotherapeutic change. Use a collaboration metaphot for  therapy rather than the widely accepted advetsarial, often com bative, metaphor. It is not "us" against "them" or even "us"  against the problem or pathology. It is both the therapist and  client in partnetship against the obstacles the client views in his  or her life.  

• Value the power of listening. Beginning therapists should prac tice their listening skills in triads, acting as the therapist, the  client, and the observer. As conversation unfolds and methods  of exploration ate tiled, trainees learn to evaluate any given  position ot technique from multiple points of view. Fiisthand  experience of varied perspectives encourages flexibility and an  ongoing appreciation of diversity of views.  

• Be comfortable with silence. Silence is critical when the client is  thinking effectively, engaging in self-reflection, imagining new  possibilities, and consideiing changes.  

• Include client feedback in their understanding of their listening  and relational skills. It is the client's perceptions that make the  difference: You are not listening until the client says you are.  

Implications for the Field  

Abandon empirically supported treatments: Embrace the American Psycho logical Association's evidence-based practice.  

The evidence-based practice (EBP) movement has become a central  component of health care policy and research over the past decade. In 1995,  Division 12 (Society of Clinical Psychology) within the American Psycholog ical Association (APA) formed the Task Force on the Promotion and Dissem ination of Psychological Procedures, with the stated objective of identifying  treatment approaches for which empirical evidence existed (Chambless &  Hollon, 1998; Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psycholog ical Procedures, 1995). The criteria used by the committee to evaluate exist ing research were based on customary ideas about how psychotherapy works.  Thus, all the approaches designated as empirically validated in the commit tee's otiginal report had been tested in a tandomized clinical tt ial using a treat ment manual and had focused on specific treatments for specific disorders.  

However, if it is the client who ultimately (in collaboration with the ther apist) makes therapy work by how he or she uses the procedures and experiences  offered, then the empirically supported treatments approach is misguided  (Bohart, 2006). The emphasis should be more on helping individual clients use  

CLIENTS: THE NEGLECTED COMMON FACTOR 99   
their own resources to change rather than on applying standardized treatment  packages. There is some movement in this direction.  

In May 2006, the APA Presidential Task Force on EBP published a revised  definition of EBP in psychology. Recognizing that the report ofthe prior Task  Force had been used by various government and commercial entities to mandate  the use ofthe approaches labeled as empirically supported, the committee moved  beyond a simplistic "specific treatments for specific disorders" paradigm, to defin 

ing EBP as "the integration ofthe best available research with clinical expertise  in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences" (p. 273). The  role of clients as an important factor in clinical decision making was recognized.  This definition merits celebration, acknowledging as it does the central role  that clients play in the execution, efficacy, and evaluation of psychotherapy.  EBP is not synonymous with a list of empirically supported treatments  (Norcross, Levant, & Beutler, 2006), although under the APA Task Force state 

ment, empirically supported treatments are to be included as one thing for the  clinician to consider. However, in addition, other empirically sound methods  exist fot ensuting that practice is informed by the best evidence (Bohart &  Tallman, 1999; Duncan et al., 2004; Hubble et al., 1999; Orlinsky et al., 2004).  

Renew interest in person-centered care.  

The data reviewed in this chapter, and elsewhere in this volume, provide  strong support for a person-centered orientation to clinical practice. Currently  popular in medicine, this way of working calls for a collaborative, patient involved model ofservice delivery. It is an approach in which listening to the  patients' stoties becomes an integral part of what physicians do (Charon, 2006;  Tallman, Janisse, Frankel, Sung, Krupat, & Hsu, 2007).  

In mental health care, clients not only desire but also demand that treat ment be more person centered. Variously called survivors or consumers, people,  particularly those who have at some time been diagnosed with schizophrenia  or bipolar disorder, want to take an active role in directing services they receive.  In several states, members of the recovery movement or their advocates sit on  various mental health commissions and have a major say in policy. Cohen  (2005) pointed out those groups often explicitly reject the traditional medical  view of emotional suffering and treatment, choosing instead to embrace a par 

adigm that emphasizes client resources and community activism. An emphasis  on creating or using real-life support networks and opportunities both in work  and in relationships is also seen. Briefly, Cohen's study of 36 survivors, most  diagnosed with schizophrenia, showed that the majority cited self-help, support  of family and friends, social activism, exercise, as well as one-on-one psy 

chotherapy as the most common and helpful methods for facilitating recov ety. Only 25% reported the use of drugs as helpful. It is unfortunate that the  one movement that explicitly recognizes clients as active, empowered agents  

100 BOHART AND TALLMAN   
in their own right has been met with mixed feelings by the mental health  establishment.    
The person-centered orientation also dovetails with the field's increasing  awareness regarding cultural diversity. As APA's revised definition of EBP indi cates, therapy needs to be informed by the client's culture and personal prefer ences. Obviously, solutions developed collaboratively, in the context of clients'  cultural experiences, are likely to be more meaningful to the individual, hence  successful. Here again, utilization and mobilization of client resources trump the  application of a specific technique to a specific problem. Finally, the person centered perspective fits perfectly with the current Zeitgeist (see chap. 8, this  volume) toward client-based outcome feedback and the privileging of the  client's voice achieved by routine assessment and use ofthe client's perceptions  ofthe benefit of services. Using client feedback to tailor mental health services  finally makes clients true partners in the therapeutic endeavor.  

Changing the goveming paradigm by taking seriously the active, gen erative nature of clients leads to fundamental changes in how the process of  therapy is viewed and conducted. This process at once becomes collaborative  in theory and practice, not merely collaborative in the sense that the client  complies with and participates in a predetermined treatment plan. From such  a vantage point, each person in the process is an expert in his or her own  right. Togethet, practitioners, researchers, and clients combine their efforts  to ensure that the client is no longer the most neglected common factor in  psychotherapy.  

QUESTIONS FROM THE EDITORS  

1\. What has been the most important finding about the client's role in psycho therapy since the first edition? What research needs to be conducted to establish  further the client's pivotal role?  

We would say that the most important finding is that the client is impor tant. In recent years there has been a significant increase in studies on the  client's role in therapy. Writers are now mentioning clients as a critical factor  in how therapy works. As mentioned previously, the recent APA Task Force  on EBP included the client as one of the three major factors to be taken into  account in deciding how best to proceed in therapy.  

In terms of research, there really is not one particular finding but rather  a convergence of results. Findings continue to accumulate showing that clients  are active interpreters of the therapy environment and that the nature of the  outcomes clients achieve depend in part on their active (and creative) inte 

gration of what therapy has to offer with their own plans, goals, and agendas.  CLIENTS: THE NEGLECTED COMMON FACTOR 101   
Research has also found that focusing on clients' strengths and resources is  important to make therapy work across different approaches.  Conceming future research, there has been almost no work done on  client expertise, although therapists of many different persuasions pay lip  service to the idea that the client is the expert on his or her own life. That  clients apply such expertise to help solve their own problems in therapy is a  major thesis of this chapter. Yet, there is virtually no research on this subject.  Much more also needs to be done to learn how clients actively engage in the  therapeutic process on a session by session basis and how they integrate what  they experience into their lives outside therapy. More research needs to be  done to identify why some clients benefit from care whereas others do not.  What are the causes from the client's point of view? Is it really due to a deficit  in the client? Or is it possible that there is a mismatch between the therapy  provided and the client? Or, finally, is it that the therapy does not sufficiently  address itself to client concerns and perspectives in such a way as to best  involve them? Perhaps the recent efforts, highlighted in this volume, to inte grate client feedback and tailor services to client preferences will shed more  light on the issue.  

2\. How do you reconcile evidence suggesting that certain clients do less well in  therapy (e.g., clients rated as more functionally impaired, diagnosed with personality  disorders, and assessed as having relationship problems from childhood) with other data  showing that client ratings of distress are better predictors of change than diagnosis or  client functional impairment?  

These findings on distress suggest that the most important factot in how  well therapy works is, once again, client involvement and participation. Pre sumably, more highly distressed clients are more motivated to participate.  That this dwarfs diagnosis, functional impairment, and so forth is significant.  It suggests that the motivated participation ofthe client is the most important  factor.  

The data suggesting that clients who are more functionally impaired do  less well in therapy are part of a largei picture that shows that different clients  have different healing trajectories in therapy. The traditional interpretation is  to blame the client: It is his or her psychological impairment that impedes ther apy. An alternative possibility is that the typical therapy environment, typical  therapy behavior, and typical therapy solutions do not work equally well in  mobilizing the self-healing capacities of all clients. The traditional model of  therapy—in which the expert therapist is the one who decides what the client's  problem is, diagnoses it, and then chooses and prescribes the treatment—may  get in the way of listening to the client to find out what works best for him or  her. This may be particularly important with clients who might not adapt well  to the traditional therapy environment. Ot, the failed therapy itself creates the  noted impairment: Client dysfunction is an iatrogenic effect of ineffective ther 

102 BOHART AND TALLMAN   
apy. In an interesting project, Duncan, Hubble, and Miller (1997) deliberately  tried to work with clients other therapists had found intractable. By working in  a more collaborative way with these clients than they had been worked with in  the past, these clients were able to be successful. More research to understand  how clients approach and work with what is offered in therapy is needed before  we conclude that their relative lack of success is due to their defects.  

3\. You talk about the client as active self-healer. We (the editors) have talked  about "heroic clients." Is it possible that such talk could stigmatize individuals who  do not self-right in everyday life and instead need psychotherapy and individuals who  do not get better in therapy?  

Fitst, one must keep in mind that the literature on resilience shows that  not everyone is equally resilient. Resilience is a complex product of individual  peisonality factors interacting with life historical events and the facilitating ot  nonfacilitating aspects of one's cuirent environment. Although 40% to 60%  of individuals who experience traumatic events show signs of posttraumatic  growth, conveisely, 40% to 60%—a substantial number—do not.  

Therefore, there is nothing unusual about needing help to self-right.  Indeed, even those who exhibit resilience or posttraumatic growth have usu ally had the aid of other people, perhaps a mentor, teacher, or supportive fam ily member. We believe the evidence supports humans' considerable potential  to self-right. They may need a therapist to help them mobilize it. The evidence  regarding the importance of listening to clients as proactive agents and find ing ways to mobilize client's generative capacities is compelling. Unfortu nately, we have both experienced too many cases of therapists who "know  what's best for you" and impose their view on clients, which often implies that  the client is damaged in some way and not capable of self-healing. The case of  Molly, presented in Duncan et al. (1997), is a classic example of how thera pists repeatedly imposed their perspectives on the client and ignored her voice.  When a therapist finally listened, Molly was able to figure out a solution for  herself. Why she had not done that in everyday life is another question, but it  shows that clients have this potential, and it is not uncommon for them to  need the aid of a professional to mobilize it.  

Therapy offers at least two things people may not have in their everyday  lives. First, it offers a supportive interpersonal relationship in which one can  think together with another human being. A supportive other can help mobi lize hope and renewed effort. In everyday life, many people do not have the  kind of relationship that would help them work through their difficulties. Sec ondly, it provides a good workspace. Clients in everyday life may not have the  time, place, or emotionally safe space to focus productively on their problems.  

Although we believe it is ultimately clients' own generative capacities  that lead them to productively use whatever they experience in therapy, it does  not mean those who do not improve should be blamed. As we have previously  

CLIENTS: THE NEGLECTED COMMON FACTOR 103   
stated, it could be that the therapy did not mobilize theii self-healing capaci ties. Additionally, oui therapy models underestimate the importance of clients'  ecological circumstances. Therapy models focus on fixing factors inside clients,  which presumably allows them to successfully cope with their life spaces. How ever, the therapist is never just working with the client but with their life cir cumstances, as well. Robert Elliott's (2002) work with his hermeneutic single  case efficacy design for studying psychotherapy outcome has shown how com plex change is and how much it is influenced by clients' circumstances. With out stigmatizing clients, therapists need to understand how circumstances both  inside and outside of therapy may be making it difficult for clients to achieve  positive outcomes in therapy.
