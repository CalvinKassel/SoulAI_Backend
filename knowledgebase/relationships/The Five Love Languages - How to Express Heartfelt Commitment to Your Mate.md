[ACKNOWLEDGMENTS]{.bold}

Love begins, or should begin, at home. For me that means Sam and Grace,
Dad and Mom, who have loved me for more than fifty years. Without them I
would still be seeking love instead of writing about it. Home also means
Karolyn, to whom I have been married for more than forty years. If all
wives loved as she does, fewer men would be looking over the fence.
Shelley and Derek are now out of the nest, exploring new worlds, but I
feel secure in the warmth of their love. I am blessed and grateful.

I am indebted to a host of professionals who have influenced my concepts
of love. Among them are psychiatrists Ross Campbell, Judson Swihart, and
Scott Peck. For editorial assistance, I am indebted to Debbie Barr and
Cathy Peterson. The technical expertise of Tricia Kube and Don Schmidt
made it possible to meet publication deadlines. Last, and most
important, I want to express my gratitude to the hundreds of couples
who, over the past thirty years, have shared the intimate side of their
lives with me. This book is a tribute to their honesty.

[[[A]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}t 30,000 feet, somewhere between
Buffalo and Dallas, he put his magazine in his seat pocket, turned in my
direction, and asked, "What kind of work do you do?"

"I do marriage counseling and lead marriage enrichment seminars," I said
matter-of-factly.

"I've been wanting to ask someone this for a long time," he said. "What
happens to the love after you get married?"

Relinquishing my hopes of getting a nap, I asked, "What do you mean?"

"Well," he said, "I've been married three times, and each time, it was
wonderful before we got married, but somehow after the wedding it all
fell apart. All the love I thought I had for her and the love she seemed
to have for me evaporated. I am a fairly intelligent person. I operate a
successful business, but I don't understand it."

"How long were you married?" I asked.

"The first one lasted about ten years. The second time, we were married
three years, and the last one, almost six years."

"Did your love evaporate immediately after the wedding, or was it a
gradual loss?" I inquired.

"Well, the second one went wrong from the very beginning. I don't know
what happened. I really thought we loved each other, but the honeymoon
was a disaster, and we never recovered. We only dated six months. It was
a whirlwind romance. It was really exciting! But after the marriage, it
was a battle from the beginning.

"In my first marriage, we had three or four good years before the baby
came. After the baby was born, I felt like she gave her attention to the
baby and I no longer mattered. It was as if her one goal in life was to
have a baby, and after the baby, she no longer needed me."

"Did you tell her that?" I asked.

"Oh, yes, I told her. She said I was crazy. She said I did not
understand the stress of being a twenty-four-hour nurse. She said I
should be more understanding and help her more. I really tried, but it
didn't seem to make any difference. After that, we just grew further
apart. After a while, there was no love left, just deadness. Both of us
agreed that the marriage was over.

"My last marriage? I really thought that one would be different. I had
been divorced for three years. We dated each other for two years. I
really thought we knew what we were doing, and I thought that perhaps
for the first time I really knew what it meant to love someone. I
genuinely felt that she loved me.

"After the wedding, I don't think I changed. I continued to express love
to her as I had before marriage. I told her how beautiful she was. I
told her how much I loved her. I told her how proud I was to be her
husband. But a few months after marriage, she started complaining; about
petty things at first---like my not taking the garbage out or not
hanging up my clothes. Later, she went to attacking my character,
telling me she didn't feel she could trust me, accusing me of not being
faithful to her. She became a totally negative person. Before marriage,
she was never negative. She was one of the most positive people I have
ever met. That is one of the things that attracted me to her. She never
complained about anything. Everything I did was wonderful, but once we
were married, it seemed I could do nothing right. I honestly don't know
what happened. Eventually, I lost my love for her and began to resent
her. She obviously had no love for me. We agreed there was no benefit to
our living together any longer, so we split.

"That was a year ago. So my question is, What happens to love after the
wedding? Is my experience common? Is that why we have so many divorces
in our country? I can't believe that it happened to me three times. And
those who don't divorce, do they learn to live with the emptiness, or
does love really stay alive in some marriages? If so, how?"

\

[[[T]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}he questions my friend seated in 5A
was asking are the questions that thousands of married and divorced
persons are asking today. Some are asking friends, some are asking
counselors and clergy, and some are asking themselves. Sometimes the
answers are couched in psychological research jargon that is almost
incomprehensible. Sometimes they are couched in humor and folklore. Most
of the jokes and pithy sayings contain some truth, but they are like
offering an aspirin to a person with cancer.

The desire for romantic love in marriage is deeply rooted in our
psychological makeup. Almost every popular magazine has at least one
article each issue on keeping love alive in a marriage. Books abound on
the subject. Television and radio talk shows deal with it. Keeping love
alive in our marriages is serious business.

With all the books, magazines, and practical help available, why is it
that so few couples seem to have found the secret to keeping love alive
after the wedding? Why is it that a couple can attend a communication
workshop, hear wonderful ideas on how to enhance communication, return
home, and find themselves totally unable to implement the communication
patterns demonstrated? How is it that we read a magazine article on "101
Ways to Express Love to Your Spouse," select two or three ways that seem
especially good to us, try them, and our spouse doesn't even acknowledge
our effort? We give up on the other 98 ways and go back to life as
usual.

[We must be willing to learn our spouse's primary love language if we
are to be effective communicators of love.]{.italic}

[[[T]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}he answer to those questions is the
purpose of this book. It is not that the books and articles already
published are not helpful. The problem is that we have overlooked one
fundamental truth: People speak different love languages.

In the area of linguistics, there are major language groups: Japanese,
Chinese, Spanish, English, Portuguese, Greek, German, French, and so on.
Most of us grow up learning the language of our parents and siblings,
which becomes our primary or native tongue. Later, we may learn
additional languages but usually with much more effort. These become our
secondary languages. We speak and understand best our native language.
We feel most comfortable speaking that language. The more we use a
secondary language, the more comfortable we become conversing in it. If
we speak only our primary language and encounter someone else who speaks
only his or her primary language, which is different from ours, our
communication will be limited. We must rely on pointing, grunting,
drawing pictures, or acting out our ideas. We can communicate, but it is
awkward. Language differences are part and parcel of human culture. If
we are to communicate effectively across cultural lines, we must learn
the language of those with whom we wish to communicate.

In the area of love, it is similar. Your emotional love language and the
language of your spouse may be as different as Chinese from English. No
matter how hard you try to express love in English, if your spouse
understands only Chinese, you will never understand how to love each
other. My friend on the plane was speaking the language of "Affirming
Words" to his third wife when he said, "I told her how beautiful she
was. I told her I loved her. I told her how proud I was to be her
husband." He was speaking love, and he was sincere, but she did not
understand his language. Perhaps she was looking for love in his
behavior and didn't see it. Being sincere is not enough. We must be
willing to learn our spouse's primary love language if we are to be
effective communicators of love.

\

[[[M]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}y conclusion after thirty years of
marriage counseling is that there are basically five emotional love
languages---five ways that people speak and understand emotional love.
In the field of linguistics a language may have numerous dialects or
variations. Similarly, within the five basic emotional love languages,
there are many dialects. That accounts for the magazine articles titled
"10 Ways to Let Your Spouse Know You Love Her," "20 Ways to Keep Your
Man at Home," or "365 Expressions of Marital Love." There are not 10,
20, or 365 basic love languages. In my opinion, there are only five.
However, there may be numerous dialects. The number of ways to express
love within a love language is limited only by one's imagination. The
important thing is to speak the love language of your spouse.

We have long known that in early childhood development each child
develops unique emotional patterns. Some children, for example, develop
a pattern of low self-esteem whereas others have healthy self-esteem.
Some develop emotional patterns of insecurity whereas others grow up
feeling secure. Some children grow up feeling loved, wanted, and
appreciated, yet others grow up feeling unloved, unwanted, and
unappreciated.

The children who feel loved by their parents and peers will develop a
primary emotional love language based on their unique psychological
makeup and the way their parents and other significant persons expressed
love to them. They will speak and understand one primary love language.
They may later learn a secondary love language, but they will always
feel most comfortable with their primary language. Children who do not
feel loved by their parents and peers will also develop a primary love
language. However, it will be somewhat distorted in much the same way as
some children may learn poor grammar and have an underdeveloped
vocabulary. That poor programming does not mean they cannot become good
communicators. But it does mean they will have to work at it more
diligently than those who had a more positive model. Likewise, children
who grow up with an underdeveloped sense of emotional love can also come
to feel loved and to communicate love, but they will have to work at it
more diligently than those who grew up in a healthy, loving atmosphere.

Seldom do a husband and wife have the same primary emotional love
language. We tend to speak our primary love language, and we become
confused when our spouse does not understand what we are communicating.
We are expressing our love, but the message does not come through
because we are speaking what, to them, is a foreign language. Therein
lies the fundamental problem, and it is the purpose of this book to
offer a solution. That is why I dare to write another book on love. Once
we discover the five basic love languages and understand our own primary
love language, as well as the primary love language of our spouse, we
will then have the needed information to apply the ideas in the books
and articles.

\

[[[O]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}nce you identify and learn to speak
your spouse's primary love language, I believe that you will have
discovered the key to a long-lasting, loving marriage. Love need not
evaporate after the wedding, but in order to keep it alive most of us
will have to put forth the effort to learn a secondary love language. We
cannot rely on our native tongue if our spouse does not understand it.
If we want him/her to feel the love we are trying to communicate, we
must express it in his or her primary love language.

[[[L]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ove is the most important word in the
English language---and the most confusing. Both secular and religious
thinkers agree that love plays a central role in life. We are told that
"love is a many-splendored thing" and that "love makes the world go
round." Thousands of books, songs, magazines, and movies are peppered
with the word. Numerous philosophical and theological systems have made
a prominent place for love. And the founder of the Christian faith
wanted love to be the distinguishing characteristic of His followers.^1^

Psychologists have concluded that the need to feel loved is a primary
human emotional need. For love, we will climb mountains, cross seas,
traverse desert sands, and endure untold hardships. Without love,
mountains become unclimbable, seas uncrossable, deserts unbearable, and
hardships our plight in life. The Christian apostle to the Gentiles,
Paul, exalted love when he indicated that all human accomplishments that
are not motivated by love are, in the end, empty. He concluded that in
the last scene of the human drama, only three characters will remain:
"faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."^2^

If we can agree that the word [love]{.italic} permeates human society,
both historically and in the present, we must also agree that it is a
most confusing word. We use it in a thousand ways. We say, "I love hot
dogs," and in the next breath, "I love my mother." We speak of loving
activities: swimming, skiing, hunting. We love objects: food, cars,
houses. We love animals: dogs, cats, even pet snails. We love nature:
trees, grass, flowers, and weather. We love people: mother, father, son,
daughter, parents, wives, husbands, friends. We even fall in love with
love.

If all that is not confusing enough, we also use the word love to
explain behavior. "I did it because I love her." That explanation is
given for all kinds of actions. A man is involved in an adulterous
relationship, and he calls it love. The preacher, on the other hand,
calls it sin. The wife of an alcoholic picks up the pieces after her
husband's latest episode. She calls it love, but the psychologist calls
it codependency. The parent indulges all the child's wishes, calling it
love. The family therapist would call it irresponsible parenting. What
is loving behavior?

\

[[[T]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}he purpose of this book is not to
eliminate all confusion surrounding the word love, but to focus on that
kind of love that is essential to our emotional health. Child
psychologists affirm that every child has certain basic emotional needs
that must be met if he is to be emotionally stable. Among those
emotional needs, none is more basic than the need for love and
affection, the need to sense that he or she belongs and is wanted. With
an adequate supply of affection, the child will likely develop into a
responsible adult. Without that love, he or she will be emotionally and
socially retarded.

I liked the metaphor the first time I heard it: "Inside every child is
an 'emotional tank' waiting to be filled with love. When a child really
feels loved, he will develop normally but when the love tank is empty,
the child will misbehave. Much of the misbehavior of children is
motivated by the cravings of an empty 'love tank.'" I was listening to
Dr. Ross Campbell, a psychiatrist who specializes in the treatment of
children and adolescents.

As I listened, I thought of the hundreds of parents who had paraded the
misdeeds of their children through my office. I had never visualized an
empty love tank inside those children, but I had certainly seen the
results of it. Their misbehavior was a misguided search for the love
they did not feel. They were seeking love in all the wrong places and in
all the wrong ways.

I remember Ashley, who at thirteen years of age was being treated for a
sexually transmitted disease. Her parents were crushed. They were angry
with Ashley. They were upset with the school, which they blamed for
teaching her about sex. "Why would she do this?" they asked.

[At the heart of mankind's existence is the desire to be intimate and to
be loved by another. Marriage is designed to meet that need for intimacy
and love.]{.italic}

In my conversation with Ashley, she told me of her parents' divorce when
she was six years old. "I thought my father left because he didn't love
me," she said. "When my mother remarried when I was ten, I felt she now
had someone to love her, but I still had no one to love me. I wanted so
much to be loved. I met this boy at school. He was older than me, but he
liked me. I couldn't believe it. He was kind to me, and in a while I
really felt he loved me. I didn't want to have sex, but I wanted to be
loved."

Ashley's "love tank" had been empty for many years. Her mother and
stepfather had provided for her physical needs but had not realized the
deep emotional struggle raging inside her. They certainly loved Ashley,
and they thought that she felt their love. Not until it was almost too
late did they discover that they were not speaking Ashley's primary love
language.

\

[[[T]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}he emotional need for love, however,
is not simply a childhood phenomenon. That need follows us into
adulthood and into marriage. The "in love" experience temporarily meets
that need, but it is inevitably a "quick fix" and, as we shall learn
later, has a limited and predictable life span. After we come down from
the high of the "in love" obsession, the emotional need for love
resurfaces because it is fundamental to our nature. It is at the center
of our emotional desires. We needed love before we "fell in love," and
we will need it as long as we live.

The need to feel loved by one's spouse is at the heart of marital
desires. A man said to me recently, "What good is the house, the cars,
the place at the beach, or any of the rest of it if your wife doesn't
love you?" Do you understand what he was really saying? "More than
anything, I want to be loved by my wife." Material things are no
replacement for human, emotional love. A wife says, "He ignores me all
day long and then wants to jump in bed with me. I hate it." She is not a
wife who hates sex; she is a wife desperately pleading for emotional
love.

Something in our nature cries out to be loved by another. Isolation is
devastating to the human psyche. That is why solitary confinement is
considered the cruelest of punishments. At the heart of mankind's
existence is the desire to be intimate and to be loved by another.
Marriage is designed to meet that need for intimacy and love. That is
why the ancient biblical writings spoke of the husband and wife becoming
"one flesh." That did not mean that individuals would lose their
identity; it meant that they would enter into each other's lives in a
deep and intimate way. The New Testament writers challenged both the
husband and the wife to love each other. From Plato to Peck, writers
have emphasized the importance of love in marriage.

But, if love is important, it is also elusive. I have listened to many
married couples share their secret pain. Some came to me because the
inner ache had become unbearable. Others came because they realized that
their behavior patterns or the misbehavior of their spouse was
destroying the marriage. Some came simply to inform me that they no
longer wanted to be married. Their dreams of "living happily ever after"
had been dashed against the hard walls of reality. Again and again I
have heard the words "Our love is gone, our relationship is dead. We
used to feel close, but not now. We no longer enjoy being with each
other. We don't meet each other's needs." Their stories bear testimony
that adults as well as children have "love tanks."

Could it be that deep inside hurting couples exists an invisible
"emotional love tank" with its gauge on empty? Could the misbehavior,
withdrawal, harsh words, and critical spirit occur because of that empty
tank? If we could find a way to fill it, could the marriage be reborn?
With a full tank would couples be able to create an emotional climate
where it is possible to discuss differences and resolve conflicts? Could
that tank be the key that makes marriage work?

\

[[[T]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}hose questions sent me on a long
journey. Along the way, I discovered the simple yet powerful insights
contained in this book. The journey has taken me not only through thirty
years of marriage counseling but into the hearts and minds of hundreds
of couples throughout America. From Seattle to Miami, couples have
invited me into the inner chamber of their marriages, and we have talked
openly. The illustrations included in this book are cut from the fabric
of real life. Only names and places are changed to protect the privacy
of the individuals who have spoken so freely.

I am convinced that keeping the emotional love tank full is as important
to a marriage as maintaining the proper oil level is to an automobile.
Running your marriage on an empty "love tank" may cost you even more
than trying to drive your car without oil. What you are about to read
has the potential of saving thousands of marriages and can even enhance
the emotional climate of a good marriage. Whatever the quality of your
marriage now, it can always be better.

WARNING: Understanding the five love languages and learning to speak the
primary love language of your spouse may radically affect his or her
behavior. People behave differently when their emotional love tanks are
full.

\

[[[B]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}efore we examine the five love
languages, however, we must address one other important but confusing
phenomenon: the euphoric experience of "falling in love."

appointment and asked my secretary if she could see me for five minutes.
I had known Janice for eighteen years. She was thirty-six and had never
married. She had dated several men through the years, one for six years,
another for three years, and several others for shorter periods of time.
From time to time, she had made appointments with me to discuss a
particular difficulty in one of her relationships. She was by nature a
disciplined, conscientious, organized, thoughtful, and caring person. It
was completely out of character for her to show up at my office
unannounced. I thought, [There must be some terrible crisis for Janice
to show up without an appointment.]{.italic} I told my secretary to show
her in, and I fully expected to see her burst into tears and tell me
some tragic story as soon as the door was closed. Instead, she virtually
skipped into my office, beaming with excitement.

"How are you today, Janice?" I asked.

"Great!" she said. "I've never been better in my life. I'm getting
married!"

"You are?" I said, revealing my shock. "To whom and when?"

"To David Gallespie," she exclaimed, "in September."

"That's exciting. How long have you been dating?"

"Three weeks. I know it's crazy, Dr. Chapman, after all the people I
have dated and the number of times I came so close to getting married. I
can't believe it myself, but I know David is the one for me. From the
first date, we both knew it. Of course, we didn't talk about it on the
first night, but one week later, he asked me to marry him. I knew he was
going to ask me, and I knew I was going to say yes. I have never felt
this way before, Dr. Chapman. You know about the relationships that I
have had through the years and the struggles I have had. In every
relationship, something was not right. I never felt at peace about
marrying any of them, but I know that David is the right one."

By this time, Janice was rocking back and forth in her chair, giggling
and saying, "I know it's crazy, but I am so happy. I have never been
this happy in my life."

What has happened to Janice? She has fallen in love. In her mind, David
is the most wonderful man she has ever met. He is perfect in every way.
He will make the ideal husband. She thinks about him day and night. The
facts that David has been married twice before, has three children, and
has had three jobs in the past year are trivial to Janice. She's happy,
and she is convinced that she is going to be happy forever with David.
She is in love.

\

[[[M]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ost of us enter marriage by way of the
"in love" experience. We meet someone whose physical characteristics and
personality traits create enough electrical shock to trigger our "love
alert" system. The bells go off, and we set in motion the process of
getting to know the person. The first step may be sharing a hamburger or
steak, depending on our budget, but our real interest is not in the
food. We are on a quest to discover [love.]{.italic} "Could this warm,
tingly feeling I have inside be the 'real' thing?"

Sometimes we lose the tingles on the first date. We find out that she
dips snuff, and the tingles run right out our toes; we want no more
hamburgers with her. Other times, however, the tingles are stronger
after the hamburger than before. We arrange for a few more "together"
experiences, and before long the level of intensity has increased to the
point where we find ourselves saying, "I think I'm falling in love."
Eventually we are convinced that it is the "real thing," and we tell the
other person, hoping the feeling is reciprocal. If it isn't, things cool
off a bit or we redouble our efforts to impress, and eventually win the
love of, our beloved. When it is reciprocal, we start talking about
marriage because everyone agrees that being "in love" is the necessary
foundation for a good marriage.

[Our dreams before marriage are of marital bliss.... It's hard to
believe anything else when you are in love.]{.italic}

At its peak, the "in love" experience is euphoric. We are emotionally
obsessed with each other. We go to sleep thinking of one another. When
we rise that person is the first thought on our minds. We long to be
together. Spending time together is like playing in the anteroom of
heaven. When we hold hands, it seems as if our blood flows together. We
could kiss forever if we didn't have to go to school or work. Embracing
stimulates dreams of marriage and ecstasy.

The person who is "in love" has the illusion that his beloved is
perfect. His mother can see the flaws but he can't. His mother says,
"Darling, have you considered she has been under psychiatric care for
five years?" But he replies, "Oh, Mother, give me a break. She's been
out for three months now." His friends also can see the flaws but are
not likely to tell him unless he asks, and chances are he won't because
in his mind she is perfect and what others think doesn't matter.

Our dreams before marriage are of marital bliss: "We are going to make
each other supremely happy. Other couples may argue and fight, but not
us. We love each other." Of course, we are not totally naive. We know
intellectually that we will eventually have differences. But we are
certain that we will discuss those differences openly; one of us will
always be willing to make concessions, and we will reach agreement. It's
hard to believe anything else when you are in love.

We have been led to believe that if we are really in love, it will last
forever. We will always have the wonderful feelings that we have at this
moment. Nothing could ever come between us. Nothing will ever overcome
our love for each other. We are enamored and caught up in the beauty and
charm of the other's personality. Our love is the most wonderful thing
we have ever experienced. We observe that some married couples seem to
have lost that feeling, but it will never happen to us. "Maybe they did
not have the real thing," we reason.

\

[[[U]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}nfortunately, the eternality of the
"in love" experience is fiction, not fact. Dr. Dorothy Tennov, a
psychologist, has done long-range studies on the in-love phenomenon.
After studying scores of couples, she concluded that the average life
span of a romantic obsession is two years. If it is a secretive love
affair, it may last a little longer. Eventually, however, we all descend
from the clouds and plant our feet on earth again. Our eyes are opened,
and we see the warts of the other person. We recognize that some of
his/her personality traits are actually irritating. Her behavior
patterns are annoying. He has the capacity for hurt and anger, perhaps
even harsh words and critical judgments. Those little traits that we
overlooked when we were in love now become huge mountains. We remember
Mother's words and ask ourselves, [How could I have been so
foolish?]{.italic}

Welcome to the real world of marriage, where hairs are always on the
sink and little white spots cover the mirror, where arguments center on
which way the toilet paper comes off and whether the lid should be up or
down. It is a world where shoes do not walk to the closet and drawers do
not close themselves, where coats do not like hangers and socks go AWOL
during laundry. In this world, a look can hurt and a word can crush.
Intimate lovers can become enemies, and marriage a battlefield.

What happened to the "in love" experience? Alas, it was but an illusion
by which we were tricked into signing our names on the dotted line, for
better or for worse. No wonder so many have come to curse marriage and
the partner whom they once loved. After all, if we were deceived, we
have a right to be angry. Did we really have the "real" thing? I think
so. The problem was faulty information.

The bad information was the idea that the "in love" obsession would last
forever. We should have known better. A casual observation should have
taught us that if people remained obsessed, we would all be in serious
trouble. The shock waves would rumble through business, industry,
church, education, and the rest of society. Why? Because people who are
"in love" lose interest in other pursuits. That is why we call it
"obsession." The college student who falls head over heels in love sees
his grades tumbling. It is difficult to study when you are in love.
Tomorrow you have a test on the War of 1812, but who cares about the War
of 1812? When you're in love, everything else seems irrelevant. A man
said to me, "Dr. Chapman, my job is disintegrating."

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"I met this girl, fell in love, and I can't get a thing done. I can't
keep my mind on my job. I spend my day dreaming about her."

The euphoria of the "in love" state gives us the illusion that we have
an intimate relationship. We feel that we belong to each other. We
believe we can conquer all problems. We feel altruistic toward each
other. As one young man said about his fiancée, "I can't conceive of
doing anything to hurt her. My only desire is to make her happy. I would
do anything to make her happy." Such obsession gives us the false sense
that our egocentric attitudes have been eradicated and we have become
sort of a Mother Teresa, willing to give anything for the benefit of our
lover. The reason we can do that so freely is that we sincerely believe
that our lover feels the same way toward us. We believe that she is
committed to meeting our needs, that he loves us as much as we love him
and would never do anything to hurt us.

That thinking is always fanciful. Not that we are insincere in what we
think and feel, but we are unrealistic. We fail to reckon with the
reality of human nature. By nature, we are egocentric. Our world
revolves around us. None of us is totally altruistic. The euphoria of
the "in love" experience only gives us that illusion.

Once the experience of falling in love has run its natural course
(remember, the average in-love experience lasts two years), we will
return to the world of reality and begin to assert ourselves. He will
express his desires, but his desires will be different from hers. He
desires sex, but she is too tired. He wants to buy a new car, but she
says, "That's absurd!" She wants to visit her parents, but he says, "I
don't like spending so much time with your family." He wants to play in
the softball tournament, and she says, "You love softball more than you
love me." Little by little, the illusion of intimacy evaporates, and the
individual desires, emotions, thoughts, and behavior patterns exert
themselves. They are two individuals. Their minds have not melded
together, and their emotions mingled only briefly in the ocean of love.
Now the waves of reality begin to separate them. They fall out of love,
and at that point either they withdraw, separate, divorce, and set off
in search of a new in-love experience, or they begin the hard work of
learning to love each other without the euphoria of the in-love
obsession.

[The in-love experience does not focus on our own growth nor on the
growth and development of the other person. Rather, it gives us the
sense that we have arrived.]{.italic}

Some researchers, among them psychiatrist M. Scott Peck and psychologist
Dorothy Tennov, have concluded that the in-love experience should not be
called "love" at all. Dr. Tennov coined the word [limerance]{.italic}
for the in-love experience in order to distinguish that experience from
what she considers real love. Dr. Peck concludes that the
falling-in-love experience is not real love for three reasons. First,
falling in love is not an act of the will or a conscious choice. No
matter how much we may want to fall in love, we cannot make it happen.
On the other hand, we may not be seeking the experience when it
overtakes us. Often, we fall in love at inopportune times and with
unlikely people.

Second, falling in love is not real love because it is effortless.
Whatever we do in the in-love state requires little discipline or
conscious effort on our part. The long, expensive phone calls we make to
each other, the money we spend traveling to see each other, the gifts we
give, the work projects we do are as nothing to us. As the instinctual
nature of the bird dictates the building of a nest, so the instinctual
nature of the in-love experience pushes us to do outlandish and
unnatural things for each other.

Third, one who is "in love" is not genuinely interested in fostering the
personal growth of the other person. "If we have any purpose in mind
when we fall in love it is to terminate our own loneliness and perhaps
ensure this result through marriage."^1^ The in-love experience does not
focus on our own growth nor on the growth and development of the other
person. Rather, it gives us the sense that we have arrived and that we
do not need further growth. We are at the apex of life's happiness, and
our only desire is to stay there. Certainly our beloved does not need to
grow because she is perfect. We simply hope she will remain perfect.

\

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}f falling in love is not real love,
what is it? Dr. Peck concludes that it "is a genetically determined
instinctual component of mating behavior. In other words, the temporary
collapse of ego boundaries that constitutes falling in love is a
stereotypic response of human beings to a configuration of internal
sexual drives and external sexual stimuli, which serves to increase the
probability of sexual pairing and bonding so as to enhance the survival
of the species."^2^

Whether or not we agree with that conclusion, those of us who have
fallen in love and out of love will likely agree that the experience
does catapult us into emotional orbit unlike anything else we have
experienced. It tends to disengage our reasoning abilities, and we often
find ourselves doing and saying things that we would never have done in
more sober moments. In fact, when we come down from the emotional
obsession we often wonder why we did those things. When the wave of
emotions subsides and we come back to the real world where our
differences are illuminated, how many of us have asked, "Why did we get
married? We don't agree on anything." Yet, at the height of the
in-loveness, we thought we agreed on everything---at least everything
that was important.

[Rational, volitional love...is the kind of love to which the sages have
always called us.]{.italic}

Does that mean that having been tricked into marriage by the illusion of
being in love, we are now faced with two options: (1) we are destined to
a life of misery with our spouse, or (2) we must jump ship and try
again? Our generation has opted for the latter, whereas an earlier
generation often chose the former. Before we automatically conclude that
we have made the better choice, perhaps we should examine the data.
Presently 40 percent of first marriages in this country end in divorce.
Sixty percent of second marriages and 75 percent of third marriages end
the same way. Apparently the prospect of a happier marriage the second
and third time around is not substantial.

Research seems to indicate that there is a third and better alternative:
We can recognize the in-love experience for what it was---a temporary
emotional high---and now pursue "real love" with our spouse. That kind
of love is emotional in nature but not obsessional. It is a love that
unites reason and emotion. It involves an act of the will and requires
discipline, and it recognizes the need for personal growth. Our most
basic emotional need is not to fall in love but to be genuinely loved by
another, to know a love that grows out of reason and choice, not
instinct. I need to be loved by someone who chooses to love me, who sees
in me something worth loving.

That kind of love requires effort and discipline. It is the choice to
expend energy in an effort to benefit the other person, knowing that if
his or her life is enriched by your effort, you too will find a sense of
satisfaction---the satisfaction of having genuinely loved another. It
does not require the euphoria of the "in love" experience. In fact, true
love cannot begin until the "in love" experience has run its course.

We cannot take credit for the kind and generous things we do while under
the influence of "the obsession." We are pushed and carried along by an
instinctual force that goes beyond our normal behavior patterns. But if,
once we return to the real world of human choice, we choose to be kind
and generous, that is real love.

The emotional need for love must be met if we are to have emotional
health. Married adults long to feel affection and love from their
spouses. We feel secure when we are assured that our mate accepts us,
wants us, and is committed to our well-being. During the in-love stage,
we felt all of those emotions. It was heavenly while it lasted. Our
mistake was in thinking it would last forever.

But that obsession was not meant to last forever. In the textbook of
marriage, it is but the introduction. The heart of the book is rational,
volitional love. That is the kind of love to which the sages have always
called us. It is intentional.

That is good news to the married couple who have lost all of their "in
love" feelings. If love is a choice, then they have the capacity to love
after the "in love" obsession has died and they have returned to the
real world. That kind of love begins with an attitude---a way of
thinking. Love is the attitude that says, "I am married to you, and I
choose to look out for your interests." Then the one who chooses to love
will find appropriate ways to express that decision.

"But it seems so sterile," some may contend. "Love as an attitude with
appropriate behavior? Where are the shooting stars, the balloons, the
deep emotions? What about the spirit of anticipation, the twinkle of the
eye, the electricity of a kiss, the excitement of sex? What about the
emotional security of knowing that I am number one in his/her mind?"
That is what this book is all about. How do we meet each other's deep,
emotional need to feel loved? If we can learn that and choose to do it,
then the love we share will be exciting beyond anything we ever felt
when we were infatuated.

\

[[[F]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}or many years now, I have discussed
the five emotional love languages in my marriage seminars and in private
counseling sessions. Thousands of couples will attest to the validity of
what you are about to read. My files are filled with letters from people
whom I have never met, saying, "A friend loaned me one of your tapes on
love languages, and it has revolutionized our marriage. We had struggled
for years trying to love each other, but our efforts had missed each
other emotionally. Now that we are speaking the appropriate love
languages, the emotional climate of our marriage has radically
improved."

When your spouse's emotional love tank is full and he feels secure in
your love, the whole world looks bright and your spouse will move out to
reach his highest potential in life. But when the love tank is empty and
he feels used but not loved, the whole world looks dark and he will
likely never reach his potential for good in the world. In the next five
chapters, I will explain the five emotional love languages and then, in
chapter 9, illustrate how discovering your spouse's primary love
language can make your efforts at love most productive.

[[[M]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ark Twain once said, "I can live for
two months on a good compliment." If we take Twain literally, six
compliments a year would have kept his emotional love tank at the
operational level. Your spouse will probably need more.

One way to express love emotionally is to use words that build up.
Solomon, author of the ancient Hebrew wisdom literature, wrote, "The
tongue has the power of life and death."^1^ Many couples have never
learned the tremendous power of verbally affirming each other. Solomon
further noted, "An anxious heart weighs a man down, but a kind word
cheers him up."^2^

Verbal compliments, or words of appreciation, are powerful communicators
of love. They are best expressed in simple, straightforward statements
of affirmation, such as:

"You look sharp in that suit."

"Do you ever look nice in that dress! Wow!"

"You must be the best potato cook in the world. I love these potatoes."

"I really appreciate your washing the dishes tonight."

"Thanks for getting the baby-sitter lined up tonight. I want you to know
I don't take that for granted."

"I really appreciate your taking the garbage out."

What would happen to the emotional climate of a marriage if the husband
and wife heard such words of affirmation regularly?

\

[[[S]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}everal years ago, I was sitting in my
office with my door open.

A lady walking down the hall said, "Have you got a minute?"

"Sure, come in."

She sat down and said, "Dr. Chapman, I've got a problem. I can't get my
husband to paint our bedroom. I have been after him for nine months. I
have tried everything I know, and I can't get him to paint it."

My first thought was, [Lady, you are at the wrong place. I am not a
paint contractor.]{.italic} But I said, "Tell me about it."

She said, "Well, last Saturday was a good example. You remember how
pretty it was? Do you know what my husband did all day long? He washed
and waxed the car."

"So what did you do?"

"I went out there and said, 'Bob, I don't understand you. Today would
have been a perfect day to paint the bedroom, and here you are washing
and waxing the car.'"

"So did he paint the bedroom?" I inquired.

"No. It's still not painted. I don't know what to do."

"Let me ask you a question," I said. "Are you opposed to clean, waxed
cars?"

"No, but I want the bedroom painted."

"Are you certain that your husband knows that you want the bedroom
painted?"

"I know he does," she said. "I have been after him for nine months."

"Let me ask you one more question. Does your husband ever do anything
good?"

"Like what?"

"Oh, like taking the garbage out, or getting bugs off the windshield of
the car you drive, or putting gas in the car, or paying the electric
bill, or hanging up his coat?"

"Yes," she said, "he does some of those things."

"Then I have two suggestions. One, don't ever mention painting the
bedroom again." I repeated, "Don't ever mention it again."

"I don't see how that's going to help," she said.

[The object of love is not getting something you want but doing
something for the well-being of the one you love. It is a fact, however,
that when we receive affirming words we are far more likely to be
motivated to reciprocate.]{.italic}

"Look, you just told me that he knows that you want the bedroom painted.
You don't have to tell him anymore. He already knows. The second
suggestion I have is that the next time your husband does anything good,
give him a verbal compliment. If he takes the garbage out, say, 'Bob, I
want you to know that I really appreciate your taking the garbage out.'
Don't say, 'About time you took the garbage out. The flies were going to
carry it out for you.' If you see him paying the electric bill, put your
hand on his shoulder and say, 'Bob, I really appreciate your paying the
electric bill. I hear there are husbands who don't do that, and I want
you to know how much I appreciate it.' Every time he does anything good,
give him a verbal compliment."

"I don't see how that's going to get the bedroom painted."

I said, "You asked for my advice. You have it. It's free."

She wasn't very happy with me when she left. Three weeks later, however,
she came back to my office and said, "It worked!" She had learned that
verbal compliments are far greater motivators than nagging words.

I am not suggesting verbal flattery in order to get your spouse to do
something you want. The object of love is not getting something you want
but doing something for the well-being of the one you love. It is a
fact, however, that when we receive affirming words we are far more
likely to be motivated to reciprocate and do something our spouse
desires.

[[E]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[NCOURAGING]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
W]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[ORDS]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

Giving verbal compliments is only one way to express words of
affirmation to your spouse. Another dialect is encouraging words. The
word [encourage]{.italic} means "to inspire courage." All of us have
areas in which we feel insecure. We lack courage, and that lack of
courage often hinders us from accomplishing the positive things that we
would like to do. The latent potential within your spouse in his or her
areas of insecurity may await your encouraging words.

[[[A]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}llison had always liked to write. Late
in her college career, she took a few courses in journalism. She quickly
realized that her excitement about writing exceeded her interest in
history, which had been her academic major. It was too late to change
majors, but after college and especially before the first baby, she
wrote several articles. She submitted one article to a magazine, but
when she received a rejection slip, she never had the courage to submit
another. Now that the children were older and she had more time to
contemplate, Allison was again writing.

Keith, Allison's husband, had paid little attention to Allison's writing
in the early days of their marriage. He was busy with his own vocation
and caught up in the pressure of climbing the corporate ladder. In time,
however, Keith had realized that life's deepest meaning is not found in
accomplishments but in relationships. He had learned to give more
attention to Allison and her interests. So it was quite natural one
night for him to pick up one of Allison's articles and read it. When he
finished, he went into the den where Allison was reading a book. With
great enthusiasm, he said, "I hate to interrupt your reading, but I have
to tell you this. I just finished reading your article on 'Making the
Most of the Holidays.' Allison, you are an excellent writer. This stuff
ought to be published! You write clearly. Your words paint pictures that
I can visualize. You have a fascinating style. You have to submit this
stuff to some magazines."

"Do you really think so?" Allison asked hesitantly.

"I know so," Keith said. "I'm telling you, this is good."

When Keith left the room, Allison did not resume her reading. With the
closed book in her lap, she dreamed for thirty minutes about what Keith
had said. She wondered if others would view her writing the same way he
did. She remembered the rejection slip she had received years ago, but
she reasoned that she was a different person now. Her writing was
better. She had had more experiences. Before she left the chair to get a
drink of water, Allison had made a decision. She would submit her
articles to some magazines. She would see if they could be published.

Keith's encouraging words were spoken fourteen years ago. Allison has
had numerous articles published since then and now has a book contract.
She is an excellent writer, but it took the encouraging words from her
husband to inspire her to take the first step in the arduous process of
getting an article published.

\

[[[P]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}erhaps your spouse has untapped
potential in one or more areas of life. That potential may be awaiting
your encouraging words. Perhaps she needs to enroll in a course to
develop that potential. Maybe he needs to meet some people who have
succeeded in that area, who can give him insight on the next step he
needs to take. Your words may give your spouse the courage necessary to
take that first step.

Please note that I am not talking about pressuring your spouse to do
something that you want. I am talking about encouraging him to develop
an interest that he already has. For example, some husbands pressure
their wives to lose weight. The husband says, "I am encouraging her,"
but to the wife it sounds like condemnation. Only when a person wants to
lose weight can you give her encouragement. Until she has the desire,
your words will fall into the category of preaching. Such words seldom
encourage. They are almost always heard as words of judgment, designed
to stimulate guilt. They express not love but rejection.

[Encouragement requires empathy and seeing the world from your spouse's
perspective. We must first learn what is important to our
spouse.]{.italic}

If, however, your spouse says, "I think I would like to enroll in a
weight-loss program this fall," then you have opportunity to give words
of encouragement. Encouraging words would sound like this. "If you
decide to do that, I can tell you one thing. You will be a success.
That's one of the things I like about you. When you set your mind to
something, you do it. If that's what you want to do, I will certainly do
everything I can to help you. And don't worry about the cost of the
program. If it's what you want to do, we'll find the money." Such words
may give your spouse the courage to phone the weight-loss center.

Encouragement requires empathy and seeing the world from your spouse's
perspective. We must first learn what is important to our spouse. Only
then can we give encouragement. With verbal encouragement, we are trying
to communicate, "I know. I care. I am with you. How can I help?" We are
trying to show that we believe in him and in his abilities. We are
giving credit and praise.

Most of us have more potential than we will ever develop. What holds us
back is often courage. A loving spouse can supply that all-important
catalyst. Of course, encouraging words may be difficult for you to
speak. It may not be your primary love language. It may take great
effort for you to learn this second language. That will be especially
true if you have a pattern of critical and condemning words, but I can
assure you that it will be worth the effort.

[[K]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[IND]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
W]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[ORDS]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

Love is kind. If then we are to communicate love verbally, we must use
kind words. That has to do with the way we speak. The same sentence can
have two different meanings, depending on how you say it. The statement
"I love you," when said with kindness and tenderness, can be a genuine
expression of love. But what about the statement "I love you?" The
question mark changes the whole meaning of those three words. Sometimes
our words are saying one thing, but our tone of voice is saying another.
We are sending double messages. Our spouse will usually interpret our
message based on our tone of voice, not the words we use.

"I would be delighted to wash dishes tonight," said in a snarling tone
will not be received as an expression of love. On the other hand, we can
share hurt, pain, and even anger in a kind manner, and that will be an
expression of love. "I felt disappointed and hurt that you didn't offer
to help me this evening," said in an honest, kind manner can be an
expression of love. The person speaking wants to be known by her spouse.
She is taking steps to build intimacy by sharing her feelings. She is
asking for an opportunity to discuss a hurt in order to find healing.
The same words expressed with a loud, harsh voice will be not an
expression of love but an expression of condemnation and judgment.

The manner in which we speak is exceedingly important. An ancient sage
once said, "A soft answer turns away anger." When your spouse is angry
and upset and lashing out words of heat, if you choose to be loving you
will not reciprocate with additional heat but with a soft voice. You
will receive what he is saying as information about his emotional
feelings. You will let him tell you of his hurt, anger, and perception
of events. You will seek to put yourself in his shoes and see the event
through his eyes and then express softly and kindly your understanding
of why he feels that way. If you have wronged him, you will be willing
to confess the wrong and ask forgiveness. If your motivation is
different from what he is reading, you will be able to explain your
motivation kindly. You will seek understanding and reconciliation, and
not to prove your own perception as the only logical way to interpret
what has happened. That is mature love---love to which we aspire if we
seek a growing marriage.

Love doesn't keep a score of wrongs. Love doesn't bring up past
failures. None of us is perfect. In marriage we do not always do the
best or right thing. We have sometimes done and said hurtful things to
our spouses. We cannot erase the past. We can only confess it and agree
that it was wrong. We can ask for forgiveness and try to act differently
in the future. Having confessed my failure and asked forgiveness, I can
do nothing more to mitigate the hurt it may have caused my spouse. When
I have been wronged by my spouse and she has painfully confessed it and
requested forgiveness, I have the option of justice or forgiveness. If I
choose justice and seek to pay her back or make her pay for her
wrongdoing, I am making myself the judge and her the felon. Intimacy
becomes impossible. If, however, I choose to forgive, intimacy can be
restored. Forgiveness is the way of love.

\

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} am amazed by how many individuals
mess up every new day with yesterday. They insist on bringing into today
the failures of yesterday and in so doing, they pollute a potentially
wonderful day. "I can't believe you did it. I don't think I'll ever
forget it. You can't possibly know how much you hurt me. I don't know
how you can sit there so smugly after you treated me that way. You ought
to be crawling on your knees, begging me for forgiveness. I don't know
if I can ever forgive you." Those are not the words of love but of
bitterness and resentment and revenge.

[If we are to develop an intimate relationship, we need to know each
other's desires. If we wish to love each other, we need to know what the
other person wants.]{.italic}

The best thing we can do with the failures of the past is to let them be
history. Yes, it happened. Certainly it hurt. And it may still hurt, but
he has acknowledged his failure and asked your forgiveness. We cannot
erase the past, but we can accept it as history. We can choose to live
today free from the failures of yesterday. Forgiveness is not a feeling;
it is a commitment. It is a choice to show mercy, not to hold the
offense up against the offender. Forgiveness is an expression of love.
"I love you. I care about you, and I choose to forgive you. Even though
my feelings of hurt may linger, I will not allow what has happened to
come between us. I hope that we can learn from this experience. You are
not a failure because you have failed. You are my spouse, and together
we will go on from here." Those are the words of affirmation expressed
in the dialect of kind words.

[[H]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[UMBLE]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
W]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[ORDS]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

Love makes requests, not demands. When I demand things from my spouse, I
become a parent and she the child. It is the parent who tells the
three-year-old what he ought to do and, in fact, what he must do. That
is necessary because the three-year-old does not yet know how to
navigate in the treacherous waters of life. In marriage, however, we are
equal, adult partners. We are not perfect to be sure, but we are adults
and we are partners. If we are to develop an intimate relationship, we
need to know each other's desires. If we wish to love each other, we
need to know what the other person wants.

The way we express those desires, however, is all-important. If they
come across as demands, we have erased the possibility of intimacy and
will drive our spouse away. If, however, we make known our needs and
desires as requests, we are giving guidance, not ultimatums. The husband
who says, "You know those apple pies you make? Would it be possible for
you to make one this week? I love those apple pies," is giving his wife
guidance on how to love him and thus build intimacy. On the other hand,
the husband who says, "Haven't had an apple pie since the baby was born.
Don't guess I'll get any more apple pies for eighteen years," has ceased
being an adult and has reverted to adolescent behavior. Such demands do
not build intimacy. The wife who says, "Do you think it will be possible
for you to clean the gutters this weekend?" is expressing love by making
a request. But the wife who says, "If you don't get those gutters
cleaned out soon, they are going to fall off the house. They already
have trees growing out of them!" has ceased to love and has become a
domineering spouse.

When you make a request of your spouse, you are affirming his or her
worth and abilities. You are in essence indicating that she has
something or can do something that is meaningful and worthwhile to you.
When, however, you make demands, you have become not a lover but a
tyrant. Your spouse will feel not affirmed but belittled. A request
introduces the element of choice. Your mate may choose to respond to
your request or to deny it, because love is always a choice. That's what
makes it meaningful. To know that my spouse loves me enough to respond
to one of my requests communicates emotionally that she cares about me,
respects me, admires me, and wants to do something to please me. We
cannot get emotional love by way of demand. My spouse may in fact comply
with my demands, but it is not an expression of love. It is an act of
fear or guilt or some other emotion, but not love. Thus, a request
creates the possibility for an expression of love, whereas a demand
suffocates that possibility.

[[V]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[ARIOUS]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[

Words of affirmation are one of the five basic love languages. Within
that language, however, there are many dialects. We have discussed a few
already, and there are many more. Entire volumes and numerous articles
have been written on these dialects. All of the dialects have in common
the use of words to affirm one's spouse. Psychologist William James said
that possibly the deepest human need is the need to feel appreciated.
Words of affirmation will meet that need in many individuals. If you are
not a man or woman of words, if it is not your primary love language but
you think it may be the love language of your spouse, let me suggest
that you keep a notebook titled "Words of Affirmation." When you read an
article or book on love, record the words of affirmation you find. When
you hear a lecture on love or you overhear a friend saying something
positive about another person, write it down. In time, you will collect
quite a list of words to use in communicating love to your spouse.

You may also want to try giving indirect words of affirmation, that is,
saying positive things about your spouse when he or she is not present.
Eventually, someone will tell your spouse, and you will get full credit
for love. Tell your wife's mother how great your wife is. When her
mother tells her what you said, it will be amplified, and you will get
even more credit. Also affirm your spouse in front of others when he or
she is present. When you are given public honor for an accomplishment,
be sure to share the credit with your spouse. You may also try your hand
at writing words of affirmation. Written words have the benefit of being
read over and over again.

\

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} learned an important lesson about
words of affirmation and love languages in Little Rock, Arkansas. My
visit with Bill and Betty Jo was on a beautiful spring day. They lived
in a cluster home with white picket fence, green grass, and spring
flowers in full bloom. It was idyllic. Once inside, however, I
discovered that the idealism ended. Their marriage was in shambles.
Twelve years and two children after the wedding day, they wondered why
they had married in the first place. They seemed to disagree on
everything. The only thing they really agreed on was that they both
loved the children. As the story unraveled, my observation was that Bill
was a workaholic who had little time left over for Betty Jo. Betty Jo
worked part-time, mainly to get out of the house. Their method of coping
was withdrawal. They tried to put distance between themselves so that
their conflicts would not seem as large. But the gauge on both love
tanks read "empty."

They told me that they had been going for marriage counseling but didn't
seem to be making much progress. They were attending my marriage
seminar, and I was leaving town the next day. This would likely be my
only encounter with Bill and Betty Jo. I decided to put all my eggs in
one basket.

I spent an hour with each of them separately. I listened intently to
both stories. I discovered that in spite of the emptiness of their
relationship and their many disagreements, they appreciated certain
things about each other. Bill acknowledged, "She is a good mother. She
also is a good housekeeper and an excellent cook when she chooses to
cook. But," he continued, "there is simply no affection coming from her.
I work my butt off and there is simply no appreciation." In my
conversation with Betty Jo, she agreed that Bill was an excellent
provider. "But," she complained, "he does nothing around the house to
help me, and he never has time for me. What's the use of having the
house, the recreational vehicle, and all the other things if you don't
ever get to enjoy them together?"

With that information, I decided to focus my advice by making only one
suggestion to each of them. I told Bill and Betty Jo separately that
each one held the key to changing the emotional climate of the marriage.
"That key," I said, "is to express verbal appreciation for the things
you like about the other person and, for the moment, suspending your
complaints about the things you do not like." We reviewed the positive
comments they had already made about each other and helped each of them
write a list of those positive traits. Bill's list focused on Betty Jo's
activities as a mother, housekeeper, and cook. Betty Jo's list focused
on Bill's hard work and financial provision of the family. We made the
lists as specific as possible. Betty Jo's list looked like this:

- > He hasn't missed a day of work in twelve years. He is aggressive in
  > his work.

- > He has received several promotions through the years. He is always
  > thinking of ways to improve his productivity.

- > He makes the house payment each month.

- > He also pays the electrical bill, the gas bill, the water bill.

- > He bought us a recreational vehicle three years ago.

- > He mows the grass or hires someone to do it each week in the spring
  > and summer.

- > He rakes the leaves or hires someone to do it in the fall.

- > He provides plenty of money for food and clothing for the family.

- > He carries the garbage out about once a month.

- > He provides money for me to buy Christmas presents for the family.

- > He agrees that I can use the money I make at my part-time job any
  > way I desire.

Bill's list looked like this:

- > She makes the beds every day.

- > She vacuums the house every week.

- > She gets the kids off to school every morning with a good breakfast.

- > She cooks dinner about three days a week.

- > She buys the groceries.

- > She helps the children with their homework.

- > She transports the children to school and church activities.

- > She teaches first grade Sunday school.

- > She takes my clothes to the cleaners.

- > She does the washing and some ironing.

I suggested that they add to the lists things they noticed in the weeks
ahead. I also suggested that twice a week, they select one positive
trait and express verbal appreciation for it to the spouse. I gave one
further guideline. I told Betty Jo that if Bill happened to give her a
compliment, she was not to give him a compliment at the same time but
rather, she should simply receive it and say, "Thank you for saying
that." I told Bill the same thing. I encouraged them to do that every
week for two months, and if they found it helpful, they could continue.
If the experiment did not help the emotional climate of the marriage,
then they could write it off as another failed attempt.

The next day, I got on the plane and returned home. I made a note to
call Bill and Betty Jo two months later to see what had happened. When I
called them in mid-summer, I asked to speak to each of them
individually. I was amazed to find that Bill's attitude had taken a
giant step forward. He had guessed that I had given Betty Jo the same
advice I had given him, but that was all right. He loved it. She was
expressing appreciation for his hard work and his provision for the
family. "She has actually made me feel like a man again. We've got a
ways to go, Dr. Chapman, but I really believe we are on the road."

When I talked to Betty Jo, however, I found that she had only taken a
baby step forward. She said, "It has improved some, Dr. Chapman. Bill is
giving me verbal compliments as you suggested, and I guess he is
sincere. But, Dr. Chapman, he's still not spending any time with me. He
is still so busy at work that we never have time together."

As I listened to Betty Jo, the lights came on. I knew that I had made a
significant discovery. The love language of one person is not
necessarily the love language of another. It was obvious that Bill's
primary love language was Words of Affirmation. He was a hard worker,
and he enjoyed his work, but what he wanted most from his wife was
expressions of appreciation for his work. That pattern was probably set
in childhood, and the need for verbal affirmation was no less important
in his adult life. Betty Jo, on the other hand, was emotionally crying
out for something else. Positive words were fine, but her deep emotional
longing is for something else. That brings us to love language number
two.

[[Love Language #2]{.bold}]{.italic}

[[Q]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[UALITY]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
T]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[IME]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} should have picked up on Betty Jo's
primary love language from the beginning. What was she saying on that
spring night when I visited her and Bill in Little Rock? "Bill is a good
provider, but he doesn't spend any time with me. What good is the house
and the recreational vehicle and all the other things if we don't ever
enjoy them together?" What was her desire? Quality time with Bill. She
wanted his attention. She wanted him to focus on her, to give her time,
to do things with her.

By "quality time," I mean giving someone your undivided attention. I
don't mean sitting on the couch watching television together. When you
spend time that way, ABC or NBC has your attention---not your spouse.
What I mean is sitting on the couch with the TV off, looking at each
other and [talking,]{.italic} giving each other your undivided
attention. It means taking a walk, just the two of you, or going out to
eat and looking at each other and talking. Have you ever noticed that in
a restaurant, you can almost always tell the difference between a dating
couple and a married couple? Dating couples look at each other and talk.
Married couples sit there and gaze around the restaurant. You'd think
they went there to eat!

When I sit on the couch with my wife and give her twenty minutes of my
undivided attention and she does the same for me, we are giving each
other twenty minutes of life. We will never have those twenty minutes
again; we are giving our lives to each other. It is a powerful emotional
communicator of love.

One medicine cannot cure all diseases. In my advice to Bill and Betty
Jo, I made a serious mistake. I assumed that words of affirmation would
mean as much to Betty Jo as they would to Bill. I had hoped that if each
of them would give adequate verbal affirmation, the emotional climate
would change, and both of them would begin to feel loved. It worked for
Bill. He began to feel more positive about Betty Jo. He began to sense
genuine appreciation for his hard work, but it had not worked as well
for Betty Jo, for words of affirmation were not her primary love
language. Her language was quality time.

\

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} got back on the phone and thanked
Bill for his efforts in the past two months. I told him that he had done
a good job of verbally affirming Betty Jo and that she had heard his
affirmations. "But, Dr. Chapman," he said, "she is still not very happy.
I don't think things are much better for her."

"You are right," I said, "and I think I know why. The problem is that I
suggested the wrong love language." Bill hadn't the foggiest idea what I
meant. I explained that what makes one person feel loved emotionally is
not always the thing that makes another person feel loved emotionally.

He agreed that his language was words of affirmation. He told me how
much that had meant to him as a boy and how good he felt when Betty Jo
expressed appreciation for the things he did. I explained that Betty
Jo's language was not words of affirmation but quality time. I explained
the concept of giving someone your undivided attention, not talking to
her while you read the newspaper or watch television but looking into
her eyes, giving her your full attention, doing something with her that
she enjoys doing and doing it wholeheartedly. "Like going to the
symphony with her," he said. I could tell the lights were coming on in
Little Rock.

"Dr. Chapman, that is what she has always complained about. I didn't do
things with her, I didn't spend any time with her. 'We used to go places
and do things before we were married,' she said, 'but now, you're too
busy.' That's her love language all right; no question about it. But,
Dr. Chapman, what am I gonna do? My job is so demanding."

"Tell me about it," I said.

For the next ten minutes, he gave me the history of his climb up the
organizational ladder, of how hard he had worked, and how proud he was
of his accomplishments. He told me of his dreams for the future and that
he knew that within the next five years, he would be where he wanted to
be.

"Do you want to be there alone, or do you want to be there with Betty Jo
and the children?" I asked.

"I want her to be with me, Dr. Chapman. I want her to enjoy it with me.
That's why it always hurts so much when she criticizes me for spending
time on the job. I am doing it for us. I wanted her to be a part of it,
but she is always so negative."

"Are you beginning to see why she was so negative, Bill?" I asked. "Her
love language is quality time. You have given her so little time that
her love tank is empty. She doesn't feel secure in your love. Therefore
she has lashed out at what was taking your time in her mind---your job.
She doesn't really hate your job. She hates the fact that she feels so
little love coming from you. There's only one answer, Bill, and it's
costly. You have to make time for Betty Jo. You have to love her in the
right love language."

"I know you are right, Dr. Chapman. Where do I begin?"

"Do you have your legal pad handy? The one on which we made the list of
the positive things about Betty Jo?"

"It's right here."

"Good. We're going to make another list. What are some things that you
know Betty Jo would like you to do with her? Things she has mentioned
through the years." Here is Bill's list:

- > Take our RV and spend a weekend in the mountains (sometimes with the
  > children and sometimes just the two of us).

- > Meet her for lunch (at a nice restaurant or sometimes even at
  > McDonald's).

- > Get a baby-sitter and take her out to dinner, just the two of us.

- > When I come home at night, sit down and talk with her about my day
  > and listen as she tells me about her day. (She doesn't want me to
  > watch TV while we are trying to talk.)

- > Spend time talking with the children about their school experiences.

- > Spend time playing games with the children.

- > Go on a picnic with her and the children on Saturday and don't
  > complain about the ants and the flies.

- > Take a vacation with the family at least once a year.

- > Go walking with her and talk as we walk. (Don't walk ahead of her.)

"Those are the things she has talked about through the years," he said.

"You know what I am going to suggest, don't you, Bill?"

"Do them," he said.

"That's right, one a week for the next two months. Where will you find
the time? You will make it. You are a wise man," I continued. "You would
not be where you are if you were not a good decision maker. You have the
ability to plan your life and to include Betty Jo in your plans."

"I know," he said, "I can do it."

"And, Bill, this does not have to diminish your vocational goals. It
just means that when you get to the top, Betty Jo and the children will
be with you."

[A central aspect of quality time is togetherness. I do not mean
proximity.... Togetherness has to do with focused attention.]{.italic}

"That's what I want more than anything. Whether I am at the top or not,
I want her to be happy, and I want to enjoy life with her and the
children."

The years have come and gone. Bill and Betty Jo have gone to the top and
back, but the important thing is that they have done it together. The
children have left the nest, and Bill and Betty Jo agree that these are
their best years ever. Bill has become an avid symphony fan, and Betty
Jo has made an unending list in her legal pad of things she appreciates
about Bill. He never tires of hearing them. He has now started his own
company and is near the top again. His job is no longer a threat to
Betty Jo. She is excited about it and encourages him. She knows that she
is number one in his life. Her love tank is full, and if it begins to
get empty, she knows that a simple request on her part will get her
Bill's undivided attention.

[[T]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[OGETHERNESS]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

A central aspect of quality time is togetherness. I do not mean
proximity. Two people sitting in the same room are in close proximity,
but they are not necessarily together. Togetherness has to do with
focused attention. When a father is sitting on the floor, rolling a ball
to his two-year-old, his attention is not focused on the ball but on his
child. For that brief moment, however long it lasts, they are together.
If, however, the father is talking on the phone while he rolls the ball,
his attention is diluted. Some husbands and wives think they are
spending time together when, in reality, they are only living in close
proximity. They are in the same house at the same time, but they are not
together. A husband who is watching sports on television while he talks
to his wife is not giving her quality time, because she does not have
his full attention.

Quality time does not mean that we have to spend our together moments
gazing into each other's eyes. It means that we are doing something
together and that we are giving our full attention to the other person.
The activity in which we are both engaged is incidental. The important
thing emotionally is that we are spending focused time with each other.
The activity is a vehicle that creates the sense of togetherness. The
important thing about the father rolling the ball to the two-year-old is
not the activity itself, but the emotions that are created between the
father and his child.

Similarly, a husband and wife playing tennis together, if it is genuine
quality time, will focus not on the game but on the fact that they are
spending time together. What happens on the emotional level is what
matters. Our spending time together in a common pursuit communicates
that we care about each other, that we enjoy being with each other, that
we like to do things together.

[[Q]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[UALITY]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
C]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[ONVERSATION]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

Like words of affirmation, the language of quality time also has many
dialects. One of the most common dialects is that of quality
conversation. By quality conversation, I mean sympathetic dialogue where
two individuals are sharing their experiences, thoughts, feelings, and
desires in a friendly, uninterrupted context. Most individuals who
complain that their spouse does not talk do not mean literally that he
or she never says a word. They mean that he or she seldom takes part in
sympathetic dialogue. If your spouse's primary love language is quality
time, such dialogue is crucial to his or her emotional sense of being
loved.

Quality conversation is quite different from the first love language.
Words of affirmation focus on what we are [saying,]{.italic} whereas
quality conversation focuses on what we are [hearing.]{.italic} If I am
sharing my love for you by means of quality time and we are going to
spend that time in conversation, it means I will focus on drawing you
out, listening sympathetically to what you have to say. I will ask
questions, not in a badgering manner but with a genuine desire to
understand your thoughts, feelings, and desires.

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} met Patrick when he was forty-three
and had been married for seventeen years. I remember him because his
first words were so dramatic. He sat in the leather chair in my office
and after briefly introducing himself, he leaned forward and said with
great emotion, "Dr. Chapman, I have been a fool, a real fool."

"What has led you to that conclusion?" I asked.

"I've been married for seventeen years," he said, "and my wife has left
me. Now I realize what a fool I've been."

I repeated my original question, "In what way have you been a fool?"

"My wife would come home from work and tell me about the problems in her
office. I would listen to her and then tell her what I thought she
should do. I always gave her advice. I told her she had to confront the
problem. 'Problems don't go away. You have to talk with the people
involved or your supervisor. You have to deal with problems.' The next
day she would come home from work and tell me about the same problems. I
would ask her if she did what I had suggested the day before. She would
shake her head and say no. So I'd repeat my advice. I told her that was
the way to deal with the situation. She would come home the next day and
tell me about the same problems. Again I would ask her if she had done
what I had suggested. She would shake her head and say no.

"After three or four nights of that, I would get angry. I would tell her
not to expect any sympathy from me if she wasn't willing to take the
advice I was giving her. She didn't have to live under that kind of
stress and pressure. She could solve the problem if she would simply do
what I told her. It hurt me to see her living under such stress because
I knew she didn't have to. The next time she'd bring up the problem, I
would say, 'I don't want to hear about it. I've told you what you need
to do. If you're not going to listen to my advice, I don't want to hear
it.'

[Many of us...are trained to analyze problems and create solutions. We
forget that marriage is a relationship, not a project to be completed or
a problem to solve.]{.italic}

"I would withdraw and go about my business. What a fool I was," he said,
"what a fool! Now I realize that she didn't want advice when she told me
about her struggles at work. She wanted sympathy. She wanted me to
listen, to give her attention, to let her know that I could understand
the hurt, the stress, the pressure. She wanted to know that I loved her
and that I was with her. She didn't want advice; she just wanted to know
that I understood. But I never tried to understand. I was too busy
giving advice. What a fool. And now she is gone. Why can't you see these
things when you are going through them?" he asked. "I was blind to what
was going on. Only now do I understand how I failed her."

\

[[[P]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}atrick's wife had been pleading for
quality conversation.

Emotionally, she longed for him to focus attention on her by listening
to her pain and frustration. Patrick was not focusing on listening but
on speaking. He listened only long enough to hear the problem and
formulate a solution. He didn't listen long enough or well enough to
hear her cry for support and understanding.

Many of us are like Patrick. We are trained to analyze problems and
create solutions. We forget that marriage is a relationship, not a
project to be completed or a problem to solve. A relationship calls for
sympathetic listening with a view to understanding the other person's
thoughts, feelings, and desires. We must be willing to give advice but
only when it is requested and never in a condescending manner. Most of
us have little training in listening. We are far more efficient in
thinking and speaking. Learning to listen may be as difficult as
learning a foreign language, but learn we must, if we want to
communicate love. That is especially true if your spouse's primary love
language is quality time and his or her dialect is quality conversation.
Fortunately, numerous books and articles have been written on developing
the art of listening. I will not seek to repeat what is written
elsewhere but suggest the following summary of practical tips.

[[L]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[EARNING TO]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
T]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[ALK]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

Quality conversation requires not only sympathetic listening but also
self-revelation. When a wife says, "I wish my husband would talk. I
never know what he's thinking or feeling," she is pleading for intimacy.
She wants to feel close to her husband, but how can she feel close to
someone whom she doesn't know? In order for her to feel loved, he must
learn to reveal himself. If her primary love language is quality time
and her dialect is quality conversation, her emotional love tank will
never be filled until he tells her his thoughts and feelings.

[If you need to learn the language of quality conversation, begin by
noting the emotions you feel away from home.]{.italic}

Self-revelation does not come easy for some of us. Many adults grew up
in homes where the expression of thoughts and feelings was not
encouraged but condemned. To request a toy was to receive a lecture on
the sad state of family finances. The child went away feeling guilty for
having the desire, and he quickly learned not to express his desires.
When he expressed anger, the parents responded with harsh and condemning
words. Thus, the child learned that expressing angry feelings is not
appropriate. If the child was made to feel guilty for expressing
disappointment at not being able to go to the store with his father, he
learned to hold his disappointment inside. By the time we reach
adulthood, many of us have learned to deny our feelings. We are no
longer in touch with our emotional selves.

A wife says to her husband, "How did you feel about what Don did?" And
the husband responds, "I think he was wrong. He should have---" but he
is not telling her his feelings. He is voicing his thoughts. Perhaps he
has reason to feel angry, hurt, or disappointed, but he has lived so
long in the world of thought that he does not acknowledge his feelings.
When he decides to learn the language of quality conversation, it will
be like learning a foreign language. The place to begin is by getting in
touch with his feelings, becoming aware that he is an emotional creature
in spite of the fact that he has denied that part of his life.

If you need to learn the language of quality conversation, begin by
noting the emotions you feel away from home. Carry a small notepad and
keep it with you daily. Three times each day, ask yourself, "What
emotions have I felt in the last three hours? What did I feel on the way
to work when the driver behind me was riding my bumper? What did I feel
when I stopped at the gas station and the automatic pump did not shut
off and the side of the car was covered with gas? What did I feel when I
got to the office and found that my secretary had been assigned to a
special work project for the morning? What did I feel when my supervisor
told me that the project I was working on had to be completed in three
days when I thought I had another two weeks?"

Write down your feelings in the notepad and a word or two to help you
remember the event corresponding to the feeling. Your list may look like
this:

\
<table valign="top" class="calibre37">
<tr valign="top" class="calibre38">
<th valign="top" class="calibre39">

</tr>
</table>

\

Do that exercise three times a day, and you will develop an awareness of
your emotional nature. Using your notepad, communicate your emotions and
the events briefly with your spouse as many days as possible. In a few
weeks, you will become comfortable expressing your emotions with him or
her. And eventually you will feel comfortable discussing your emotions
toward your spouse, the children, and events that occur within the home.
Remember, emotions themselves are neither good nor bad. They are simply
our psychological responses to the events of life.

\

[[[B]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ased on our thoughts and emotions, we
eventually make decisions. When the tailgater was following you on the
highway and you felt angry, perhaps you had these thoughts: [I wish he
would lay off; I wish he would pass me; if I thought I wouldn't get
caught, I'd press the accelerator and leave him in the twilight; I
should slam on my brakes and let his insurance company buy me a new car;
maybe I'll pull off the road and let him pass.]{.italic}

Eventually, you made some decision or the other driver backed off,
turned, or passed you, and you arrived safely at work. In each of life's
events, we have emotions, thoughts, desires, and eventually actions. It
is the expression of that process that we call self-revelation. If you
choose to learn the love dialect of quality conversation, that is the
learning road you must follow.

[[P]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[ERSONALITY]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
T]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[YPES]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

Not all of us are out of touch with our emotions, but when it comes to
talking, all of us are affected by our personality. I have observed two
basic personality types. The first I call the "Dead Sea." In the little
nation of Israel, the Sea of Galilee flows south by way of the Jordan
River into the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea goes nowhere. It receives but it
does not give. This personality type receives many experiences,
emotions, and thoughts throughout the day. They have a large reservoir
where they store that information, and they are perfectly happy not to
talk. If you say to a Dead Sea personality, "What's wrong? Why aren't
you talking tonight?" he will probably answer, "Nothing's wrong. What
makes you think something's wrong?" And that response is perfectly
honest. He is content not to talk. He could drive from Chicago to
Detroit and never say a word and be perfectly happy.

On the other extreme is the "Babbling Brook." For this personality,
whatever enters into the eye gate or the ear gate comes out the mouth
gate and there are seldom sixty seconds between the two. Whatever they
see, whatever they hear, they tell. In fact if no one is at home to talk
to, they will call someone else. "Do you know what I saw? Do you know
what I heard?" If they can't get someone on the telephone, they may talk
to themselves because they have no reservoir. Many times a Dead Sea
marries a Babbling Brook. That happens because when they are dating, it
is a very attractive match.

[One way to learn new patterns is to establish a daily sharing time in
which each of you will talk about three things that happened to you that
day and how you feel about them.]{.italic}

If you are a Dead Sea and you date a Babbling Brook, you will have a
wonderful evening. You don't have to think, "How will I get the
conversation started tonight? How will I keep the conversation flowing?"
In fact, you don't have to think at all. All you have to do is nod your
head and say, "Uh-huh," and she will fill up the whole evening and you
will go home saying, "What a wonderful person." On the other hand, if
you are a Babbling Brook and you date a Dead Sea, you will have an
equally wonderful evening because Dead Seas are the world's best
listeners. You will babble for three hours. He will listen intently to
you, and you will go home saying, "What a wonderful person." You attract
each other. But five years after marriage, the Babbling Brook wakes up
one morning and says, "We've been married five years, and I don't know
him." The Dead Sea is saying, "I know her [too]{.italic} well. I wish
she would stop the flow and give me a break." The good news is that Dead
Seas can learn to talk and Babbling Brooks can learn to listen. We are
influenced by our personality but not controlled by it.

One way to learn new patterns is to establish a daily sharing time in
which each of you will talk about three things that happened to you that
day and how you feel about them. I call that the "Minimum Daily
Requirement" for a healthy marriage. If you will start with the daily
minimum, in a few weeks or months you may find quality conversation
flowing more freely between you.

[[Q]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[UALITY]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
A]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[CTIVITIES]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

In addition to the basic love language of quality time, or giving your
spouse your undivided attention, is another dialect called quality
activities. At a recent marriage seminar, I asked couples to complete
the following sentence: "I feel most loved by my husband/ wife when
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_." Here is the response of a twenty-nine-year-old husband
who has been married for eight years: "I feel most loved by my wife when
we do things together, things I like to do and things she likes to do.
We talk more. It sorta feels like we are dating again." That is a
typical response of individuals whose primary love language is quality
time. The emphasis is on being together, doing things together, giving
each other undivided attention.

Quality activities may include anything in which one or both of you have
an interest. The emphasis is not on what you are doing but on why you
are doing it. The purpose is to experience something together, to walk
away from it feeling "He cares about me. He was willing to do something
with me that I enjoy, and he did it with a positive attitude." That is
love, and for some people it is love's loudest voice.

\

[[[T]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}racie grew up with the symphony.
Throughout her childhood, the house was filled with classical music. At
least once a year, she accompanied her parents to the symphony. Larry,
on the other hand, grew up on country and western music. He never
actually attended a concert, but the radio was always on, tuned to the
country station. The symphony he called elevator music. Had he not
married Tracie, he could have lived his life without ever attending the
symphony. Before they were married, while he was still in the obsessed
state of being in love, he went to the symphony. But even in his
euphoric emotional state, his attitude was, "You call this stuff music?"
After marriage, that was one experience he never expected to repeat.
When, however, he discovered several years later that quality time was
Tracie's primary love language and that she especially liked the dialect
of quality activities and that attending the symphony was one of those
activities, he chose to go with an enthusiastic spirit. His purpose was
clear. It was not to attend the symphony but to love Tracie and to speak
her language loudly. In time, he did come to appreciate the symphony and
even occasionally to enjoy a movement or two. He may never become a
symphony lover, but he has become proficient at loving Tracie.

\

[[[Q]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}uality activities may include such
activities as putting in a garden, visiting flea markets, shopping for
antiques, listening to music, picnicking together, taking long walks, or
washing the car together on a hot summer day. The activities are limited
only by your interest and willingness to try new experiences. The
essential ingredients in a quality activity are: (1) at least one of you
wants to do it, (2) the other is willing to do it, (3) both of you know
why you are doing it---to express love by being together.

One of the by-products of quality activities is that they provide a
memory bank from which to draw in the years ahead. Fortunate is the
couple who remembers an early morning stroll along the coast, the spring
they planted the flower garden, the time they got poison ivy chasing the
rabbit through the woods, the night they attended their first major
league baseball game together, the one and only time they went skiing
together and he broke his leg, the amusement parks, the concerts, the
cathedrals, and oh, yes, the awe of standing beneath the waterfall after
the two-mile hike. They can almost feel the mist as they remember. Those
are memories of love, especially for the person whose primary love
language is quality time.

And where do we find time for such activities, especially if both of us
have vocations outside the home? We make time just as we make time for
lunch and dinner. Why? Because it is just as essential to our marriage
as meals are to our health. Is it difficult? Does it take careful
planning? Yes. Does it mean we have to give up some individual
activities? Perhaps. Does it mean we do some things we don't
particularly enjoy? Certainly. Is it worth it? Without a doubt. What's
in it for me? The pleasure of living with a spouse who feels loved and
knowing that I have learned to speak his or her love language fluently.

A personal word of thanks to Bill and Betty Jo in Little Rock, who
taught me the value of love language number one, Words of Affirmation,
and love language number two, Quality Time. Now, it's on to Chicago and
love language number three.

[[R]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[ECEIVING]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
G]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[IFTS]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} was in Chicago when I studied
anthropology. By means of detailed ethnographies, I visited fascinating
peoples all over the world. I went to Central America and studied the
advanced cultures of the Mayans and the Aztecs. I crossed the Pacific
and studied the tribal peoples of Melanesia and Polynesia. I studied the
Eskimos of the northern tundra and the aboriginal Ainus of Japan. I
examined the cultural patterns surrounding love and marriage and found
that in every culture I studied, gift giving was a part of the
love-marriage process.

Anthropologists are enamored by cultural patterns that tend to pervade
cultures, and so was I. Could it be that gift giving is a fundamental
expression of love that transcends cultural barriers? Is the attitude of
love always accompanied by the concept of giving? Those are academic and
somewhat philosophical questions, but if the answer is yes, it has
profound practical implications for North American couples.

I took an anthropology field trip to the island of Dominica. Our purpose
was to study the culture of the Carib Indians, and on the trip I met
Fred. Fred was not a Carib but a young black man of twenty-eight years.
Fred had lost a hand in a fishing-by-dynamite accident. Since the
accident, he could not continue his fishing career. He had plenty of
available time, and I welcomed his companionship. We spent hours
together talking about his culture.

Upon my first visit to Fred's house, he said to me, "Mr. Gary, would you
like to have some juice?" to which I responded enthusiastically. He
turned to his younger brother and said, "Go get Mr. Gary some juice."
His brother turned, walked down the dirt path, climbed a coconut tree,
and returned with a green coconut. "Open it," Fred commanded. With three
swift movements of the machete, his brother uncorked the coconut,
leaving a triangular hole at the top. Fred handed me the coconut and
said, "Juice for you." It was green, but I drank it---all of
it---because I knew it was a gift of love. I was his friend, and to
friends you give juice.

At the end of our weeks together as I prepared to leave that small
island, Fred gave me a final token of his love. It was a crooked stick
fourteen inches in length which he had taken from the ocean. It was
silky smooth from pounding upon the rocks. Fred said that the stick had
lived on the shores of Dominica for a long time, and he wanted me to
have it as a reminder of the beautiful island. Even today when I look at
that stick, I can almost hear the sound of the Caribbean waves, but it
is not as much a reminder of Dominica as it is a reminder of love.

\

[[[A]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} gift is something you can hold in
your hand and say, "Look, he was thinking of me," or, "She remembered
me." You must be thinking of someone to give him a gift. The gift itself
is a symbol of that thought. It doesn't matter whether it costs money.
What is important is that you thought of him. And it is not the thought
implanted only in the mind that counts, but the thought expressed in
actually securing the gift and giving it as the expression of love.

Mothers remember the days their children bring a flower from the yard as
a gift. They feel loved, even if it was a flower they didn't want
picked. From early years, children are inclined to give gifts to their
parents, which may be another indication that gift giving is fundamental
to love.

Gifts are visual symbols of love. Most wedding ceremonies include the
giving and receiving of rings. The person performing the ceremony says,
"These rings are outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual
bond that unites your two hearts in love that has no end." That is not
meaningless rhetoric. It is verbalizing a significant truth---symbols
have emotional value. Perhaps that is even more graphically displayed
near the end of a disintegrating marriage when the husband or wife stops
wearing the wedding ring. It is a visual sign that the marriage is in
serious trouble. One husband said, "When she threw her wedding rings at
me and angrily walked out of the house slamming the door behind her, I
knew our marriage was in serious trouble. I didn't pick up her rings for
two days. When I finally did, I cried uncontrollably." The rings were a
symbol of what should have been, but lying in his hand and not on her
finger, they were visual reminders that the marriage was falling apart.
The lonely rings stirred deep emotions within the husband.

Visual symbols of love are more important to some people than to others.
That's why individuals have different attitudes toward wedding rings.
Some never take the ring off after the wedding. Others don't even wear a
wedding band. That is another sign that people have different primary
love languages. If receiving gifts is my primary love language, I will
place great value on the ring you have given me and I will wear it with
great pride. I will also be greatly moved emotionally by other gifts
that you give through the years. I will see them as expressions of love.
Without gifts as visual symbols, I may question your love.

Gifts come in all sizes, colors, and shapes. Some are expensive, and
others are free. To the individual whose primary love language is
receiving gifts, the cost of the gift will matter little, unless it is
greatly out of line with what you can afford. If a millionaire gives
only one-dollar gifts regularly, the spouse may question whether that is
an expression of love, but when family finances are limited, a
one-dollar gift may speak a million dollars worth of love.

[If your spouse's primary love language is receiving gifts, you can
become a proficient gift giver. In fact, it is one of the easiest love
languages to learn.]{.italic}

Gifts may be purchased, found, or made. The husband who stops along the
roadside and picks his wife a wildflower has found himself an expression
of love, unless, of course, his wife is allergic to wildflowers. For the
man who can afford it, you can purchase a beautiful card for less than
five dollars. For the man who cannot, you can make one for free. Get the
paper out of the trash can where you work, fold it in the middle, take
scissors and cut out a heart, write "I love you," and sign your name.
Gifts need not be expensive.

But what of the person who says, "I'm not a gift giver. I didn't receive
many gifts growing up. I never learned how to select gifts. It doesn't
come naturally for me." Congratulations, you have just made the first
discovery in becoming a great lover. You and your spouse speak different
love languages. Now that you have made that discovery, get on with the
business of learning your second language. If your spouse's primary love
language is receiving gifts, you can become a proficient gift giver. In
fact, it is one of the easiest love languages to learn.

Where do you begin? Make a list of all the gifts your spouse has
expressed excitement about receiving through the years. They may be
gifts you have given or gifts given by other family members or friends.
The list will give you an idea of the kind of gifts your spouse would
enjoy receiving. If you have little or no knowledge about selecting the
kinds of gifts on your list, recruit the help of family members who know
your spouse. In the meantime, select gifts that you feel comfortable
purchasing, making, or finding, and give them to your spouse. Don't wait
for a special occasion. If receiving gifts is his/her primary love
language, almost anything you give will be received as an expression of
love. (If she has been critical of your gifts in the past and almost
nothing you have given has been acceptable, then receiving gifts is
almost certainly not her primary love language.)

If you are to become an effective gift giver, you may have to change
your attitude about money. Each of us has an individualized perception
of the purposes of money, and we have various emotions associated with
spending it. Some of us have a spending orientation. We feel good about
ourselves when we are spending money. Others have a saving and investing
perspective. We feel good about ourselves when we are saving money and
investing it wisely.

If you are a spender, you will have little difficulty purchasing gifts
for your spouse; but if you are a saver, you will experience emotional
resistance to the idea of spending money as an expression of love. You
don't purchase things for yourself. Why should you purchase things for
your spouse? But that attitude fails to recognize that you are
purchasing things for yourself. By saving and investing money you are
purchasing self-worth and emotional security. You are caring for your
own emotional needs in the way you handle money. What you are not doing
is meeting the emotional needs of your spouse. If you discover that your
spouse's primary love language is receiving gifts, then perhaps you will
understand that purchasing gifts for him or her is the best investment
you can make. You are investing in your relationship and filling your
spouse's emotional love tank, and with a full love tank, he or she will
likely reciprocate emotional love to you in a language you will
understand. When both persons' emotional needs are met, your marriage
will take on a whole new dimension. Don't worry about your savings. You
will always be a saver, but to invest in loving your spouse is to invest
in blue-chip stocks.

There is an intangible gift that sometimes speaks more loudly than a
gift that can be held in one's hand. I call it the gift of self or the
gift of presence. Being there when your spouse needs you speaks loudly
to the one whose primary love language is receiving gifts. Jan once said
to me, "My husband, Don, loves softball more than he loves me."

"Why do you say that?" I inquired.

"On the day our baby was born, he played softball. I was lying in the
hospital all afternoon while he played softball," she said.

"Was he there when the baby was born?"

"Oh, yes. He stayed long enough for the baby to be born, but ten minutes
afterward, he left to play softball. I was devastated. It was such an
important moment in our lives. I wanted us to share it together. I
wanted him to be there with me. Don deserted me to play."

That husband may have sent her a dozen roses, but they would not have
spoken as loudly as his presence in the hospital room beside her. I
could tell that Jan was deeply hurt by that experience. The "baby" was
now fifteen years old, and she was talking about the event with all the
emotion as though it had happened yesterday. I probed further. "Have you
based your conclusion that Don loves softball more than he loves you on
this one experience?"

"Oh, no," she said. "On the day of my mother's funeral, he also played
softball."

"Did he go to the funeral?"

"Oh, yes. He went to the funeral, but as soon as it was over, he left to
play softball. I couldn't believe it. My brothers and sisters came to
the house with me, but my husband was playing softball."

Later, I asked Don about those two events. He knew exactly what I was
talking about. "I knew she would bring that up," he said. "I was there
through all the labor and when the baby was born. I took pictures; I was
so happy. I couldn't wait to tell the guys on the team, but my bubble
was burst when I got back to the hospital that evening. She was furious
with me. I couldn't believe what she was saying. I thought she would be
proud of me for telling the team.

[Physical presence in the time of crisis is the most powerful gift you
can give if your spouse's primary love language is receiving
gifts.]{.italic}

"And when her mother died? She probably did not tell you that I took off
work a week before she died and spent the whole week at the hospital and
at her mother's house doing repairs and helping out. After she died and
the funeral was over, I felt I had done all I could do. I needed a
breather. I like to play softball, and I knew that would help me relax
and relieve some of the stress I'd been under. I thought she would want
me to take a break.

"I had done what I thought was important to her, but it wasn't enough.
She has never let me forget those two days. She says that I love
softball more than I love her. That's ridiculous."

He was a sincere husband who failed to understand the tremendous power
of presence. His being there for his wife was more important than
anything else in her mind. Physical presence in the time of crisis is
the most powerful gift you can give if your spouse's primary love
language is receiving gifts. Your body becomes the symbol of your love.
Remove the symbol, and the sense of love evaporates. In counseling, Don
and Jan worked through the hurts and misunderstandings of the past.
Eventually, Jan was able to forgive him, and Don came to understand why
his presence was so important to her.

\

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}f the physical presence of your spouse
is important to you, I urge you to verbalize that to your spouse. Don't
expect him to read your mind. If, on the other hand, your spouse says to
you, "I really want you to be there with me tonight, tomorrow, this
afternoon," take his request seriously. From your perspective, it may
not be important; but if you are not responsive to that request, you may
be communicating a message you do not intend. A husband once said, "When
my mother died, my wife's supervisor said that she could be off two
hours for the funeral but she needed to be back in the office for the
afternoon. My wife told him that she felt her husband needed her support
that day and she would have to be away the entire day.

"The supervisor replied, 'If you are gone all day, you may well lose
your job.'

"My wife said, 'My husband is more important than my job.' She spent the
day with me. Somehow that day, I felt more loved by her than ever
before. I have never forgotten what she did. Incidentally," he said,
"she didn't lose her job. Her supervisor soon left, and she was asked to
take his job." That wife had spoken the love language of her husband,
and he never forgot it.

\

[[[A]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}lmost everything ever written on the
subject of love indicates that at the heart of love is the spirit of
giving. All five love languages challenge us to give to our spouse, but
for some, receiving gifts, visible symbols of love, speaks the loudest.
I heard the most graphic illustration of that truth in Chicago, where I
met Jim and Janice.

They attended my marriage seminar and agreed to take me to O'Hare
Airport after the seminar on Saturday afternoon. We had two or three
hours before my flight, and they asked if I would like to stop at a
restaurant. I was famished, so I readily agreed. That afternoon,
however, I got much more than a free meal.

Jim and Janice both grew up on farms in central Illinois not more than a
hundred miles from each other. They moved to Chicago shortly after their
wedding. I was hearing their story fifteen years and three children
later. Janice began talking almost immediately after we sat down. She
said, "Dr. Chapman, the reason we wanted to take you to the airport is
so that we could tell you about our miracle." Something about the word
[miracle]{.italic} always causes me to brace myself, especially if I
don't know the person who is using it. [What bizarre story am I going to
hear?]{.italic} I wondered, but I kept my thoughts to myself and gave
Janice my undivided attention. I was about to be shocked.

She said, "Dr. Chapman, God used you to perform a miracle in our
marriage." I felt guilty already. A moment ago, I was questioning her
use of the term [miracle,]{.italic} and now in her mind I was the
vehicle of a miracle. Now I was listening even more intently. Janice
continued, "Three years ago, we attended your marriage seminar here in
Chicago for the first time. I was desperate," she said. "I was thinking
seriously of leaving Jim and had told him so. Our marriage had been
empty for a long time. I had given up. For years, I had complained to
Jim that I needed his love, but he never responded. I loved the
children, and I knew they loved me, but I felt nothing coming from Jim.
In fact, by that time, I hated him. He was a methodical person. He did
everything by routine. He was as predictable as a clock, and no one
could break into his routine.

"For years," she continued, "I tried to be a good wife. I cooked, I
washed, I ironed, I cooked, I washed, I ironed. I did all the things I
thought a good wife should do. I had sex with him because I knew that
was important to him, but I felt no love coming from him. I felt like he
stopped dating me after we got married and simply took me for granted. I
felt used and unappreciated.

"When I talked to Jim about my feelings, he'd laugh at me and say we had
as good a marriage as anybody else in the community. He didn't
understand why I was so unhappy. He would remind me that the bills were
paid, that we had a nice house and a new car, that I was free to work or
not work outside the home, and that I should be happy instead of
complaining all the time. He didn't even try to understand my feelings.
I felt totally rejected.

"Well, anyway," she said as she moved her tea and leaned forward, "we
came to your seminar three years ago. We had never been to a marriage
seminar before. I did not know what to expect, and frankly I didn't
expect much. I didn't think anybody could change Jim. During and after
the seminar, Jim didn't say too much. He seemed to like it. He said that
you were funny, but he didn't talk with me about any of the ideas in the
seminar. I didn't expect him to, and I didn't ask him to. As I said, I
had already given up by then.

"As you know," she said, "the seminar ended on Saturday afternoon.
Saturday night and Sunday were pretty much as usual, but Monday
afternoon, he came home from work and gave me a rose. 'Where did you get
that?' I asked. 'I bought it from a street vendor,' he said. 'I thought
you deserved a rose.' I started crying. 'Oh, Jim, that is so sweet of
you.'

"In my mind," she said, "I knew he bought the rose from a Moonie. I had
seen the young man selling roses that afternoon, but it didn't matter.
The fact was, he had brought me a rose. On Tuesday he called me from the
office at about one-thirty and asked me what I thought about his buying
a pizza and bringing it home for dinner. He said he thought I might
enjoy a break from cooking dinner. I told him I thought the idea was
wonderful, and so he brought home a pizza and we had a fun time
together. The children loved the pizza and thanked their father for
bringing it. I actually gave him a hug and told him how much I enjoyed
it.

"When he came home on Wednesday, he brought each of the children a box
of Cracker Jacks, and he had a small potted plant for me. He said he
knew the rose would die, and he thought I might like something that
would be around for a while. I was beginning to think I was
hallucinating! I couldn't believe what Jim was doing or why he was doing
it. Thursday night after dinner, he handed me a card with a message
about his not always being able to express his love to me but hoping
that the card would communicate how much he cared. Again I cried, looked
up at him, and could not resist hugging and kissing him. 'Why don't we
get a baby-sitter on Saturday night and the two of us go out for
dinner?' he suggested. 'That would be wonderful,' I said. On Friday
afternoon, he stopped by the cookie shop and bought each of us one of
our favorite cookies. Again, he kept it as a surprise, telling us only
that he had a treat for dessert.

"By Saturday night," she said, "I was in orbit. I had no idea what had
come over Jim, or if it would last, but I was enjoying every minute of
it. After our dinner at the restaurant, I said to him, 'Jim, you have to
tell me what's happening. I don't understand.'"

She looked at me intently and said, "Dr. Chapman, you have to
understand. This man had never given me a flower since the day we got
married. He never gave me a card for any occasion. He always said, 'It's
a waste of money; you look at the card and throw it away.' We'd been out
to dinner one time in five years. He never bought the children anything
and expected me to buy only the essentials. He had never brought a pizza
home for dinner. He expected me to have dinner ready every night. I
mean, this was a radical change in his behavior."

I turned to Jim and asked, "What did you say to her in the restaurant
when she asked you what was going on?"

"I told her that I had listened to your lecture on love languages at the
seminar and that I realized that her love language was gifts. I also
realized that I had not given her a gift in years, maybe not since we
had been married. I remembered that when we were dating I used to bring
her flowers and other small gifts, but after marriage I figured we
couldn't afford that. I told her that I had decided that I was going to
try to get her a gift every day for one week and see if it made any
difference in her. I had to admit that I had seen a pretty big
difference in her attitude during the week.

"I told her that I realized that what you said was really true and that
learning the right love language was the key to helping another person
feel loved. I said I was sorry that I had been so dense for all those
years and had failed to meet her need for love. I told her that I really
loved her and that I appreciated all the things she did for me and the
children. I told her that with God's help, I was going to be a gift
giver for the rest of my life.

"She said, 'But, Jim, you can't go on buying me gifts every day for the
rest of your life. You can't afford that.' 'Well, maybe not every day,'
I said, 'but at least once a week. That would be fifty-two more gifts
per year than what you have received in the past five years.' I
continued, 'And who said I was going to buy all of them? I might even
make some of them, or I'll take Dr. Chapman's idea and pick a free
flower from the front yard in the spring.'"

Janice interrupted, "Dr. Chapman, I don't think he has missed a single
week in three years. He is like a new man. You wouldn't believe how
happy we have been. Our children call us lovebirds now. My tank is full
and overflowing."

I turned to Jim and asked, "But what about you, Jim? Do you feel loved
by Janice?"

"Oh, I've always felt loved by her, Dr. Chapman. She is the best
housekeeper in the world. She is an excellent cook. She keeps my clothes
washed and ironed. She is wonderful about doing things for the children.
I know she loves me." He smiled and said, "Now, you know what my love
language is, don't you?"

I did, and I also knew why Janice had used the word [miracle.]{.italic}

[[Love Language #4]{.bold}]{.italic}

[[A]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[CTS OF]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
S]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[ERVICE]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

[[[B]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}efore we leave Jim and Janice, let's
reexamine Jim's answer to my question, "Do you feel loved by Janice?"

"Oh, I've always felt loved by her, Dr. Chapman. She is the best
housekeeper in the world. She is an excellent cook. She keeps my clothes
washed and ironed. She is wonderful about doing things with the
children. I know she loves me."

Jim's primary love language was what I call "acts of service." By acts
of service, I mean doing things you know your spouse would like you to
do. You seek to please her by serving her, to express your love for her
by doing things for her.

Such actions as cooking a meal, setting a table, washing dishes,
vacuuming, cleaning a commode, getting hairs out of the sink, removing
the white spots from the mirror, getting bugs off the windshield, taking
out the garbage, changing the baby's diaper, painting a bedroom, dusting
the bookcase, keeping the car in operating condition, washing or
vacuuming the car, cleaning the garage, mowing the grass, trimming the
shrubs, raking the leaves, dusting the blinds, walking the dog, changing
the cat's litter box, and changing water in the goldfish bowl are all
acts of service. They require thought, planning, time, effort, and
energy. If done with a positive spirit, they are indeed expressions of
love.

Jesus Christ gave a simple but profound illustration of expressing love
by an act of service when He washed the feet of His disciples. In a
culture where people wore sandals and walked on dirt streets, it was
customary for the servant of the household to wash the feet of guests as
they arrived. Jesus, who had instructed His disciples to love one
another, gave them an example of how to express that love when He took a
basin and a towel and proceeded to wash their feet.^1^ After that simple
expression of love, He encouraged His disciples to follow His example.

Earlier in His life, Jesus had indicated that in His kingdom those who
would be great would be servants. In most societies, those who are great
lord it over those who are small, but Jesus Christ said that those who
are great would serve others. The apostle Paul summarized that
philosophy when he said, "Serve one another in love."^2^

\

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} discovered the impact of "acts of
service" in the little village of China Grove, North Carolina. China
Grove sits in central North Carolina, originally nestled in chinaberry
trees, not far from Andy Griffith's legendary Mayberry, and an hour and
a half from Mount Pilot. At the time of this story, China Grove was a
textile town with a population of 1,500. I had been away for more than
ten years, studying anthropology, psychology, and theology. I was making
my semiannual visit to keep in touch with my roots.

Almost everyone I knew except Dr. Shin and Dr. Smith worked in the mill.
Dr. Shin was the medical doctor, and Dr. Smith was the dentist. And of
course, there was Preacher Blackburn, who was pastor of the church. For
most couples in China Grove, life centered on work and church. The
conversation at the mill focused on the superintendent's latest decision
and how it affected their job in particular. The services at church
focused mainly on the anticipated joys of heaven. In that pristine
American setting, I discovered love language number four.

I was standing under a chinaberry tree after church on Sunday when Mark
and Mary approached me. I didn't recognize either of them. I assumed
they had grown up while I was away. Introducing himself, Mark said, "I
understand you have been studying counseling."

I smiled and said, "Well, a little bit."

"I have a question," he said. "Can a couple make it in marriage if they
disagree on everything?"

It was one of those theoretical questions that I knew had a personal
root. I brushed aside the theoretical nature of his question and asked
him a personal question. "How long have you been married?"

"Two years," he responded. "And we don't agree on anything."

"Give me some examples," I continued.

"Well, for one thing, Mary doesn't like me to go hunting. I work all
week in the mill, and I like to go hunting on Saturdays---not every
Saturday but when hunting season is in."

Mary had been silent until this point when she interjected. "When
hunting season is out, he goes fishing, and besides that, he doesn't
hunt just on Saturdays. He takes off from work to go hunting."

"Once or twice a year I take off two or three days from work to go
hunting in the mountains with some buddies. I don't think there is
anything wrong with that."

"What else do you disagree on?" I asked.

"Well, she wants me to go to church all the time. I don't mind going on
Sunday morning, but Sunday night I like to rest. It's all right if she
wants to go, but I don't think I ought to have to go."

Again, Mary spoke up. "You don't really want me to go either," she said.
"You fuss every time I walk out the door."

I knew that things weren't supposed to be getting this hot under a shady
tree in front of a church. As a young, aspiring counselor, I feared that
I was getting in over my head, but having been trained to ask questions
and listen, I continued. "What other things do you disagree on?"

This time Mary answered. "He wants me to stay home all day and work in
the house," she said. "He gets mad if I go see my mother or go shopping
or something."

"I don't mind her going to see her mother," he said, "but when I come
home, I like to see the house cleaned up. Some weeks, she doesn't make
the bed up for three or four days, and half the time, she hasn't even
started supper. I work hard, and I like to eat when I get home. Besides
that, the house is a wreck," he continued. "The baby's things are all
over the floor, the baby is dirty, and I don't like filth. She seems to
be happy to live in a pigpen. We don't have very much, and we live in a
small mill house, but at least it could be clean."

"What's wrong with his helping me around the house?" Mary asked. "He
acts like a husband shouldn't do anything around the house. All he wants
to do is work and hunt. He expects me to do everything. He even expects
me to wash the car."

Thinking that I had better start looking for solutions rather than
prying for more disagreements, I looked at Mark and asked, "Mark, when
you were dating, before you got married, did you go hunting every
Saturday?"

"Most Saturdays," he said, "but I always got home in time to go see her
on Saturday night. Most of the time, I'd get home in time to wash my
truck before I went to see her. I didn't like to go see her with a dirty
truck."

"Mary, how old were you when you got married?" I asked.

"I was eighteen," she said. "We got married right after I finished high
school. Mark graduated a year before me, and he was working."

"During your senior year in high school, how often did Mark come to see
you?" I inquired.

"He came almost every night," she said. "In fact, he came in the
afternoon and would often stay and have supper with my family. He would
help me do my chores around the house and then we'd sit and talk until
supper time."

"Mark, what did the two of you do after supper?" I asked.

Mark looked up with a sheepish smile and said, "Well, the regular dating
stuff, you know."

"But if I had a school project," Mary said, "he'd help me with it.
Sometimes we worked hours on school projects. I was in charge of the
Christmas float for the senior class. He helped me for three weeks every
afternoon. He was great."

I switched gears and focused on the third area of their disagreement.
"Mark, when you were dating, did you go to church with Mary on Sunday
nights?"

"Yes, I did," he said. "If I didn't go to church with her, I couldn't
see her that night. Her father was strict that way."

"He never complained about it," Mary said. "In fact, he seemed to enjoy
it. He even helped us with the Christmas program. After we finished the
Christmas float project, we started working on the set for the Christmas
program at the church. We spent about two weeks working together on
that. He is really talented when it comes to painting and building
sets."

I thought I was beginning to see some light, but I wasn't sure Mark and
Mary were seeing it. I turned to Mary and asked, "When you were dating
Mark, what convinced you that he really loved you? What made him
different from other guys you had dated?"

"It was the way he helped me with everything," she said. "He was so
eager to help me. None of the other guys ever expressed any interest in
those things, but it seemed natural for Mark. He even helped me wash
dishes when he had supper at our house. He was the most wonderful person
I had ever met, but after we got married that changed. He didn't help me
at all."

Turning to Mark I asked, "Why do you think you did all those things for
and with her before you were married?"

"It just seemed natural for me," he said. "It's what I would want
someone to do for me if she cared about me."

"And why do you think you stopped helping her after you got married?" I
asked.

"Well, I guess I expected it to be like my family. Dad worked, and Mom
took care of things at the house. I never saw my dad vacuum the floor or
wash the dishes or do anything around the house. Since Mom didn't work
outside the house, she kept everything spotless, did all the cooking,
washing, and ironing. And I guess I just thought that was the way it was
supposed to be."

Hoping that Mark was seeing what I was seeing, I asked, "Mark, a moment
ago what did you hear Mary say when I asked her what really made her
feel loved by you when you were dating?"

He responded, "Helping her with things and doing things with her."

[Requests give direction to love, but demands stop the flow of
love.]{.italic}

"So, can you understand," I continued, "how she could feel unloved when
you stopped helping her with things?" His head was bobbing up and down.
I continued. "It was a normal thing for you to follow the model of your
mother and father in marriage. Almost all of us tend to do that, but
your behavior toward Mary was a radical change from your courtship. The
one thing that had assured her of your love disappeared."

Then I turned to Mary and asked, "What did you hear Mark say when I
asked, 'Why did you do all of those things to help Mary when you were
dating?'"

"He said that it came naturally to him," she replied.

"That's right," I said, "and he also said that is what he would want
someone to do for him if she loved him. He was doing those things for
you and with you because in his mind that's the way anyone shows love.
Once you were married and living in your own house, he had expectations
of what you would do if you loved him. You would keep the house clean,
you would cook, and so on. In brief, you would do things for him to
express your love. When he did not see you doing those things, do you
understand why he would feel unloved?" Mary's head was also bobbing now.
I continued, "My guess is that the reason you are both so unhappy in
your marriage is that neither of you is showing your love by doing
things for each other."

Mary said, "I think you are right, and the reason I stopped doing things
for him is because I resented his demanding spirit. It was as if he were
trying to make me be like his mother."

"You are right," I said, "and no one likes to be forced to do anything.
In fact, love is always freely given. Love cannot be demanded. We can
request things of each other, but we must never demand anything.
Requests give direction to love, but demands stop the flow of love."

Mark broke in and said, "She's right, Dr. Chapman. I was demanding and
critical of her because I was disappointed in her as a wife. I know I
said some cruel things, and I understand how she could be upset with
me."

"I think things can be turned around rather easily at this juncture," I
said. I pulled two note cards out of my pocket. "Let's try something. I
want each of you to sit on the steps of the church and make a request
list. Mark, I want you to list three or four things that if Mary chose
to do them would make you feel loved when you walk into the house in the
afternoon. If making the bed is important to you, then put it down.
Mary, I want you to make a list of three or four things that you would
really like to have Mark's help in doing, things which, if he chose to
do them, would help you know that he loved you." (I'm big on lists; they
force us to think concretely.)

After five to six minutes, they handed me their lists. Mark's list read:

- Make up the beds every day.
- Have the baby's face washed when I get home.
- Put her shoes in the closet before I get home.
- Try to have supper at least started before I get home so that we could
  eat within 30--45 minutes after I get home.

I read the list out loud and said to Mark, "I'm understanding you to say
that if Mary chooses to do these four things, you will view them as acts
of love toward you."

"That's right," he said, "if she did those four things, it would go a
long way in changing my attitude toward her." Then I read Mary's list:

- I wish he would wash the car every week instead of expecting me to do
  it.
- I wish he would change the baby's diaper after he gets home in the
  afternoon, especially if I am working on supper.
- I wish he would vacuum the house for me once a week.
- I wish he would mow the grass every week in the summer and not let it
  get so tall that I am ashamed of our yard.

I said, "Mary, I am understanding you to say that if Mark chooses to do
those four things, you would take his actions as genuine expressions of
love toward you."

"That's right," she said. "It would be wonderful if he would do those
things for me."

"Does this list seem reasonable to you, Mark? Is it feasible for you to
do these things?"

"Yes," he said.

"Mary, do the things on Mark's list seem reasonable and feasible to you?
Could you do them if you chose to?"

"Yes," she said, "I can do those things. In the past, I have felt
overwhelmed because no matter what I did, it was never enough."

"Mark," I said, "you understand that what I am suggesting is a change
from the model of marriage that your mother and father had."

"Oh," he said, "my father mowed the grass and washed the car."

"But he didn't change the diapers or vacuum the floor, right?"

"Right," he said.

"You don't have to do these, you understand? If you do them, however, it
will be an act of love to Mary."

[What we do for each other before marriage is no indication of what we
will do after marriage.]{.italic}

And to Mary I said, "You understand that you don't have to do these
things, but if you want to express love for Mark, here are four ways
that will be meaningful to him. I want to suggest that you try these for
two months and see if they help. At the end of two months, you may want
to add additional requests to your lists and share them with each other.
I would not add more than one request per month, however."

"This really makes sense," Mary said. "I think you have helped us," Mark
said. They took each other by the hand and walked toward their car. I
said to myself out loud, "I think this is what church is all about. I
think I am going to enjoy being a counselor." I have never forgotten the
insight I gained under that chinaberry tree.

\

[[[A]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}fter years of research, I have
realized what a unique situation Mark and Mary presented me. Seldom do I
meet a couple who both have the same love language. For both Mark and
Mary, "acts of service" was their primary love language. Hundreds of
individuals can identify with either Mark or Mary and acknowledge that
the primary way that they feel loved is by acts of service on the part
of their spouse. Putting away shoes, changing a baby's diaper, washing
dishes or a car, vacuuming, or mowing speaks volumes to the individual
whose primary love language is acts of service.

You may be wondering, [If Mark and Mary had the same primary love
language, why were they having so much difficulty?]{.italic} The answer
lies in the fact that they were speaking different dialects. They were
doing things for each other but not the most important things. When they
were forced to think concretely, they easily identified their specific
dialects. For Mary it was washing the car, changing the baby's diaper,
vacuuming the floor, and mowing the grass, whereas for Mark it was
making up the bed, washing the baby's face, putting the shoes in the
closet, and having supper underway when he got home from work. When they
started speaking the right dialects, their love tanks began to fill.
Since acts of service was their primary love language, learning each
other's specific dialect was relatively easy for them.

Before we leave Mark and Mary, I would like to make three other
observations. First, they illustrate clearly that what we do for each
other before marriage is no indication of what we will do after
marriage. Before marriage, we are carried along by the force of the
in-love obsession. After marriage, we revert to being the people we were
before we "fell in love." Our actions are influenced by the model of our
parents, our own personality, our perceptions of love, our emotions,
needs, and desires. Only one thing is certain about our behavior: It
will not be the same behavior we exhibited when we were caught up in
being "in love."

That leads me to the second truth illustrated by Mark and Mary. Love is
a choice and cannot be coerced. Mark and Mary were criticizing each
other's behavior and getting nowhere. Once they decided to make requests
of each other rather than demands, their marriage began to turn around.
Criticism and demands tend to drive wedges. With enough criticism, you
may get acquiescence from your spouse. He may do what you want, but
probably it will not be an expression of love. You can give guidance to
love by making requests: "I wish you would wash the car, change the
baby's diaper, mow the grass," but you cannot create the will to love.
Each of us must decide daily to love or not to love our spouses. If we
choose to love, then expressing it in the way in which our spouse
requests will make our love most effective emotionally.

There is a third truth, which only the mature lover will be able to
hear. My spouse's criticisms about my behavior provide me with the
clearest clue to her primary love language. People tend to criticize
their spouse most loudly in the area where they themselves have the
deepest emotional need. Their criticism is an ineffective way of
pleading for love. If we understand that, it may help us process their
criticism in a more productive manner. A wife may say to her husband
after he gives her a criticism, "It sounds like that is extremely
important to you. Could you explain why it is so crucial?" Criticism
often needs clarification. Initiating such a conversation may eventually
turn the criticism into a request rather than a demand. Mary's constant
condemnation of Mark's hunting was not an expression of her hatred for
the sport of hunting. She blamed hunting as the thing that kept him from
washing the car, vacuuming the house, and mowing the grass. When he
learned to meet her need for love by speaking her emotional love
language, she became free to support him in his hunting.

[[D]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[OORMAT OR]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
L]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[OVER?]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

"I have served him for twenty years. I have waited on him hand and foot.
I have been his doormat while he ignored me, mistreated me, and
humiliated me in front of my friends and family. I don't hate him. I
wish him no ill, but I resent him, and I no longer wish to live with
him." That wife has performed acts of service for twenty years, but they
have not been expressions of love. They were done out of fear, guilt,
and resentment.

[Due to the sociological changes of the past thirty years, there is no
longer a common stereotype of the male and female role in American
society.]{.italic}

A doormat is an inanimate object. You can wipe your feet on it, step on
it, kick it around, or whatever you like. It has no will of its own. It
can be your servant but not your lover. When we treat our spouses as
objects, we preclude the possibility of love. Manipulation by guilt ("If
you were a good spouse, you would do this for me") is not the language
of love. Coercion by fear ("You will do this or you will be sorry") is
alien to love. No person should ever be a doormat. We may allow
ourselves to be used, but we are in fact creatures of emotion, thoughts,
and desires. And we have the ability to make decisions and take action.
Allowing oneself to be used or manipulated by another is not an act of
love. It is, in fact, an act of treason. You are allowing him or her to
develop inhumane habits. Love says, "I love you too much to let you
treat me this way. It is not good for you or me."

[[O]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[VERCOMING]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
S]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[TEREOTYPES]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

Learning the love language of acts of service will require some of us to
reexamine our stereotypes of the roles of husbands and wives. Mark was
doing what most of us do naturally. He was following the role model of
his father and mother, but he wasn't even doing that well. His father
washed the car and mowed the grass. Mark did not, but that was the
mental image he had of what a husband should do. He definitely did not
picture himself vacuuming floors and changing the baby's diapers. To his
credit, he was willing to break from his stereotype when he realized how
important it was to Mary. That is necessary for all of us if our
spouse's primary love language asks something of us that seems
inappropriate to our role.

Due to the sociological changes of the past thirty years, there is no
longer a common stereotype of the male and female role in American
society. Yet that does not mean that all stereotypes have been removed.
It means rather that the number of stereotypes has been multiplied.
Before the days of television, a person's idea of what a husband or wife
should do and how he or she should relate was influenced primarily by
one's own parents. With the pervasiveness of television and the
proliferation of single-parent families, however, role models are often
influenced by forces outside the home. Whatever your perceptions,
chances are your spouse perceives marital roles somewhat differently
than you do. A willingness to examine and change stereotypes is
necessary in order to express love more effectively. Remember, there are
no rewards for maintaining stereotypes, but there are tremendous
benefits to meeting the emotional needs of your spouse.

\

[[[R]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ecently a wife said to me, "Dr.
Chapman, I am going to send all of my friends to your seminar."

"And why would you do that?" I inquired.

"Because it has radically changed our marriage," she said. "Before the
seminar, Bob never helped me with anything. We both started our careers
right after college, but it was always my role to do everything at the
house. It was as if it never crossed his mind to help me with anything.
After the seminar, he started asking me, 'What can I do to help you this
evening?' It was amazing. At first, I couldn't believe it was real, but
it has persisted for three years now.

"I'll have to admit, there were some trying and humorous times in those
early weeks because he didn't know how to do anything. The first time he
did the laundry, he used undiluted bleach instead of regular detergent.
Our blue towels came out with white polka dots. Then there was the first
time he used the garbage disposal. It sounded strange, and shortly
afterward soap bubbles started emerging from the drain of the adjoining
sink. He didn't know what was happening until I turned the garbage
disposal off, reached my hand inside, and retrieved the remains of a new
bar of soap, now the size of a quarter. But he was loving me in my
language, and my tank was filling up. Now he knows how to do everything
around the house and is always helping me. We have much more time
together because I don't have to work all the time. Believe me, I have
learned his language, and I keep his tank full."

Is it really that simple?

Simple? Yes. Easy? No. Bob had to work hard at tearing down the
stereotype with which he had lived for thirty-five years. It didn't come
easily, but he would tell you that learning the primary love language of
your spouse and choosing to speak it makes a tremendous difference in
the emotional climate of a marriage. Now, let's move on to love language
number five.

[[Love Language #5]{.bold}]{.italic}

[[P]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[HYSICAL]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
T]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[OUCH]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

[[[W]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}e have long known that physical touch
is a way of communicating emotional love. Numerous research projects in
the area of child development have made that conclusion: Babies who are
held, hugged, and kissed develop a healthier emotional life than those
who are left for long periods of time without physical contact. The
importance of touching children is not a modern idea. In the first
century, the Hebrews living in Palestine, recognizing Jesus as a great
teacher, brought their children to Him "to have him touch them."^1^ You
may remember that Jesus' disciples rebuked those parents, thinking that
Jesus was too busy for such frivolous activity. But the Scriptures say
that Jesus was indignant with the disciples and said, "'Let the little
children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God
belongs to such as these. I tell you the truth, anyone who will not
receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.' And
he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed
them."^2^ Wise parents, in any culture, are touching parents.

Physical touch is also a powerful vehicle for communicating marital
love. Holding hands, kissing, embracing, and sexual intercourse are all
ways of communicating emotional love to one's spouse. For some
individuals, physical touch is their primary love language. Without it,
they feel unloved. With it, their emotional tank is filled, and they
feel secure in the love of their spouse.

The old-timers used to say, "The way to a man's heart is through his
stomach." Many a man has been "fattened for the kill" by women who have
believed this philosophy. The old-timers, of course, were not thinking
of the physical heart but of man's romantic center. It would be more
accurate to say, "The way to some men's hearts is through their
stomachs." I remember the husband who said, "Dr. Chapman, my wife is a
gourmet cook. She spends hours in the kitchen. She makes these elaborate
meals. Me? I'm a meat and potatoes man. I tell her she is wasting her
time. I like simple food. She gets hurt and says I don't appreciate her.
I do appreciate her. I just wish she would make it easy on herself and
not spend so much time with the elaborate meals. Then we would have more
time together, and she would have the energy to do some other things."
Obviously, "other things" were closer to his heart than fancy foods.

That man's wife was a frustrated lover. In the family in which she grew
up, her mother was an excellent cook and her father appreciated her
efforts. She remembers hearing her father say to her mother, "When I sit
down to meals like this, it's so easy for me to love you." Her father
was a wellspring of positive comments to her mother about her cooking.
In private and in public, he praised her culinary skills. That daughter
learned well from her mother's model. The problem is that she is not
married to her father. Her husband has a different love language.

In my conversation with this husband, it didn't take long to discover
that "other things" to him meant sex. When his wife was sexually
responsive, he felt secure in her love. But when, for whatever reason,
she withdrew from him sexually, all of her culinary skills could not
convince him that she really loved him. He did not object to the fancy
meals, but in his heart they could never substitute for what he
considered to be "love."

\

[[[S]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}exual intercourse, however, is only
one dialect in the love language of physical touch. Of the five senses,
touching, unlike the other four, is not limited to one localized area of
the body. Tiny tactile receptors are located throughout the body. When
those receptors are touched or pressed, nerves carry impulses to the
brain. The brain interprets these impulses and we perceive that the
thing that touched us is warm or cold, hard or soft. It causes pain or
pleasure. We may also interpret it as loving or hostile.

[Physical touch can make or break a relationship. It can communicate
hate or love.]{.italic}

Some parts of the body are more sensitive than others. The difference is
due to the fact that the tiny tactile receptors are not scattered evenly
over the body but arranged in clusters. Thus, the tip of the tongue is
highly sensitive to touch whereas the back of the shoulders is the least
sensitive. The tips of the fingers and the tip of the nose are other
extremely sensitive areas. Our purpose, however, is not to understand
the neurological basis of the sense of touch but rather its
psychological importance.

Physical touch can make or break a relationship. It can communicate hate
or love. To the person whose primary love language is physical touch,
the message will be far louder than the words "I hate you" or "I love
you." A slap in the face is detrimental to any child, but it is
devastating to a child whose primary love language is touch. A tender
hug communicates love to any child, but it shouts love to the child
whose primary love language is physical touch. The same is true of
adults.

In marriage, the touch of love may take many forms. Since touch
receptors are located throughout the body, lovingly touching your spouse
almost anywhere can be an expression of love. That does not mean that
all touches are created equal. Some will bring more pleasure to your
spouse than others. Your best instructor is your spouse, of course.
After all, she is the one you are seeking to love. She knows best what
she perceives as a loving touch. Don't insist on touching her in your
way and in your time. Learn to speak her love dialect. Your spouse may
find some touches uncomfortable or irritating. To insist on continuing
those touches is to communicate the opposite of love. It is saying that
you are not sensitive to her needs and that you care little about her
perceptions of what is pleasant. Don't make the mistake of believing
that the touch that brings pleasure to you will also bring pleasure to
her.

Love touches may be explicit and demand your full attention such as in a
back rub or sexual foreplay, culminating in intercourse. On the other
hand, love touches may be implicit and require only a moment, such as
putting your hand on his shoulder as you pour a cup of coffee or rubbing
your body against him as you pass in the kitchen. Explicit love touches
obviously take more time, not only in actual touching but in developing
your understanding of how to communicate love to your spouse this way.
If a back massage communicates love loudly to your spouse, then the
time, money, and energy you spend in learning to be a good masseur or
masseuse will be well invested. If sexual intercourse is your mate's
primary dialect, reading about and discussing the art of sexual
lovemaking will enhance your expression of love.

Implicit love touches require little time but much thought, especially
if physical touch is not your primary love language and if you did not
grow up in a "touching family." Sitting close to each other on the couch
as you watch your favorite television program requires no additional
time but may communicate your love loudly. Touching your spouse as you
walk through the room where he is sitting takes only a moment. Touching
each other when you leave the house and again when you return may
involve only a brief kiss or hug but will speak volumes to your spouse.

Once you discover that physical touch is the primary love language of
your spouse, you are limited only by your imagination on ways to express
love. Coming up with new ways and places to touch can be an exciting
challenge. If you have not been an "under-the-table toucher," you might
find that it will add a spark to your dining out. If you are not
accustomed to holding hands in public, you may find that you can fill
your spouse's emotional love tank as you stroll through the parking lot.
If you don't normally kiss as soon as you get into the car together, you
may find that it will greatly enhance your travels. Hugging your spouse
before she goes shopping may not only express love, it may bring her
home sooner. Try new touches in new places and let your spouse give you
feedback on whether he finds it pleasurable or not. Remember, he has the
final word. You are learning to speak his language.

Whatever there is of me resides in my body. To touch my body is to touch
me. To withdraw from my body is to distance yourself from me
emotionally. In our society shaking hands is a way of communicating
openness and social closeness to another individual. When on rare
occasions one man refuses to shake hands with another, it communicates a
message that things are not right in their relationship. All societies
have some form of physical touching as a means of social greeting. The
average American male may not feel comfortable with the European bear
hug and kiss, but in Europe that serves the same function as our shaking
hands.

There are appropriate and inappropriate ways to touch members of the
opposite sex in every society. The recent attention to sexual harassment
has highlighted the inappropriate ways. Within marriage, however, what
is appropriate and inappropriate touching is determined by the couple
themselves, within certain broad guidelines. Physical abuse is of course
deemed inappropriate by society, and social organizations have been
formed to help "the battered wife and the battered husband." Clearly our
bodies are for touching, but not for abuse.

[If your spouse's primary love language is physical touch, nothing is
more important than holding her as she cries.]{.italic}

This age is characterized as the age of sexual openness and freedom.
With that freedom, we have demonstrated that the open marriage where
both spouses are free to have sexual intimacies with other individuals
is fanciful. Those who do not object on moral grounds eventually object
on emotional grounds. Something about our need for intimacy and love
does not allow us to give our spouse such freedom. The emotional pain is
deep and intimacy evaporates when we are aware that our spouse is
involved with someone else sexually. Counselors' files are filled with
records of husbands and wives who are trying to grapple with the
emotional trauma of an unfaithful spouse. That trauma, however, is
compounded for the individual whose primary love language is physical
touch. That for which he longs so deeply---love expressed by physical
touch---is now being given to another. His emotional love tank is not
only empty; it has been riddled by an explosion. It will take massive
repairs for those emotional needs to be met.

Almost instinctively in a time of crisis, we hug one another. Why?
Because physical touch is a powerful communicator of love. In a time of
crisis, more than anything, we need to feel loved. We cannot always
change events, but we can survive if we feel loved.

All marriages will experience crises. The death of parents is
inevitable. Automobile accidents cripple and kill thousands each year.
Disease is no respecter of persons. Disappointments are a part of life.
The most important thing you can do for your mate in a time of crisis is
to love him or her. If your spouse's primary love language is physical
touch, nothing is more important than holding her as she cries. Your
words may mean little, but your physical touch will communicate that you
care. Crises provide a unique opportunity for expressing love. Your
tender touches will be remembered long after the crisis has passed. Your
failure to touch may never be forgotten.

[[[S]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ince my first visit to West Palm
Beach, Florida, many years ago, I have always welcomed invitations to
lead marriage seminars in that area. It was on one such occasion that I
met Pete and Patsy. They were not native to Florida (few are), but they
had lived there for twenty years and called West Palm Beach home. My
seminar was sponsored by a local church, and as we drove from the
airport, the pastor informed me that Pete and Patsy had requested that I
spend the night at their house. I tried to act excited, but knew from
experience that such a request usually meant a late-night counseling
session. However, I was to be surprised in more than one way that night.

As the pastor and I entered the spacious, well-decorated, Spanish-style
house, I was introduced to Patsy and to Charlie, the family cat. As I
looked around the house, I had the hunch that either Pete's business had
done very well, his father had left him a huge inheritance, or he was
hopelessly in debt. Later I discovered that my first hunch was correct.
When I was shown the guest room, I observed that Charlie, the cat, was
making himself at home, stretched across the bed where I was to be
sleeping. I thought, [This cat has it made.]{.italic}

Pete came home shortly, and we had a delightful snack together and
agreed that we would have dinner after the seminar. Several hours later
while sharing dinner, I kept waiting for the counseling session to
begin. It never did. Instead, I found Pete and Patsy to be a healthy,
happily married couple. For a counselor, that is an oddity. I was eager
to discover their secret, but being extremely tired and knowing that
Pete and Patsy were going to drive me to the airport the next day, I
decided to do my probing when I was feeling more alert. They showed me
to my room.

Charlie, the cat, was nice enough to leave the room when I got there.
Bounding from the bed, he headed off to another bedroom and within
minutes, I was in bed. After a brief reflection of the day, I was
entering the twilight zone. Just before losing touch with reality, the
door to my bedroom popped open and a monster leaped on top of me! I had
heard of Florida's scorpions, but this was no small scorpion. Without
time to think, I grabbed the sheet that was draped over my body and with
one bloodcurdling shriek, flung the monster against the far wall. I
heard his body hit the wall and then silence. Pete and Patsy came
running down the hallway, turned on the light, and we all looked at
Charlie lying still.

Pete and Patsy have never forgotten me, and I have never forgotten them.
Charlie did revive in a few minutes, but he did not come back to my
room. In fact, Pete and Patsy told me later that Charlie never went back
to that bedroom again.

After my abuse of Charlie, I wasn't sure whether Pete and Patsy would
still want to take me to the airport the next day or if they would have
any further interest in me. However, my fears vanished when, after the
seminar, Pete said, "Dr. Chapman, I have been to many seminars, but I
have never heard anyone describe Patsy and me as clearly as you. That
love language idea is true. I can't wait to tell you our story!"

A few minutes after saying good-byes to those attending the seminar, we
were in the car for our forty-five-minute drive to the airport. And Pete
and Patsy began to tell me their story. In the early years of their
marriage, they had tremendous difficulties. But some twenty-two years
earlier, all of their friends agreed that they were the "perfect
couple." Pete and Patsy certainly believed that their marriage was "made
in heaven."

They had grown up in the same community, attended the same church, and
graduated from the same high school. Their parents had similar
lifestyles and values. Pete and Patsy enjoyed many of the same things.
They both liked tennis and boating, and they often talked about how many
interests they held in common. They seemed to possess all the
commonalities that are supposed to assure fewer conflicts in marriage.

They began dating in their senior year in high school. They attended
separate colleges but managed to see each other at least once a month
and sometimes more often. By the end of their freshman year, they were
convinced that they were "meant for each other." They both agreed,
however, to finish college before marriage. For the next three years,
they enjoyed an idyllic dating relationship. One weekend, he would visit
her campus; the following weekend, she would visit his campus; the third
weekend, they would go home to visit the folks but spend most of the
weekend with each other. The fourth weekend of each month, they agreed
not to see each other, thus giving each of them freedom to develop
individual interests. Except for special events such as birthdays, they
consistently followed that schedule. Three weeks after he received his
degree in business and she a degree in sociology, they were married. Two
months later, they moved to Florida where Pete had been offered a good
job. They were two thousand miles from their nearest relative. They
could enjoy a "honeymoon" forever.

The first three months were exciting---moving, finding a new apartment,
enjoying life together. The only conflict they could remember was over
washing dishes. Pete thought he had a more efficient way to complete
that chore. Patsy, however, was not open to his idea. Eventually, they
had agreed that whoever washed the dishes could do it his/her way, and
that conflict was resolved. They were about six months into the marriage
when Patsy began to feel that Pete was withdrawing from her. He was
working longer hours, and when he was at home, he spent considerable
time with the computer. When she finally expressed her feelings that he
was avoiding her, Pete told her that he was not avoiding her but simply
trying to stay on top of his job. He said that she didn't understand the
pressure he was under and how important it was that he do well in his
first year on the job. Patsy wasn't pleased, but she decided to give him
space.

Patsy began to develop friendships with other wives who lived in the
apartment complex. Often when she knew Pete was going to work late she
would go shopping with one of her friends instead of going straight home
after work. Sometimes she was not at home when Pete arrived. That
annoyed him greatly, and he accused her of being thoughtless and
irresponsible. Patsy retorted, "This is the pot calling the kettle
black. Who is irresponsible? You don't even call me and let me know when
you will be home. How can I be here for you when I don't even know when
you will be here? And when you are here, you spend all your time with
that dumb computer. You don't need a wife; all you need is a computer!"

To which Pete loudly responded, "I do need a wife. Don't you understand?
That's the whole point. I do need a wife."

But Patsy did not understand. She was extremely confused. In her search
for answers, she went to the public library and checked out several
books on marriage. "Marriage is not supposed to be this way," she
reasoned. "I have to find an answer to our situation." When Pete went to
the computer room, Patsy would pick up her book. In fact on many
evenings, she read until midnight. On his way to bed, Pete would notice
her and make sarcastic comments such as, "If you read that much in
college, you would have made straight A's." Patsy would respond, "I am
not in college. I'm in marriage, and right now, I'd be satisfied with a
C." Pete went to bed without so much as a second glance.

[At the end of the first year, Patsy was desperate.]{.italic}

At the end of the first year, Patsy was desperate. She had mentioned it
before, but this time she calmly said to Pete, "I am going to find a
marriage counselor. Do you want to go with me?"

But Pete answered, "I don't need a marriage counselor. I don't have time
to go to a marriage counselor. I can't afford a marriage counselor."

"Then I'll go alone," said Patsy.

"Fine, you are the one who needs counseling anyway."

The conversation was over. Patsy felt totally alone, but the next week
she made an appointment with a marriage counselor. After three sessions,
the counselor called Pete and asked if he would be willing to come in to
talk about his perspective on their marriage. Pete agreed, and the
process of healing began. Six months later, they left the counselor's
office with a new marriage.

\

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} said to Pete and Patsy, "What did you
learn in counseling that turned your marriage around?"

"In essence, Dr. Chapman," Pete said, "we learned to speak each other's
love language. The counselor did not use that term, but as you gave the
lecture today, the lights came on. My mind raced back to our counseling
experience, and I realized that's exactly what happened to us. We
finally learned to speak each other's love language."

"So what is your love language, Pete?" I asked.

"Physical touch," he said without hesitation.

"Physical touch for sure," said Patsy.

"And yours, Patsy?"

"Quality time, Dr. Chapman. That's what I was crying for in those days
while he was spending all his time with his job and his computer."

"How did you learn that physical touch was Pete's love language?"

"It took a while," Patsy said. "Little by little, it began to come out
in the counseling. At first, I don't think Pete even realized it."

"She's right," Pete said. "I was so insecure in my own sense of
self-worth that it took forever for me to be willing to identify and
acknowledge that her lack of touch had caused me to withdraw. I never
told her that I wanted to be touched, although I was crying inside for
her to reach out and touch me. In our dating relationship, I had always
taken the initiative in hugging, kissing, and holding hands, but she had
always been responsive. I felt that she loved me, but after we got
married, there were times that I reached out to her physically and she
was not responsive. Maybe with her new job responsibilities she was too
tired. I don't know, but I took it personally. I felt that she didn't
find me attractive. Then I decided I would not take the initiative
because I didn't want to be rejected. So I waited to see how long it
would be before she'd initiate a kiss or a touch or sexual intercourse.
Once I waited for six weeks before she touched me at all. I found it
unbearable. My withdrawal was to stay away from the pain I felt when I
was with her. I felt rejected, unwanted, and unloved."

Then Patsy said, "I had no idea that that was what he was feeling. I
knew that he was not reaching out to me. We were not kissing and hugging
as we had done earlier, but I just assumed that since we were married,
that was not as important to him now. I knew that he was under pressure
with his job. I had no idea that he wanted me to take the initiative.

"He's right. I would go weeks without touching him. It didn't cross my
mind. I was preparing meals, keeping the house clean, doing his laundry,
and trying to stay out of his way. I honestly didn't know what else I
could be doing. I could not understand his withdrawal or his lack of
attention to me. It's not that I dislike touching; it's just that it was
never that important to me. Spending time with me is what made me feel
loved and appreciated, giving me attention. It really didn't matter
whether we hugged or kissed. As long as he gave me his attention, I felt
loved.

"It took us a long time to discover the root of the problem, but once we
discovered that we were not meeting each other's emotional need for
love, we began to turn things around. Once I began to take the
initiative in giving him physical touch, it's amazing what happened. His
personality, his spirit changed drastically. I had a new husband. Once
he became convinced that I really did love him, then he began to become
more responsive to my needs."

"Does he still have a computer at home?" I asked.

"Yes," she said, "but he seldom uses it and when he does, it's all right
because I know that he is not 'married' to the computer. We do so many
things together that it's easy for me to give him the freedom to use the
computer when he wants to."

"What amazed me at the seminar today," Pete said, "was the way your
lecture on love languages carried me back all these years to that
experience. You said in twenty minutes what it took us six months to
learn."

"Well," I said, "it's not how fast you learn it but how well you learn
it that matters. And obviously, you have learned it well."

\

[[[P]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ete is only one of many individuals
for whom physical touch is the primary love language. Emotionally, they
yearn for their spouse to reach out and touch them physically. Running
the hand through the hair, giving a back rub, holding hands, embracing,
sexual intercourse---all of those and other "love touches" are the
emotional lifeline of the person for whom physical touch is the primary
love language.

[[[D]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}iscovering the primary love language
of your spouse is essential if you are to keep his/her emotional love
tank full. But first, let's make sure you know your own love language.
Having heard the five emotional love languages,

> > [Words of Affirmation]{.italic}

> > [Quality Time]{.italic}

> > [Receiving Gifts]{.italic}

> > [Acts of Service]{.italic}

> > [Physical Touch]{.italic}

some individuals will know instantaneously their own primary love
language and that of their spouse. For others, it will not be that easy.
Some are like Bob from Parma Heights, Ohio, who after hearing the five
emotional love languages said to me, "I don't know. It seems that two of
those are just about equal for me."

"Which two?" I inquired.

"'Physical Touch' and 'Words of Affirmation,'" Bob responded.

"By 'Physical Touch,' what do you mean?"

"Well, mainly sex," Bob replied.

I probed a little further, asking, "Do you enjoy your wife running her
hands through your hair, or giving you a back rub, or holding hands, or
kissing and hugging you at times when you are not having sexual
intercourse?"

"Those things are fine," said Bob. "I am not going to turn them down,
but the main thing is sexual intercourse. That's when I know that she
really loves me."

Leaving the subject of physical touch for a moment, I turned to
affirming words and asked, "When you say that 'Words of Affirmation' are
also important, what kinds of statements do you find most helpful?"

"Almost anything if it is positive," Bob replied. "When she tells me how
good I look, how smart I am, what a hard worker I am, when she expresses
appreciation for the things I do around the house, when she makes
positive comments about my taking time with the children, when she tells
me she loves me---all of those things really mean a lot to me."

"Did you receive those kinds of comments from your parents when you were
growing up?"

"Not very often," Bob said. "Most of what I got from my parents were
critical or demanding words. I guess that's why I appreciated Carol so
much in the first place, because she gave me words of affirmation."

"Let me ask you this. If Carol were meeting your sexual needs, that is,
if you were having quality sexual intercourse as often as you desire,
but she was giving you negative words, making critical remarks,
sometimes putting you down in front of others, do you think you would
feel loved by her?"

"I don't think so," he replied. "I think I would feel betrayed and
deeply hurt. I think I would be depressed."

"Bob," I said, "I think we have just discovered that your primary love
language is 'Words of Affirmation.' Sexual intercourse is extremely
important to you and to your sense of intimacy with Carol, but her words
of affirmation are more important to you emotionally. If she were, in
fact, verbally critical of you all the time and put you down in front of
other people, the time may come when you would no longer desire to have
sexual intercourse with her because she would be a source of deep pain
to you."

\

[[[B]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ob had made the mistake common to many
men: assuming that "Physical Touch" is their primary love language
because they desire sexual intercourse so intensely. For the male,
sexual desire is physically based. That is, the desire for sexual
intercourse is stimulated by the buildup of sperm cells and seminal
fluid in the seminal vesicles. When the seminal vesicles are full, there
is a physical push for release. Thus, the male's desire for sexual
intercourse has a physical root.

[Most sexual problems in marriage have little to do with physical
technique but everything to do with meeting emotional needs.]{.italic}

For the female, sexual desire is rooted in her emotions, not her
physiology. There is nothing physically that builds up and pushes her to
have intercourse. Her desire is emotionally based. If she feels loved
and admired and appreciated by her husband, then she has a desire to be
physically intimate with him. But without the emotional closeness she
may have little physical desire.

Because the male is physically pushed to have sexual release on a
somewhat regular basis, he may automatically assume that that is his
primary love language. But if he does not enjoy physical touch at other
times and in nonsexual ways, it may not be his love language at all.
Sexual desire is quite different from his emotional need to feel loved.
That doesn't mean that sexual intercourse is unimportant to him---it is
extremely important---but sexual intercourse alone will not meet his
need to feel loved. His wife must speak his primary emotional love
language as well.

When, in fact, his wife speaks his primary love language and his
emotional love tank is full, and he speaks her primary love language and
her emotional tank is full, the sexual aspect of their relationship will
take care of itself. Most sexual problems in marriage have little to do
with physical technique but everything to do with meeting emotional
needs.

After further conversation and reflection, Bob said, "You know, I think
you are right. 'Words of Affirmation' is definitely my primary love
language. When she has been cutting and critical of me verbally, I tend
to withdraw from her sexually and fantasize about other women. But when
she tells me how much she appreciates me and admires me, my natural
sexual desires are turned toward her." Bob had made a significant
discovery in our brief conversation.

\

[[[W]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}hat is your primary love language?
What makes you feel most loved by your spouse? What do you desire above
all else? If the answer to those questions does not leap to your mind
immediately, perhaps it will help to look at the negative use of love
languages. What does your spouse do or say or fail to do or say that
hurts you deeply? If, for example, your deepest pain is the critical,
judgmental words of your spouse, then perhaps your love language is
"Words of Affirmation." If your primary love language is used negatively
by your spouse---that is, he does the opposite---it will hurt you more
deeply than it would hurt someone else because not only is he neglecting
to speak your primary love language, he is actually using that language
as a knife to your heart.

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} remember Mary in Kitchener, Ontario,
who said, "Dr. Chapman, what hurts me most is that Ron never lifts a
hand to help me around the house. He watches television while I do all
the work. I don't understand how he could do that if he really loved
me." Mary's deepest hurt, mainly that Ron did not help her do things
around the house, was the clue to her primary love language---"Acts of
Service." If it grieves you deeply that your spouse seldom gives you a
gift for any occasion, then perhaps your primary love language is
"Receiving Gifts." If your deepest hurt is that your spouse seldom gives
you quality time, then that is your primary love language.

Another approach to discovering your primary love language is to look
back over your marriage and ask, "What have I most often requested of my
spouse?" Whatever you have most requested is probably in keeping with
your primary love language. Those requests have probably been
interpreted by your spouse as nagging. They have been, in fact, your
efforts to secure emotional love from your spouse.

Elizabeth, who lived in Maryville, Indiana, used that approach in
discovering her primary love language. She said to me at the conclusion
of a seminar session, "Whenever I look back over the last ten years of
my marriage and ask myself what have I most requested of Peter, my love
language becomes obvious. I have requested 'Quality Time' most often.
Over and over again, I have asked him if we could go on a picnic, take a
weekend together away, shut the TV off for just an hour and talk with
each other, take a walk together, and on and on. I have felt neglected
and unloved because seldom did he ever respond to my request. He gave me
nice gifts for my birthday and special occasions and wondered why I was
not excited about them.

"During your seminar," she continued, "the lights came on for both of
us. During the break, my husband apologized for being so dense through
the years and so resistant to my requests. He has promised me that
things will be different in the future, and I believe they will."

\

[[[A]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}nother way to discover your primary
love language is to examine what you do or say to express love to your
spouse. Chances are what you are doing for her is what you wish she
would do for you. If you are constantly doing "Acts of Service" for your
spouse, perhaps (although not always) that is your love language. If
"Words of Affirmation" speak love to you, chances are you will use them
in speaking love to your spouse. Thus, you may discover your own
language by asking, "How do I consciously express my love to my spouse?"

But remember, that approach is only a possible clue to your love
language; it is not an absolute indicator. For example, the husband who
learned from his father to express love to his wife by giving her nice
gifts expresses his love to his wife by doing what his father did, yet
"Receiving Gifts" is not his primary love language. He is simply doing
what he was trained to do by his father.

[Spend some time writing down what you think is your primary love
language. Then list the other four in order of importance.]{.italic}

I have suggested three ways to discover your own primary love language.

\
<li value="1" class="calibre46">
1\. What does your spouse do or fail to do that hurts you most deeply?
The opposite of what hurts you most is probably your love language.
</li>
\
<li value="2" class="calibre43">
2\. What have you most often requested of your spouse? The thing you
have most often requested is likely the thing that would make you feel
most loved.
</li>
\
<li value="3" class="calibre43">
3\. In what way do you regularly express love to your spouse? Your
method of expressing love may be an indication that that would also make
you feel loved.
</li>
\

Using those three approaches will probably enable you to determine your
primary love language. If two languages seem to be equal for you, that
is, both speak loudly to you, then perhaps you are bilingual. If so, you
make it easier on your spouse. Now he or she has two choices, either of
which will strongly communicate love to you.

\

[[[T]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}wo kinds of people may have difficulty
discovering their primary love language. The first is the individual
whose emotional love tank has been full for a long time. Her spouse has
expressed love in many ways, and she is not certain which of those ways
makes her feel most loved. She simply knows that she is loved. The
second is the individual whose love tank has been empty for so long that
he doesn't remember what makes him feel loved. In either case, go back
to the experience of falling in love and ask yourself, "What did I like
about my spouse in those days? What did he do or say that made me desire
to be with him?" If you can conjure up those memories, it will give you
some idea of your primary love language. Another approach would be to
ask yourself, "What would be an ideal spouse to me? If I could have the
perfect mate, what would she be like?" Your picture of a perfect mate
should give you some idea of your primary love language.

Having said all of that, let me suggest that you spend some time writing
down what you think is your primary love language. Then list the other
four in order of importance. Also write down what you think is the
primary love language of your spouse. You may also list the other four
in order of importance if you wish. Sit down with your spouse and
discuss what you guessed to be his/her primary love language. Then tell
each other what you consider to be your own primary love language.

Once you have shared that information, I suggest that you play the
following game three times a week for three weeks. The game is called
"Tank Check," and it is played like this. When you come home, one of you
says to the other, "On a scale of zero to ten, how is your love tank
tonight?" Zero means empty, and 10 means "I am full of love and can't
handle any more." You give a reading on your emotional love tank---10,
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0, indicating how full it is. Your spouse
says, "What could I do to help fill it?"

Then you make a suggestion---something you would like your spouse to do
or say that evening. To the best of his ability, he will respond to your
request. Then you repeat the process in the reverse order so that both
of you have the opportunity to do a reading on your love tank and to
make a suggestion toward filling it. If you play the game for three
weeks, you will be hooked on it, and it can be a playful way of
stimulating love expressions in your marriage.

One husband said to me, "I don't like that love tank game. I played it
with my wife. I came home and said to her, 'On a scale of zero to ten,
how's your love tank tonight?' She said, 'About seven.' I asked, 'What
could I do to help fill it?' She said, 'The greatest thing you could do
for me tonight is to do the laundry.' I said, 'Love and laundry? I don't
get it.'"

I said, "That's the problem. Perhaps you don't understand your wife's
love language. What's your primary love language?"

Without hesitation he said, "Physical touch, and especially the sexual
part of the marriage."

"Listen to me carefully," I said. "The love you feel when your wife
expresses love by physical touch is the same love your wife feels when
you do the laundry."

"Bring on the laundry," he shouted. "I'll wash the clothes every night
if it makes her feel that good."

\

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ncidentally, if you have still not
discovered your primary love language, keep records on the tank check
game. When your spouse says, "What could I do to help fill your tank?"
your suggestions will likely cluster around your primary love language.
You may request things from all five love languages, but you will have
more requests centering on your primary love language.

Perhaps some of you are saying in your minds what Raymond and Helen said
to me in Zion, Illinois. "Dr. Chapman, all that sounds fine and
wonderful, but what if the love language of your spouse is something
that just doesn't come naturally for you?"

I'll discuss my answer in chapter 10.

[[[H]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ow can we speak each other's love
language when we are full of hurt, anger, and resentment over past
failures? The answer to that question lies in the essential nature of
our humanity. We are creatures of choice. That means that we have the
capacity to make poor choices, which all of us have done. We have spoken
critical words, and we have done hurtful things. We are not proud of
those choices, although they may have seemed justified at the moment.
Poor choices in the past don't mean that we must make them in the
future. Instead we can say, "I'm sorry. I know I have hurt you, but I
would like to make the future different. I would like to love you in
your language. I would like to meet your needs." I have seen marriages
rescued from the brink of divorce when couples make the choice to love.

Love doesn't erase the past, but it makes the future different. When we
choose active expressions of love in the primary love language of our
spouse, we create an emotional climate where we can deal with our past
conflicts and failures.

\

[[[B]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}rent was in my office, stone-faced and
unfeeling. He had come not by his own initiative, but at my request. A
week earlier his wife, Becky, had been sitting in the same chair,
weeping uncontrollably. Between her outbursts of tears, she managed to
verbalize that Brent had told her that he no longer loved her and that
he was leaving. She was devastated.

When she regained her composure she said, "We have both worked so hard
the last two or three years. I knew that we were not spending as much
time together as we used to, but I thought we were working for a common
goal. I cannot believe what he is saying. He has always been such a kind
and caring person. He is such a good father to our children." She
continued, "How could he do this to us?"

I listened as she described their twelve years of marriage. It was a
story I had heard many times before. They had an exciting courtship, got
married at the height of the "in love experience," had the typical
adjustments in the early days of marriage, and pursued the American
dream. In due time, they came down off the emotional high of the "in
love experience" but did not learn to speak each other's love language
sufficiently. She had lived with a love tank only half full for the last
several years, but she had received enough expressions of love to make
her think that everything was OK. However, his love tank was empty.

I told Becky that I would see if Brent would talk with me. I told Brent
on the phone, "As you know, Becky came to see me and told me about her
struggle with what is happening in the marriage. I want to help her, but
in order to do so, I need to know what you are thinking."

He agreed without hesitation, and now he sat in my office. His outward
appearance was in stark contrast to Becky's. She had been weeping
uncontrollably, but he was stoic. I had the impression, however, that
his weeping had taken place weeks or perhaps months ago and that it had
been an inward weeping. The story Brent told confirmed my hunch.

"I just don't love her anymore," he said. "I haven't loved her for a
long time. I don't want to hurt her, but we are not close. Our
relationship has become empty. I don't enjoy being with her anymore. I
don't know what happened. I wish it were different, but I don't have any
feelings for her."

Brent was thinking and feeling what hundreds of thousands of husbands
have thought and felt through the years. It's the "I don't love her
anymore" mind-set that gives men the emotional freedom to seek love with
someone else. The same is true for wives who use the same excuse.

\

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} sympathized with Brent, for I have
been there. Thousands of husbands and wives have been
there---emotionally empty, wanting to do the right thing, not wanting to
hurt anyone, but being pushed by their emotional needs to seek love
outside the marriage. Fortunately, I had discovered in the earlier years
of my own marriage the difference between the "in love experience" and
the "emotional need" to feel loved. Most in our society have not yet
learned that difference. The movies, the "soaps," and the romantic
magazines have intertwined these two loves, thus adding to our
confusion, but they are, in fact, quite distinct.

The "in love experience" that we discussed in chapter 3 is on the level
of instinct. It is not premeditated; it simply happens in the normal
context of male-female relationships. It can be fostered or quenched,
but it does not arise by conscious choice. It is short-lived (usually
two years or less) and seems to serve for humankind the same function as
the mating call of the Canada geese.

The "in love experience" temporarily meets one's emotional need for
love. It gives us the feeling that someone cares, that someone admires
us and appreciates us. Our emotions soar with the thought that another
person sees us as number one, that he or she is willing to devote time
and energies exclusively to our relationship. For a brief period,
however long it lasts, our emotional need for love is met. Our tank is
full; we can conquer the world. Nothing is impossible. For many
individuals, it is the first time they have ever lived with a full
emotional tank, and it is euphoric.

[Meeting my wife's need for love is a choice I make each day. If I know
her primary love language and choose to speak it, her deepest emotional
need will be met and she will feel secure in my love.]{.italic}

In time, however, we come down from that natural high back to the real
world. If our spouse has learned to speak our primary love language, our
need for love will continue to be satisfied. If, on the other hand, he
or she does not speak our love language, our tank will slowly drain, and
we will no longer feel loved. Meeting that need in one's spouse is
definitely a choice. If I learn the emotional love language of my spouse
and speak it frequently, she will continue to feel loved. When she comes
down from the obsession of the "in love experience," she will hardly
even miss it because her emotional love tank will continue to be filled.
However, if I have not learned her primary love language or have chosen
not to speak it, when she descends from the emotional high, she will
have the natural yearnings of unmet emotional need. After some years of
living with an empty love tank, she will likely "fall in love" with
someone else and the cycle will begin again.

Meeting my wife's need for love is a choice I make each day. If I know
her primary love language and choose to speak it, her deepest emotional
need will be met and she will feel secure in my love. If she does the
same for me, my emotional needs are met and both of us live with a full
tank. In a state of emotional contentment, both of us will give our
creative energies to many wholesome projects outside the marriage while
we continue to keep our marriage exciting and growing.

\

[[[W]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ith all of that in my mind, I looked
back at the deadpan face of Brent and wondered if I could help him. I
knew in my heart that he was probably already involved with another "in
love experience." I wondered if it was in the beginning stages or at its
height. Few men, suffering from an empty emotional love tank, leave
their marriage until they have prospects of meeting that need somewhere
else.

Brent was honest and revealed that he had been in love with someone else
for several months. He had hoped that the feelings would go away and
that he could work things out with his wife. But things at home had
gotten worse, and his love for the other woman had increased. He could
not imagine living without his new lover.

I sympathized with Brent in his dilemma. He sincerely did not want to
hurt his wife or his children, but at the same time, he felt he deserved
a life of happiness. I told him the statistics on second marriages (60
percent ending in divorce). He was surprised to hear that but was
certain that he would beat the odds. I told him about the research on
the effects of divorce on children, but he was convinced that he would
continue to be a good father to his children and that they would get
over the trauma of the divorce. I talked to Brent about the issues in
this book and explained the difference between the experience of falling
in love and the deep emotional need to feel loved. I explained the five
love languages and challenged him to give his marriage another chance.
All the while, I knew that my intellectual and reasoned approach to
marriage compared to the emotional high that he was experiencing was
like pitting a BB gun against an automatic weapon. He expressed
appreciation for my concern and asked that I do everything possible to
help Becky. But he assured me that he saw no hope for the marriage.

One month later, I received a call from Brent. He indicated that he
would like to talk with me again. This time when he entered my office he
was noticeably disturbed. He was not the calm, cool man I had seen
before. His lover had begun to come down off the emotional high, and she
was observing things in Brent that she did not like. She was withdrawing
from the relationship, and he was crushed. Tears came to his eyes as he
told me how much she meant to him and how unbearable it was to
experience her rejection.

I listened sympathetically for an hour before Brent ever asked for my
advice. I told him how sympathetic I was to his pain and indicated that
what he was experiencing was the natural emotional grief from a loss and
that the grief would not go away overnight. I explained, however, that
the experience was inevitable. I reminded him of the temporary nature of
the "in love experience," that sooner or later, we always come down from
the high to the real world. Some fall out of love before they get
married; others, after they get married. He agreed that it was better
now than later.

After some time, I suggested that perhaps the crisis was a good time for
him and his wife to get some marriage counseling. I reminded him that
true, long-lasting emotional love is a choice and that emotional love
could be reborn in his marriage if he and his wife learned to love each
other in the right love languages. He agreed to marriage counseling; and
nine months later, Brent and Becky left my office with a reborn
marriage. When I saw Brent three years later, he told me what a
wonderful marriage he had and thanked me for helping him at a crucial
time in his life. He told me that the grief over losing the other lover
had been gone for more than two years. He smiled and said, "My tank has
never been so full, and Becky is the happiest woman you are ever going
to meet."

Fortunately Brent was the benefactor of what I call the disequilibrium
of the "in love experience." That is, almost never do two people fall in
love on the same day, and almost never do they fall out of love on the
same day. You don't have to be a social scientist to discover that
truth. Just listen to country and western songs. Brent's lover happened
to have fallen out of love at an opportune time.

[When an action doesn't come naturally to you, it is a greater
expression of love.]{.italic}

In the nine months that I counseled Brent and Becky, we worked through
numerous conflicts that they had never resolved before. But the key to
the rebirth of their marriage was discovering each other's primary love
language and choosing to speak it frequently.

\

[[[L]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}et me return to the question I raised
in chapter 9. "What if the love language of your spouse is something
that doesn't come naturally for you?" I am often asked this question at
my marriage seminars, and my answer is, "So?"

My wife's love language is "Acts of Service." One of the things I do for
her regularly as an act of love is to vacuum the floors. Do you think
that vacuuming floors comes naturally for me? My mother used to make me
vacuum. All through junior high and high school, I couldn't go play ball
on Saturday until I finished vacuuming the entire house. In those days,
I said to myself, "When I get out of here, one thing I am not going to
do: I am not going to vacuum houses. I'll get myself a wife to do that."

But I vacuum our house now, and I vacuum it regularly. And there is only
one reason I vacuum our house. [Love.]{.italic} You couldn't pay me
enough to vacuum a house, but I do it for love. You see, when an action
doesn't come naturally to you, it is a greater expression of love. My
wife knows that when I vacuum the house, it's nothing but 100 percent
pure, unadulterated love, and I get credit for the whole thing!

Someone says, "But, Dr. Chapman, that's different. I know that my
spouse's love language is physical touch, and I am not a toucher. I
never saw my mother and father hug each other. They never hugged me, Dr.
Chapman. I am just not a toucher. What am I going to do?"

Do you have two hands? Can you put them together? Now, imagine that you
have your spouse in the middle and pull him/her toward you. I'll bet
that if you hug your spouse three thousand times, it will begin to feel
more comfortable. But ultimately, comfort is not the issue. We are
talking about love, and love is something you do for someone else, not
something you do for yourself. Most of us do many things each day that
do not come "naturally" for us. For some of us, that is getting out of
bed in the morning. We go against our feelings and get out of bed. Why?
Because we believe there is something worthwhile to do that day. And
normally, before the day is over, we feel good about having gotten up.
Our actions preceded our emotions.

The same is true with love. We discover the primary love language of our
spouse, and we choose to speak it whether or not it is natural for us.
We are not claiming to have warm, excited feelings. We are simply
choosing to do it for his or her benefit. We want to meet our spouse's
emotional need, and we reach out to speak his love language. In so
doing, his emotional love tank is filled and chances are he will
reciprocate and speak our language. When he does, our emotions return,
and our love tank begins to fill.

\

[[[L]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ove is a choice. And either partner
can start the process today.

M]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[AKES THE]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
D]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[IFFERENCE]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

[[[L]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}ove is not our only emotional need.
Psychologists have observed that among our basic needs are the need for
security, self-worth, and significance. Love, however, interfaces with
all of those.

If I feel loved by my spouse, I can relax, knowing that my lover will do
me no ill. I feel secure in his/her presence. I may face many
uncertainties in my vocation. I may have enemies in other areas of my
life, but with my spouse I feel secure.

My sense of self-worth is fed by the fact that my spouse loves me. After
all, if he/she loves me, I must be worth loving. My parents may have
given me negative or mixed messages about my worth, but my spouse knows
me as an adult and loves me. Her love builds my self-esteem.

The need for significance is the emotional force behind much of our
behavior. Life is driven by the desire for success. We want our lives to
count for something. We have our own idea of what it means to be
significant, and we work hard to reach our goals. Feeling loved by a
spouse enhances our sense of significance. We reason, If someone loves
me, I must have significance.

I am significant because I stand at the apex of the created order. I
have the ability to think in abstract terms, communicate my thoughts via
words, and make decisions. By means of printed or recorded words, I can
benefit from the thoughts of those who have preceded me. I can profit
from others' experience, though they lived in a different age and
culture. I experience the death of family and friends and sense that
there is existence beyond the material. I discover that, in all
cultures, people believe in a spiritual world. My heart tells me it is
true even when my mind, trained in scientific observation, raises
critical questions.

I am significant. Life has meaning. There is a higher purpose. I want to
believe it, but I may not feel significant until someone expresses love
to me. When my spouse lovingly invests time, energy, and effort in me, I
believe that I am significant. Without love, I may spend a lifetime in
search of significance, self-worth, and security. When I experience
love, it impacts all of those needs positively. I am now freed to
develop my potential. I am more secure in my self-worth and can now turn
my efforts outward instead of being obsessed with my own needs. True
love always liberates.

In the context of marriage, if we do not feel loved, our differences are
magnified. We come to view each other as a threat to our happiness. We
fight for self-worth and significance, and marriage becomes a
battlefield rather than a haven.

Love is not the answer to everything, but it creates a climate of
security in which we can seek answers to those things that bother us. In
the security of love, a couple can discuss differences without
condemnation. Conflicts can be resolved. Two people who are different
can learn to live together in harmony. We discover how to bring out the
best in each other. Those are the rewards of love.

The decision to love your spouse holds tremendous potential. Learning
his/her primary love language makes that potential a reality. Love
really does "make the world go round." At least it did for Jean and
Norm.

\

[[[T]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}hey had traveled for three hours to
get to my office. It was obvious that Norm did not want to be there.
Jean had twisted his arm by threats of leaving him. (I do not suggest
this approach, but people do not always know my suggestions before they
come to see me.) They had been married for thirty-five years and had
never gone to counseling before.

Jean began the conversation. "Dr. Chapman, I want you to know two things
up front. First of all, we don't have any money problems. I was reading
in a magazine that money is the biggest problem in marriage. That's not
true for us. We both have worked through the years, the house is paid
for, the cars are paid for. We don't have any money problems. Second, I
want you to know that we don't argue. I hear my friends talking about
the arguments they have all the time. We have never argued. I can't
remember the last time we ever had an argument. Both of us agree that
arguing is fruitless, so we don't argue."

As a counselor, I appreciated Jean's clearing the path. I knew that she
was going to get right to the point. It was obvious that she had thought
through her opening statement. She wanted to make sure we didn't get
bogged down in nonproblems. She wanted to use the hour wisely.

She continued. "The problem is that I just don't feel any love coming
from my husband. Life is a routine for us. We get up in the morning and
go off to work. In the afternoon, he does his thing and I do my thing.
We generally have dinner together, but we don't talk. He watches TV
while we eat. After dinner, he piddles in the basement and then sleeps
in front of the TV until I tell him it's time to go to bed. That is our
schedule five days a week. On Saturday, he plays golf in the morning,
works in the yard in the afternoon, and we go out to dinner with another
couple on Saturday night. He talks to them, but when we get into the car
to go home, the conversation is over. Once we are at home, he sleeps in
front of the TV until we go to bed. On Sunday morning, we go to church.
We always go to church on Sunday morning, Dr. Chapman," she emphasized.

"Then," she said, "we go out to lunch with some friends. When we get
home, he sleeps in front of the TV all Sunday afternoon. We usually go
back to church on Sunday night, come home, eat popcorn, and go to bed.
That's our schedule every week. That's all there is to it. We are like
two roommates living in the same house. There is nothing going on
between us. I don't feel any love coming from him. There is no warmth,
there's no emotion. It's empty, it's dead. I don't think I can go on
much longer like this."

By that time, Jean was crying. I handed her a tissue and looked at Norm.
His first comment was, "I don't understand her." After a brief pause, he
continued. "I have done everything I know to show her that I love her,
especially the last two or three years since she's been complaining
about it so much. Nothing seems to help. No matter what I do, she
continues to complain that she doesn't feel loved. I don't know what
else to do."

I could tell that Norm was frustrated and exasperated. I inquired, "What
have you been doing to show your love for Jean?"

"Well, for one thing," he said, "I get home from work before she does,
so I get dinner started every night. In fact, if you want to know the
truth, I have dinner almost ready when she gets home four nights a week.
The other night, we go out to eat. After dinner, I wash dishes three
nights a week. The other night I have a meeting, but three nights I wash
the dishes after dinner is over. I do all the vacuuming because her back
is bad. I do all the yard work because she is allergic to pollen. I fold
the clothes when they come out of the dryer."

He went on telling me other things that he did for Jean. When he
finished, I wondered, [What does this woman do?]{.italic} There was
almost nothing left for her.

Norm continued, "I do all those things to show her that I love her, yet
she sits there and says to you what she has been saying to me for two or
three years---that she doesn't feel loved. I don't know what else to do
for her."

When I turned back to Jean she said, "Dr. Chapman, all of those things
are fine, but I want him to sit on the couch and talk to me. We don't
ever talk. We haven't talked in thirty years. He's always washing
dishes, vacuuming the floor, mowing the grass. He's always doing
something. I want him to sit on the couch with me and give me some time,
look at me, talk to me about us, about our lives."

Jean was crying again. It was obvious to me that her primary love
language was "Quality Time." She was crying for attention. She wanted to
be treated as a person, not an object. Norm's busyness did not meet her
emotional need. As I talked further with Norm, I discovered that he
didn't feel loved either, but he wasn't talking about it. He reasoned,
"If you have been married for thirty-five years and your bills are paid
and you don't argue, what more can you hope for?" That's where he was.
But when I said to him, "What would be an ideal wife to you? If you
could have a perfect wife, what would she be like?" he looked me in the
eye for the first time and asked, "Do you really want to know?"

"Yes," I said.

He sat up on the couch and folded his arms across his chest. A big smile
broke on his face, and he said, "I've dreamed about this. A perfect wife
would be a wife who would come home in the afternoon and fix dinner for
me. I would be working in the yard, and she would call me in to eat.
After dinner, she would wash the dishes. I would probably help her some,
but she would take the responsibility. She would sew the buttons on my
shirt when they fall off."

Jean could contain herself no longer. She turned to him and said, "I'm
not believing you. You told me that you liked to cook."

"I don't mind cooking," Norm responded, "but the man asked me what would
be ideal."

I knew Norm's primary love language without another word---"Acts of
Service." Why do you think Norm did all of those things for Jean?
Because that was his love language. In his mind, that's the way you show
love: by doing things for people. The problem was that "doing things"
was not Jean's primary love language. It did not mean to her emotionally
what it would have meant to him if she had been doing things for him.

When the light came on in Norm's mind, the first thing he said was, "Why
didn't somebody tell me this thirty years ago? I could have been sitting
on the couch talking to her fifteen minutes every night instead of doing
all this stuff."

He turned to Jean and said, "For the first time in my life, I finally
understand what you mean when you say 'We don't talk.' I could never
understand that. I thought we did talk. I always ask, 'Did you sleep
well?' I thought we were talking, but now I understand. You want to sit
on the couch fifteen minutes every night and look at each other and
talk. Now I understand what you mean, and now I know why it is so
important to you. It is your emotional love language, and we'll start
tonight. I'll give you fifteen minutes on the couch every night for the
rest of my life. You can count on that."

Jean turned to Norm and said, "That would be heavenly, and I don't mind
fixing dinner for you. It will have to be later than usual because I get
off work later than you, but I don't mind fixing dinner. And I would
love to sew your buttons on. You never left them off long enough for me
to get them. I'll wash dishes the rest of my life if it will make you
feel loved."

Jean and Norm went home and started loving each other in the right love
languages. In less than two months, they were on a second honeymoon.
They called me from the Bahamas to tell me what a radical change had
taken place in their marriage.

[[L]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[OVING THE]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
U]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[NLOVELY]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}t was a beautiful September Saturday.
My wife and I were strolling through Reynolda Gardens, enjoying the
flora, some of which had been imported from around the world. The
gardens had originally been developed by R. J. Reynolds, the tobacco
magnate, as a part of his country estate. They are now a part of the
Wake Forest University campus. We had just passed the rose garden when I
noticed Ann, a woman who had begun counseling two weeks earlier,
approaching us. She was looking down at the cobblestone walkway and
appeared to be in deep thought. When I greeted her, she was startled but
looked up and smiled. I introduced her to Karolyn, and we exchanged
pleasantries. Then, without any lead-in, she asked me one of the most
profound questions I have ever heard: "Dr. Chapman, is it possible to
love someone whom you hate?"

I knew the question was born of deep hurt and deserved a thoughtful
answer. I knew that I would be seeing her the following week for another
counseling appointment, so I said, "Ann, that is one of the most
thought-provoking questions I have ever heard. Why don't we discuss that
next week?" She agreed, and Karolyn and I continued our stroll. But
Ann's question did not go away. Later, as we drove home, Karolyn and I
discussed it. We reflected on the early days of our own marriage and
remembered that we had often experienced feelings of hate. Our
condemning words to each other had stimulated hurt and, on the heels of
hurt, anger. Anger held inside becomes hate. What made the difference
for us? We both knew it was the choice to love. We had realized that if
we continued our pattern of demanding and condemning, we would destroy
our marriage. Fortunately over a period of about a year, we had learned
how to discuss our differences without condemning each other, how to
make decisions without destroying our unity, how to give constructive
suggestions without being demanding, and eventually how to speak each
other's primary love language. (Many of those insights are recorded in
an earlier book, [Toward a Growing Marriage,]{.italic} Moody
Publishers.) Our choice to love was made in the midst of negative
feelings toward each other. When we started speaking each other's
primary love language, the negative feelings of anger and hate abated.

Our situation, however, was different from Ann's. Karolyn and I had both
been open to learning and growing. I knew that Ann's husband was not.
She had told me the previous week that she had begged him to go for
counseling. She had pleaded for him to read a book or listen to a tape
on marriage, but he had refused all her efforts toward growth. According
to her, his attitude was: "I don't have any problems. You are the one
with the problems." In his mind he was right, she was wrong---it was as
simple as that. Her feelings of love for him had been killed through the
years by his constant criticism and condemnation. After ten years of
marriage, her emotional energy was depleted and her self-esteem almost
destroyed. Was there hope for Ann's marriage? Could she love an unlovely
husband? Would he ever respond in love to her?

I knew that Ann was a deeply religious person and that she attended
church regularly. I surmised that perhaps her only hope for marital
survival was in her faith. The next day, with Ann in mind, I began to
read Luke's account of the life of Christ. I have always admired Luke's
writing because he was a physician who gave attention to details and in
the first century wrote an orderly account of the teachings and
lifestyle of Jesus of Nazareth. In what many have called Jesus' greatest
sermon, I read the following words, which I call love's greatest
challenge.

> [I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate
> you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.... Do
> to others as you would have them do to you. If you love those who love
> you, what credit is that to you? Even "sinners" love those who love
> them.]{.italic}^1^

It seemed to me that that profound challenge, written almost two
thousand years ago, might be the direction that Ann was looking for, but
could she do it? Could anyone do it? Is it possible to love a spouse who
has become your enemy? Is it possible to love one who has cursed you,
mistreated you, and expressed feelings of contempt and hate for you? And
if she could, would there be any payback? Would her husband ever change
and begin to express love and care for her? I was astounded by this
further word from Jesus' ancient sermon: "Give, and it will be given to
you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over,
will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be
measured to you."^2^

Could that ancient principle of loving an unlovely person possibly work
in a marriage as far gone as Ann's? I decided to do an experiment. I
would take as my hypothesis that if Ann could learn her husband's
primary love language and speak it for a period of time so that his
emotional need for love was met, eventually he would reciprocate and
begin to express love to her. I wondered, [Would it work?]{.italic}

I met with Ann the next week and listened again as she reviewed the
horrors of her marriage. At the end of her synopsis, she repeated the
question she had asked in Reynolda Gardens. This time she put it in the
form of a statement: "Dr. Chapman, I just don't know if I can ever love
him again after all he has done to me."

"Have you talked about your situation with any of your friends?" I
asked.

"With two of my closest friends," she said, "and a little bit with some
other people."

"And what was their response?"

"Get out," she said. "They all tell me to get out, that he will never
change, and that I am simply prolonging the agony. But, Dr. Chapman, I
just can't bring myself to do that. Maybe I should, but I just can't
believe that's the right thing to do."

"It seems to me that you are torn between your religious and moral
beliefs that tell you it is wrong to get out of the marriage, and your
emotional pain, which tells you that getting out is the only way to
survive," I said.

"That's exactly right, Dr. Chapman. That's exactly the way I feel. I
don't know what to do."

[When the tank is low...we have no love feelings toward our spouse but
simply experience emptiness and pain.]{.italic}

"I am deeply sympathetic with your struggle," I continued. "You are in a
very difficult situation. I wish I could offer you an easy answer.
Unfortunately, I can't. Both of the alternatives you mentioned, getting
out or staying in, will likely bring you a great deal of pain. Before
you make that decision, I do have one idea. I am not sure it will work,
but I'd like you to try it. I know from what you have told me that your
religious faith is important to you and that you have a great deal of
respect for the teachings of Jesus."

She nodded affirmingly. I continued, "I want to read something that
Jesus once said that I think has some application to your marriage." I
read slowly and deliberately.

"'I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate
you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.... Do
to others as you would have them do to you. If you love those who love
you, what credit is that to you? Even "sinners" love those who love
them.'

"Does that sound like your husband? Has he treated you as an enemy
rather than as a friend?" I inquired.

She nodded her head affirmingly.

"Has he ever cursed you?" I asked.

"Many times."

"Has he ever mistreated you?"

"Often."

"And has he told you that he hates you?"

"Yes."

"Ann, if you are willing, I would like to do an experiment. I would like
to see what would happen if we apply this principle to your marriage.
Let me explain what I mean." I went on to explain to Ann the concept of
the emotional tank and the fact that when the tank is low, as hers was,
we have no love feelings toward our spouse but simply experience
emptiness and pain. Since love is such a deep emotional need, the lack
of it is perhaps our deepest emotional pain. I told her that if we could
learn to speak each other's primary love language, that emotional need
could be met and positive feelings could be engendered again.

"Does that make sense to you?" I inquired.

"Dr. Chapman, you have just described my life. I have never seen it so
clearly before. We were in love before we got married, but not long
after our marriage we came down off the high and we never learned to
speak each other's love language. My tank has been empty for years, and
I am sure his has also. Dr. Chapman, if I had understood this concept
earlier, maybe none of this would have happened."

"We can't go back, Ann," I said. "All we can do is try to make the
future different. I would like to propose a six-month experiment."

"I'll try anything," Ann said.

I liked her positive spirit, but I wasn't sure whether she understood
how difficult the experiment would be.

"Let's begin by stating our objective," I said. "If in six months you
could have your fondest wish, what would it be?"

Ann sat in silence for some time. Then thoughtfully she said, "I would
like to see Glenn loving me again and expressing it by spending time
with me. I would like to see us doing things together, going places
together. I would like to feel that he is interested in my world. I
would like to see us talking when we go out to eat. I'd like him to
listen to me. I'd like to feel that he values my ideas. I would like to
see us taking trips together and having fun again. I would like to know
that he values our marriage more than anything."

Ann paused and then continued. "On my part, I would like to have warm,
positive feelings toward him again. I would like to gain respect for him
again. I would like to be proud of him. Right now, I don't have those
feelings."

I was writing as Ann was speaking. When she finished, I read aloud what
she had said. "That sounds like a pretty lofty objective," I said, "but
is that really what you want, Ann?"

"Right now, that sounds like an impossible objective, Dr. Chapman," Ann
replied, "but more than anything, that's what I would like to see."

"Then let's agree," I said, "that this will be our objective. In six
months, we want to see you and Glenn having this kind of love
relationship.

"Now, let me suggest a hypothesis. The purpose of our experiment will be
to prove whether or not the hypothesis is true. Let's hypothesize that
if you could speak Glenn's primary love language consistently for a
six-month period, that somewhere along the line his emotional need for
love would begin to be met; and as his emotional tank filled, he would
begin to reciprocate love to you. That hypothesis is built upon the idea
that the emotional need for love is our deepest emotional need; and when
that need is being met, we tend to respond positively to the person who
is meeting it."

I continued, "You understand that that hypothesis places all the
initiative in your hands. Glenn is not trying to work on this marriage.
You are. This hypothesis says that if you can channel your energies in
the right direction, there is a good possibility that Glenn will
eventually reciprocate." I read the other portion of Jesus' sermon
recorded by Luke, the physician. "'Give, and it will be given to you. A
good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be
poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured
to you.'

"As I understand that, Jesus is stating a principle, not a way to
manipulate people. Generally speaking, if we are kind and loving toward
people, they will tend to be kind and loving toward us. That does not
mean that we can make a person kind by being kind to him. We are
independent agents. Thus, we can spurn love and walk away from love or
even spit into the face of love. There is no guarantee that Glenn will
respond to your acts of love. We can only say that there is a good
possibility he will do so." (A counselor can never predict with absolute
certainty individual human behavior. Based on research and personality
studies, a counselor can only predict how a person is likely to respond
in a given situation.)

After we agreed on the hypothesis, I said to Ann, "Now let's discuss
your and Glenn's primary love languages. I'm assuming from what you have
told me already that quality time may be your primary love language.
What do you think?"

"I think so, Dr. Chapman. In the early days when we spent time together
and Glenn listened to me, we spent long hours talking together, doing
things together. I really felt loved. More than anything, I wish that
part of our marriage could return. When we spend time together, I feel
like he really cares, but when he's always doing other things, never has
time to talk, never has time to do anything with me, I feel like
business and other pursuits are more important than our relationship."

"And what do you think Glenn's primary love language is?" I inquired.

"I think it is physical touch and especially the sexual part of the
marriage. I know that when I felt more loved by him and we were more
sexually active, he had a different attitude. I think that's his primary
love language, Dr. Chapman."

"Does he ever complain about the way you talk to him?"

"Well, he says I nag him all the time. He also says that I don't support
him, that I'm always against his ideas."

"Then, let's assume," I said, "that 'Physical Touch' is his primary love
language and 'Words of Affirmation' is his secondary love language. The
reason I suggest the second is that if he complains about negative
words, apparently positive words would be meaningful to him.

"Now, let me suggest a plan to test our hypothesis. What if you go home
and say to Glenn, 'I've been thinking about us and I've decided that I
would like to be a better wife to you. So if you have any suggestions as
to how I could be a better wife, I want you to know that I am open to
them. You can tell me now or you can think about it and let me know what
you think, but I would really like to work on being a better wife.'
Whatever his response, negative or positive, simply accept it as
information. That initial statement lets him know that something
different is about to happen in your relationship.

[If you claim to have feelings that you do not have, that is
hypocritical.... But if you express an act of love that is designed for
the other person's benefit or pleasure, it is simply a choice.]{.italic}

"Then based upon your guess that his primary love language is 'Physical
Touch' and my suggestion that his secondary love language may be 'Words
of Affirmation,' focus your attention on those two areas for one month.

"If Glenn comes back with a suggestion as to how you might be a better
wife, accept that information and work it into your plan. Look for
positive things in Glenn's life and give him verbal affirmation about
those things. In the meantime, stop all verbal complaints. If you want
to complain about something, write it down in your personal notebook
rather than saying anything about it to Glenn this month.

"Begin taking more initiative in physical touch and sexual involvement.
Surprise him by being aggressive, not simply responding to his advances.
Set a goal to have sexual intercourse at least once a week the first two
weeks and twice a week the following two weeks." Ann had told me that
she and Glenn had had sexual intercourse only once or twice in the past
six months. I figured this plan would get things off dead center rather
quickly.

"Oh, Dr. Chapman, this is going to be difficult," Ann said. "I have
found it hard to be sexually responsive to him when he ignores me all
the time. I have felt used rather than loved in our sexual encounters.
He acts as though I am totally unimportant all the rest of the time and
then wants to jump in bed and use my body. I have resented that, and I
guess that's why we have not had sex very often in the last few years."

"Your response has been natural and normal," I assured Ann. "For most
wives, the desire to be sexually intimate with their husbands grows out
of a sense of being loved by their husbands. If they feel loved, then
they desire sexual intimacy. If they do not feel loved, they likely feel
used in the sexual context. That is why loving someone who is not loving
you is extremely difficult. It goes against our natural tendencies. You
will probably have to rely heavily upon your faith in God in order to do
this. Perhaps it will help if you read again Jesus' sermon on loving
your enemies, loving those who hate you, loving those who use you. And
then ask God to help you practice the teachings of Jesus."

I could tell that Ann was following what I was saying. Her head was
nodding ever so slightly. Her eyes told me she had lots of questions.

"But, Dr. Chapman, isn't it being hypocritical to express love sexually
when you have such negative feelings toward the person?"

"Perhaps it would be helpful for us to distinguish between love as a
feeling and love as an action," I said. "If you claim to have feelings
that you do not have, that is hypocritical and such false communication
is not the way to build intimate relationships. But if you express an
act of love that is designed for the other person's benefit or pleasure,
it is simply a choice. You are not claiming that the action grows out of
a deep emotional bonding. You are simply choosing to do something for
his benefit. I think that must be what Jesus meant.

"Certainly we do not have warm feelings for people who hate us. That
would be abnormal, but we can do loving acts for them. That is simply a
choice. We hope that such loving acts will have a positive effect upon
their attitudes and behavior and treatment, but at least we have chosen
to do something positive for them."

My answer seemed to satisfy Ann, at least for the moment. I had the
feeling that we would discuss that again. I also had the feeling that if
the experiment was going to get off the ground, it would be because of
Ann's deep faith in God.

"After the first month," I said, "I want you to ask Glenn for feedback
on how you are doing. Using your own words, ask him, 'Glenn, you
remember a few weeks ago when I told you I was going to try to be a
better wife? I want to ask how you think I am doing.'

"Whatever Glenn says, accept it as information. He may be sarcastic, he
may be flippant or hostile, or he may be positive. Whatever his
response, do not argue but accept it and assure him that you are serious
and that you really want to be a better wife, and if he has additional
suggestions, you are open to them.

"Follow this pattern of asking for feedback once a month for the entire
six months. Whenever Glenn gives you the first positive feedback,
whenever he says, 'You know, I have to admit that when you first told me
that you were going to try to be better, I pretty much laughed it off,
but I'll have to acknowledge that things are different around here,' you
will know that your efforts are getting through to him emotionally. He
may give you positive feedback after the first month, or it may be after
the second or third. One week after you receive the first positive
feedback, I want you to make a request of Glenn---something that you
would like him to do, something in keeping with your primary love
language. For example, you may say to him one evening, 'Glenn, do you
know something I would like to do? Do you remember how we used to play
Scrabble together? I'd like to play Scrabble with you on Thursday night.
The kids are going to be staying at Mary's. Do you think that would be
possible?'

"Make the request something specific, not general. Don't say, 'You know,
I wish we would spend more time together.' That's too vague. How will
you know when he's done it? But if you make your request specific, he
will know exactly what you want and you will know that, when he does it,
he is choosing to do something for your benefit.

"Make a specific request of him each month. If he does it, fine; if he
doesn't do it, fine. But when he does it, you will know that he is
responding to your needs. In the process, you are teaching him your
primary love language because the requests you make are in keeping with
your love language. If he chooses to begin loving you in your primary
language, your positive emotions toward him will begin to resurface.
Your emotional tank will begin to fill up and in time the marriage will,
in fact, be reborn."

[Perhaps you need a miracle in your own marriage. Why not try Ann's
experiment?]{.italic}

"Dr. Chapman, I would do anything if that could happen," Ann said.

"Well," I responded, "it will take a lot of hard work, but I believe
it's worth a try. I'm personally interested to see if this experiment
works and if our hypothesis is true. I would like to meet with you
regularly throughout this process---perhaps every two weeks---and I
would like you to keep records on the positive words of affirmation that
you give Glenn each week. Also, I would like you to bring me your list
of complaints that you have written in your notebook without stating
them to Glenn. Perhaps from the felt complaints, I can help you build
specific requests for Glenn that will help meet some of those
frustrations. Eventually, I want you to learn how to share your
frustrations and irritations in a constructive way, and I want you and
Glenn to learn how to work through those irritations and conflicts. But
during this six-month experiment, I want you to write them down without
telling Glenn."

Ann left, and I believed that she had the answer to her question: "Is it
possible to love someone whom you hate?"

In the next six months, Ann saw a tremendous change in Glenn's attitude
and treatment of her. The first month, he was flippant and treated the
whole thing lightly. But after the second month, he gave her positive
feedback about her efforts. In the last four months, he responded
positively to almost all of her requests, and her feelings for him began
to change drastically. Glenn never came for counseling, but he did
listen to some of my tapes and discuss them with Ann. He encouraged Ann
to continue her counseling, which she did for another three months after
our experiment. To this day, Glenn swears to his friends that I am a
miracle worker. I know in fact that love is a miracle worker.

\

[[[P]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}erhaps you need a miracle in your own
marriage. Why not try Ann's experiment? Tell your spouse that you have
been thinking about your marriage and have decided that you would like
to do a better job of meeting his/her needs. Ask for suggestions on how
you could improve. His suggestions will be a clue to his primary love
language. If he makes no suggestions, guess his love language based on
the things he has complained about over the years. Then, for six months,
focus your attention on that love language. At the end of each month,
ask your spouse for feedback on how you are doing and for further
suggestions.

Whenever your spouse indicates that he is seeing improvement, wait one
week and then make a specific request. The request should be something
you really want him to do for you. If he chooses to do it, you will know
that he is responding to your needs. If he does not honor your request,
continue to love him. Maybe next month he will respond positively. If
your spouse starts speaking your love language by responding to your
requests, your positive emotions toward him will return, and in time
your marriage will be reborn. I cannot guarantee the results, but scores
of people whom I have counseled have experienced the miracle of love.

[[[D]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}oes the concept of love languages
apply to children? I am often asked that question by those attending my
marriage seminars. My unqualified answer is yes. When children are
little, you don't know their primary love language. Therefore, pour on
all five and you are bound to hit it; but if you observe their behavior,
you can learn their primary love language rather early.

Bobby is six years old. When his father comes home from work, Bobby
jumps into his lap, reaches up, and messes up his father's hair. What is
Bobby saying to his father? "I want to be touched." He is touching his
father because he wants to be touched. Bobby's primary love language is
likely "Physical Touch."

Patrick lives next door to Bobby. He is five and a half, and he and
Bobby are playmates. Patrick's father, however, faces a different
scenario when he comes home from work. Patrick says excitedly, "Come
here, Daddy. I want to show you something. Come here."

His father says, "Just a minute, Patrick, I want to look at the paper."

Patrick leaves for a moment but is back in fifteen seconds, saying,
"Daddy, come to my room. I want to show you now, Daddy. I want to show
you now."

His father replies, "Just a minute, son. Let me finish reading."

Patrick's mother calls him, and he dashes off. His mother tells him that
his father is tired and please let him read the paper for a few minutes.
Patrick says, "But, Mommy, I want to show him what I made."

"I know," says his mother, "but let Dad read for a few minutes."

Sixty seconds later, Patrick is back to his father and instead of saying
anything, he jumps into his father's paper, laughing. His father says,
"What are you doing, Patrick?"

Patrick says, "I want you to come to my room, Daddy. I want to show you
what I made."

What is Patrick requesting? "Quality Time." He wants his father's
undivided attention, and he won't stop until he gets it, even if he must
create a scene.

\

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}f your child is often making presents
for you, wrapping them up and giving them to you with a special glee in
his or her eye, your child's primary love language is probably
"Receiving Gifts." He gives to you because he desires to receive. If you
observe your son or daughter always trying to help a younger brother or
sister, it probably means that his or her primary love language is "Acts
of Service." If he or she is often telling you how good you look and
what a good mother or father you are and what a good job you did, it is
an indicator that his or her primary love language is "Words of
Affirmation."

All of that is on the subconscious level for the child. That is, the
child is not consciously thinking, "If I give a gift, my parents will
give me a gift; if I touch, I will be touched," but her behavior is
motivated by her own emotional desires. Perhaps she has learned by
experience that when she does or says certain things, she typically
receives certain responses from her parents. Thus, she does or says that
which results in getting her own emotional needs met. If all goes well
and their emotional needs are met, children develop into responsible
adults; but if the emotional need is not met, they may violate
acceptable standards, expressing anger toward parents who did not meet
their needs, and seeking love in inappropriate places.

Dr. Ross Campbell, the psychiatrist who first told me about the
emotional love tank, says that in his many years of treating adolescents
who have been involved in sexual misconduct, he has never treated such
an adolescent whose emotional need for love has been met by the parents.
His opinion was that almost all sexual misconduct in adolescents is
rooted in an empty emotional love tank.

[Why is it that as the child gets older, our "Words of Affirmation" turn
to words of condemnation?]{.italic}

Have you seen that in your community? A teenager runs away from home.
The parents wring their hands, saying, "How could he do this to us after
all we have done for him?" but the teenager is sixty miles down the road
in some counselor's office, saying, "My parents don't love me. They have
never loved me. They love my brother, but they don't love me." Do the
parents, in fact, love that teenager? In the majority of cases, they do.
Then what's the problem? Very likely, the parents never learned how to
communicate love in a language the child could understand.

Perhaps they bought ball gloves and bicycles to show their love, but the
child was crying, "Will someone play ball with me? Will someone go
riding with me?" The difference between buying a ball glove and playing
ball with a child may be the difference between an empty love tank and a
full one. Parents can sincerely love their children (most do), but
sincerity is not enough. We must learn to speak the primary love
language of our children if we are to meet their emotional need for
love.

Let's look at the five love languages in the context of loving children.

[[W]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[ORDS OF]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
A]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[FFIRMATION]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

Parents typically give many affirming words when the child is young.
Even before the child understands verbal communication, parents are
saying, "What a pretty nose, what beautiful eyes, what curly hair," and
so on. When the child begins to crawl, we applaud every movement and
give "Words of Affirmation." When he begins to walk and stands with one
hand against the couch, we stand two feet away and say, "Come on, come
on, come on. That's right! Walk. That's right, walk." The child takes
half a step and falls and what do we say? We don't say, "You dumb kid,
can't you walk?" Rather, we say, "Yea, good job!" So he gets up and
tries again.

Why is it that as the child gets older, our "Words of Affirmation" turn
to words of condemnation? When the child is seven we walk into the room
and tell him to put the toys in the toy box. Twelve toys are on the
floor. We come back in five minutes and seven toys are in the box, and
what do we say? "I told you to get these toys up. If you don't get these
toys up, I am going to---" What about the seven toys in the box? Why
don't we say, "Yea, Johnny, you put seven toys in the box. That's
great." The other five would probably jump into the box! As the child
gets older, we tend to condemn him for his failures rather than commend
him for his successes.

To a child whose primary love language is "Words of Affirmation," our
negative, critical, demeaning words strike terror to her psyche.
Hundreds of thirty-five-year-old adults still hear words of condemnation
spoken twenty years ago ringing in their ears: "You're too fat; nobody
will ever date you." "You're not a student. You may as well drop out of
school." "I can't believe you are so dumb." "You are irresponsible and
will never amount to anything." Adults struggle with self-esteem and
feel unloved all their lives when their primary love language is
violated in such a detrimental manner.

[[Q]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[UALITY]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
T]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[IME]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

Quality time means giving a child undivided attention. For the small
child, it means sitting on the floor and rolling a ball back and forth
with him. We are talking about playing with cars or dolls. We are
talking about playing in the sandbox and building castles, getting into
his world, doing things with him. You may be into computers as an adult,
but your child lives in a child's world. You must get down on the
child's level if you eventually want to lead him to the adult world.

As the child gets older and develops new interests, you must enter into
those interests if you want to meet his needs. If he is into basketball,
get interested in basketball, spend time playing basketball with him,
take him to basketball games. If he is into piano, perhaps you could
take a piano lesson or at least listen with undivided attention for part
of his practice period. Giving a child your undivided attention says
that you care, that he is important to you, that you enjoy being with
him.

Many adults, looking back on childhood, do not remember much of what
their parents said, but they do remember what their parents did. One
adult said, "I remember that my father never missed my high school
games. I knew he was interested in what I was doing." For that adult,
"Quality Time" was an extremely important communicator of love. If
"Quality Time" is the primary love language of your child and you speak
that language, chances are he will allow you to spend quality time with
him even through the adolescent years. If you do not give him quality
time in the younger years, he will likely seek the attention of peers
during the adolescent years and turn away from parents who may at that
time desperately desire more time with their children.

[[R]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[ECEIVING]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
G]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[IFTS]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

Many parents and grandparents speak the language of gifts excessively.
In fact, when one visits toy stores, one wonders if parents believe that
is the only language of love. If parents have the money, they tend to
buy many gifts for their children. Some parents believe that that is the
best way to show love. Some parents try to do for their children what
their parents were unable to do for them. They buy things that they wish
they had had as a child. But unless that is the primary love language of
the child, gifts may mean little emotionally to the child. The parent
has good intentions, but he/she is not meeting the emotional needs of
the child by giving gifts.

If the gifts you give are quickly laid aside, if the child seldom says
"thank you," if the child does not take care of the gifts that you have
given, if she does not prize those gifts, chances are "Receiving Gifts"
is not her primary love language. If, on the other hand, your child
responds to you with much thanksgiving, if she shows others the gift and
tells others how wonderful you are for buying the gift, if she takes
care of the gift, if she puts it in a place of prominence in her room
and keeps it polished, if she plays with it often over an extended
period of time, then perhaps "Receiving Gifts" is her primary love
language.

What if you have a child for whom "Receiving Gifts" is his or her
primary love language but you cannot afford many gifts? Remember, it's
not the quality or cost of the gift; it is the "thought that counts."
Many gifts can be handmade, and sometimes the child appreciates that
gift more than an expensive, manufactured gift. In fact, younger
children will often play with a box more than the toy that came in it.
You can also find discarded toys and refinish them. The process of
refinishing can become a project for both parent and child. You need not
have lots of money in order to provide gifts for your children.

[[A]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[CTS OF]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
S]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[ERVICE]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

When children are small, parents are continually doing "Acts of Service"
for them. If they did not, the child would die. Bathing, feeding, and
dressing all require a great deal of work in the first few years of a
child's life. Then comes cooking, washing, and ironing. Then comes
packing lunches, running a taxi service, and helping with homework. Such
things are taken for granted by many children, but for other children
those things communicate love.

[Observe your children. Watch how they express love to others. That is a
clue to their love language.]{.italic}

If your child is often expressing appreciation for ordinary acts of
service, that is a clue that they are emotionally important to him or
her. Your acts of service are communicating love in a meaningful way.
When you help him with a science project, it means more than a good
grade. It means "My parent loves me." When you fix a bicycle, you do
more than get him back on wheels. You send him away with a full tank. If
your child consistently offers to help you with your work projects, it
probably means that in his mind that is a way of expressing love, and
"Acts of Service" likely is his primary love language.

[[P]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[HYSICAL]{.bold}]{.calibre4}[[
T]{.bold}]{.calibre6}[[OUCH]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

We have long known that "Physical Touch" is an emotional communicator to
children. Research has shown that babies who are handled often develop
better emotionally than babies who are not. Naturally many parents and
other adults pick up an infant, hold it, cuddle it, kiss it, squeeze it,
and speak silly words to it. Long before the child understands the
meaning of the word [love,]{.italic} she feels loved. Hugging, kissing,
patting, holding hands are all ways of communicating love to a child.
The hugging and kissing of a teenager will differ from the hugging and
kissing of an infant. Your teenager may not appreciate such behavior in
the presence of peers, but that doesn't mean that he does not want to be
touched, especially if it is his primary love language.

If your teenager is regularly coming up behind you and grabbing your
arms, lightly pushing you, grabbing you by the ankle when you walk
through the room, tripping you, those are all indications that "Physical
Touch" is important to him.

Observe your children. Watch how they express love to others. That is a
clue to their love language. Take note of the things they request of
you. Many times, their request will be in keeping with their own love
language. Notice the things for which they are most appreciative. Those
are likely indicators of their primary love language.

Our daughter's love language is "Quality Time"; thus, as she grew up,
she and I often took walks together. During her high school years while
she attended Salem Academy, one of the oldest girls' academies in the
country, we took walks amid the quaint surroundings of Old Salem. The
Moravians have restored the village, which is more than two hundred
years old. Walking the cobblestone streets takes one back to a simpler
time. Strolling through the ancient cemetery gives one a sense of
reality about life and death. In those years, we walked three afternoons
a week and had long discussions in that austere setting. She is a
medical doctor now, but when she comes home, she almost always says,
"Want to take a walk, Dad?" I have never refused her invitation.

My son would never walk with me. He said, "Walking's dumb! You're not
going anywhere. If you're going somewhere, drive."

"Quality Time" was not his primary love language. As parents, we often
try to pour all of our children into the same mold. We go to parenting
conferences or read books on parenting, get some wonderful ideas, and
want to go home and practice with each child. The problem is that each
child is different, and what communicates love to one child may not
communicate love to another. Forcing a child to take a walk with you so
that you can spend quality time together will not communicate love. We
must learn to speak our children's language if we want them to feel
loved.

\

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6} believe that most parents sincerely
love their children. I also believe that thousands of parents have
failed to communicate love in the proper language and thousands of
children in this country are living with an empty emotional tank. I
believe that most misbehavior in children and teenagers can be traced to
empty love tanks.

It is never too late to express love. If you have older children and
realize that you have been speaking the wrong love language, why not
tell them? "You know, I have been reading a book on how to express love,
and I realize that I have not been expressing my love to you in the best
way through the years. I have tried to show you my love by
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, but I'm now realizing that that probably has not
communicated love to you, that your love language is probably something
different. I am beginning to think that your love language is probably
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. You know, I really do love you, and I hope that in the
future I can express it to you in better ways." You might even want to
explain the five love languages to them and discuss your love language
as well as theirs.

Perhaps you do not feel loved by your older children. If they are old
enough to understand the concept of love languages, your discussion may
open their eyes. You may be surprised at their willingness to start
speaking your love language and, if they do, you might be surprised at
the way your feelings and attitudes toward them begin to change. When
family members start speaking each other's primary love language, the
emotional climate of a family is greatly enhanced.

W]{.bold}]{.calibre3}[[ORD]{.bold}]{.calibre4}

[[[I]{.bold}]{.italic}]{.calibre6}n chapter 2, I warned the reader that
"understanding the five love languages and learning to speak the primary
love language of your spouse may radically affect his or her behavior."
Now I ask, "What do you think?" Having read these pages, walked in and
out of the lives of several couples, visited small villages and large
cities, sat with me in the counseling office, and talked with people in
restaurants, what do you think? Could these concepts radically alter the
emotional climate of your marriage? What would happen if you discovered
the primary love language of your spouse and chose to speak it
consistently?

Neither you nor I can answer that question until you have tried it. I
know that many couples who have heard this concept at my marriage
seminars say that choosing to love and expressing it in the primary love
language of their spouse has made a drastic difference in their
marriage. When the emotional need for love is met, it creates a climate
where the couple can deal with the rest of life in a much more
productive manner.

We each come to marriage with a different personality and history. We
bring emotional baggage into our marriage relationship. We come with
different expectations, different ways of approaching things, and
different opinions about what matters in life. In a healthy marriage,
that variety of perspectives must be processed. We need not agree on
everything, but we must find a way to handle our differences so that
they do not become divisive. With empty love tanks, couples tend to
argue and withdraw, and some may tend to be violent verbally or
physically in their arguments. But when the love tank is full, we create
a climate of friendliness, a climate that seeks to understand, that is
willing to allow differences and to negotiate problems. I am convinced
that no single area of marriage affects the rest of marriage as much as
meeting the emotional need for love.

The ability to love, especially when your spouse is not loving you, may
seem impossible for some. Such love may require us to draw upon our
spiritual resources. A number of years ago, as I faced my own marital
struggles, I rediscovered my need for God. As an anthropologist, I had
been trained to examine data. I decided to personally excavate the roots
of the Christian faith. Examining the historical accounts of Christ's
birth, life, death, and resurrection, I came to view His death as an
expression of love and His resurrection as profound evidence of His
power. I became a true "believer." I committed my life to Him and have
found that He provides the inner spiritual energy to love, even when
love is not reciprocated. I would encourage you to make your own
investigation of the one whom, as He died, prayed for those who killed
Him: "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do." That is
love's ultimate expression.

The high divorce rate in our country bears witness that thousands of
married couples have been living with an empty emotional love tank. The
growing number of adolescents who run away from home and clash with the
law indicates that many parents who may have sincerely tried to express
love to their children have been speaking the wrong love language. I
believe that the concepts in this book could make an impact upon the
marriages and families of our country.

I have not written this book as an academic treatise to be stored in the
libraries of colleges and universities, although I hope that professors
of sociology and psychology will find it helpful in courses on marriage
and family life. I have written not to those who are studying marriage
but to those who are married, to those who have experienced the "in
love" euphoria, who entered marriage with lofty dreams of making each
other supremely happy but in the reality of day-to-day life are in
danger of losing that dream entirely. It is my hope that thousands of
those couples will not only rediscover their dream but will see the path
to making their dreams come true.

I dream of a day when the potential of the married couples in this
country can be unleashed for the good of humankind, when husbands and
wives can live life with full emotional love tanks and reach out to
accomplish their potential as individuals and as couples. I dream of a
day when children can grow up in homes filled with love and security,
where children's developing energies can be channeled to learning and
serving rather than seeking the love they did not receive at home. It is
my desire that this brief volume will kindle the flame of love in your
marriage and in the marriages of thousands of other couples like you.

If it were possible, I would hand this book personally to every married
couple in this country and say, "I wrote this for you. I hope it changes
your life. And if it does, be sure to give it to someone else." Since I
cannot do that, I would be pleased if you would give a copy of this book
to your family, to your brothers and sisters, to your married children,
to your employees, to those in your civic club or church or synagogue.
Who knows, together we may see our dream come true.

primary love language. Then again, you may have no clue. The Five Love
Languages Profile will help you know for certain which love language is
yours---Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of

The profile consists of 30 pairs of statements. You can only pick one
statement in each pair as the one that best represents your desire. Read
each pair of statements, and then, in the right-hand column, circle the
letter that matches up with the statement you choose. It may be tough at
times to decide between two statements, but you should only choose one
per pair to ensure the most accurate profile results.

Allow at least 15 to 30 minutes to complete the profile. Take it when
you are relaxed, and try not to rush through it. Once you've made your
selections, go back and count the number of times you circled each
individual letter. You can list the results in the appropriate spaces at
the end of the profile.

Your primary love language is the one that received the highest score.
You are "bilingual" and have two primary love languages if point totals
are equal for any two love languages. If your second highest scoring
love language is close in score but not equal to your primary love
language, then this simply means that both expressions of love are
important to you. The highest possible score for any one love language
is 12.

You may have scored certain ones of the love languages more highly than
others, but do not dismiss those other languages as insignificant. Your
wife may express love in those ways, and it will be helpful to you to
understand this about her.

In the same way, it will benefit your wife to know your love language
and express her affection for you in ways that you interpret as love.
Every time you or your wife speak each other's language, you score
emotional points with one another. Of course, this isn't a game with a
scorecard! The payoff of speaking each other's love language is a
greater sense of connection. This translates into better communication,
increased understanding, and, ultimately, improved romance.

If your wife has not already done so, encourage her to take The Five
Love Languages Profile for Wives, which is available on page 199.
Discuss your respective love languages, and use this insight to improve
your marriage!
