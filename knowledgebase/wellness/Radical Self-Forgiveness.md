>
> #### THE JUDGING AND SELF-LOVING SELVES {.calibre_10}
>
> [You are probably most familiar with the resident judge, because
> that's the one with the loudest voice and is relentless in its effort
> to make you wrong and force you to accept a huge weight of guilt,
> irrespective of whether you're at fault. It never stops. Your critical
> parent is not quite so insistent, but it will treat you like a small
> child, always scolding you and withholding love as punishment for what
> it perceives as your constant wrongdoing. This one specializes in
> shaming you and is the one who delights in dragging down your
> self-esteem. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [Your inner lover is overshadowed and crowded out by these other two,
> which is why it is probably a lot less familiar to you. You might even
> be surprised that you even have an inner lover. This is the part of
> your human self that lives in your heart and will, for the most part
> anyway, love you no matter what you do. It remains incredibly tolerant
> of your shortcomings and forgiving of your mistakes, even when they
> are big ones. It has a huge amount of compassion for you and
> empathizes with whatever you are feeling. It understands you
> completely at the emotional level. It knows and identifies with your
> fears, your anxieties, your joys, your dreams, your loves, your
> disappointments, and so on. It also knows how to pull together all the
> other selves in support of your true emotional character. It is,
> therefore, the great "mediator self." ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [So, given the fact that there are these different personalities
> within you, it could be possible to meet the requirement that we need
> one who is potentially forgiven (an object), if you can find a
> forgiver (the subject) from the same source. Is it possible that some
> characters on the committee might agree to bestow forgiveness upon
> you? Yes, but can you really imagine the resident judge and the
> critical parent being anxious to do so? Hell no! And guess who holds
> sway on that committee of yours? No other characters are going against
> these two! They have too much power, and they will always drown out
> the inner lover. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [Neither the resident judge nor the critical parent will have any
> compassion for you, nor even tolerance or understanding. Their only
> interest is in being self-righteous and making you wrong, so of course
> they are not going to forgive you. Neither one cares whether the guilt
> is appropriate or inappropriate, and they will accept no excuses. They
> will assume your guilt is a given and will beat you to death with it.
> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [So, even though we now have a subject (your resident judge and
> critical parent acting as one) and object (your inner lover), if your
> only chance of being forgiven depends on whether these two tyrants
> respond favorably to the entreaties of your inner lover, you're still

> prejudices, and other content that exists at the subconscious level.

> planning is not in accordance with every belief that already exists in
> your subconscious. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [For instance, if, as a consequence of having witnessed your parents'
> abusive marriage, you have concluded that marriage is not good, your

> as the M-word enters the conversation. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [It's the same with money. If you believe that money has negative

> rich---its only concern is with being right. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [Once again, though, as with the disowned self, your beliefs,

>
> [So, taking the first of our two examples---the idea that "marriage is

> heart-to-heart talk with your saboteur self about making some dramatic

> [Nowhere is the saboteur more commonly operative than in the area of

> [Sometimes the saboteur is caught napping, and people experience an

> person will have a really good year. Almost invariably, though, this
> increase is followed by a dramatic drop the next year. From then on,

> [When we have a fear of success, which a lot of people do, our

> child is used to. He or she notices that the mother is showing signs

> problem---it's their problem. If they don't like it, you could easily
> and justifiably tell them to go take a hike! But in your early years,

> comprises five stages. Every one of the tools that this technology
> provides guides us through these five stages. They are the same for
> both forgiving others and forgiving self. Let's now examine them in
> more detail. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> #### STAGE 1: TELLING THE STORY {.calibre_10}
>
> [Whether we are a victim or a perpetrator of a wrongdoing, we will
> always have a story about what happened. All of the pain and suffering
> will be contained in the story, so having that story heard, witnessed,
> and validated is the first step in creating the space for forgiveness
> or self-forgiveness to occur. From this point on, for the sake of
> clarity, I will refer only to how this process works for
> self-forgiveness. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [When telling the story, even if you are telling it to yourself by
> using one of the technologies contained herein, it is important not to
> overlay the victim/perpetrator story with any spiritual
> interpretations. You must pretend to know nothing at all about Radical
> Self-Forgiveness at this stage. Nor should you make excuses for
> yourself or attempt to explain the situation in ways that would tend
> to justify your actions. Don't even try to distinguish between
> appropriate and inappropriate guilt at this point. All of those things
> come in later stages. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [It is during this stage that you give your judging self full reign to
> rant and rave against you for what it thinks you have done wrong. This
> is the judging self's great moment, so let your judging self have it.
> It needs to be heard and validated, loved and accepted, just like any
> other part of you. You will no doubt hear the voice of the critical
> parent, as well. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> #### STAGE 2: FEELING THE FEELINGS {.calibre_10}
>
> [Every perpetrator story has a bundle of emotion attached to it. Yes,
> guilt and shame will be the primary feelings, but anger, fear, regret,
> remorse, and a whole host of other similar emotions will be right up
> there with the guilt and shame. Whatever they are, the important thing
> is to feel them fully. You cannot heal what you don't feel.
> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [The definition of an emotion is "a thought attached to a feeling,"
> but the bond between the thought and the feeling is very tight. You
> cannot break that bond simply by trying to change the thought alone,
> as in talk therapy or other similar modalities---the feeling component
> is the part that forms the bond, not the thought. Before the feeling
> can release the thought, and before an alternative thought can be
> emotionally accepted in its place, the feeling has to be
> reexperienced. It need not be experienced with the same intensity as
> originally felt, but it must at least be engaged in some way.
> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [It helps to realize, too, that there is no such thing as a negative
> feeling. Feelings such as guilt, shame, fear, anger, sadness, or grief
> are not negative. They are simply normal human emotions we all feel
> from time to time to varying degrees. Labeling them as negative
> results in our struggling against them, trying to "think positive," or
> denying them. This only leads us to suppress, repress, and project
> them onto others, onto our own bodies, or onto situations. Resistance
> to any of our human emotions creates serious internal stress and
> ultimately causes disease. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [Another way to resist feelings is to engage in constructing a [
> spiritual bypass.]{.italic} Many people, especially those who think of
> themselves as spiritual, think that feelings are to be meditated away,
> rather than felt. It's important to acknowledge that many people in
> helping professions are also bypassers, addicted to helping others as
> a way of avoiding their own feelings and emotional pain. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [Having been blessed with the capability to feel our emotions, it is
> natural that we should want the full experience of them. This means
> feeling them---not talking about them, analyzing them, or labeling
> them. When we do not allow ourselves to experience the full range of
> emotions but suppress them instead, our souls create situations in
> which we are [ forced]{.italic} to feel them. Have you noticed that
> people are often given opportunities to feel intense emotions just
> after having prayed for spiritual growth? ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [This idea suggests that the whole point of creating an upset may
> simply lie in our soul's desire to provide an opportunity for us to
> properly feel emotion. That being the case, simply allowing ourselves
> to have the feeling might let the energy move through us and cause the
> so-called problem to disappear immediately. This often happens. It's
> important to note that not all situations are dissolved so easily.
> When we have committed a crime regarded as unforgivable, such as
> sexual abuse, rape, theft, murder, and so on, it takes more than just
> experiencing our emotions to get to the point where we can truly
> forgive ourselves, radically or otherwise. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> #### STAGE 3: COLLAPSING THE STORY {.calibre_10}
>
> [Completing this step represents the end of the line as far as
> traditional forgiveness is concerned. This is because traditional
> forgiveness makes its appeal to the human self, and so the process
> must end at this point---there's nowhere else to go. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [It is in this third step that we ask the judging self to give way to
> the self-loving self. We need it to bring some heart-centered energy
> to the situation. It's the self-loving self's job at this stage to say
> to the judging self: [ "Yes, but have some compassion for me and try
> to understand why I did what I did. Yes, I am a flawed human being,
> and I did something wrong, but if those who are judging me could
> imagine what it might have been like for them, had they been walking

> #### THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE I AM SELF {.calibre_10}
>
> [Whereas the energy driving mental and emotional intelligence emanates
> from the ego and is relatively coarse in nature, Spiritual
> Intelligence emanates from our I Am Self and is much finer and
> infinitely more subtle than the other two. Also, unlike the other two,
> it operates below the level of our awareness. It knows the truth of
> who we are and connects us to the World of Spirit and Universal
> Intelligence (God). Our bodies are the antennae for our Spiritual
> Intelligence. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [Spiritual Intelligence guides us on our spiritual journey, always
> moving us in the direction of growth and healing. It is our internal
> spiritual compass and keeps us on track with our divine plan. It finds
> its outer expression in our everyday lives in the form of religious or
> spiritual practice, the search for meaning beyond this reality,
> contemplation and meditation, prayer, and so on. It is not bound by
> time and space. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [When we ask for help from our I Am Self, that's when our Spiritual
> Intelligence comes to the fore. Of the three forms of intelligence, it
> is the only one that can connect directly with the I Am Self and the
> Divine. Since the tools and processes of Radical Forgiveness are
> designed to activate our Spiritual Intelligence, they provide a
> perfect way to ask for such divine assistance, even if we are
> genuinely skeptical about the whole idea. Without Spiritual
> Intelligence, "real" forgiveness---of self or otherwise---would not be
> achieved. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> #### SECULAR PRAYER {.calibre_10}
>
> [When I first created the Radical Forgiveness Worksheet, I did not
> realize that it was in fact a form of what I now call "secular
> prayer." I didn't know that its purpose was to communicate with our
> Spiritual Intelligence and, furthermore, that it, and all the other
> tools that followed, actually moved spiritual energy and worked
> immediately to change peoples' lives. I soon discovered, however, that
> not only did it alter the lives of the people using it, it had a
> positive impact on much of what was causing the problems in the first
> place, often in ways that were simply amazing. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [At first blush, the term [ secular prayer]{.italic} seems to be an
> oxymoron, since the Radical Forgiveness technology does not require
> you to have a belief in God. This would seem to preclude it from being
> a form of prayer, since to whom does one pray if not to God? However,
> to say that a belief in God is not necessary doesn't mean that you
> need not have a belief in some kind of power greater than yourself,
> which will likely become active in your life at the spiritual level
> when necessary. That much, at least, is required---even if you
> conceive of that power as being nothing more than your own Higher
> Self. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [There is no requirement, however, that we know what that power is or
> how it operates. And we are certainly not obligated to accept anyone
> else's view on such topics. Since there's no definition that must be
> attached to it other than one's own personal ideas, Spiritual
> Intelligence can legitimately be thought of as a secular/metaphysical
> notion, assuming one chooses to see it that way. And yet, while the
> notion of secular prayer distinguishes Spiritual Intelligence from any
> particular religious or spiritual belief system, it is also true that
> people who employ a specific belief system find it easy to fit the
> Radical Forgiveness system into their existing beliefs. The process is
> extremely flexible in this regard, and allows us to simply use
> whatever notion of a Higher Power resonates most appropriately.
> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> #### BE OPEN, YET SKEPTICAL {.calibre_10}
>
> [Another interesting thing I discovered was that the only thing
> required of a person doing the Radical Self-Forgiveness work is a
> willingness to be open to the possibility that, no matter how he or
> she thinks of it, Spiritual Intelligence can be accessed and used for
> good in his or her life simply by soliciting its guidance using the
> tools of Radical Forgiveness. When we make such requests, it is still
> a form of prayer, albeit of a more secular nature. Some sort of Higher
> Power is being invoked, even if we have no particular religious belief
> or a developed concept of what that Higher Power might be. And the
> effects of secular prayer can be the same as prayers to one's
> God---the only difference being in the manner of our asking. From a
> practical standpoint, since we see dramatic results when we use the
> Radical Self-Forgiveness tools, we can say that Radical Forgiveness
> connects us to the Divine in much the same way as traditional prayer,
> probably because both employ the services of our Spiritual
> Intelligence. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> #### NO SPIRITUAL AMNESIA {.calibre_10}
>
> [No matter how we choose to conceive of the process by which we
> connect to the Divine, employing the term [ Spiritual
> Intelligence]{.italic} gives us a way to think about how the
> connection is maintained and how communication with our Higher Power
> is facilitated during our life as a human being. When we agreed to
> incarnate and subscribe to particular life lessons in order to further
> our souls' evolution, we fully understood the need to forget about the
> spirit world from which we had come and to have what I call "spiritual
> amnesia." Without such amnesia, it would be impossible for us to
> participate in the game of life as intended. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [However, Spiritual Intelligence is a part of our psyche that is not
> subject to spiritual amnesia. It has always known the truth of who we
> are and remembers the divine plan for our lives. It also remains in

>
> #### THE EGO AS OUR GUIDE {.calibre_10}
>
> [Our Spiritual Intelligence works with the ego to create the
> circumstances of our lives, whether those that were decided prior to
> incarnation or those that were adopted opportunistically along the
> way. Our ego works with our Spiritual Intelligence to convince us that
> life, as we understand it, is real and that living in the world means
> trying to control as many aspects of it as possible. To this end, the
> ego tells us to strive to earn as much money as possible in order to
> become successful and accumulate as much material wealth as we can.
> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [Ego tells us that the world is a dangerous place, that we can't
> really trust anyone else, and that it's a dog-eat-dog world. It tells
> us that life is a game of chance, has no real meaning, and is chaotic.
> We're essentially encouraged to live our lives from this shaky place
> and to continuously operate out of fear. Such a perspective is
> entirely purposeful, in the spiritual sense, in that it helps provide
> opportunities for us to experience the pain of separation. This is the
> basic lesson all human selves are here to learn---the nature of
> oneness. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [Marshall McLuhan once famously said, "The last one to discover water
> is likely to be the fish." By that he meant that many who are totally
> immersed in a particular environment are completely unaware of it,
> which means that the only way to appreciate an experience is to be
> exposed to the opposite of it. For example, you cannot appreciate what
> darkness is until you have experienced light. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> #### THE PURPOSE OF THE SOUL'S JOURNEY {.calibre_10}
>
> [So, in order to fully appreciate being in a state of oneness with
> Universal Intelligence, we must come into the human experience and
> this world of duality in order to know the opposite of
> oneness---separation. To truly experience this separation, not just as
> an idea but as an emotion---the definition of which is a thought
> attached to a feeling---we need a body. Without a body we would have
> no way of experiencing the emotional pain of separation, which is the
> whole purpose of the operation. Once we've experienced the necessary
> amount of separation, our Spiritual Intelligence allows us to begin
> awakening to the truth that this is our soul's journey and that
> everything we have been experiencing has a particular purpose.
> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [The goal of the ego, then, working through our Spiritual
> Intelligence, is to slowly and methodically guide us through any
> predetermined lessons, which are seen as perfect ways to experience
> separation---betrayal, rejection, abandonment, abuse, rape, war,
> genocide, racial discrimination, and so on. It is also the job of the
> ego to see to it that the last piece of drama we create brings us to
> what can be seen as a breakdown phase. This breakdown experience is
> the signal for our Spiritual Intelligence to begin prompting us from
> deep within to ask such questions as the following: ]{.calibre_3}

> [Whenever we have done something wrong and have caused harm or stress

>
> [However, once again, we need to understand that just as there are two

> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> #### THE ORDINARY APOLOGY {.calibre_10}
>
> [An ordinary apology recognizes that a person was in some way damaged
> because of intentional wrongdoing on our part. It is a direct
> communication to the aggrieved party that we feel sorrow, guilt, and
> regret about the action or event and that we want to somehow make
> amends. This acknowledgment on our part may also be an appeal for
> forgiveness, although we must ensure that our apology doesn't become a
> form of manipulation. Apologies can easily become conditional and
> based upon our being forgiven, which means that they become more about
> us rather than the injured party. In other words, we apologize because
> we want to feel better. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [It's important to note that ordinary apologies carry no undertone or
> recognition of an underlying spiritual purpose for what took place. If
> we were living in a fully awakened world where everyone was aware of
> the spiritual purpose behind all actions, there would be no need for
> an apology in the normal sense of the word, since nothing wrong ever
> happens. But we are not at that level of awakening yet---not by a long
> way---so apologies are still appropriate. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [However, as individuals begin to awaken to the nature of the soul's
> journey and the divine purpose within everything, we also experience a
> subtle shift in how we make an apology. It's not that we say or do
> anything much differently than before; it's how we approach it that's
> different. I call this a Radical Apology. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> #### THE RADICAL APOLOGY {.calibre_10}
>
> [A Radical Apology recognizes that someone was hurt and that this is
> something to be truly sorrowful for---perhaps even [
> appropriately]{.italic} guilty about. We also accept full
> responsibility for what happened in human and worldly terms and are
> willing to be accountable for what we have done. At the same time,
> however, we are open to the possibility that some higher purpose was
> being served and that it had to happen that way for some particular
> reason. We are, in effect, seeing the situation simultaneously from
> the perspective of both the World of Spirit and the World of Humanity.
> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [We do not, however, communicate this perspective as part of our
> apology. It would seriously dilute our efforts in the eyes of the
> receiver, even if he or she had a similar metaphysical understanding,
> and would sound like an attempt to mitigate our pain and our guilt. We
> must be cautious about appearing to use spirituality as a way to avoid
> accountability and responsibility---a spiritual bypass, as we say.
> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [Internally holding and honoring this perspective, however, will raise
> your own vibration. Remember, guilt and shame are very low vibrations.
> A willingness to be open to seeing spiritual perfection is a high
> vibration. The injured party will feel this vibration at some level
> and connect with it energetically. Such a connection has the ability
> to release the low-vibration energy tied up in the situation itself,
> thus enabling healing to occur more rapidly than with an ordinary
> apology. This type of healing will also contribute to an overall rise
> in consciousness such that, in the future, there will be less need for
> similar things to occur. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [The sorrow and regret that are implied in any genuine apology are
> just as real with the Radical Apology. We feel this sorrow not so much
> because the wrong happened, but because the person, a fellow human
> being, was hurt or damaged. Acknowledging this sorrow opens the energy
> for Radical Forgiveness---especially for the victim. Therefore, a
> Radical Apology is a bridge to Radical Forgiveness and reconciliation.
> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [The Radical Apology practice is also a step toward clearing our
> shadow. By simply bringing forth some rather unsavory parts of
> ourselves in committing this crime against someone else, we find love
> and acceptance for aspects within our own shadow that may have
> otherwise remained buried. In making the Radical Apology, we actually
> forgive ourselves for all of these hidden sources of shame.
> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [The same is true for corporations, religious organizations,
> governments, and even countries. They all have their own shadows, many

> [The interesting thing about this is that a country's shadow material

> [Born in England in 1941, Colin Tipping was raised during the war and
> in early post-war Britain by working-class parents. By his own
> account, his parents were good people, loving and hardworking, and he
> considers himself blessed in having had a stable and enjoyable
> childhood in spite of the social hardships of the time. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [Even as a boy, he seemed to inspire the trust of people who needed to
> talk about their feelings, as they found in him a person who would
> listen and not judge. After a four-year stint in the Royal Air Force,
> he became a high school teacher and a college professor, but even then
> often found himself sought out to provide counseling for people.
> ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [He has three children from his first marriage, which ended in divorce
> after seven years. A second marriage lasted only four, but he
> nevertheless remains friends with both ex-wives. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [He immigrated to America in 1984 and shortly thereafter became
> certified as a clinical hypnotherapist. He liked hypnotherapy because,
> after some years of experience, he concluded it sped up the therapy by
> a factor of at least three. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [He was not religious then and still feels "free" of any organized
> religious dogma. His spirituality is essentially practical and
> down-to-earth, simple, free, and open-ended. ]{.calibre_3}
>
> [In 1992, he and his wife, JoAnn, who he met in Atlanta and married in
> 1990, created a series of healing retreats in the north Georgia
> mountains for people challenged by cancer. In recognizing that lack of
> forgiveness was a big part of the causation, they set about refining a
> new form of forgiveness that later was to become what is now
> recognized as Radical Forgiveness. Unlike traditional forgiveness,
> which takes many years and is universally seen as very difficult to
> achieve, this had to be be quick, easy to do, simple, and
> therapy-free. ]{.calibre_3}

> [In 1997, Colin wrote the first edition of [ Radical
> Forgiveness,]{.italic} and began doing workshops in January 1998. He
> now has an Institute for Radical Forgiveness in the United States,
> Australia, Poland, and Germany. He has no plans to retire.
