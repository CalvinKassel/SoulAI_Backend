to tackle the problem once and for all. When your home is jammed with
stuff, you might feel a discomfort and pressure. There is no doubt,
clutter can really influence the way you live and work. Your clutter

collectibles, these things reflect your passion. If your space is jammed
with book clutter, it reveals your personality. However, do not settle
with living in a messy home. You deserve better! Consequently, your
question is "Where do I start?" We all know how annoying clutter can be.

seem like a daunting and never-ending task. Honestly, who has time and
energy to declutter the entire house in one go? Luckily, the solution is

are just what you need now. There are simple life hacks for decluttering
your entire house that will save you time and energy. Set the mood with
your favorite music and get to work! Try to break down the job into a
few small manageable tasks and avoid discouragement and tiredness.
Divide your entire house into a few zones like this: a. entryway, b.
kitchen, c. bathroom d. living room, e. dining room, f. bedroom, g.
children's room, h. pet area, i. laundry room,

j. garage. Next, divide these areas into smaller parts. It could be one
shelf, one closet, a wall, and so on. As you probably already know, it's
easy to let our house turn chaotic. Stick to simple rules to streamline
your living space. It will be easy because the same basic rules for
decluttering work for any room. Now, focus on one area at a time. Each
and every item should fit into one of these zones. If you find some
items that don't fit into one of these designated "zones", consider
donating or tossing them. It's just that simple! There is an old adage:
"It is better to take many small steps in the right direction than to
make a great leap forward only to stumble backward." This book contains
365 simple and quick decluttering tasks that you can handle easily and
effortlessly. Everything big and meaningful starts with baby steps. Here
are a few declutter guidelines to help you stay on track. a. Schedule a
decluttering day; b. Take small simple steps to reach your goal. Start
with just fifteen minutes each day. Once you've gotten a part of your
house decluttered, take the time to celebrate your small win and enjoy
this uncluttered look. Remember -- each small win is an accomplishment
unto itself. c. Keep moving. Take another fifteen minutes the next day.
And so on. Before you know it, you will have uncluttered and organized a
whole room! Close your eyes and spend a few minutes visualizing your
uncluttered home. Think about how you want your home to look. Don't
limit yourself and let your imagination run wild! Here are a few smart
strategies for you. 1. Get essential decluttering tools ready. These are
trash boxes and bags, donate boxes and the right organizers.

1.  Find the right organizers like boxes, tote bags, hutches, and the
    other appropriate containers. Sort and declutter through your home:
    then, go out and buy a storage piece.

1. Consider buying double-duty furniture pieces.

1.  Here's a great trick. Take a picture of your room. Then, move just
    one or two items. Take a picture again. What does it look like?
    Better?
2.  Don't force and rush yourself. You can create a "maybe" box if you
    are not sure. There is a time for everything, so take a deep breath.
    It's completely normal to feel down sometimes. However, it's
    important to make progress, a little bit every day. Be a student of
    life! You can start clearing and decluttering your entryway. For
    example, pick a part of your mudroom closet. It doesn't matter what
    part of the closet. It could be just one shelf. Toss unwanted things
    and leave the shelf looking neatly organized. Find a place for your
    essentials. Display your favorites. Then, keep moving. Choose the
    another room and repeat the same procedure. Take your time to enjoy
    the new look. Tomorrow is a new day! A beautiful, uncluttered and
    well-organized home is the result of the work of all household
    members. However, if you live with those who do not want to work
    together, it would be difficult to manage. Then, if you live with a
    pack-rat, the situation could become even worse. You want to make
    changes and get organized and they do not want it at all. You tend
    to organize a simple lifestyle, but they gather things and spend a
    lot of money. And you can face a terrible mess! Luckily, every
    problem has a solution! Have an honest conversation with your family
    members or roommate. Try to understand their needs, try to be
    encouraging rather than nagging and negative. Do not judge and stop
    trying to convince someone to do her/his household chore. Set the
    standard, but do not tell people how to live their lives. Don't be
    afraid to express your feelings and show by example -- it is the
    most effective way to get others to follow you. Teach them to love
    uncluttered house! "If you would convince a man that he does wrong,
    do right. But do not care to convince him. Men will believe what
    they see. Let them see." ― Henry

David Thoreau And they will see very quickly -- they spend less time
cleaning and maintaining things! Remember -- nobody's perfect. Teach
your child that he/she doesn't need stuff to be happy. Your children
learn by the "monkey see, monkey do" method. So you have to set a good
example and find a creative and fun way to involve your kids in the
process. Step into a wonderful world of freedom and beauty hiding behind
all that mess!

ENTRYWAY

Entryway makeover Your entryway is the first place that guests see when
they enter your house. There are perfect solutions that can make an
efficient entry area. Learn to love the uncluttered look of your
entryway. Life is beautiful when you have simple tricks up your sleeve!

1. Use it or lose it! There is an old American adage "A place for
everything and everything in its place". This is so true. The key is to
establish a storage spot for every single object in your entryway.
Simplify your life. Determine the essentials and find them their home.
Clean the clutter out of your entryway once and for all. This rule
applies to all rooms without exception. Even for the basement and attic.
2. Consider adding mudroom. Do you have a hall closet jammed with
clutter? Here are a few life hacks for decluttering and cleaning out
your hall closet. a. While you are going through this mess, ask
yourself: Do I really need all these things in my hall closet? Is
anything in this area unused? Toss unwanted items. You can donate some
of them to a homeless shelter. b. Anyway, if you have a lot of items and
you can't get rid of them, consider adding a mudroom. The overburdened
hall closet is something quite normal for most families. However, you
can conquer your hall closet. If you are able, you can build a small
room around your front door. It could have walls of glass with charming
shelves for potted plants. So you will spend less time cleaning and
maintaining things.

3.  Mudroom organizing idea: Table with drawers.

Your mudroom can be one of the most challenging rooms to keep organized.
All year round. You and your kids bring lots of junk home. Umbrellas,
shopping bags, briefcases, newspapers, all of these items have a way of
getting dumped in the entryway. Don't let your entry room become a
chaotic place. You can equip your mudroom with lockers, floating
shelves, bins, baskets for outdoor toys, etc. Consider buying a nice
table with a drawers and shelf underneath. So, you can place large items
upon the shelf, while smaller things, like keys or papers, can go in the
drawers.

4.  Remove off-season items and hide clutter instantly! There is an old
    space-saving idea -- remove off-season items from your entryway.
    Don't store them in your hall closet. It's summertime and you still

    for keys, a spot for sunglasses, wallets, etc. And stick to it.

KITCHEN

Hello kitchen! It's time to tackle the kitchen clutter. You should

food preparation; cleaning; storage; Therefore, every item in your
kitchen should fit into one of these four groups. Thus, you can
declutter, organize and clean entire kitchen easily and effortlessly.
Maybe you think you can't make time to remove trash from your kitchen,
but there is a simple solution. Just focus on one small area, one by
one! 32. There is no wrong place to start. "Do not wait; the time will
never be just right. Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools
you may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you go
along." -- Napoleon Hill Therefore, focus on the part of your kitchen.
That might be one drawer, it doesn't matter. It does not sound just like
a revolutionary idea, but you will build one small success on top of
another small success. Afterwards, you can build a "mountain" of
success. a. Examine the selected drawer. Then, empty the drawer on the
kitchen table on a counter. b. Immediately get rid of what you won't
need. Do not accumulate anything, and put unnecessary items into
donation boxes and garbage bags.

c. Then, clean the drawer, and sort the items by frequency of use.
Purchase drawer dividers and organize everything. Arrange things that
are used the most frequently in the front part of the drawer. Put rest
of the thing behind them. This bright idea will save your time and
energy.

33. Reorganize and declutter floating shelves in the kitchen.

Now, you have to declutter floating shelves in the kitchen. The way you
organize your shelves also plays a part in making a clean and tidy
kitchen. a. Place a large quilt on the floor. b. Remove items from your

way, you can see an abundance of stuff in your kitchen. You may need to
remove some items to the other room. c. It's time to clean your items
that have gotten dusty. d. Afterwards, place things back in floating
shelves. And remember -- Balance is the key to a happy kitchen. Don't
overfill your space with a lot of things. Realistically, how many baking
dishes, measuring cups or graters do you need? Get rid of the surplus
and take back your kitchen!

34. Declutter small kitchen appliances. If you have a lot of small
    appliances, they can create a clutter. Here are a few ideas to take
    control of your small appliances.

Before organizing those items, take inventory. How many small appliances
do you have? Have you been given a lot of hand-me-downs? Declutter
duplicate appliances. For example, if you have two blenders, think about
letting one of them go. You can sell these items at a garage sale or you
can donate them to charity. Ask yourself: Which ones do you use most
frequently? Divide all items into two categories:

"rarely use" and "use often." Therefore, keep only necessary items and
purge the rest. Therefore, try to store what you will use. Keep your
small appliances well organized in a kitchen cabinet. Therefore, when
you want to find certain appliance, you will always know where it is.

35. A systematically organized cooking space. You can make the most of
    your kitchen. Before you start cluttering of your cooking zone,

    when you want to find your cooking tool, you'll always know where it
    is.

<!-- -->

36. Prepare your meals in decluttered kitchen. Cookware such as mixing
    bowls, cutting boards, kitchen gadgets, knives and blender should be
    organized in a specific area. In this way, they will always be at
    your fingertips. Cut through the unnecessary kitchen tools that
    might have accumulated. Get rid of items that don't work. Free up
    space in your kitchen so that you can enjoy your space to the
    fullest.

37. Create more cook-friendly kitchen. If you are able, create a station
on your counter where you will keep your cooking essentials. Cooking
oil, salt, black pepper, and garlic are the most commonly used cooking
ingredients. In this way, your space becomes more cook-friendly. Use an
old cutting board to designate this spot.

38. Organize your pots and pans. Empty your kitchen cabinet and utilize
it for your pots and pants. Begin with the largest pots so arrange them
on the bottom of the cabinet; then, work upwards to the smallest pots
and pans. Or store them on an open shelf. Of course, get rid of old and
rusty pots and pans and organize the good ones. Your pans and pots get
unwanted stains? Don't waste your time to scrub and clean them. You can

then, allow the water to simmer for about 3 minutes. Then, pour out the
water; lastly, cleanse the pot with a rag.

39. Another way to keep pots and pans well organized. Countertops look
    like magnets for clutter. Unwashed dishes, utensils, bags, pots,
    pans, there are too many items there. You can start with all these
    pots and pans and find a convenient place to store them. Otherwise,
    you will not be able to cook, bake and eat. If you continue to pile
    up all these things, your kitchen will be jammed with clutter. The
    most common and the easiest way to organize your pots and pans is to
    hang them on the wall. If you're lacking cabinet space, hang your
    cookware. Take back your kitchen!

40. Pot and pan holder. If you do not know what to do with pots and pans
    because you have a small kitchen, there is no need to

be concerned. You can easily build a simple storage area for your
favorite cookware. How about using an old pallet for this purpose? You
have to paint the pallet: then, anchor the pallet to the wall with
drywall screws; lastly, you should add some hangers. In this way, you
can keep your pots and pans neat and tidy.

41. Don't forget to organize and declutter your knives. There are too
    many knives in your kitchen. Bring all knives together on a kitchen
    table. Get rid of unwanted knives. Now you should organize the good
    ones. It may be hard to get started, but it saves you work. There
    are a few great ways to keep your knives organized.

b.  Consider putting your knives in a designated drawer, but make sure
    to organize them with drawer dividers.
c.  In-drawer knife block is also a great solution.

    storage option. You can install magazine rack inside the cabinet
    door to hold your cutting boards. You should screw the rack on the
    inside of cabinet door. This is an amazing space saver and a great
    spot for easy access to your cutting boards. Nice and tidy!

43. Lazy Susan -- Spice organizers. For those who are overwhelmed by
    kitchen clutter, here is a great idea to declutter your spices. Do
    you constantly buy herbs and spices? Do you spend money buying
    duplicates for spices you already have somewhere? Do you keep
    expired spices? Your spice rack may be jammed with unwanted bottles
    of spices and herbs.

Use Lazy Susan as your new spice organizer. You can use multiple Lazy
Susans and divide your favorite spices into categories. You can organize
everything by grouping items by type and frequency of use. Items that
are used the most frequently should be the most accessible. It's
important not to limit yourself. Spice it up!

44. Alphabetize your favorite spices. Have you got a large variety of
    spices? Do you like cooking and experiment with new flavors? Do you
    want to keep your herbs and spices organized? It will take only 15
    minutes and you will find what you need much easier every time you
    cook. To alphabetize your favorite spices, bring them together.
    First, toss out expired spices. Then, arrange them in alphabetical
    order. A spice rack will help you to keep them organized once and
    for all. There is only one rule you should follow -- put every spice
    back into its proper spot after the usage.

45. How to organize your bakeware? How many pieces of baking equipment
    do you really need? It depends on the size of your family and your
    personal preferences. It's not the same thing: bake the cookies for
    yourself and your spouse or baking for sixmember family. Further, if
    you adore baking and you bake croissants, rolls, cookies, and cakes
    more frequently, you will need proper baking equipment. On the other
    hand, if you mainly buy your favorite treats in the bakery, you will
    need less baking items. The average kitchen contains many more
    dishes than it is necessary. In other words, if you think that you
    need a wide variety of baking items, here's a simple guideline.
    Four-member family will need:

<!-- -->

a.  Bakeware: 2-qt baking dish, 1 8x8 casserole, 2 cookie sheets, 2
    muffin tins, 1 tart pan, 2 round cake pans, and 1 bread pan.
b.  Baking equipment: a rolling pin, a wire rack, 2-3 mixing bowls, 12
    cookie cutters, and flour sifter.

Get rid of unwanted baking items. Throw away everything that is rusty,
warped and useless. In this way, you can organize and store your
bakeware. It means you should store bakeware and baking equipment in a
kitchen cupboard that is near to your oven. The clutter will be gone and
you will enjoy baking in the comfort of your home.

46. Create a baking zone. Do you like making delicious cookies, rolls,
    loaves of bread and other bakery products? Keeping all of your
    ingredients within arm's reach of your preparation area will make
    you feel great. You can corral all ingredients in a designated
    kitchen cabinet or shelf. Clear out the designated kitchen cabinet
    and make space for your favorites.

<!-- -->

a.  Bring all of your baking ingredients together and check the
    expiration dates.
b.  Throw unwanted ingredients away.
c.  Create a list of missing ingredients and go shopping as soon as
    possible.
d.  Put the ingredients into containers or mason jars, grouping them
    according to their purpose.
e.  Label these containers and jars and stock your new space. Enjoy
    baking and fall in love with the order in your baking zone.

<!-- -->

47. How to keep your baking cabinet neat and tidy? If you make baked
    goods frequently, you like keeping your ingredients on hand.
48. Use large-sized containers for flours, granulated sugar, powdered
    sugar, and old-fashioned oats.

1. Next, medium-sized containers are perfect for brown sugar, chocolate
chips, and tapioca. 1. Use small-sized containers for cocoa powder,
baking powder, baking soda, cornstarch, and coconut. You can choose any
type of containers that easy to open when your hands are messy. Fill
your containers with the ingredients and you will tackle this task
easily and effortlessly.

48. A kitchen organizing trick for baking sheets. Are your baking trays
    and sheets falling all over kitchen shelves and cabinets? Or it's
    difficult to find the baking tray that you need right now. The
    reason is that you didn't create a special place for your bakeware
    and they are scattered with other dishes. Here's a great kitchen
    organizing trick. Keep your bakeware organized on top of kitchen
    cupboards! In this way, they are always easily accessible.

49. Reorganize and categorize kitchen utensils. Your hand-held kitchen
    tools deserve a special spot in your kitchen. There are so useful
    and you want to have them at your fingertips. Cheese knife, bread
    knife, spatulas, colander, corkscrew, filet knife, funnel, grater,
    lemon squeezer, baster, and other utensils can create a lot of
    clutter.

<!-- -->

a.  You can group them together and categorize them by their various
    uses.
b.  Clear out all of your drawers and wipe them down.
c.  Then, get rid of utensils that you haven't used in the last year.
    Try to donate as much as you can.

d. Use baskets, bins and trays for storing your most commonly used
utensils. e. If you're short on space, you can store them in your
large-sized slow cooker.

sleeping zone; 2) the relaxing and entertaining zone; 3) the grooming
zone. There are many of us that have the fourth part and it is the work
zone. Everything in your bedroom should fit into one of these three or
four categories. If you have an item that doesn't fit, it may not belong
in your bedroom. Declutter one area at a time and don't move to the next
zone until you have finished the previous. Good luck!

really need all these things in my bedroom? Is anything in this area
unused? Toss unwanted items. b. Step two: This is the fun part. You
should make six piles -- keep, put away in another place, give away,
sell, trash, and recycle (repurpose). If there are items that could be
useful to someone, give it to them. c. Step three: Designate a spot for
each and every item. Put items back in their places. To maintain this
