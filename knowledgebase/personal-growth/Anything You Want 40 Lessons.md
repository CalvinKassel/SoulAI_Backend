[]{#part0005.html_pageMap_1 .calibre2}Ten years of experience in one
hour

From 1998 to 2008, I had this wild experience of starting a little
hobby, accidentally growing it into a big business, and then selling it
for \$22 million. So now people want to hear my thoughts.

People ask me about that experience, so I tell stories about how it went
for me. Many of them are about all the things I did wrong. I made some
horrible mistakes.

People ask my advice on how to approach situations in their lives or
businesses, so I explain how I approach things. But my approach is just
one way, and I could argue against it as well.

I'm not really suggesting that anyone should be like me. I'm pretty
unusual, so what works for me might not work for others. But enough
people thought that my stories and the philosophies I developed from
this experience were worth sharing, so here we are.

This is most of what I learned in ten years, compacted into something
you can read in an hour.

I hope you find these ideas useful for your own life or business. I also
hope you disagree with some of them. Then I hope you e-mail me to tell
me about your different point of view, because that's my favorite part
of all. (I'm a student, not a guru.)

[]{#part0006.html}

::: basic-text-frame
[]{#part0006.html_pageMap_2 .calibre2}What's your compass?

Most people don't know why they're doing what they're doing. They
imitate others, go with the flow, and follow paths without making their
own. They spend decades in pursuit of something that someone convinced
them they should want, without realizing that it won't make them happy.

Don't be on your deathbed someday, having squandered your one chance at
life, full of regret because you pursued little distractions instead of
big dreams. You need to know your personal philosophy of what makes you
happy and what's worth doing.

In the following stories, you'll notice some common themes. These are my
philosophies from the ten years I spent starting and growing a small
business.

- Business is not about money. It's about making dreams come true for
  others and for yourself.
- Making a company is a great way to improve the world while improving
  yourself.
- When you make a company, you make a utopia. It's where you design your
  perfect world.
- []{#part0006.html_pageMap_3}Never do anything just for the money.
- Don't pursue business just for your own gain. Only answer the calls
  for help.
- Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from
  persistently promoting what's not working.
- Your business plan is moot. You don't know what people really want
  until you start doing it.
- Starting with no money is an advantage. You don't need money to start
  helping people.
- You can't please everyone, so proudly exclude people.
- Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business.
- The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes
  you happy.

What do these statements mean? What's the context? How are you supposed
to apply them to your own situation?

Well . . . I don't love talking about myself, but for the lessons to
make sense, I have to tell you my tale.

[]{#part0007.html}

::: basic-text-frame
[]{#part0007.html_pageMap_4 .calibre2}Just selling my CD

This story begins in 1997. I was a professional musician, age
twenty-seven. I was making a full-time living just playing
music---playing lots of gigs around the U.S. and Europe, producing
people's records, playing on people's records, and running a little
recording studio. I was even the musician and MC for a circus.

My bank account was always low, but never empty. I made enough money to
buy a house in Woodstock, New York. I was living a musician's dream.

I made a CD of my music, and sold fifteen hundred copies at my concerts.
I wanted to sell it online, but there were no businesses that would sell
independent music online. Not one. I called up the big online record
stores and they all told me the same thing: The only way I could get my
CD into their online stores was through a major distributor.

Music distribution was an awful racket. Getting a distribution deal was
as hard as getting a record deal. Distributors were notorious for taking
thousands of CDs and paying you a year later, if ever. Record labels
with deep pockets would buy expensive promotional placement, and the
rest of us would just sit in the bin. If you didn't sell well in the
first few months, you were kicked out of the system.

It's not that distributors were evil. It was just an awful
[]{#part0007.html_pageMap_5}system, and I wanted nothing to do with it.
So when the big online record stores told me they couldn't sell my CD
directly, I thought, "Ah, screw it. I'll just set up my own online
store. How hard could it be?"

But it was hard! In 1997, PayPal didn't exist, so I had to get a credit
card merchant account, which cost \$1,000 in setup fees and took three
months of paperwork. The bank even had to send an inspector out to my
location to make sure I was a valid business. Then I had to figure out
how to build a shopping cart. I didn't know any programming, but I
copied some examples from a programming book, with lots of trial and
error.

Finally, though, I had a BUY NOW button on my website! In 1997 this was
a big deal.

When I told my musician friends about my BUY NOW button, one friend
asked, "Could you sell my CD, too?"

I thought about it for a minute and said, "Sure. No problem." I just did
it as a favor. It took me a couple of hours to get him added into my
system. I made a separate page for his CD on my band's website.

Then two other friends asked if I could sell their CDs. Then I started
getting calls from strangers saying, "My friend Dave said you could sell
my CD." The calls and e-mails kept coming. I said yes to all.

Two popular online music leaders announced it to their mailing lists.
(Bryan Baker from Gajoob, and David Hooper. Thanks, guys!) Fifty more
musicians signed up.

This was meant to be just a favor I was doing for a few friends.
Hmmm . . .
:::

[]{#part0008.html}

::: basic-text-frame
[]{#part0008.html_pageMap_6 .calibre2}Make a dream come true

Selling my friends' CDs was starting to take up a lot of my time. I
realized I had accidentally started a business. But I didn't want to
start a business! I was already living my dream life as a full-time
musician. I didn't want anything to distract me from that.

So, I thought that by taking an unrealistically utopian approach, I
could keep the business from growing too much. Instead of trying to make
it big, I was going to make it small. It was the opposite of ambition,
so I had to think in a way that was the opposite of ambitious.

I wrote down my utopian dream-come-true distribution deal from my
musician's point of view. In a perfect world, my distributor would:

1.  Pay me every week.
2.  Show me the full name and address of everyone who bought my CD.
    (Because those are my fans, not the distributor's.)
3.  Never kick me out for not selling enough. (Even if I sell only one
    CD every five years, it'll be there for someone to buy.)
4.  []{#part0008.html_pageMap_7}Never allow paid placement. (Because
    it's not fair to those who can't afford it.)

That's it! That was my mission. I liked it. It was a worthy hobby. I
named it CD Baby, and put my friends' CDs there.

Those four points were like a mission statement. I wrote them on the
site, talked about them at every conference, and made sure everyone I
worked with knew them.

The key point is that I wasn't trying to make a big business. I was just
daydreaming about how one little thing would look in a perfect world.

When you make a business, you get to make a little universe where you
control all the laws. This is your utopia.

When you make it a dream come true for yourself, it'll be a dream come
true for someone else, too.

[]{#part0009.html}

::: basic-text-frame
[]{#part0009.html_pageMap_8 .calibre2}A business model with only two
numbers

Like most people, I had no idea what to charge for my service. So I went
to the record store in Woodstock, where they had some local musicians'
CDs on the counter.

I asked the woman at the store, "How does it work if I sell my CD here?"

She said, "You set the selling price at whatever you want. We keep a
flat \$4 cut. And we pay you every week."

So I went home and wrote on my new cdbaby.com website, "You set the
selling price at whatever you want. We keep a flat \$4 cut. And we pay
you every week." I figured if it worked for her, it was fine for me.

Because it was taking me about forty-five minutes of work to add a new
album to the site, I also had to charge \$25 per album as compensation
for my time (shows you how much I thought my time was worth in those
days). A few days later, I realized that \$35 feels about the same as
\$25, so I bumped it up to \$35 per album, which left me room to give
discounts and still make a profit.

And that's it! Six years and \$10 million later, those same two
[]{#part0009.html_pageMap_9}numbers were the sole source of income for
the company: a \$35 setup fee per album and a \$4 cut per CD sold.

A business plan should never take more than a few hours of
work---hopefully no more than a few minutes. The best plans start
simple. A quick glance and common sense should tell you if the numbers
will work. The rest are details.
:::

[]{#part0010.html}

::: basic-text-frame
[]{#part0010.html_pageMap_10 .calibre2}This ain't no revolution

Five years after I started CD Baby, when it was a big success, the media
said I had revolutionized the music business. But *revolution* is a term
that people use only when you're successful. Before that, you're just a
quirky person who does things differently.

People think a revolution needs to involve loud provocations, fists in
the air, and bloodshed. But if you think true love looks like Romeo and
Juliet, you'll overlook a great relationship that grows slowly. If you
think your life's purpose needs to hit you like a lightning bolt, you'll
overlook the little day-to-day things that fascinate you. If you think
revolution needs to feel like war, you'll overlook the importance of
simply serving people better.

When you're onto something great, it won't feel like revolution. It'll
feel like uncommon sense.
:::

[]{#part0011.html}

::: basic-text-frame
[]{#part0011.html_pageMap_11 .calibre2}If it's not a hit, switch

For the first time in my life, I had made something that people really
wanted.

Before that, I had spent twelve years trying to promote my various
projects---trying every marketing approach, networking, pitching,
pushing. It always felt like an uphill battle, trying to open locked or
slamming doors. I made progress, but only with massive effort.

But now . . . Wow! It was like I had written a hit song. A songwriter
can write a hundred songs; then suddenly one of them really resonates
with people and becomes a hit. Who knows why? It's not that it's
necessarily better. But through some random set of circumstances or
magic combination of ingredients, people love it.

Once you've got a hit, suddenly all the locked doors open wide. People
love the hit so much that it seems to promote itself. Instead of trying
to create demand, you're managing the huge demand.

So what's the lesson learned here?

We've all heard about the importance of persistence. But I had
misunderstood. Success comes from persistently improving and inventing,
not from persistently doing what's not working.

We all have lots of ideas, creations, and projects. When you present one
to the world and it's not a hit, don't keep pushing it as is. Instead,
get back to improving and inventing.

[]{#part0011.html_pageMap_12}Present each new idea or improvement to the
world. If multiple people are saying, "Wow! Yes! I need this! I'd be
happy to pay you to do this!" then you should probably do it. But if the
response is anything less, don't pursue it.

Don't waste years fighting uphill battles against locked doors. Improve
or invent until you get that huge response.
:::

[]{#part0012.html}

::: basic-text-frame
[]{#part0012.html_pageMap_13 .calibre2}No "yes." Either "[Hell
yeah!]{.medium-italic}" or "no."

You can use this same rule on yourself if you're often overcommitted or
too scattered. If you're not saying, "*Hell yeah!*" about something, say
no. When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less
than "Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!" then say no.

When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw
yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say, "*Hell
yeah!*"

For every event you get invited to, every request to start a new
project, if you're not saying, "*Hell yeah!*" about it, say no.

We're all busy. We've all taken on too much. Saying yes to less is the
way out.
:::

[]{#part0013.html}

::: basic-text-frame
[]{#part0013.html_pageMap_14 .calibre2}Just like that, my plan
completely changed

When I first started CD Baby, I thought it was just a credit card
processing service.

It was supposed to be a website that musicians would use to say, "Go
here to buy my CD." Just click to buy, charge your card, and then go
back to the musician's website. Kind of like PayPal, but this was two
years before PayPal was invented.

The day I launched cdbaby.com, my second customer was a guy in the
Netherlands. A week later he e-mailed to ask, "Any new releases?"

New releases? I didn't understand. I asked why he wanted to know which
new people are using my service to charge credit cards.

He replied, "Oh, sorry; I thought it was a store."

A store? Oh! Interesting. He thinks I'm a store! I hadn't thought of
that. Maybe if I set it up like a store, I'd actually be doing my
friends a bigger favor, by getting total strangers to buy their music,
too.

And just like that, my plan completely changed.

Five years later, when the iTunes Music Store launched, Apple asked us
to be a digital distributor. I hadn't thought of that. But I said OK.

[]{#part0013.html_pageMap_15}And just like that, my plan completely
changed again.

Anytime you think you know what your new business will be doing,
remember this quote from serial entrepreneur Steve Blank: "No business
plan survives first contact with customers."
:::

[]{#part0014.html}

::: basic-text-frame
[]{#part0014.html_pageMap_16 .calibre2}The advantage of no funding

Having no funding was a huge advantage for me.

A year after I started CD Baby, the dot-com boom happened. Anyone with a
little hot air and a vague plan was given millions of dollars by
investors. It was ridiculous.

Most business owners I knew would tell you about their businesses by
talking about their second round of funding, their fancy encrypted
replicated load-balancing database server, their twenty-person
development team, their nice Midtown office with a pool table, and their
weekly promotion parties. When you asked what the business actually did,
they couldn't explain it clearly. Then they would talk about LOI, ROI,
NDAs, IPOs, and all kinds of things that also had nothing to do with
actually helping people.

I'm so glad I didn't have investors. I didn't have to please anybody but
my customers and myself. No effort was spent on anything but my
customers.

I'd get weekly calls from investment firms, wanting to invest in CD
Baby. My immediate answer was always, "No thanks."

They'd say, "Don't you want to expand?"

I'd say, "No. I want my business to be smaller, not bigger." That always
ended the conversation.

[]{#part0014.html_pageMap_17}By not having any money to waste, you never
waste money. Since I couldn't afford a programmer, I went to the
bookstore and got a \$25 book on PHP and MySQL programming. Then I sat
down and learned it, with no programming experience. Necessity is a
great teacher.

Even years later, the desks were just planks of wood on cinder blocks
from the hardware store. I made the office computers myself from parts.
My well-funded friends would spend \$100,000 to buy something that I
made myself for \$1,000. They did it saying, "We need the very best,"
but it didn't improve anything for the customers.

Never forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.
Make every decision---even decisions about whether to expand the
business, raise money, or promote someone---according to what's best for
your customers. If you're ever unsure what to prioritize, just ask your
customers the open-ended question, "How can I best help you now?" Then
focus on satisfying those requests.

None of your customers will ask you to turn your attention to expanding.
They want you to keep your attention focused on them. It's
counterintuitive, but the way to grow your business is to focus entirely
on your existing customers. Just thrill them, and they'll tell everyone.
:::

[]{#part0015.html}

::: basic-text-frame
[]{#part0015.html_pageMap_18 .calibre2}Start now. No funding needed.

Watch out when anyone (including you) says he wants to do something big,
but can't until he raises money. It usually means the person is more in
love with the idea of being big-big-big than with actually doing
something useful. For an idea to get big-big-big, it has to be useful.
And being useful doesn't need funding.

If you want to be useful, you can always start now, with only 1 percent
of what you have in your grand vision. It'll be a humble prototype
version of your grand vision, but you'll be in the game. You'll be ahead
of the rest, because you actually started, while others are waiting for
the finish line to magically appear at the starting line.

For example, let's say you have a vision of making an international
chain of enlightened modern schools. You picture it as a huge,
world-changing organization, with hundreds of employees, dozens of
offices, and expensive technology. But instead of waiting for that, you
start by teaching somebody something this week. Find someone who will
pay to learn something, meet her anywhere, and begin. It will be nothing
but you, a student, and a notebook, but you'll be in business, and you
can grow it from there.

If you want to make a movie recommendation service, start by telling
friends to call you for movie recommendations. When
[]{#part0015.html_pageMap_19}you find a movie your friends like, they
buy you a drink. Keep track of what you recommended and how your friends
liked it, and improve from there.

Want to start a new airline? Next time you're at the airport when a
flight is canceled, tell everyone at the gate that you'll lease a small
plane to fly to their destination if they will split the costs. (This is
how Richard Branson started Virgin Atlantic Airways.)

Starting small puts 100 percent of your energy into actually solving
real problems for real people. It gives you a stronger foundation to
grow from. It eliminates the friction of big infrastructure and gets
right to the point. And it will let you change your plan in an instant,
as you're working closely with those first customers telling you what
they really need.

Since I had already built a website for my own CD, the first version of
CD Baby took me only a few days to make, and it did almost nothing. It
was a list of a few CDs, each with a BUY NOW button. Clicking that would
put the CD in your cart and ask for your info. When you entered your
info, the site would e-mail it to me.

That's it. For the first year, that's all the site did, and that's all
it needed to do to become profitable.

I spent only \$500 to start CD Baby. The first month, I earned back
\$300. But the second month I made \$700, and it's been profitable every
month since.

So no, your idea doesn't need funding to start. (You also don't need an
MBA, a particular big client, a certain person's endorsement, a lucky
break, or any other common excuse not to start.)

[]{#part0016.html_pageMap_20 .calibre2}Ideas are just a multiplier of
execution

It's so funny when I hear people being so protective of ideas
(especially people who want me to sign a non-disclosure agreement before
they tell me about the simplest ideas).

To me, ideas are worth nothing unless they are executed. They are just a

Explanation:

Awful idea = -1

Weak idea = 1

So-so idea = 5

Good idea = 10

Great idea = 15

Brilliant idea = 20

No execution = \$1

Weak execution = \$1,000

So-so execution = \$10,000

Good execution = \$100,000

Great execution = \$1,000,000

Brilliant execution = \$10,000,000

[]{#part0016.html_pageMap_21}To make a business, you need to multiply
the two components. The most brilliant idea, with no execution, is worth
\$20. The most brilliant idea takes great execution to be worth
\$200,000,000.

That's why I don't want to hear people's ideas. I'm not interested until

refuse.

A year after starting CD Baby, when it was going pretty well, I got a
call from a friend who was setting up his own similar web-based
business. He said, "Do you have any advice about how to do our 'Terms
and Conditions' and 'Privacy Policy' on the website? Which lawyer did
you use for that?"

I said, "Huh? I don't have any of that legalese stuff. I've never hired
a lawyer."

Shocked, he said, "That's crazy! What if some kid buys a CD from you,
then kills himself? What if you get sued over that?"

I said, "Then no stupid footnote legalese would protect me anyway, so
I'll worry about it if it happens."

Do you passionately love the "Terms & Conditions" and "Privacy Policy"
pages on other websites? Have you even read them? If not, then why would
you go putting that garbage on your website?

After CD Baby grew to fifty employees, all the business-to-business
service companies started pitching me on how I needed an official
employee review plan, sensitivity training, Terms and Conditions
postings, and all this corporate crap. I got such joy out of saying no
to all of it.

Never forget that there are thousands of businesses, like
[]{#part0017.html_pageMap_23}Jim's Fish Bait Shop in a shack on a beach
somewhere, that are doing just fine without corporate formalities.

As your business grows, don't let the leeches sucker you into all that
stuff they pretend you need. They'll play on your fears, saying that you
need this stuff to protect yourself against lawsuits. They'll scare you
with horrible worst-case scenarios. But those are just sales tactics.
You don't need any of it.

[]{#part0018.html_pageMap_24 .calibre2}The strength of many little
customers

Many small entrepreneurs think, "If we can just land Apple, Google, or
the government as a client, we'll be all set!"

Software companies often do this. They hope to make some technology that
a huge company will want to build into every product or install at every
employee's desk.

But this approach has many problems:

- You have to custom-tailor your product to please a very few specific
  people.
- Those people might change their minds or leave the company.
- Whom are you really working for? Are you self-employed or is this
  client your boss?
- If you do land the big client, that organization will practically own
  you.
- By trying so hard to please the big client, you will lose touch with
  what the rest of the world wants.

[]{#part0018.html_pageMap_25}Instead, imagine that you have designed
your business to have *no* big clients, just lots of little clients.

- You don't need to change what you do to please one client; you need to
  please only the majority (or yourself).
- If one client needs to leave, it's OK; you can sincerely wish her
  well.
- Because no one client can demand that you do what he says, you are
  your own boss (as long as you keep your clients happy in general).
- You hear hundreds of people's opinions and stay in touch with what the
  majority of your clients want.

So much of the music business is actually the star business---people
hoping to catch the coattails of a redundant megastar. But I wanted
nothing to do with that, for these same reasons.

When you build your business on serving thousands of customers, not
dozens, you don't have to worry about any one customer leaving or making
special demands. If most of your customers love what you do, but one
doesn't, you can just say good-bye and wish him the best, with no hard
feelings.

You know you can't please everyone, right?

But notice that most businesses are trying to be everything to
everybody. And they wonder why they can't get people's attention!

You need to confidently exclude people, and proudly say what you're not.
By doing so, you will win the hearts of the people you want.

The Hotel Café, a folk- and rock-music venue in Los Angeles, is a
no-talking club. Big signs read, NO TALKING DURING PERFORMANCES!
Performers are encouraged to stop the show if someone is talking, and
let the person know that he can go to any other club in town to talk
over the music. This is the one place in L.A. where you can sit and
really listen to the music, which, of course, makes it the most popular
music venue in town.

When CD Baby got popular, I'd get calls from record labels wanting to
feature their newest, hottest acts on our site.

I'd say, "Nope. They're not allowed here."

The record label guys would say, "Huh? What do you mean not allowed?
You're a record store! We're a record label."

I'd say, "You can sell anywhere else. This is a place for independents
only: musicians who chose not to sign their rights over to a
corporation. To make sure these musicians get the maximum exposure they
deserve, no major-label acts are allowed."

[]{#part0019.html_pageMap_27}It's a big world. You can loudly leave out
99 percent of it.

Have the confidence to know that when your target 1 percent hears you
excluding the other 99 percent, the people in that 1 percent will come
to you because you've shown how much you value them.

He said, "But you're a business. What do you mean you're not trying to
make money?"

I said, "I'm just trying to help musicians. CD Baby has to charge money
to sustain itself, but the money's not the point. I don't do anything
for the money."

This goes back to the utopian perfect-world ideal of why we're doing
what we're doing in the first place. In a perfect world, would your
website be covered with advertising? When you've asked your customers
what would improve your service, has anyone said, "Please fill your

Nope. So don't do it.

I used to take voice lessons from a great teacher named Warren Senders.
For each lesson, I'd bring in one song I was trying to improve. First,
I'd sing it for him as written.

Then he'd say, "OK, now do it up an octave."

"Uh . . . up an octave? But I can't sing that high!"

"I don't care! Do it anyway! Go! One, two, three, four."

I'd sing the whole song again, in screeching, squeaking falsetto,
sounding like an undead cartoon mouse. But by the second half of the
song, it was almost charming.

Then he'd say, "OK, now do it down an octave."

"Down an octave? But I don't think I can!"

"Doesn't matter! Go! One, two, three, four."

I sounded like a garbage disposal or lawn mower, but he made me sing the
whole song that way.

Then he'd make me sing it twice as fast. Then twice as slow. Then like
Bob Dylan. Then like Tom Waits. Then he'd tell me to sing it like it's 4
a.m. and a friend woke me up. And then he'd give me many other
scenarios.

After all of this, he'd say, "Now, how did that song go again?" It was
the clearest proof that what I thought was "the" way the song went was
really just one of an infinite number of options.

[]{#part0021.html_pageMap_30}I'm taking an entrepreneurship class now.
I've never studied business before.

We analyzed a business plan for a mail-order pantyhose company. Like all
business plans, it proposed only one idea. After reading the whole
thing, I felt like saying things my old voice teacher would have said:

- "OK, make a plan that requires only \$1,000. Go!"
- "Now make a plan for ten times as many customers. Go!"
- "Now do it without a website. Go!"
- "Now make all your initial assumptions wrong, and have it work anyway.
  Go!"
- "Now show how you would franchise it. Go!"

You can't pretend there's only one way to do it. Your first idea is just
one of many options. No business goes as planned, so make ten radically
different plans.

Do you have a big visionary master plan for how the world will work in
twenty years? Do you have massive ambitions to revolutionize your
industry?

Don't feel bad if you don't. I never did.

A year and a half after starting CD Baby, it was just me and John, my
first employee, running it out of my house. One night, I decided I
should think more about the long-term future of this thing. I sat with
my diary for a few hours of introspection. Afterward, I wrote John an
e-mail that went like this:

"I think there's a chance that this thing might be huge one day, so we
better start preparing for that now. I mean someday, we might have ONE
THOUSAND artists on CD Baby. We might need a third employee! That would
mean we'd need three computers here in the office, which would mean we'd
need to figure out how to network them together. We might even need to
start moving CDs into the garage, since eventually they might fill up
the living room. Yes, I know it sounds grandiose, but I think things are
headed that way."

Years later, after I had a hundred thousand artists and eighty-five
employees, John would often get a good laugh out of this e-mail I sent
him in 1999.

[]{#part0022.html_pageMap_33}Journalists would ask, "What's your

I was in Las Vegas for a conference, taking a taxi from the airport to
the hotel. I asked the driver, "How long have you lived here?"

He said, "Twenty-seven years."

"Wow! A lot has changed since then, huh?"

"Yeah. I miss the mob."

"Huh? Really? What do you mean?"

"When the mafia ran this town, it was fun. There were only two numbers
that mattered: how much was coming in, and how much was going out. As
long as there was more in than out, everyone was happy. But then the
whole town was bought up by these damn corporations full of MBA weasels
micromanaging, trying to maximize the profit from every square foot of
floor space. Now the place that used to put ketchup on my hot dog tells
me it'll be an extra twenty-five cents for ketchup! It sucked all the
fun out of this town! Yeah, I miss the mob." (Sure, we could bring up
other issues with the mob, but let's just leave it as a metaphor and a
lesson.)

I told this story a lot at CD Baby. Sometimes MBA types would ask me,
"What's your growth rate? What's your retained earnings rate as a
percentage of gross? What are your projections?"

I'd just say, "I have no idea. I don't even know what some of that
means. I started this as a hobby to help my friends, and that's

to how many valuable properties bear his name. Plenty of real estate
tycoons have made billions without putting their names on everything,
but maybe that's his measure.

We all grade ourselves by different measures:

- For some people, it's as simple as how much money they make. When
  their net worth is going up, they know they're doing well.
- For others, it's how much money they give.
- For some, it's how many people's lives they can influence for the
  better.
- For others, it's how deeply they can influence just a few people's

At a conference in Los Angeles, someone in the audience asked me, "What
if every musician just set up their own store on their own website?
Since that'd be the death of CD Baby, how do you plan to stop that?"

I said, "Honestly, I don't care about CD Baby. I only care about the
musicians. If someday, musicians don't need CD Baby anymore, that's
great! I'll just shut it down and get back to making music."

He was shocked. He had never heard a business owner say he didn't care
about the survival of his company.

To me, it was just common sense. Of course you should care about your
customers more than you care about yourself! Isn't that Rule No. 1 of
providing a good service? It's all about them, not about you.

But even well-meaning companies accidentally get trapped in survival
mode. A business is started to solve a problem. But if the problem were
truly solved, that business would no longer be needed! So the business
accidentally or unconsciously keeps the problem around so that they can
keep solving it for a fee. (I don't []{#part0025.html_pageMap_39}want to

If you set up your business like you don't need the money, people are
happier to pay you. When someone's doing something for the money, people
can sense it, like they sense a desperate lover. It's a turnoff. When
someone's doing something for love, being generous instead of stingy,
trusting instead of fearful, it triggers this law: We want to give to

My friend Sara has run a small online business out of her living room
for twelve years. It's her whole life. She takes it very, very
personally.

Recently, one of her clients sent her a ten-page scathing e-mail,
chopping her down, calling her a scam artist and issuing other vicious
personal insults, saying she was going to sue Sara for everything she's
worth as retribution for the client's mishandled account.

Devastated, Sara turned off her computer and cried. She shut off the
phones and closed up shop for the day. She spent the whole weekend in
bed wondering if she should just give up, thinking maybe every insult in
this client's letter is true and she's actually no good at what she
does, even after twelve years.

On Sunday, she spent about five hours---most of the day---carefully
addressing every point in this ten-page e-mail; then she went through
the client's website, learning everything about her, and offered all
kinds of advice, suggestions, and connections. Sara refunded the
client's money, plus an additional \$50, with deep apologies for ever
having upset someone she was honestly trying to help.

The next day, she called the client to try to talk through the
[]{#part0028.html_pageMap_44}situation with her. The client cheerfully
took her call and said, "Oh, don't worry about it! I wasn't actually

my e-mail anyway."

My friend Valerie was using an online dating service. She was
halfhearted about it. She wanted a magic perfect man to sweep her off
her feet through divine serendipity.

We were at her computer when I asked her how it was going. She logged in
to her account and showed me her in-box. There were eight new messages,
each one well written, saying what the man liked about her profile, how
they have a mutual interest in hiking, or that he also speaks German,
and asking her if she's also been to Berlin, or has hiked in New
Zealand.

I felt for those guys, each one pouring out his heart, projecting his
hopes onto Valerie, hoping she'd reply with equal enthusiasm, hoping she
might be the one who would finally see and appreciate him.

She said, "Ugh. Losers. I get, like, ten of these a day." Then she
deleted all of them, without replying.

little world, you can make it like it should be.

When I first built CD Baby, every order resulted in an automated e-mail
that let the customer know when the CD was actually shipped. At first
this note was just the normal "Your order has shipped today. Please let
us know if it doesn't arrive. Thank you for your business."

After a few months, that felt really incongruent with my mission to make
people smile. I knew I could do better. So I took twenty minutes and
wrote this goofy little thing:

Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized
contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.

A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure it
was in the best possible condition before mailing.

Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the
crowd as he put your CD into the finest gold-lined box that money can
buy.

We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party
marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of
Portland waved "Bon Voyage!" to your package,

thousand results. Each one is somebody who got the e-mail and loved it
enough to post it on his website and tell all his friends. That one
goofy e-mail created thousands of new customers.

When you're thinking of how to make your business bigger, it's tempting

difference

If you find even the smallest way to make people smile, they'll remember
you more for that smile than for all your other fancy business-model
stuff.

Here are some things that made a huge difference on the CD Baby website:

Because we shipped FedEx at 5 p.m. each day, customers would often call
and ask, "What time is it there? Do I still have time to get it sent
today?" So I added two little lines of programming code that counted how
many hours and minutes remained until 5 p.m. and then showed the result
by the shipping options. "You have 5 hours, 18 minutes until our next
FedEx shipment." Customers *loved* this!

We answered our phone within two rings, always---7 a.m. to 10 p.m.,
seven days a week. Phones were everywhere, so even if the customer
service rep was busy, someone in the warehouse could pick up. All anyone
had to do was say, "CD Baby!" Customers *loved* this! Someone actually
picking up the phone at a company is so rare that musicians would often
tell me later at conferences that it was the main reason they decided to
go with CD Baby---they could always talk to a real person immediately.
All employees knew that as long as we weren't completely
[]{#part0031.html_pageMap_50}swamped, they should take a minute and get
to know the caller a bit. Ask about her music. Ask how it's going. Yes,
it would lead to twenty-minute conversations sometimes, but those people
became lifelong fans.

Every outgoing e-mail has a "From:" name, right? Why not use that to
make people smile, too? With one line of code, I made it so that every
outgoing e-mail customized the "From:" field to be "CD Baby loves
\[first name\]." So if the customer's name was Susan, every e-mail she
got from us would say it was from "CD Baby loves Susan." Customers
*loved* this!

Sometimes, after we had done the forty-five minutes of work to add a new
album to the store, the musician would change his mind and ask us to do
it over again with a different album cover or different audio clips. I
wanted to say yes but let him know that this was really hard to do, so I
made a policy that made us both smile: "We'll do anything for a pizza."
If you needed a big special favor, we'd give you the number of our local
pizza delivery place. If you bought us a pizza, we'd do any favor you
wanted. When we'd tell people about this on the phone, they'd often
laugh, not believing we were serious. But we'd get a pizza every few
weeks. I'd often hear from musicians later that this was the moment they
fell in love with us.

At the end of each order, the last page of the website would ask, "Where
did you hear of this artist? We'll pass them any message you write
here." Customers would often take the time to write things like, "Heard
your song on WBEZ radio last night." "Searched Yahoo!" "Found it here."
"I'd love to have you play at our school!" The musicians absolutely
loved getting this []{#part0031.html_pageMap_51}information, and it
always led to the customer and musician getting in touch directly. This
is something that big stores like Amazon would never do.

Also at the end of each order, there was a box that would ask, "Any
special requests?" One time, someone said, "I'd love some cinnamon gum."
Since one of the guys in the warehouse was going to the store anyway, he
picked up some cinnamon gum and included it in the package. One time,
someone said, "If you could include a small, rubber squid, I would
appreciate it. If this is unobtainable, a real squid would do." Just by
chance, a customer from Korea had sent us a packaged filet of squid. So
the shipping guys included it in the box with the other customer's CDs.
See the customer tell the story himself in this great video:
http://sivers.org/squid.

Even if you want to be big someday, remember that you never need to act
like a big boring company. Over ten years, it seemed like every time
someone raved about how much he loved CD Baby, it was because of one of
these little fun human touches.

[]{#part0032.html_pageMap_52 .calibre2}It's OK to be casual

My hiring policy was ridiculous. Because I was "too busy to bother," I'd
just ask my current employees if they had any friends who needed work.
Someone always did, so I'd say, "Tell them to start tomorrow morning.
Ten dollars an hour. Show them what to do." And that was that.

The thought was that it's almost impossible to tell what someone's going
to be like on the job until he's actually on the job for a few weeks. So
I'd hire lightly and fire lightly. Luckily we didn't need to fire that
often. Maybe the fact that the new hires were friends of friends helped
with the trust part.

To be fair, this was a mail-order CD store, so most of my employees were
in the warehouse. But I also took this same casual approach when I
needed an important high-tech systems administrator: "Anyone have a
friend who's good with Linux? Yeah? Is he cool? OK, tell him to start
tomorrow."

The first time I did that I found Ryan. The second time, I found Jason.
Both guys are amazing and are key people at CD Baby to this day.

Don't try to impress an invisible jury of MBA professors. It's OK to be
casual.

[]{#part0033.html_pageMap_53 .calibre2}Naive quitting

My first real job was as the librarian at Warner/Chappell Music. I loved
it. I was twenty years old, and I had just graduated from Berklee
College of Music, in Boston, and moved to New York City. I took the job
very seriously and learned a lot.

After two and a half years, though, I decided to quit to be a full-time
musician. (Partially because I was too happy there! I was scared that if
I didn't force myself to quit, I'd never leave. I was too comfortable.)

Since I had never quit a job before and didn't know how, I did what
seemed to be the respectful and considerate thing to do: I found and
trained my replacement. (It wasn't my boss's fault I wanted to quit, so
why should I make it his problem? If I want to quit, it's my problem.) I
called on my old friend Nikki, who I knew would be perfect, and offered
her my job at my current salary. She came with me to the office for a
week while I trained her in every aspect of the job. Once she had it
mastered, I went into my boss's office on a Friday afternoon and said,
"I need to quit now, but I've already trained my replacement. She's
great. She'll take over for me starting Monday."

My boss just looked a little stunned, then said, "Uh. Well. OK. We'll
miss you. Tell her to see HR about the paperwork." And that was that.

[]{#part0033.html_pageMap_54}Ten years later, I was running CD Baby, and
for the first time, an employee told me he needed to quit.

I said, "Drag. Well. OK. I wish you the best! Who's your replacement?"

He looked confused.

I said, "Have you found and trained a replacement yet?"

He looked a little stunned, then said, "No . . . . I think that's your
job."

Now I was stunned. I asked a few friends and found out he was right.
People can just quit a job without finding and training their
replacements. I had no idea. All these years, I just assumed what I had
done was normal.

There's a benefit to being naive about the norms of the world---deciding
from scratch what seems like the right thing to do, instead of just
doing what others do.

[]{#part0034.html_pageMap_55 .calibre2}Prepare to double

CD Baby doubled in size every year for the first six years. Both
customers and profit, almost exactly 100 percent growth each year. It
was spooky.

Because the business needed a warehouse for the CDs, I always had to buy
more shelving. Each time I did, I'd buy twice as much as I had before.
It always filled up fast, even when it got warehouse-sized. When I had
filled a 5,000-square-foot warehouse, I rented 10,000 square feet. When
I filled up 10,000 square feet, I rented 20,000 square feet. Even that
filled up fast.

But no matter what business you're in, it's good to prepare for what
would happen if business doubled. Have ten clients now? How would it
look if you had twenty at once? Serving eighty customers for lunch each
day? What would happen if 160 showed up?

Notice that "more of the same" is never the answer. You'd have to do
things in a new way to handle twice as much business. Processes would
have to be streamlined.

Never be the typical tragic small business that gets frazzled and
freaked out when business is doing well. It sends a repulsive "I can't
handle this!" message to everyone. Instead, if your internal processes
are always designed to handle twice your existing load, it sends an
attractive "come on in, we've got plenty of room" message.

[]{#part0035.html}

[]{#part0035.html_pageMap_56 .calibre2}It's about being, not having

Being a singer:

Since I was fourteen, I was determined to be a great singer. But my
pitch was bad, my tone was bad, and everyone said I was just not a
singer.

For eleven years, from the ages of fourteen to twenty-five, I took voice
lessons, and practiced at least an hour a day. I was always the lead
singer of my band, doing a few shows a week, getting as much real-world
experience as possible. The whole time, people kept telling me I was
just not a singer---that I should give it up and find a real singer.

When I was twenty-five, I recorded my first album. When I gave it to
someone who was a real mentor to me, he gave it a focused listen and
then said, "Derek, you're just not a singer. You really need to stop
trying. Admit you're a songwriter, and find a real singer." But I
bounced away from that meeting unfazed. I knew I just had more work to
do.

At twenty-eight, I started noticing that my voice was getting good! I
recorded a few new songs, and for the first time, I really liked the
vocals!

At twenty-nine, I had done it. After fifteen years of practice,
[]{#part0035.html_pageMap_57}and about a thousand live shows, I was
finally a very good singer, at least by my own standards. (Someone who
heard me for the first time then said, "Singing is a gift you're either
born with or you're not. You're lucky. You were born with it!")

Point is: It's not that I wanted to get it done and have good vocals.
It's that I wanted to be a great singer.

Being a producer:

I wanted to record my album myself, to learn recording-studio
engineering and production, because I thought that would be a really
rewarding and empowering thing to know how to do---like building your
own house.

Friends and mentors said that was ridiculous, that I should just hire a
great engineer, producer, and studio. Doing everything myself might take
years, whereas I could have it all done in a few weeks if I just hired
someone good.

I took the few years to learn it myself, and it was one of the most
rewarding experiences of my life. For the next few years, I did all the
production and engineering on a few friends' albums, too. Now it's
something I know how to do, and it feels great.

Being a programmer:

When I started CD Baby, I knew only some basic HTML, no programming. But
as the site grew, basic HTML wouldn't do it anymore. My tech friends
told me I had to make a server-side database-driven automated system.

[]{#part0035.html_pageMap_58}Since I couldn't afford to hire a
programmer, that meant I had to learn it myself. I went to the bookstore
and got a book on PHP and MySQL programming. It was the slow road, but I
loved it! As with being in the recording studio again, it was wonderful
to learn how to make the technology do what I wanted and not be a
mystery. And it was nice to be self-sufficient.

As the company grew, everyone was surprised that I still did all the
programming myself. But for an Internet business, outsourcing the
programming would be like a band outsourcing the songwriting! This
wasn't just my business---this was my creation. This wasn't like mowing
lawns---this was like writing songs.

In the last few years, my employees got furious that new features were
not being added as fast as they wanted, because I still insisted on
doing all the programming myself. They said we were losing millions of
dollars in business because we didn't have certain features. But that
was OK with me. I loved the process. I was happy.

Being, not having:

When you want to learn how to do something yourself, most people won't
understand. They'll assume the only reason we do anything is to get it
done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way.

But that's forgetting about the joy of learning and doing. Yes, it may
take longer. Yes, it may be inefficient. Yes, it may even cost you
millions of dollars in lost opportunities because your business is
growing slower because you're insisting on doing
[]{#part0035.html_pageMap_59}something yourself. But the whole point of
doing anything is because it makes you happy! That's it!

You might get bigger faster and make millions if you outsource
everything to the experts. But what's the point of getting bigger and
making millions? To be happy, right?

In the end, it's about what you want to be, not what you want to have.
To have something (a finished recording, a business, or millions of
dollars) is the means, not the end. To be something (a good singer, a
skilled entrepreneur, or just plain happy) is the real point.

When you sign up to run a marathon, you don't want a taxi to take you to
the finish line.

[]{#part0036.html_pageMap_60 .calibre2}The day Steve Jobs dissed me in a
keynote

In May 2003, Apple invited me to their headquarters to discuss getting
CD Baby's catalog into the iTunes Music Store. iTunes had just launched
two weeks before, with only some music from the major labels. Many of us
in the music biz---especially those who had seen companies like eMusic
use this exact same model for years without much success---were not sure
this idea was going to work.

I flew to Cupertino, California, thinking I'd be meeting with one of
Apple's marketing or tech people. When I arrived, I found out that about
a hundred people from small record labels and distributors had also been
invited.

We all went into a little presentation room, not knowing what to expect.
Then out came Steve Jobs. Whoa! Wow. He was in full persuasive
presentation mode---trying to convince all of us to give Apple our
entire catalog of music, talking about iTunes' success so far, and all
the reasons we should work with Apple. He made a point of saying, "We
want the iTunes Music Store to have every piece of music ever recorded.
Even if it's discontinued or not selling much, we want it all."

This was huge to me, because until 2003, independent musicians were
always denied access to the big outlets. For Apple to
[]{#part0036.html_pageMap_61}sell all music, not just music from artists
who had signed their rights away to a corporation---this was amazing!

Then the Apple guys showed us the software we'd all have to use to send
them each album. It required us to put the audio CD into a Mac CD-ROM
drive; type in all of the album info, the song titles, and the artist's
bio; click Encode for it to rip; and click Upload when done.

I raised my hand and asked if it was required that we use their
software. They said yes. I asked again, saying we had more than a
hundred thousand albums, already ripped as lossless WAV files, with all
of the info carefully entered by the artists themselves, ready to send
to Apple's servers with their exact specifications.

The Apple guys said, "Sorry, you need to use this software; there is no
other way."

Ugh. That meant we'd have to pull each one of those CDs off of the shelf
again, stick it in a Mac, and cut and paste every song title into that
Mac software. But so be it. If that's what Apple needed, OK.

They said they'd be ready for us to start uploading in the next couple
of weeks.

I flew home that night, posted my meeting notes on my website, e-mailed
all of my clients to announce the news, and went to sleep.

When I woke, I had furious e-mails and voice mails from my contact at
Apple: "What the hell are you doing? That meeting was confidential! Take
those notes off your site immediately! Our legal department is furious!"

[]{#part0036.html_pageMap_62}There had been no mention of
confidentiality at the meeting and no agreement to sign. But I removed
my notes from my site immediately, to be nice. All was well, or so I
thought.

Apple e-mailed us the iTunes Music Store contract. We immediately signed
it and returned it the same day. I started building the system to
deliver everyone's music to iTunes.

I decided we'd have to charge \$40 for this service to cover our
bandwidth and the payroll costs of pulling each CD out of the warehouse,
entering all the info, digitizing and uploading the music, and putting
the CD back in the warehouse.

Five thousand musicians signed up in advance, each paying \$40. That
\$200,000 helped pay for the extra equipment and people needed to make
this happen.

Within two weeks, we got contacted by Rhapsody, Yahoo! Music, Napster,
eMusic, and more, each saying they wanted our entire catalog. Yes!
Awesome!

Maybe you can't appreciate this now, but the summer of 2003 was the
biggest turning point that independent music has ever had. Until that
point, almost no big business would sell independent music. With iTunes
saying they wanted everything, and then their competitors needing to
keep up, we were in! Since the summer of 2003, all musicians everywhere
have been able to sell all their music in almost every outlet online. Do
you realize how amazing that is?

But there was one problem. iTunes wasn't getting back to us. Yahoo!,
Rhapsody, Napster, and the rest were all up and running. But iTunes
wasn't returning our signed contract. Was it because I had posted my
meeting notes? Had I pissed off Steve []{#part0036.html_pageMap_63}Jobs?
Nobody at Apple would say anything. It had been months. My musicians
were getting impatient and angry.

I gave optimistic apologies, but I was starting to get worried, too.

A month later, Steve Jobs did a special worldwide simulcast keynote
speech about iTunes. People had been criticizing iTunes for having less
music than the competition. They had 400,000 songs, while Rhapsody and
Napster had more than 2 million songs. (More than 500,000 of those were
from CD Baby.)

Four minutes in, he said something that made my pounding heart sink to
my burning stomach:

"This number could have easily been much higher, if we wanted to let in
every song. But we realize record companies do a great service. They
edit! Did you know that if you and I record a song, for \$40 we can pay
a few of the services to get it on their site, through some
intermediaries? We can be on Rhapsody and all these other guys for \$40?
Well, we don't want to let that stuff on our site! So we've had to edit
it. And these are 400,000 quality songs."

Whoa! Wow. Steve Jobs had just dissed me hard! I was the only one
charging \$40. That was me he was referring to!

Shit. OK. That's that. Steve changed his mind. No independents on
iTunes. You heard the man.

I hated the position this put me in. Ever since I started my company in
1998, I had been offering excellent service. I could make promises and
keep them because I was in full control. Now, for the first time, I had
promised something that was out of my control.

[]{#part0036.html_pageMap_64}So it was time to do the right thing, no
matter how much it hurt. I decided to refund everybody's \$40, with my
deepest apologies. With five thousand musicians signed up, that meant I
was refunding \$200,000.

Since we couldn't promise anything, I couldn't charge money in good
conscience. I removed all mention of iTunes from my site. I removed the
\$40 cost. I decided to make digital distribution a free service from
that point on. I changed the language to say we couldn't promise
anything. I e-mailed everyone to let them know what had happened.

The very next day, I got our signed contract back from Apple, along with
upload instructions. Unbelievable. I asked, "Why now?" but got no
answer. Whatever. Fucking Apple.

We started encoding and uploading immediately. I quietly added iTunes
back to the list of companies on our site.

But I never again promised a customer that I could do something that was
beyond my full control.

[]{#part0037.html_pageMap_65 .calibre2}My \$3.3 million mistake

Starting when I was a teenager, my dad would occasionally send me things
to sign for the family business. I didn't understand the complexities of
it, and didn't need to, so I'd just sign without question.

Four years before I started CD Baby, as I was recording my first album,
I needed to borrow \$20,000 to buy studio equipment. My dad said,
"Instead of my lending you money, start a corporation. Then the family
business can buy shares in your corporation."

So I did. Because my band was called Hit Me, I called the company Hit
Media Inc. My dad's company bought some shares, and that helped me
finish my album, and I continued to run my record studio at a profit.

Four years later, I was living in Woodstock, New York, and started this
little hobby called CD Baby.

The first time I got a check addressed to "CD Baby," I brought it down
to the bank and told the teller, "I need to set this up as a new
business, so let's open a new business account."

She said, "Oh you don't need to do that. You can just make it an alias
on your Hit Media account." (At that time, Hit Media was a recording
studio and booking agency.) It seemed a little strange because CD Baby
was definitely a new business, but it saved ten minutes and \$100, so I
said OK.

[]{#part0037.html_pageMap_66}Four years later, CD Baby was doing really
well: a few million dollars in sales, half a million dollars in net
profits. I paid my dad back the \$20,000 I had borrowed.

I called up my accountant in January. "OK. I got all the Quicken books
balanced. Should we file early this year?"

He said, "Oh, you don't need to file. CD Baby is just a line item on
your dad's company's tax return."

I said, "Uh . . . what?"

"You didn't know that your dad's company owns ninety percent of CD
Baby?"

"Uh . . . what?"

"You should talk to your dad."

Yes, it turns out that when I borrowed the \$20,000 eight years earlier,
I didn't realize that I got the \$20,000 by selling 90 percent of Hit
Media Inc. to my dad's company. Then because the bank teller advised me
to make CD Baby an alias of Hit Media, that meant my dad's company owned
90 percent of CD Baby as well.

FFFFffff . . . SSSSssss . . . RRRRrrrr . . . Oh, what a horrible sinking
feeling. What I thought was my company all these years was not actually
my company. I owned only 10 percent.

I couldn't be mad at my dad. He was doing me a favor back then and
thought I knew what I was signing. Nobody thought my little hobby was
going to turn into a multimillion-dollar business. It was my fault for
not reading what I signed. My fault for letting a bank teller's quick
advice make that major decision for my business structure.

What made it even worse is that I couldn't just buy the
[]{#part0037.html_pageMap_67}business back for the original \$20,000.
The IRS wouldn't allow that. The only way was to pay full market value,
as determined by an outside valuation company.

In the end, I had to pay \$3.3 million to buy back that 90 percent of my
company.

[]{#part0038.html_pageMap_68 .calibre2}Delegate or die: The
self-employment trap

Most self-employed people get caught in the delegation trap.

You're so busy, doing everything yourself. You know you need help, but
to find and train someone would take more time than you have. So you
keep working harder, until you break.

Here's my little tale of how I broke into the delegation mind-set:

In 2001, CD Baby was three years old. I had eight employees, but I was
still doing "everything else" myself, working 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., seven
days a week. Everything still went through me.

Every five minutes, my employees had a question for me:

"Derek, some guy wants to change the album art after it's already live
on the site. What do I tell him?"

"Derek, can we accept wire transfer as a form of payment?"

"Derek, someone placed two orders today, and wants to know if we can
ship them together as one, but refund him the shipping cost savings."

It was hard to get anything done while answering questions all day. I
felt like I might as well just show up to work and sit on a chair in the
hallway, just answering employees' questions full-time.

I hit my breaking point. I stopped going to the office and
[]{#part0038.html_pageMap_69}shut off my phone. Then I realized I was
running from my problems instead of solving them. I had to fix this, or
I'd be ruined.

After a long night of thinking and writing, I got myself into the
delegation mind-set. I had to make myself unnecessary to the running of
my company.

The next day, as soon as I walked in the door, someone said, "Derek,
someone whose CDs we received yesterday has now changed his mind and
wants his CDs shipped back. We've already done the work, but he's asking
if we can refund his setup fee since he was never live on the site."

This time, instead of just answering the question, I called everyone
together for a minute. I repeated the situation and the question. I
answered the question, but more important, I explained the thought
process and philosophy behind my answer.

"Yes, refund his money in full. We'll take a little loss. It's important
to always do whatever would make the customer happiest, as long as it's
not outrageous. A little gesture like this goes a long way toward him
telling his friends we're a great company. Everyone always remember that
helping musicians is our first goal, and profit is second. You have my
full permission to use that guideline to make these decisions yourself
in the future. Do what makes the musicians happiest. Make sure everyone
who deals with us leaves with a smile."

I asked around to make sure everyone understood the answer. I asked one
person to start a manual, and write down the answer to this one
situation, along with the philosophy behind it. Then everyone went back
to work.

Ten minutes later, a new question. Same process:

1.  []{#part0038.html_pageMap_70}Gather everybody around.
2.  Answer the question and explain the philosophy.
3.  Make sure everyone understands the thought process.
4.  Ask one person to write it in the manual.
5.  Let everybody know they can decide this without me next time.

After two months of this, there were no more questions.

Then I showed someone how to do the last of the stuff that was still my
job. As part of learning it, he had to document it in the manual, and
then show it to someone else, too. (Learn by teaching.)

Now I was totally unnecessary. I started working at home, not going into
the office at all.

I had even taught the employees my thought process and philosophy about
hiring new people. So our two newest employees were found, interviewed,
hired, and trained by other employees. They used that manual to make
sure all new employees understood the philosophy and history of CD Baby,
and knew how to make decisions for themselves.

I'd call in once a week to make sure everything was OK. It was. No one
had any questions for me.

Because my team was running the business, I was free to actually improve
the business! I moved to California, just to make
[]{#part0038.html_pageMap_71}it clear that the running of things was up
to the employees. I was still working twelve-hour days, but now I was
spending all my time on improvements, optimizations, and innovations. To
me, this was the fun stuff. This was play, not work.

While I was away, my company grew from \$1 million to \$20 million in
four years, and from eight to eighty-five employees.

There's a big difference between being self-employed and being a
business owner. Being self-employed feels like freedom until you realize
that if you take time off, your business crumbles. To be a true business
owner, make it so that you could leave for a year, and when you came
back, your business would be doing better than when you left.

[]{#part0039.html_pageMap_72 .calibre2}Make it anything you want

After your business has been up and running awhile, you'll hit an
interesting crossroads.

Everyone assumes that as the owner of the company, you'll be the
traditional CEO, having high-powered lunches with other high-powered
CEOs and doing all the big business deals. But what if you don't like
doing that? What if what you love the most is the solitude of the craft?
Or talking to customers?

Never forget that you can make your role anything you want it to be.
Anything you hate to do, someone else loves. So find that person and let
her do it.

I loved sitting alone and programming, writing, planning, and
inventing---thinking of ideas and making them happen. This makes me
happy, not business deals or management. So I found someone who liked
doing business deals and put him in charge of all that.

If you do this, you'll encounter a lot of pushback and misunderstanding,
but who cares? You can't live someone else's expectation of a
traditional business. You have to just do whatever you love the most, or
you'll lose interest in the whole thing.

On a similar note, people also assume that you want to be
big-big-big---as big as can be. But do you, really? Huge growth
[]{#part0039.html_pageMap_73}means lots of meetings, investors, bankers,
media, and answering to others. It's quite far from the real core of the
business.

Happiness is the real reason you're doing anything, right? Even if you
say it's for the money, the money is just a means to happiness, isn't
it? But what if it's proven that after a certain point, money doesn't
create any happiness at all, but only headaches? You may be much happier
as a \$1 million business than a \$1 billion business.

The funny thing is, I didn't want CD Baby to grow at all. Even from the
start, I didn't want this website hobby to take away from my career as a
musician, but it did. I didn't want it to have more than a couple of
employees or outgrow my house, but it did. When I had twenty employees,
I vowed to keep it that small, but customer demand kept growing, and I
had to keep the customers happy. When I had fifty employees, I swore
that was enough and we needed to curb this growth, but the business kept
growing.

When people would ask, "What are you doing to grow your company?" I'd
say, "Nothing! I'm trying to get it to stop growing! I don't like this.
It's too big." They thought that was the weirdest thing. Doesn't every
business want to be as big as possible?

No. Make sure you know what makes you happy, and don't forget it.

[]{#part0040.html_pageMap_74 .calibre2}Trust, but verify

In 2005, CD Baby's main business was doing digital delivery of music to
all the digital music retailers: iTunes, Amazon, Napster, Rhapsody, MSN,
Yahoo!, and fifty more. This role was life-or-death important to the
company because it was the main reason most of our new clients signed
up. And there were lots of competitors in this field, so it was crucial
that we did everything well.

I built a system that did most of the work, but it still required
someone to run the outputs, connect hard drives, and ship them to the
retailers. I hired a guy who seemed good. I sat side by side with him
for a week, showing him the system, running it myself, and explaining
how it all worked. He got it.

The key point was that we had to get every album delivered to every
company, every week, no matter what. The guy I hired signed a contract
with me that said, in huge letters, EVERY ALBUM, TO EVERY COMPANY, EVERY
WEEK, NO MATTER WHAT. We talked a lot about how absolutely crucial that
was---that it was really his only job requirement because it was that
important. He signed and agreed.

His first few weeks, I watched closely to make sure everything was going
well. It was. So I turned my attention back to other things.

A few months later, I started hearing a lot of complaints from
musicians, saying that their music hadn't been sent to these
[]{#part0040.html_pageMap_75}companies. I logged in to the system to see
what was wrong. It turns out that we hadn't sent any music to Napster,
Amazon, and some other companies in months. Months!

I called the guy in charge of it and asked what was going on. He said,
"Yeah, I've been really backed up. It's been really busy."

I said, "What's rule number one? The sole mission of your job?"

He said, "I know. Every album to every company every week no matter
what. But I've been swamped. I just couldn't."

I flew up to Portland and let him go. I've never fired anyone so fast,
but this was extreme. Our company's reputation was permanently damaged.

This job was so crucial to the company's survival that I decided to do
it myself for a while---not just do it, but build a system that wouldn't
let mistakes go unnoticed again. So for the next six months, I lived at
the warehouse in Portland, and my sole job was digital deliveries. It
took fifteen-hour days to catch up on months of backlog, but eventually
we had a smooth system again.

I learned a hard lesson in hindsight: Trust, but verify.

Remember it when delegating. You have to do both.

Delegation doesn't come naturally to any of us. But I was trying really
hard to be good at it. I knew how important it was to get into the
delegation mind-set. I was trying to empower my employees---to let them
know they could make decisions on their own, without me.

When they asked, "How should we organize all the rooms in the new
office?" I said, "Any way you want to do it is fine."

When they asked, "Which health-care plan should we go with?" I said,
"You guys choose. Take a vote. Whichever one you choose, I'll pay for."

When they asked, "Which profit-sharing plan should we go with?" I said,
"You guys choose. Whatever you think is best."

A local magazine voted CD Baby "Best Place to Work" in the state of
Oregon.

Six months later, my accountant called me and said, "Did you know that
your employees set up a profit-sharing program?"

I said, "Yeah. Why?"

He said, "Did you know that they're giving all of the profits of the
company back to themselves?"

Oops.

When I canceled the profit-sharing program, I became a
[]{#part0041.html_pageMap_77}very unpopular guy. In our weekly company
meetings, the general message from the employees was, "We need to get
Derek out of here, so he stops telling us what to do. We don't need to
answer to him! He needs to answer to us!"

Then I realized that there's such a thing as over-delegation. I had
empowered my employees so much that I gave them all the power. After a
complete communication breakdown, it was eighty-five people (my
employees) against one (me). I became the scapegoat for all of their
dissatisfaction.

I thought of trying to repair relationships with each of the eighty-five
employees over hundreds of hours of talking. But if you've ever had a
romance break up, you know that sometimes it's beyond repair.

So I considered firing everyone and hiring a whole new crew. I also
considered shutting down the company entirely, since I wasn't enjoying
this anymore. I even thought about a Willy Wonka move, in which I'd put
five golden tickets into five CDs and then give the whole company to
some lucky finder.

In the end, I did what was best for my clients and me: I retreated into
solitude, staying at a friend's house in London, and focused entirely on
programming some major new software features for CD Baby. I never saw or
spoke to my employees again, never saw the office again.

I learned an important word: *abdicate*. To abdicate means to surrender
or relinquish power or responsibility; this word is usually used when a
king abdicates the throne or crown.

Lesson learned too late: Delegate, but don't abdicate.

[]{#part0042.html_pageMap_78 .calibre2}How I knew I was done

I thought I would never sell CD Baby. When National Public Radio did a
story about me in 2004, I said I'd stick it out until the end, and I
meant it.

In 2007 I did a ground-up rewrite of the website from scratch. And man,
it was beautiful code. The proudest achievement of my life so far is
that rewritten software. Wonderfully organized, extensible, and
efficient: the culmination of everything I'd learned about programming
in ten years.

After a successful relaunch and Christmas rush, I was looking at my
plans for 2008 and beyond. Every plan needed a huge effort for little
reward, but all were required for future growth. I had broken the plans
into about twenty projects of two to twelve weeks each, and I wasn't
excited about any of them. I'd taken CD Baby far beyond my goals, and I
realized I had no big vision for its being much else.

The next week, I got calls from three companies, each asking if I'd be
interested in selling. I said no, as usual, since I'd been giving the
same answer for ten years.

But just to be open-minded, that weekend I opened my diary and started
answering the question, "What if I sold?" I had done this a few times in
previous years, but the answer had always been, "No way! There's so much
more I want to do! This is my baby. I can't stop now!"

[]{#part0042.html_pageMap_79}This time it was different. I thought about
how nice it'd be to not have eighty-five employees and all that
responsibility. I wrote about how nice it'd be to get outside a bit and
feel free of all that. I got excited about all the cool new projects I
could do instead.

I realized that the bigger learning and growing challenge for me was
letting go, not staying on.

Surprised by this, I asked Seth Godin's advice. All he said was, "If you
care, sell." (I think his point was that my lack of enthusiastic vision
was doing a disservice to my clients. It'd be better for everyone if I
put the company in more motivated hands that could help them all grow.)

I called Jared Rose, my business coach, and asked him to grill me about
this big decision. "What other ways can you achieve the freedom you
want, without selling?" he asked me. After an hour of questions like
this, we both came to the conclusion that I was really done.

As with any breakup, graduation, or move, you emotionally disconnect,
and it all feels as if it's in the distant past. I felt like I was
already on the highway with a little box of stuff, moving cross-country,
with my old home long gone, never to be seen again. By the end of that
day, I was no longer derek@cdbaby.com.

Unfortunately, as with a divorce, the paperwork took another seven
months. I let two companies bid, and ended up choosing the one that bid
lower but understood my clients better.

It was never about the money. The decision was done in that one
introspective day of writing in my diary and talking with my mentors.
Afterward, I was completely unconflicted and knew it was the right
decision.

[]{#part0042.html_pageMap_80}I went to bed that night (January 18, 2008)
and slept longer than I had in months. Then I woke up full of detailed
ideas for my next company, but that's a different story.

I've been asked a few times by other entrepreneurs, "How do you know
when it's time to sell?"

My answer is, "You'll know." But I hope this detailed story describes
how it will feel.

[]{#part0043.html_pageMap_81 .calibre2}Why I gave my company to charity

Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller were at a party at a billionaire's
extravagant estate. Kurt said, "Wow! Look at this place! This guy has
everything!" Joseph said, "Yes, but I have something he'll never
have. . . . Enough."

When I decided to sell CD Baby, I already had enough. I live simply. I
don't own a house, a car, or even a TV. The less I own, the happier I
am. The lack of stuff gives me the priceless freedom to live anywhere
anytime.

So I didn't need or even want the money from the sale of the company. I
just wanted to make sure I had enough for a simple, comfortable life.
The rest should go to music education because that's what made such a
difference in my life.

I created a charitable trust called the Independent Musicians Charitable
Remainder Unitrust. When I die, all of its assets will go to music
education. But while I'm alive, it pays out 5 percent of its value per
year to me. A few months before the sale, I transferred all the CD Baby
assets into the trust. It was irrevocably gone. It was no longer mine.
It all belonged to the charitable trust.

Then, when Disc Makers bought CD Baby, they bought it
[]{#part0043.html_pageMap_82}not from me but from the trust, turning it
into \$22 million cash to benefit music education.

It's not that I'm altruistic. I'm sacrificing nothing. I've just learned
what makes me happy. And doing it this way made me the happiest.

I get the deeper happiness of knowing that the lucky streak I've had in
my life will benefit tons of people---not just me. I get the pride of
knowing I did something smart and irreversible before I could change my
mind. I get the safety of knowing I won't be the target of wrongful
lawsuits, since I have very little net worth. I get the unburdened
freedom of having it out of my hands so I can't do something stupid.

But most of all, I get the constant priceless reminder that I have
enough.

[]{#part0044.html_pageMap_83 .calibre2}You make your perfect world

I started CD Baby focused on the importance of making a dream-come-true
perfect world for musicians. Along the way I learned the importance of
making my business a dream come true for myself, too.

Business is as creative as the fine arts. You can be as unconventional,
unique, and quirky as you want. A business is a reflection of the
creator.

- Some people want to be billionaires with thousands of employees. Some
  people want to work alone.
- Some want as much profit as possible. Some want as little profit as
  possible.
- Some want to be in Silicon Valley with Fortune 500 customers. Some
  want to be anonymous.

No matter which goal you choose, there will be lots of people telling
you you're wrong.

Just pay close attention to what excites you and what drains
[]{#part0044.html_pageMap_84}you. Pay close attention to when you're
being the real you and when you're trying to impress an invisible jury.

Even if what you're doing is slowing the growth of your business---if it
makes you happy, that's OK. It's your choice to remain small.

You'll notice that as my company got bigger, my stories about it were
less happy. That was my lesson learned. I'm happier with five employees
than with eighty-five, and happiest working alone.

Whatever you make, it's your creation, so make it your personal dream
come true.
