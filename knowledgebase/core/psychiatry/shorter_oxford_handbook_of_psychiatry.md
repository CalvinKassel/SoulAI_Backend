Psychiatrists require two distinct capacities. One is the  capacity to collect clinical data objectively and accur ately, and to organize and communicate the data in a  systematic and balanced way. The other is the capacity  for intuitive understanding of each patient as an indi vidual. When the psychiatrist exercises the first cap acity, he draws on his skills and knowledge of clinical  phenomena; when he exercises the second capacity,  he draws on his knowledge of human nature and his  experience with former patients to gain insights into the  patient he is now seeing. Both capacities can be devel oped by listening to patients, and by learning from more  experienced psychiatrists. A  textbook can provide the  information and describe the procedures necessary to    
psychiatric patients. In other words, he decides whether  the clinical features conform to a recognized syndrome.  He does this by combining observations about the  patient’s present state with information about the history  of the condition. The value of identifying a syndrome is  that it helps to predict prognosis and to select an effect 

ive treatment. It does this by directing the psychiatrist  to the relevant body of accumulated knowledge about  mebo  
the causes, treatment, and outcome in similar patients.  Diagnosis and classification are discussed in the next  chapter, and also in each of the chapters dealing with the  various psychiatric disorders. Chapter 3 discusses how to  elicit and interpret the symptoms described in this chap 

ter, and how to integrate the information to arrive at a    
mebooksfree.com

develop the first capacity. The focus of the chapter on  the first capacity does not imply that intuitive under standing is unimportant, but simply that it cannot be  learned directly or solely from a textbook. 

Skill in examining patients depends on a sound know ledge of how symptoms and signs are defined. Without  such knowledge, the psychiatrist is liable to misclassify  phenomena and thereby make inaccurate diagnoses. For  this reason, this chapter is concerned with the defin ition of the key symptoms and signs of psychiatric dis orders. Having elicited a patient’s symptoms and signs,  the psychiatrist needs to decide how far these phenom ena fall into a pattern that has been observed in other    
syndromal diagnosis, since this in turn is the basis for a  rational approach to management and prognosis. 

As much of the present chapter consists of defini tions and descriptions of symptoms and signs, it may  be less easy to read than those that follow. It is sug gested that the reader might approach it in two stages.  The first reading would be applied to the introductory  sections and to a general understanding of the more  mebo  
frequently observed phenomena. The second reading  would focus on details of definition and the less com mon symptoms and signs, and might be done best in  conjunction with an opportunity to interview a patient  exhibiting these.

**General issues** 

Before individual phenomena are described, some gen eral issues will be considered concerning the methods  of studying symptoms and signs, and the terms that are  used to describe them.

of mental processes of which the patient is unaware (i.e.  mebo  
they are ‘unconscious’). For example, Freud explained  persecutory delusions as being evidence, in the con scious mind, of activities in the unconscious mind,  including the mechanisms of repression and projection  (see p. 277).

Subsequently, experimental psychopathology has

The study of abnormal states of mind is known as *psycho pathology*. The term embraces two distinct approaches to  the subject—*descriptive* and *experimental*. This chapter is  concerned almost exclusively with the former; the latter  is introduced here but is discussed in later chapters. 

**Descriptive psychopathology** 

*Descriptive psychopathology* is the objective description of    
focused on empirically measurable and verifiable con scious psychological processes, using experimental  methods such as cognitive and behavioural psych ology and functional brain imaging. For example, there  are cognitive theories of the origin of delusions, panic  attacks, and depression. Although experimental psycho pathology is concerned with the causes of symptoms,  it is usually conducted in the context of the syndromes  

abnormal states of mind avoiding, as far as possible, pre conceived ideas or theories, and limited to the descrip tion of conscious experiences and observable behaviour.  It is sometimes also called *phenomenology* or *phenomeno logical psychopathology*, although the terms are not in  fact synonymous, and phenomenology has additional  

in which the symptoms occur. Thus its findings are dis cussed in the chapter covering the disorder in question.

meanings (Berrios, 1992). Likewise, descriptive psycho pathology is more than just *symptomatology* (Stanghellini  and Broome, 2014). 

The aim of descriptive psychopathology is to eluci date the essential qualities of morbid mental experiences  and to understand each patient’s experience of illness. It  therefore requires the ability to elicit, identify, and inter 

**Symptoms and signs** 

In general medicine there is a clear definition of, and  separation between, a symptom and a sign. In psych iatry the situation is different. There are few ‘signs’ in  the medical sense (apart from the motor abnormalities  of catatonic schizophrenia or the physical manifesta

tions of anorexia nervosa), with most diagnostic infor

The most important exponent of descriptive psycho pathology was the German psychiatrist and philosopher,  Karl Jaspers. His classic work, *Allgemeine Psychopathologie*   
mation coming from the history and observations of  the patient’s appearance and behaviour. Use of the word  ‘sign’ in psychiatry is therefore less clear, and two dif ferent uses may be encountered. First, it may refer to  a feature noted by the observer rather than something  spoken by the patient (e.g. a patient who appears to be

(*General Psychopathology*), first published in 1913, still  provides the most complete account of the subject, and  the seventh edition is available in an English transla tion (Jaspers, 1963). A briefer introduction can be found  in Jaspers (1968), and Oyebode (2014) has provided  a highly readable contemporary text on descriptive  psychopathology.   
responding to a hallucination). Secondly, it may refer  to a group of symptoms that the observer interprets in  aggregation as a sign of a particular disorder. In prac tice, the phrase ‘symptoms and signs’ is often used  interchangeably with ‘symptoms’ (as we have done in  this chapter) to refer collectively to the phenomena of  psychiatric disorders, without a clear distinction being

nomena, as well as to describe them. One of the first  attempts was *psychodynamic psychopathology*, originating  in Freud’s psychoanalytic investigations (see p. 91). It  explains the causes of abnormal mental events in terms    
In general medicine, the terms *subjective* and *objective* are  used as counterparts of symptoms and signs, respectively,  with ‘objective’ being defined as something observed  directly by the doctor (e.g. meningism, jaundice)—even

though, strictly speaking, it is a subjective judgement on  his part as to what has been observed. 

In psychiatry, the terms have broadly similar mean ings as they do in medicine, although with a blurring  between them, just as there is for symptoms and signs.  ‘Objective’ refers to features observed during an inter view (i.e. the patient’s appearance and behaviour). The  term is usually used when the psychiatrist wants to com pare this with the patient’s description of symptoms. For  example, in evaluation of depression, complaints of low

content, not the form, that is of concern to the patient,  whose priority will be to discuss the persecution and its  implications, and who may be irritated by what seem  to be irrelevant questions about the form of the belief.  mebo  
The psychiatrist must be sensitive to this difference in  emphasis between the two parties. 

**Primary and secondary** 

With regard to symptoms, the terms *primary* and *sec ondary* are often used, but unfortunately with two dif

mood and tearfulness are subjective features, whereas  observations of poor eye contact, psychomotor retarda tion, and crying are objective ones. If both are present,  the psychiatrist might record ‘subjective *and* objective  evidence of depression’, with the combination provid ing stronger evidence than either alone. However, if the  patient’s behaviour and manner in the interview appear  entirely normal, he records ‘not objectively depressed’,  despite the subjective complaints. It is then incumbent  on the psychiatrist to explore the reasons for the dis crepancy and to decide what diagnostic conclusions  he should draw. As a rule, objective signs are accorded  greater weight. Thus he may diagnose a depressive dis order if there is sufficient evidence of this kind, even if    
ferent meanings. The first meaning is *temporal*, simply  referring to which occurred first. The second meaning  is *causal*, whereby primary means ‘arising directly from  the pathological process’, and secondary means ‘arising  as a reaction to a primary symptom’. The two meanings  often coincide, as symptoms that arise directly from  the pathological process usually appear first. However,  although subsequent symptoms are often a reaction to    
mebo  
the first symptoms, they are not always of this kind, for  they too may arise directly from the pathological pro cess. The terms primary and secondary are used more  often in the temporal sense because this usage does not  involve an inference about causality. However, many  patients cannot say in what order their symptoms    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com

the patient denies the subjective experience of feeling  depressed. Conversely, the psychiatrist may question the  significance of complaints of low mood, however promi nent, if there are none of the objective features associ ated with the diagnosis. 

**Form and content**   
appeared. In such cases, when it seems likely that one  symptom is a reaction to another—for example, that  a delusion of being followed by persecutors is a reac tion to hearing accusing voices—it is described as sec ondary (using the word in the causal sense). The terms  primary and secondary are also used in descriptions of  syndromes. 

When psychiatric symptoms are described, it is useful  to distinguish between form and content, a distinction  

**Understanding and explanation**   
mebo  
that is best explained by an example. If a patient says  that, when he is alone, he hears voices calling him a  homosexual, the *form* of the experience is an auditory  hallucination (see below), whereas the *content* is the  statement that he is homosexual. Another patient might    
Jaspers (1913) contrasted two forms of understanding  when applied to symptoms. The first, called *Verstehen* (‘understanding’), is the attempt to appreciate the  patient’s subjective experience: what does it feel like?  This important skill requires intuition and empathy.

hear voices saying that she is about to be killed. Again  the form is an auditory hallucination, but the content  is different. A third patient might experience repeated  intrusive thoughts that he is homosexual, but he realizes  that these are untrue. Here the content is the same as  that of the first example, but the form is different. 

Form is often critical when making a diagnosis. From  the examples given above, the presence of a hallucina tion indicates (by definition) a psychosis of one kind or  another, whereas the third example suggests obsessive– compulsive disorder. Content is less diagnostically  useful, but can be very important in management; for  example, the content of a delusion may suggest that the  patient could attack a supposed persecutor. It is also the    
The second approach, called *Erklären* (‘explanation’),  accounts for events in terms of external factors; for  example, the patient’s low mood can be ‘explained’  by his recent redundancy. The latter approach requires  knowledge of psychiatric aetiology (Chapter 5). 

**The significance of individual symptoms** 

mebo  
Psychiatric disorders are diagnosed when a defined  group of symptoms (a syndrome) is present. Almost any  single symptom can be experienced by a healthy per son; even hallucinations, often regarded as a hallmark  of severe mental disorder, are experienced by some  otherwise healthy people. An exception to this is that  a delusion, even if isolated, is generally considered to

be evidence of psychiatric disorder if it is unequivocal  and persistent (see Chapter  11). In general, however,  the finding of a single symptom is not evidence of psy chiatric disorder, but an indication for a thorough and,  if necessary, repeated search for other symptoms and  signs of psychiatric disorder. The dangers of not adher ing to this principle are exemplified by the well-known  study by Rosenhan (1973). Eight ‘patients’ presented  with the complaint that they heard the words ‘empty,  hollow, thud’ being said out loud. All eight individuals  

subject. This way of understanding is sometimes called  the life-story approach. It is not something that can be  readily assimilated from textbooks; it is best learned by  taking time to listen to patients. The psychiatrist may  mebo  
be helped by reading biographies or works of literature  that provide insights into the ways in which experi ences throughout life shape the personality, and help  to explain the diverse ways in which different people  respond to the same events.

were admitted and diagnosed with schizophrenia, des pite denying all other symptoms and behaving entirely  normally. This study also illustrates the importance of  descriptive psychopathology, and of reliable diagnos tic criteria (see Chapter  2), as fundamental aspects of  psychiatry. 

**The patient’s experience** 

Symptoms and signs are only part of the subject mat ter of psychopathology. The latter is also concerned  with the patient’s experience of illness, and the way  in which psychiatric disorder changes his view of him self, his hopes for the future, and his view of the world  (Stanghellini and Broome, 2014). This may be seen as    
**Cultural variations in psychopathology** 

The core symptoms of most serious mental disorders  are present in culturally diverse individuals. However,  there are cultural differences in how these symp toms present in clinical settings and to the meanings  that are attributed to them. For example, depression  can present with prominent somatic symptoms in  many Asian populations, such as those from India    
mebo  
and China. The content of symptoms can also differ  between cultures. For example, for sub-Saharan African  populations, delusions not infrequently centre upon  being cursed, a rare delusional theme in Europeans.  Cultural differences also affect the person’s subjective  experience of illness, and therefore influence that per

one example of the understanding (*verstehen*) men tioned above. A  depressive disorder may have a very  different effect on a person who has lived a satisfying  and happy life and has fulfilled his major ambitions,  compared with a person who has had many previous  misfortunes but has lived on hopes of future success.  To understand this aspect of the patient’s experience  of psychiatric disorder, the psychiatrist has to under stand him in the way that a biographer understands his    
son’s understanding of it (Fabrega, 2000). In some cul tures, the effects of psychiatric disorder are ascribed to  witchcraft—a belief that adds to the patient’s distress.  In many cultures, mental illness is greatly stigmatized,  and can, for example, hinder prospects of marriage. In  such a culture the effect of illness on the patient’s view  of himself and his future will be very different from  mebo  
the effect on a patient living in a society that is more  tolerant of mental disorder.

**Disturbances of emotion**    
**and mood** 

Much of psychiatry is concerned with abnormal emo tional states, particularly disturbances of mood and  other emotions, especially anxiety. Before describing the  main symptoms of this kind, it is worth clarifying two  areas of terminology that may cause confusion, in part  

because their usage has changed over the years. First, the term ‘mood’ can either be used as a broad  term to encompass all emotions (e.g. ‘anxious mood’),  or in a more restricted sense to mean the emotion that  runs from depression at one end to mania at the other.  

The former usage is now uncommon. The latter usage is  emphasized by the fact that, in current diagnostic sys tems, ‘mood disorders’ are those in which depression and  mania are the defining characteristics, whereas disorders  defined by anxiety or other emotional disturbances are  categorized separately. In this section, features common  to both ‘mood’ and ‘other emotions’ are described first,    
mebo  
before the specific features of anxiety, depression, and  mania are discussed separately. 

The second point concerns the term ‘affect’. This is  now usually used interchangeably with the term ‘mood’,  in the more limited meaning of the latter word (e.g.  ‘his affect was normal’, ‘he has an affective disorder’).

However, in the past, these words had different nuances    
**Descriptions of symptoms and signs** 

**Anxiety**   
of meaning; mood referred to a prevailing and prolonged  state, whereas affect was linked to a particular aspect or  object, and was more transitory. 

Emotions and mood may be abnormal in three ways: 

● Their nature may be altered 

● They may fluctuate more or less than usual 

● They may be inconsistent with the patient’s thoughts  or actions, or with his current circumstances.   
mebooksfree.com 

Anxiety is a normal response to danger. Anxiety is  abnormal when its severity is out of proportion to the  mebo  
threat of danger, or when it outlasts the threat. Anxious  mood is closely coupled with somatic and autonomic  components, and with psychological ones. All can be  thought of as equivalent to the preparations for deal 

ing with danger seen in other mammals, ready for flight  from, avoidance of, or fighting with a predator. Mild-to moderate anxiety enhances most kinds of performance,    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
**Changes in the nature of emotions and mood** These can be towards anxiety, depression, elation, or  irritability and anger. Any of these changes may be asso ciated with events in the person’s life, but they may arise  without an apparent reason. They are usually accom panied by other symptoms and signs. For example, an  increase in anxiety is accompanied by autonomic over activity and increased muscle tension, and depression  is accompanied by gloomy preoccupations and psycho motor slowness. 

**Changes in the way that emotions**  

**and mood vary**

but very high levels interfere with it. 

The anxiety response is considered further in  Chapter  8\. Here its main components can be summa rized as follows. 

● *Psychological.* The essential feelings of dread and appre hension are accompanied by restlessness, narrowing of  attention to focus on the source of danger, worrying    
mebo  
thoughts, increased alertness (with insomnia), and  irritability (that is, a readiness to become angry). 

● *Somatic*. Muscle tension and respiration increase. If  these changes are not followed by physical activity,  they may be experienced as muscle tension tremor, or  the effects of hyperventilation (e.g. dizziness).   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
Emotions and mood vary in relation to the person’s  circumstances and preoccupations. In abnormal states,  this variation with circumstances may continue, but the  variations may be greater or less than normal. Increased  variation is called *lability* of mood; extreme variation is  sometimes called *emotional incontinence*. 

Reduced variation is called *blunting* or *flattening*.  These terms have been used with subtly different  meanings, but are now usually used interchangeably.  Blunting or flattening usually occurs in depression and  schizophrenia. Severe flattening is sometimes called  *apathy* (note the difference from the layman’s meaning  of the word). 

Emotion can also vary in a way that is not in keep 

● *Autonomic*. Heart rate and sweating increase, the  mouth becomes dry, and there may be an urge to uri nate or defaecate. 

● *Avoidance of danger*. A *phobia* is a persistent, irrational  fear of a specific object or situation. Usually there is  also a marked wish to avoid the object, although this  is not always the case—for example, fear of illness  mebo  
(hypochondriasis). The fear is out of proportion to the  objective threat, and is recognized as such by the per son experiencing it. Phobias include fear of animate  objects, natural phenomena, and situations. Phobic  people feel anxious not only in the presence of the  object or situation, but also when thinking about it

ing with the person’s circumstances and thoughts, and  this is described as *incongruous* or *inappropriate*. For  example, a patient may appear to be in high spirits and  laugh when talking about the death of his mother. Such  incongruity must be distinguished from the embarrassed  laughter which indicates that the person is ill at ease.

Clinical associations 

Depression can occur in any psychiatric disorder. It is  the defining feature of mood disorders, and commonly  occurs in schizophrenia, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive  disorder, eating disorders, and substance-induced disor 

ders. It can also be a manifestation of an organic disorder. 

**Elation** 

Happy moods have been studied less than depressed  mood. Elation is an extreme degree of happy mood  which, like depression, is coupled with other changes,  including increased feelings of self-confidence and well   
*eidetic imagery*, which is visual imagery so intense and  detailed that it has a ‘photographic’ quality akin to a  percept, although in other ways it differs from a percept.  Imagery is generally terminated when perception starts.  Occasionally, imagery persists despite the presence of  percept (provided this is weak and unstructured). This  sort of imagery is called *pareidolia*. 

Percepts may alter in intensity and in quality. Anxious  mebo  
people may experience sensations as more intense than  usual; for example, they may be unusually sensitive  to noise. In mania, perceptions seem more vivid than  usual. Depressed patients may experience perceptions as  dull and lifeless.

being, increased activity, and increased arousal. The lat ter is usually experienced as pleasant, but sometimes  as an unpleasant feeling of restlessness. Elation occurs  most often in mania and hypomania.

Irritability is a state of increased readiness for anger. Both

*Illusions* are misperceptions of external stimuli. They  occur when the general level of sensory stimulation is  reduced and when attention is not focused on the rel evant sensory modality. For example, at dusk the out line of a bush may be perceived at first as that of a man,  although not when attention is focused on the outline.  

irritability and anger may occur in many kinds of dis

**Disturbances of perception** 

Specific kinds of perceptual disturbance are symptoms  of severe psychiatric disorders. It is therefore important  to be able to identify these symptoms and to distinguish  them from the other, much less significant, alterations  in sensory experience which occur. We shall therefore  describe perceptual phenomena in some detail. 

**Perception and imagery** 

*Perception* is the process of becoming aware of what is  presented through the sense organs. It is not a direct  awareness of data from the sense organs, because these

Hallucinations are generally indications of signifi 

cant psychiatric disorder, and specific types of hallucin mebo  
ation are characteristic of different disorders, as outlined  below. However, as noted above, hallucinations do occur  in some otherwise healthy people. It is also common to  experience them when falling asleep (*hypnagogic hal* 

*lucinations*) or on waking (*hypnopompic hallucinations*).  These two types of hallucination may be either visual  or auditory, the latter sometimes as the experience of

*Visual hallucinations* may also be elementary or com plex. The content may appear normal or abnormal in  mebo

Hallucinations can be described in terms of their com plexity and their sensory modality (see Box 1.1). The  term *elementary hallucination* refers to experiences such  as bangs, whistles, and flashes of light, whereas the term  *complex hallucination* refers to experiences such as hear 

ing voices or music, or seeing faces and scenes. *Auditory hallucinations* may be experienced as noises,  music, or voices. Voices may be heard clearly or indis tinctly; they may seem to speak words, phrases, or sen tences. They may seem to address the patient directly  (*second-person hallucinations*), or talk to one another,  referring to the patient as ‘he’ or ‘she’ (*third-person hal lucinations*). Sometimes patients say that the voices  anticipate what they are about to think a few moments  

are frequently experienced together. The smells and  tastes are often unpleasant. 

*Tactile hallucinations*, sometimes called *haptic* hal lucinations, may be experienced as sensations of being  touched, pricked, or strangled. Sometimes they are felt  as movements just below the skin, which the patient  may attribute to insects, worms, or other small creatures  burrowing through the tissues. *Hallucinations of deep*

Rarely,  the experience is accompanied by the conviction that  the person has a double (*Doppelganger*).

ophrenia, severe mood disorder, organic disorders, and  dissociative states. Therefore the finding of hallucina tions does not itself help much in diagnosis. However, as  with delusions, there are certain kinds of hallucination  which do have important implications for diagnosis of  schizophrenia and other disorders. 

● *Auditory hallucination.* Only clearly heard voices  mebo  
(not noises or music) have diagnostic significance.  Third-person hallucinations (introduced above) are  strongly associated with schizophrenia. Such voices  may be experienced as commenting on the patient’s  intentions (e.g. ‘He wants to make love to her’)  or actions (e.g. ‘She is washing her face’), or may  make critical comments.

do so. Thus voices with derogatory content (e.g. ‘You

are a failure, you are wicked’) suggest severe depres sive disorder, especially when the patient accepts  them as justified. In schizophrenia, the patient more  often resents such comments. Voices which antici pate, echo, or repeat the patient’s thoughts also sug gest schizophrenia. 

A *delusional perception* is a delusion arising directly from  a normal percept. This is sometimes erroneously consid ered to be a perceptual disturbance, but it is really a dis order of thought, and is therefore discussed in the next  section.

● *Visual hallucinations* should always suggest the possi bility of an organic disorder, although they also occur  in severe affective disorders, schizophrenia, and disso ciative disorder. The content of visual hallucinations  is of little significance in diagnosis. Autoscopic hal lucinations also raise suspicion of an organic disorder,  such as temporal lobe epilepsy.

Pseudohallucinations 

This term refers to experiences that are similar to hallu cinations but which do not meet all of the requirements  of the definition, nor have the same implications. The  word has two distinct meanings, which correspond to  two of the ways in which an experience can fail to meet  the criteria for a hallucination. In the first meaning,  pseudohallucination is a sensory experience that dif fers from a hallucination in not seeming to the patient  to represent external reality, being located within the    
● *Disturbance of the thinking process* and the link ing together of different thoughts; this may affect  the speed or the form of the relationship between  thoughts. It can occur even if individual thoughts are  unremarkable in nature. These phenomena are cov ered in the next section. 

**Delusions**   
mebo  
A *delusion* is a belief that is firmly held on inadequate  grounds, that is not affected by rational argument or  evidence to the contrary, and that is not a conventional  belief that the person might be expected to hold given  their educational, cultural, and religious background.  This definition is intended to separate delusions, which

mind rather than in external space. In this way pseu dohallucinations resemble imagery although, unlike  imagery, they cannot be dismissed by an effort of will.  In the second meaning, the sensory experience appears  to originate in the external world, but it seems unreal.  For a more detailed discussion, see Hare (1973) and  Taylor (1981).   
are cardinal symptoms of severe psychiatric disorder  (and specifically of psychosis), from other kinds of  abnormal thoughts and from strongly held beliefs found  among healthy people. There are several problems with  the definition, which is summarized in Box 1.2, but it  suffices as a starting point for more detailed discussion  of delusions. 

Both definitions of pseudohallucinations are difficult

teristic feature of delusions is that they have a marked  effect on the person’s feeling and actions—in the  same way that strongly held normal beliefs do. Since  the behavioural response to the delusion may itself  be out of keeping or even bizarre, it is often this that

**Box 1.2 Problems with the definition of delusions**   
**Descriptions of symptoms and signs** 

**Delusions are firmly held**  

**despite evidence to the contrary** 

The hallmark of a delusion is that it is held with such  conviction that it cannot be altered by presenting  evidence to the contrary. For example, a patient who  holds the delusion that there are persecutors in the  

delusion that hallucinated voices are those of people who  are spying on the patient. 

**Delusions are not beliefs shared**

This criterion is important when the patient is a mem

adjoining house will not be convinced by evidence  that the house is empty. Instead he may suggest that  the persecutors left the house shortly before it was  searched. The problem with this criterion for delusions  is that some of the ideas of normal people are equally  impervious to contrary evidence. For example, the  beliefs of a convinced spiritualist are not undermined  by the counterarguments of a non-believer. Strongly  held non-delusional beliefs are called overvalued ideas (see page 14). 

A further problem with this part of the definition of  delusion relates to partial delusions. Although delu sions are usually held strongly from the start, some times they are at first held with a degree of doubt. Also,    
ber of a culture or subculture (including a religious  faith), because healthy people in such a group may hold  beliefs that are not accepted outside it. Like delusions,  such cultural beliefs are generally impervious to contrary  evidence and reasoned argument—for example, beliefs  in evil spirits. Therefore, before deciding that an idea is  delusional, it is important to determine whether other  members of the same culture share the belief. 

**Delusions as false beliefs** 

Some definitions of delusions indicate that they are  false beliefs, but this criterion was not included in  the definition given above. This omission is because,  in exceptional circumstances, a delusional belief can

during recovery it is not uncommon for patients to pass  through a stage of increasing doubt about their delu sions before finally rejecting them. The term ‘partial  delusion’ refers to both these situations of doubt. It  should be used during recovery only when it is known  that the beliefs were preceded by a full delusion, and  applied to the development of a delusion only when it  is known in retrospect that a full delusion developed  later. Partial delusions are not, in isolation, helpful in  diagnosis—akin to the status of pseudohallucinations  mentioned on page 8.

be true or can subsequently become true. A well-rec ognized example relates to pathological jealousy (see  page 306). It is not falsity that determines whether the  belief is delusional, but the nature of the mental pro cesses that led up to it. (The difficulty with this state ment is that we cannot define these mental processes  precisely.) There is a further practical problem concern ing the use of falsity as a criterion for delusion. It is that  if the criterion is used, it may be assumed that, because  a belief is highly improbable, it is false. This is certainly  not a sound assumption, because improbable stories— for example, of persecution by neighbours—sometimes  turn out to be true and arrived at through sound obser vations and logical thought. Therefore ideas should be

Delusions are not arrived at by the ordinary processes of  observation and logic. Some delusions appear suddenly  without any previous thinking about the subject (primary  delusions). Other delusions appear to be attempts to  explain another abnormal experiences—for example, the

leads to the delusion being elicited. For example, a man  with the delusion that he was being irradiated by sonic  waves covered his windows with silver foil and barri caded his door. Occasionally, however, a delusion has    
little influence on feelings and actions. For example, a  patient may believe that he is a member of the royal  family while living contentedly in a group home. This  separation is called *double orientation*, and usually occurs  in chronic schizophrenia.

tressing mental events, it is often difficult to be certain  which experience came first. Primary delusions are given  considerable weight in the diagnosis of schizophrenia,  and they should be recorded only when it is certain that  they are present.

Primary and secondary delusions 

A *primary* or *autochthonous* delusion is one that appears  suddenly and with full conviction but without any men tal events leading up to it. For example, a schizophrenic  patient may be suddenly and completely convinced, for  no reason and with no prior thoughts of this kind, that

*Secondary delusions* are delusions apparently derived  from a preceding morbid experience. The latter may be  of several kinds, including hallucinations (e.g. some one who hears voices may believe that he is being fol lowed), low mood (e.g. a profoundly depressed woman  may believe people think that she is worthless), or an  existing delusion (e.g. a person who is convinced he  is being ‘framed’ may come to believe that he will be

When a patient first experiences a delusion, he responds  emotionally. For example, a person who believes that a  group of people intends to kill him is likely to feel afraid.  Occasionally, the change of mood precedes the delusion.  mebo  
This preceding mood is often a feeling of foreboding  that some, as yet, unidentified sinister event is about  to take place. When the delusion follows, it appears to  explain this feeling.

Delusional memory 

In *delusional memory*, a delusional interpretation is  attached to past events. Fish (1962) distinguishes two  forms of delusional memory. In the commoner form, the  past event was genuine, and the term ‘delusional’ refers  to the significance which has now become attached to it.  mebooksfree.com

These are concerned with the idea that objects, events,  or people that are unconnected with the patient have a  personal significance for him. For example, the patient

For example, a patient who believes that there is a cur rent plot to poison her may remember (correctly) that  she vomited after a meal, eaten long before her psycho sis began, and now concludes (incorrectly) that she had  been intentionally poisoned. Alternatively, a sudden  (autochthonous) delusion arises, which is wrongly dated  to a past event. This latter form might be viewed as a true  delusional memory (i.e. the memory itself is the delu sion), whereas in the first kind described, the memory is  normal but a delusional interpretation is placed upon it.

Occasionally, a person who lives with a deluded patient  comes to share his delusional beliefs. This condition is  known as shared delusions or *folie à deux* (see page 310).

For the purposes of clinical work, it is useful to group

Persecutory delusions 

These are most commonly concerned with persons or  organizations that are thought to be trying to inflict  harm on the patient, damage his reputation, or make  him insane. Such delusions are common but of little  help in diagnosis, because they can occur in delusional  disorders, organic states, schizophrenia, and severe  affective disorders. However, the patient’s attitude to  the delusion may point to the diagnosis. In a severe  depressive disorder, a patient with persecutory delu sions characteristically accepts the supposed activities  of the persecutors as justified by his own wickedness.  In schizophrenia, however, he resents these activities as    
sions concerning the possession of thoughts lose these  normal convictions in one or more of three ways, all of  which are strongly associated with schizophrenia: 

● *Thought insertion* is the delusion that certain thoughts  are not the patient’s own but are implanted by an out side agency. Often there is an associated explanatory  delusion—for example, that persecutors have used radio  mebo  
waves to insert the thoughts. This experience must not  be confused with that of the obsessional patient, who  may be distressed by thoughts that he feels are alien to  his nature but who never doubts that these thoughts are  his own. The patient with a delusion of thought inser 

tion believes that the thoughts are not his own, but that

**Box 1.4 The term ‘paranoid’** 

The term ‘paranoid’ is often used as if it were equivalent  to ‘persecutory’. Strictly interpreted, however, the word  ‘paranoid’ has a wider meaning (Lewis, 1970). It was  used in ancient Greek writings to mean the equivalent  of ‘out of his mind’. For example, Hippocrates used it to  describe patients with febrile delirium. Many later writ 

ers applied the term to grandiose, erotic, jealous, and  

now more common, as sanctioned in the diagnostic cat egory of paranoid personality disorder (see page 398).  Because the term ‘paranoid’ has two possible meanings,  the term ‘persecutory’ is preferable when the narrow  sense of paranoid is required. The issue also affects the  use of the word to describe syndromes in which such  symptoms predominate; the older term ‘paranoid psy

experiences a sudden break in the flow of thoughts and  believes that the ‘missing’ thoughts have been taken  away by some outside agency. Often there are associ ated explanatory delusions comparable to those that  accompany delusions of thought insertion (see above). ● *Thought broadcasting* is the delusion that unspoken  

These are beliefs that some person or thing has ceased,  or is about to cease, to exist. Examples include a patient’s  delusion that he has no money, that his career is ruined,  or that the world is about to end. Nihilistic delusions are  seen in severe depression. Occasionally, nihilistic delu

thoughts are known to other people through radio,  telepathy, or in some other way. In addition, some  patients believe that their thoughts can be heard out  loud by other people, a belief that also accompanies  the experience of hearing one’s own thoughts spoken  (*Gedankenlautwerden*), described above in the section  on ‘Types of hallucination’. 

Grandiose delusions 

These are beliefs of exaggerated self-importance. The  patient may consider himself to be wealthy, endowed  with unusual abilities, or a special person. Such expansive  ideas occur particularly in mania, and in schizophrenia.

sions concern failures of bodily function (often that the  bowels are blocked), and are often referred to as *Cotard’s  syndrome* (see page 196). 

Hypochondriacal delusions 

These are beliefs concerned with illness. The patient  believes, wrongly and in the face of all medical evidence  to the contrary, that he is suffering from a disease. Such  mebo  
delusions are more common in the elderly, reflecting the  increasing concern with health among people in this age  group. Other hypochondriacal delusions are concerned  with cancer or venereal disease, or with the appearance  of parts of the body, especially the nose. They must be  distinguished from the health worries of hypochondria

Bizarre delusions 

Delusions with highly improbable content (e.g. of con trol by aliens who communicate via birds) are said to  be *bizarre*. They are often given particular weight in  the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but the category has  problems of reliability and definition (Bell *et al.*, 2006;  Cermolacce *et al.*, 2010), and it is not included in current  diagnostic criteria. 

Delusions of guilt 

These beliefs are found most often in depressive illness,  and for this reason are sometimes called *depressive delu sions*. Typical themes are that a minor infringement of  the law in the past will be discovered and bring shame    
sis (see page 650), which are not delusional. 

Mood-congruent and mood-incongruent delusions If a delusion ‘makes sense’ in terms of the person’s mood,  it is said to be mood-congruent. Hypochondriacal and  nihilistic delusions in psychotic depression, and gran diose delusions in mania, both fall into this category.  In contrast, a delusion that is out of keeping with the  mebo  
prevailing mood is mood-incongruent, and is suggestive  of schizophrenia. The concept of congruency can also be  applied to hallucinations. 

Delusions of jealousy 

These are more common among men than women.  Not all jealous ideas are delusions; less intense jealous

preoccupations and obsessions are common. Jealous  delusions are important because they may lead to aggres sive behaviour towards the person(s) who is thought  to be unfaithful. A  patient with delusional jealousy is  not satisfied if he fails to find evidence supporting his  beliefs; his search will continue. These important and  potentially dangerous problems are discussed further in  Chapter 12.

persistence. Obsessional symptoms are also a trait in  anankastic personality disorder (see page 403). 

Obsessions can take various forms (see Box 1.5). 

mebo  
● *Obsessional thoughts* are repeated and intrusive words  or phrases that are upsetting to the patient—for exam ple, repeated obscenities or blasphemous phrases  coming into the awareness of a religious person. 

● *Obsessional ruminations* are repeated worrying themes  of a more complex kind—for example, about the end   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
These are rare, and are more frequent in women than  in men. Sexual delusions are occasionally secondary  to somatic hallucinations felt in the genitalia. A per son with amorous delusions believes that she is loved  by a man who is usually inaccessible to her, and often  of higher social status. In many cases she has never  spoken to the person. Erotic delusions are the most  prominent feature of De Clérambault’s syndrome (see  page 308). 

**Obsessional and compulsive symptoms** Obsessions 

*Obsessions* are recurrent persistent thoughts, impulses,  or images that enter the mind despite efforts to exclude    
ing of the world. 

● *Obsessional doubts* are repeated themes expressing  uncertainty about previous actions—for example,  whether or not the person turned off an electrical  appliance that might cause a fire. Whatever the nature  of the doubt, the person realizes that the degree of  uncertainty and consequent distress is unreasonable. 

● *Obsessional impulses* are repeated urges to carry out  mebo  
actions, usually ones that are aggressive, dangerous, or  socially embarrassing—for example, the urge to pick  up a knife and stab another person, to jump in front  of a train, or to shout obscenities in church. Whatever  the urge, the person has no wish to carry it out, resists  it strongly, and does not act on it.

them. One characteristic feature is the subjective sense  of a struggle—the patient resists the obsession, which  nevertheless intrudes into awareness. Another charac teristic feature is the conviction that to think something  is to make it more likely to happen. Obsessions are rec ognized by the person as his own and not implanted  from elsewhere (in contrast to delusions of thought  insertion). Another important distinction from delu sions is that obsessions are regarded as untrue or sense less. They are generally about matters that the patient  finds distressing or otherwise unpleasant. They are  often, but not always, accompanied by compulsions  (see page 14). 

The presence of resistance is important because,  

● *Obsessional phobias.* This term denotes an obses sional symptom associated with avoidance as well  as anxiety—for example, the obsessional impulse to  injure another person with a knife may lead to con sequent avoidance of knives. Sometimes obsessional  fears of illness are called *illness phobias*. 

● *Obsessional slowness*. Many obsessional patients per mebo  
form actions slowly because their compulsive rituals or  repeated doubts take time and distract them from their  main purpose. Occasionally, however, the slowness  does not seem to be secondary to these other problems,  but appears to be a primary feature of unknown origin. 

mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
together with the lack of persistent or complete con viction about the truth of the idea, it distinguishes  obsessions from delusions. However, in practice this  distinction can, in isolation, be more difficult, since the  resistance tends to diminish when obsessions have been  longstanding. Furthermore, when obsessions are very  intense, patients may become less certain that they are  false. However, a careful history, not only of the symp tom but also of other relevant features (e.g. compulsions,  other evidence of psychosis) should avoid diagnostic  difficulties. It is also necessary to distinguish clinically  significant obsessions from similar thoughts that occur  in healthy people, especially when they are tired or  under stress. This requires evidence of dysfunction and

Although the content (or themes) of obsessions are  various, most of them can be grouped into one or other  of six categories: 

● *Checking rituals* are often concerned with safety—for  example, checking over and over again that the fire has  been turned off, or that the doors have been locked. ● *Cleaning rituals* often take the form of repeated hand

Thoughts about *dirt and contamination* are usually  associated with the idea of harm to others or self through  the spread of disease. *Aggressive thoughts* may be about  striking another person or shouting angry or obscene  remarks in public. Thoughts about *orderliness* may be  about the way objects are to be arranged or work is to be  organized. Thoughts about *illness* are usually of a fearful  kind—for example, a dread of cancer. Obsessional ideas  about *sex* usually concern practices that the individual  would find shameful. Obsessions about *religion* often  take the form of doubts about the fundamentals of belief  (e.g. ‘does God exist?’) or repeated doubts about whether  sins have been adequately confessed (‘scruples’).   
mebooksfree.com   
silent, so an onlooker may be unaware of the ritual. 

● In *dressing rituals* the person lays out clothes, or puts  them on, in a particular way or order. The ritual is  often accompanied by doubting thoughts that lead to  seemingly endless repetition. 

**Overvalued ideas** 

mebo  
*Overvalued ideas* were first described by Wernicke in  1900, and were reviewed by McKenna (1984). An over valued idea is a comprehensible and understandable  idea which is pursued beyond the bounds of reason. It  may preoccupy and dominate a person’s life for many  years, and affect their actions. It therefore shares some  characteristics of delusions. However, it is essential to    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
Compulsions 

*Compulsions* are repetitive and seemingly purposeful  behaviours that are performed in a stereotyped way  (hence the alternative name, ‘compulsive rituals’) in  response to an obsession. They are accompanied by a  subjective sense that the behaviour must be carried  out and by an urge to resist it. The compulsion usually  makes sense given the content of the obsession. For  example, a compulsion to wash the hands repeatedly is  usually driven by obsessional thoughts that the hands  are contaminated. Sometimes obsessional ideas concern  the consequences of failing to carry out the compulsion  in the ‘correct’ way—for example, that another person  mebooksfree.com   
distinguish the two types of belief, as their diagnostic  implications are very different. Overvalued ideas differ  from delusions in two main ways. 

● The content of, and basis for, the overvalued idea  is usually understandable when the person’s back ground is known, whereas delusions and the person’s  explanation of them tend to be bizarre. For example, a    
mebo  
person whose mother and sister suffered from cancer  one after the other may understandably become con vinced that cancer is contagious. 

● The theme also tends to be culturally common and  acceptable, as in the overvalued ideas about body  shape that characterize anorexia nervosa.   
mebooksfree.com   
will suffer an accident. Compulsions may cause prob   
mebooksfree.com   
lems for several reasons. 

● They may cause direct harm (e.g. dermatitis from  excessive washing). 

● They may interfere with normal life because of the  time they require. 

● Although the compulsive act transiently reduces the  anxiety associated with the obsession, in fact the com pulsions help to maintain the condition. Strategies to  reduce them are central to behavioural treatments of  obsessive–compulsive disorder. 

There are many kinds of compulsive acts, but four  types are particularly common. 

With an overvalued idea, there is a small degree of  insight and willingness to at least entertain alternative  views, even though this is not persistent and the patient  always returns to and retains the belief. 

Overvalued ideas must also be distinguished from  obsessions. This is usually easier than the distinction  from delusions, since there is no sense of intrusiveness    
mebo  
or senselessness of the thought, nor is there resistance to  it. Overvalued ideas differ from normal religious beliefs  in that the latter are shared by a wider group, arise from  religious instruction, and are subject to periodic doubts.  Despite these differences, it can on occasion be dif 

ficult to recognize an overvalued idea and distinguish

it unequivocally from a delusion, obsession, or normal  belief. However, this should rarely lead to practical prob lems, because diagnosis depends on more than the pres ence or absence of a single symptom.   
The beliefs concerning body shape and weight that  are held in anorexia nervosa are perhaps the clearest  example of overvalued ideas. According to McKenna  (1984), the term also applies to abnormal beliefs in  many other conditions, including dysmorphophobia,  hypochondriasis, paranoid personality disorder, and  mebooksfree.com   
**Descriptions of symptoms and signs** 

**Disorders of the form of thought** 

Disorder of the form of thought (also known as *formal  thought disorder*) is usually recognized from speech and  mebo  
writing, but is sometimes evident from the patient’s  behaviour—for example, he may be unable to file papers  under appropriate category headings. Disorders of the  form of thought can be divided into several kinds, as  described below. Each kind has associations with a par 

ticular mental disorder, but none of the associations is  strong enough to be diagnostic.

morbid jealousy. However, it is important to emphasize    
mebooksfree.com   
that overvalued ideas are defined by their form, not their  content, and they have no inviolable relationship with,  or implication for, any particular diagnostic category.  Thus some cases of morbid jealousy are clearly delu 

sional, whereas in hypochondriasis or dysmorphopho bia the belief often has the character of an obsession or  a worry, not of an overvalued idea.

Perseveration 

Perseveration is the persistent and inappropriate rep etition of the same thoughts. The disorder is detected  by examining the person’s words or actions. Thus, in  response to a series of simple questions, the person may  give the correct answer to the first question, but con mebo  
tinue to give the same answer inappropriately to sub sequent questions. Perseveration occurs in, but is not  limited to, dementia and frontal lobe injury. 

Flight of ideas 

In flight of ideas, thoughts and speech move quickly  from one topic to another so that one train of thought is    
mebooksfree.com

In disturbances of the stream of thought, the amount  and speed of thinking are changed. In *pressure of  thought*, ideas arise in unusual variety and abundance  and pass through the mind rapidly. In *poverty of  thought*, the patient has few thoughts, and these lack  variety and richness and seem to move slowly through  the mind. Pressure of thought occurs in mania; pov 

erty of thought occurs in depressive disorders. Either  may be experienced in schizophrenia. Given that the  phenomena are recognized through the person’s use of  language, they are also known as *pressure of speech* or  *poverty of speech*. 

Thought block 

not carried to completion before another takes its place.  The normal logical sequence of ideas is generally pre served, although ideas may be linked by distracting cues  in the surroundings and by distractions arising from the  words that have been spoken. These verbal distractions  are of three kinds, namely *clang associations* (a second  word with a sound similar to the first), *puns* (a second  meaning of the first word), and *rhymes*. In practice, it is    
mebo  
difficult to distinguish between flight of ideas and loos ening of associations (see below), especially when the  patient speaks rapidly. When this happens it is often  helpful to record a sample of speech. Flight of ideas is  characteristic of mania. 

mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
Sometimes the stream of thought is interrupted sud denly. The patient feels that his mind has gone blank,  and an observer notices a sudden interruption in the  patient’s speech. In a minor degree this experience is  common, particularly when a person is tired, anxious,  or distracted. In thought blocking, the interruptions are  sudden, striking, and repeated, and are experienced by  the patient as an abrupt and complete emptying of his  mind. Thought blocking is an important symptom, as  it strongly suggests schizophrenia. The diagnostic asso 

ciation with schizophrenia is stronger when the patient  interprets the experience in an unusual way—for exam ple, when he says that another person has removed his    
Loosening of associations 

This denotes a loss of the normal structure of thinking.  To the interviewer the patient’s discourse seems mud dled, illogical, or tangential to the matter in hand. It  does not become clearer when the patient is questioned  further; indeed, the interviewer has the experience that  the more he tries to clarify the patient’s thinking (or the  longer he allows the patient to speak without interrup   
mebo  
tion), the less he understands it. Several specific features  of this muddled thinking have been described, but they  are difficult to identify with certainty, and the most  striking clinical impression is often a general lack of clar 

ity, best described by recording an example of the speech

of clarity differs from that of people who are anxious or  of low intelligence. Anxious people give a more coherent  account when they have been put at ease, and people  with low intelligence usually express their ideas more  

as highly unpleasant experiences. These central features  are often accompanied by other morbid experiences,  including changes in the experience of time, changes in  the body image (e.g. a feeling that a limb has altered in  

clearly when the interviewer simplifies the questions  

size or shape), and occasionally a feeling of being out   
mebo  
and allows more time for the reply. 

Three characteristic kinds of loosening of associa tions have been described, all of which are seen most  often in schizophrenia. 

● In *talking past the point* (*Vorbeireden*) the patient seems    
side one’s own body and observing one’s own actions,  often from above. 

Because patients find it difficult to describe the feel ings of depersonalization and derealization, they often  resort to metaphor, and this can lead to confusion    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
always about to get to the endpoint of the topic in  question, but then skirts round it and never in fact  reaches it. 

● *Knight’s move* or *derailment* refers to a transition from  one topic to another, either between sentences or in  mid-sentence, with no logical relationship between  the two topics and no evidence of the associations  described above under flight of ideas. 

● *Verbigeration* is said to be present when speech is  reduced to the senseless repetition of sounds, words,  or phrases. This abnormality can occur with severe  expressive aphasia and occasionally in schizophre 

nia. When this abnormality is extreme, the disorder is    
between depersonalization and delusional ideas. For  example, a patient may say that he feels ‘as if part of my  brain had stopped working’, or ‘as if the people I meet  are lifeless creatures’. Sometimes careful questioning is  required to make the distinction; the ‘as if’ quality is a  useful discriminator. 

Depersonalization and derealization are experienced  quite commonly by healthy people—especially when    
mebo  
they are tired—as transient phenomena of abrupt onset  (Sedman, 1970). The symptoms have been reported  after sleep deprivation and sensory deprivation, and as  an effect of hallucinogenic drugs. They occur in anxi 

ety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive  disorders, schizophrenia, and temporal lobe epilepsy.

called *word salad*. 

Other disorders of thinking 

*Overinclusion* refers to a widening of the boundaries of  concepts, such that things are grouped together which  are not normally regarded as closely connected. 

*Neologisms* are words or phrases invented by  the patient, often to describe a morbid experience.  Neologisms must be distinguished from incorrect pro nunciation, the wrong use of words by people with lim ited education, dialect words, obscure technical terms,  and the ‘private words’ that some families invent for  their own use. Before deciding that a word is a neolo gism, the interviewer should ask the patient what he  

There is also a rarely used diagnostic category of  depersonalization–derealization syndrome. 

**Motor symptoms and signs** 

Abnormalities of social behaviour, facial expression, and  posture occur frequently in mental disorders of all kinds;  motor symptoms and signs can also be side effects of    
mebo  
medication. They are considered in Chapter 3, where the  examination of the patient is described. Motor slowing  and agitation, which are important features of depres sive disorder, are discussed in Chapter 9\. With the excep tion of tics, the specific symptoms listed here are mainly  observed in schizophrenia, particularly catatonic schizo

**Depersonalization and**    
**derealization** 

*Depersonalization* is a change of self-awareness such that  

phrenia (see page 256). 

● *Tics* are irregular repeated movements involving a  group of muscles—for example, sideways movement  of the head or the raising of one shoulder. 

● *Mannerisms* are repeated movements that appear to  have some functional significance—for example,  

the person feels unreal, detached from his own experi

mebo  
ence, and unable to feel emotion (Sierra and David,  2011). *Derealization* is a similar change in relation to the  environment, such that objects appear unreal and peo ple appear as lifeless two-dimensional ‘cardboard’ fig ures. Despite the complaint of inability to feel emotion,  both depersonalization and derealization are described    
● *Stereotypies* are repeated movements that are regular  (unlike tics) and without obvious significance (unlike  mannerisms)—for example, rocking to and fro. 

● *Catatonia* is a state of increased muscle tone that  affects extension and flexion and is abolished by vol untary movement.

● *Catalepsy (waxy flexibility, flexibilitas cerea)* is a term  used to describe the tonus in catatonia. It is detected  when a patient’s limbs can be placed in a position  in which they then remain for long periods while at  the same time muscle tone is uniformly increased.  Patients with this abnormality sometimes main 

tain the head a little way above the pillow in a  position that a healthy person could not maintain  without extreme discomfort (*psychological pillow*).  Catalepsy should not be confused with *cataplexy*   
**Descriptions of symptoms and signs** 

*Distorted awareness of size and shape of the body* occurs  occasionally in healthy people when they are tired or  falling asleep. The experience, which includes feelings  that a limb is enlarging, becoming smaller, or other   
mebo  
wise being distorted, also occurs in migraine, as part of  the aura of epilepsy, and after taking LSD. The person is  aware that the experience is unreal. However, changes in  the shape and size of body parts are described by some  schizophrenic patients, and in this instance the symp 

toms are delusional or hallucinatory and there is no

(see page 327). 

● *Posturing* is the adoption of unusual bodily postures  continuously for a long time. The posture may appear  to have a symbolic meaning (e.g. standing with both  arms outstretched as if being crucified), or may have  no apparent significance (for example, standing on  one leg). 

● *Grimacing* has the same meaning as in everyday  speech. The term *Schnauzkrampf* (snout cramp or  spasm) denotes pouting of the lips to bring them  closer to the nose. 

● *Negativism*. Patients are said to show negativism when  they do the opposite of what is asked, and actively  mebooksfree.com   
insight. *Coenestopathic states* are localized distortions of  body awareness—for example, when the nose feels as if  it is made of cotton wool. 

A *general distortion of the body image* occurs in ano rexia nervosa, where the patient is convinced that they  are fat when in fact they are underweight, sometimes to  the point of emaciation. 

The *reduplication phenomenon* is the experience that  mebo  
the body has doubled, or that part of the body has  done so—for example, that there are two left arms. The  experience is reported very occasionally in migraine,  temporal lobe epilepsy, and schizophrenia. The related  experience of *autoscopic hallucinations* was described on  page 7\.

● *Echopraxia* occurs when the patient imitates the inter viewer’s movement automatically, even when asked  not to do so. 

● *Mitgehen* (going along with) describes another kind  of excessive compliance in which the patient’s limbs  can be moved into any position with the slightest  pressure. 

● *Ambitendence.* Patients are said to exhibit ambitend ence when they alternate between opposite move ments—for example, putting out the arm to shake  hands, then withdrawing it, extending it again, and  so on repeatedly.

**Disturbances of the self** 

The experience of self has several aspects. It is more than  the awareness of the body; we have a feeling of unity  between the various aspects of the self, we recognize our  activities as our own, we recognize a boundary between  mebo  
the self and the outside world, and we have a feeling  of continuity between our past and present selves. The  concept of self is closely related to, but distinct from,  that of the *body image.* Although the body image is usu 

ally experienced as part of the self, it can also be experi enced in a more objective way, as when we say ‘my leg  hurts’. Some of these aspects of the self are changed in

**Disturbances of the body image** 

The body image or body schema is a person’s subjective  representation against which the integrity of their body  is judged and the movement and positioning of its parts  assessed. Specific abnormalities of the body image arise  in neurological disorders. These abnormalities include  the awareness of a *phantom limb* after amputation,  *unilateral lack of awareness or neglect* (usually following  stroke), *hemiasomatognosia* (in which the person feels,  incorrectly, that a limb is missing), and *anosognosia* (lack  of awareness of loss of function, often of hemiplegia).  These abnormalities are described in textbooks of neu e.com   
certain psychiatric disorders. The experiences are often  associated with other abnormal phenomena, so that the  account of abnormalities of the self overlaps with several  other parts of this chapter. 

**Disturbances concerned with activities** 

We take it for granted that, other than in a metaphorical  mebo

**Disturbances of memory** 

The features of memory disturbance and its assessment  are discussed in detail in Chapters 3 and 14\. In this chap ter we introduce some key terms and concepts. 

Failure of memory is called *amnesia.* The related  term *dysmnesia* is occasionally used. *Paramnesia* is dis tortion of memory. Several kinds of disturbed memory  occur in psychiatric disorders, and it is usual to describe  

disorder recall more when given cues. When this hap pens, it suggests that the disorder is concerned at least in  part with retrieval. 

After a period of unconsciousness, memory is  impaired for the interval between the ending of com plete unconsciousness and the restoration of full  consciousness (*anterograde amnesia*). Some causes of  unconsciousness (e.g. head injury and electroconvulsive    
mebo  
therapy) also lead to inability to recall events before the  onset of unconsciousness (*retrograde amnesia*).

them in terms of the temporal stages that approximate  crudely to the scheme of memory derived from psy chological research. A discussion of this subject can be  found in textbooks of neuropsychology or in David *et al.* (2009a,b). 

● *Immediate memory* concerns the retention of informa 

● *Jamais vu* is the failure to recognize events that have  been encountered before. 

● *Déjà vu* is the conviction that an event is repeating  one that has been experienced in the past, when in  fact it is novel.

Recall of events can be biased by the mood at the time  of recall. Importantly, in depressive disorders, memories  of unhappy events are recalled more readily than other  events, a process which adds to the patient’s low mood. 

**Psychogenic amnesia** 

This is thought to result from an active process of  repression which prevents the recall of memories that  would otherwise evoke unpleasant emotions. The  ideas arose from the study of *dissociative amnesia* (see

**False memory syndrome** 

It is a matter of dispute whether memories can be  

unresponsive, but appears to be fully conscious in that  the eyes are usually open and follow external objects.  If the eyes are closed, the patient resists attempts to  open them. Reflexes are normal and resting posture is  maintained. Stupor may occur in catatonia (see page  16).

● *Confusion* means an inability to think clearly. It occurs  characteristically in states of impaired conscious ness, but it can occur when consciousness is normal.  In delirium, confusion occurs together with partial  impairment (clouding) of consciousness, along with

ous questioning, while others contend that they are  true memories that have previously been completely  repressed. Those who hold the latter opinion point to  evidence that memories of events other than child abuse  can sometimes be completely lost and then regained,  and also that some recovered memories of child abuse  are corroborated subsequently by independent evidence  (for review, see Brewin, 2000). Although the quality of  the evidence has been questioned, the possibility of  complete and sustained repression of memories has  not been ruled out. However, it seems likely that only a  small minority of cases of ‘recovered memory syndrome’  can be explained in this way.

other features. In the past, delirium was called a con fusional state, with the result that the term ‘confu sion’ was used to mean impairment of consciousness  as well as muddled thinking. 

Other terms that are used to describe states of  impaired consciousness include the following:

and can interfere with a patient’s ability to work, drive a  car, or take part in leisure activities. 

**Insight** 

In psychopathology, the term *insight* refers to aware ness of morbid change in oneself and a correct attitude  to this change, including, in appropriate cases, a real ization that it signifies a mental disorder. This aware ness is difficult for a patient to achieve, since it involves  some knowledge of what are the limits of normal men tal functioning and mental experience. Furthermore,  insight has to be assessed against the background of  knowledge and beliefs about psychiatric disorder—it is    
high spirits)? 

● If so, does he consider that the phenomena are caused  by mental illness (as opposed to, say, a physical illness  or poison administered by enemies)? 

● If so, does he think that he needs treatment? 

The answers to these questions are more informative  mebo  
and more reliable than those of the single question as  to whether insight is present or not. The value of deter mining the degree of insight is that it helps to predict  whether the patient is likely to accept the need for help  and treatment. 

In discussions of psychotherapy, insight has a dif

not the same as complete agreement with the views of  the doctor. Insight is also influenced by cultural and  cognitive factors (Saravanan *et al.*, 2004; Nair *et al.*,  2014). 

Although, in the past, lack of insight was said to be  a feature that distinguishes between psychosis (where  it was said to be absent) and neurosis (where it is pre

In psychotherapy, insight is  the capacity to understand one’s own motives and to  be aware of previously unconscious aspects of mental  activity.

Chapter 1 outlined the symptoms and signs of psychiatric  disorder. In Chapter 3 we describe the psychiatric assess ment, by which these symptoms and signs are elicited,  interpreted, and used as the basis upon which psychiatric  diagnoses are made. Before doing so, in this chapter we  discuss the principles of psychiatric diagnosis and classi fication, since this provides the framework within which  this clinical process happens. The term *nosology* is some times used to refer to classification and its study. 

Classification is needed in psychiatry for several  purposes:

atric classification does raise particular challenges and  controversies, largely as a consequence of the uncer tain aetiology, or independent biological validation,  of most disorders, which means that its diagnostic  categories are almost entirely *syndromal*—a collection  of symptoms and signs. The resulting difficulties are  of two kinds. The first is conceptual, relating to the  nature of mental illness and the question of what, if

anything, should be classified. The second difficulty  is a practical one, concerning how categories are  defined and organized into a classificatory scheme.

Similarly, in psychiatric practice the term ‘mental  illness’ is used with little precision, and often syn onymously with ‘mental disorder’. In this context,  the terms ‘mental’ and ‘psychiatric’ are also used  interchangeably. 

A good definition of mental illness is difficult to  achieve, for both practical and philosophical reasons, as  outlined here. In routine clinical work the difficulty is  important mainly in relation to ethical and legal issues,  such as compulsory admission to hospital. In forensic  psychiatry the definition of mental illness (by the law)  is particularly important in the assessment of issues such  as criminal responsibility. 

Diverse discussion of the concepts of mental illness    
will be regarded as a disease (Campbell *et al.*, 1979). 

● *Biological disadvantage*. The idea of defining disease  in terms of biological disadvantage was proposed by  Scadding (1967), and is the most extreme biomedical  view of disease. Scadding never defined biological dis 

advantage, but the term has been used in psychiatry  to include decreased fertility (reproductive fitness)  and increased mortality. Viewing disease in terms  mebo  
of ‘evolutionary disadvantage’ is a similar concept  (Wakefield, 1992). 

● *Pathological process.* Some extreme theorists, most  notably Szasz (1960), take the view that illness can  be defined only in terms of *physical* pathology. Since  most mental disorders do not have demonstrable

**Definitions of mental illness** 

Many attempts have been made to define mental illness,  none of which is satisfactory or uniformly accepted.  A common approach is to examine the concept of illness  

physical pathology, according to this view they are  not illnesses. Szasz takes the further step of assert ing that most mental disorders are therefore not the  province of doctors. This kind of argument can be  sustained only by taking an extremely narrow view  of pathology. It is also arbitrary, based on current  knowledge, and is increasingly incompatible with the  evidence of a genetic and neurobiological basis to the

are five types of definition: 

● *Absence of health.* This approach changes the emphasis  of the problem but does not solve it, because health  is even more difficult to define. The World Health  

● *Presence of suffering.* This approach has some practical  value because it defines a group of people who are  likely to consult doctors. A disadvantage is that the  

mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
Organization, for example, defined health as ‘a state  of complete physical, mental and social well-being,  and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.’ As  Lewis (1953) rightly commented, ‘a definition could  hardly be more comprehensive than that, or more  meaningless.’ Many other definitions of health have  been proposed, all equally unsatisfactory. 

● *Disease is what doctors treat*. This definition has the  attraction of simplicity, but does not really address the  issue. The notion that disease is what doctors *can* treat  has somewhat more merit, since there is evidence  that, as a medical treatment for a condition becomes    
term cannot be applied to everyone who would usu ally be regarded as ill in everyday terms. For example,  patients with mania may feel unusually well and may  not experience suffering, although most people would  regard them as mentally ill. 

**Biomedical versus social concepts** 

mebo  
The above concepts may be divided into those that  view mental illnesses in purely biomedical terms,  and those that consider them to be social constructs  or value judgements. This debate is still ongoing,  and depends in part on one’s opinion about their

aetiology, but it is now generally accepted that value  judgements play a part in all diagnoses, even if the  disorders themselves are considered from a biomedical  perspective (Fulford, 1989). For example, beliefs and  emotions are central to most psychiatric disorders, yet  it is a value judgement as to whether a given belief  or emotion is ‘reasonable’ or ‘unhelpful’ for a given  individual in their particular social context, and there fore what, if any, diagnostic significance it has. Would  we use ‘useful’ or ‘dysfunctional’ to decide whether a

and useful for the patient, since it immediately suggests  what investigations and treatment are needed. Its clear  utility also makes redundant most theoretical or philo sophical concerns about classification. Unfortunately,  for most psychiatric patients it is rarely possible to  arrive at this type of diagnosis, the only exception to

belief was ‘illness’? Would ‘normal’ or ‘abnormal’ be  better? 

**Impairment, disability,**    
**and handicap** 

It is useful in medicine, and particularly in psychiatry, to  describe and classify the consequences of a disorder. This  approach is related to the concept of disease as involving  dysfunction (Wakefield, 1992), as incorporated into the  definitions of mental disorder used in ICD-10 and DSM 

5 (see below). Three related terms, derived from medical  sociology and social psychology, are used to describe the  harmful consequences of a disorder.   
this being, by definition, ‘organic’ psychiatric disorders  (see page 26). 

The lack of clear disease categories, in a medical sense,  has led to the use of the more general term ‘disorder’.  The definition of a psychiatric disorder in ICD-10 is: 

…*a clinically recognizable set of symptoms or behaviour asso ciated in most cases with distress and with interference with*  mebo  
*personal functions. Social deviance or conflict alone, without per sonal dysfunction, should not be included in mental disorder as  defined here.* 

(World Health Organization, 1992b, p. 5). 

The DSM-5 definition of a mental disorder is longer  but similar:   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
● *Impairment* refers to a pathological defect—for  example, hemiparesis after a stroke. 

● *Disability* is the limitation of physical or psycho logical function that arises from an impairment—for  example, difficulties with self-care that are caused by  the hemiparesis. 

● *Handicap* refers to the resulting social dysfunction— for example, being unable to work because of the  hemiparesis. 

*Incapacity* may be seen as another harmful consequence  of illness, although the term usually refers in a legal sense  to the effect that illness has on one’s competence to make    
…*a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance  in an individual’s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that  reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or develop mental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders  are usually associated with significant distress or disability in  social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or  culturally acceptable response to a common stressor or loss, such as  the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant*  mebo  
*behavior (e.g. political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are  primarily between the individual and society are not mental disor ders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the  individual, as described above.*   
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013a, p. 20). 

Despite the similarity, there is an important differ

treatment decisions, as enshrined in the United Kingdom  by the Mental Capacity Act (see Chapter 4). 

**Diagnoses, diseases, and disorders** 

The term ‘diagnosis’ has two somewhat different  meanings. It has the general meaning of ‘telling one  thing apart from another’, but in medicine it has also  acquired a more specific meaning of ‘knowing the  underlying cause’ of the symptoms and signs about  which the patient is complaining. Underlying causes  are expressed in quite different terms from the symp 

toms. For example, the symptoms of acute appendicitis    
ence between the two definitions. ‘Interference with  personal functions’ in ICD-10 refers only to such things  as personal care and one’s immediate environment, and  does not extend to interference with work and other  social roles. In DSM-5, as in the extract above, impair 

ment refers to all types of functioning. 

Both definitions illustrate that most psychiatric  disorders are based not upon theoretical concepts, or  mebo  
presumptions about aetiology, but upon recognizable  clusters of symptoms and behaviours. This reliance  explains much of the debate about the reliability and  validity of the categories being classified, as will be dis 

cussed later in this chapter.

disputed, then so will any classifications thereof. These  criticisms were most prevalent and trenchant at the  height of the ‘anti-psychiatry’ movement in the 1960s,  although they continue to be voiced by a vociferous  ‘critical psychiatry’ lobby (Bracken *et  al.*, 2012). Three  main criticisms of this kind are made. 

● *Allocating patients to a diagnostic category distracts from*  

reasons. Although such abuses are fortunately rare,  they are an extreme illustration of the fact that making  diagnoses and classifying patients are not neutral acts,  but carry significant ethical and other implications (see  Chapter 4). One of these implications concerns *stigma*,  which remains a serious problem for patients with men

● *Allocating a person to a diagnostic category is simply to  label deviant behaviour as illness*. Some sociologists have  argued that such labelling serves only to increase the  person’s difficulties. There can be no doubt that terms  such as epilepsy or schizophrenia attract stigma (see  Box 2.1, but this does not lessen the reality of disorders  that cause suffering and require treatment. However,  it does emphasize that mental illness should not be  defined solely in terms of socially deviant behaviour.  The presence of the former must be separately estab lished based on the psychiatric history and mental state  examination. Moreover, if mental illness is inferred  from socially deviant behaviour alone, political abuse  may result. A serious example of the latter occurred in    
cannot solve it, because stigma results from many other  factors too (Thornicroft, 2006). The issue of stigma in  psychiatry is discussed in Box 2.1. 

Although these criticisms are important, they are  arguments only against the improper use of, or over reliance upon, classification. Disorders and their harm ful consequences cannot be made to disappear by  ceasing to give names to them. ICD-10 and DSM-5,  mebo  
to be discussed later, emphasize that classification is  a means of communication and a guide to decision making, but acknowledge that they are provisional and  imperfect schemes.

the former Soviet Union, where some psychiatrists col luded with the government in being willing to classify  political dissent as evidence of mental illness. A fur ther reason for excluding purely social criteria from  the definition of mental illness, and from diagnostic  criteria, is that many behaviours are appraised differ ently in different countries and at different times. For  example, homosexuality was considered to be a men

Other criticisms of classification in psychiatry are  mostly concerned with the specifics rather than the  principles—for example, whether a particular diagnostic  category is reliable and valid, and the severity threshold  at which the diagnosis should be made.

**Box 2.1 Stigma**   
**Criticisms of classification** 

People stigmatize others when they judge them not on their  personal qualities but on the basis of a mark or label which  assigns them to a feared or unfavoured group. The tendency  to stigmatize seems to be deeply rooted in human nature as  a way of responding to people who appear or behave differ 

ently. Stigmatization is based on fear that those who seem  different may behave in threatening or unpredictable ways,  

● people with mental illness are hard to talk and relate to ● mental illness cannot be cured, and people with men tal illness do not recover. 

These beliefs make people draw back from those  with mental illness and discourage them from engaging  in social relationships. Consequently they do not learn  that their assumptions are wrong. In the same way, fear

and it is reduced when it becomes clear that the stigma tized person is unlikely to behave in these ways. 

**Stigma in psychiatry** 

People fear mental illness and they stigmatize those who  are affected by it. The reasons for this are complex. They  include the notion that people with mental illness can not control their own behaviour, and that they may act  in odd, unpredictable, and possibly violent ways. Thus  they are seen as directly threatening, and perhaps also as  indirectly threatening because their lack of self-control  threatens our belief in our ability to control our actions.  Whatever the underlying psychological mechanisms, fear  of mental illness makes people react to mentally ill indi   
of being stigmatized adds greatly to the problems of peo ple with mental illness. It discourages them from seek ing help at an early stage, and from sharing their distress  with relatives and friends. Stigma also has wider social  effects—for example, it makes it harder for mentally ill  people to obtain work. Stigmatization may also affect the  allocation of resources for the care of people with mental  illness, with a reluctance to fund care in the community  or to give appropriate priority to mental health services  generally. 

**Reducing stigma** 

Campaigns to reduce stigma generally include: ● information about the true nature of mental illness,

viduals in the same cautious and unfavourable way—that  is, to stigmatize them. 

Diagnoses, as labels, have the potential to be stigma tizing (e.g. leprosy and AIDS). It has been suggested that  the stigma of mental illness would be reduced if diagno ses such as schizophrenia were abandoned. This proposal  misses the point that the basis of stigma is fear, and that  simply removing the label does not reduce the fear. The  mentally ill were stigmatized long before modern diag nostic terms were in use, and people who fear mental  illness invent their own labels, such as ‘nutter’, which are  far more stigmatizing than a diagnosis. To reduce stigma  it is necessary to reduce fear, and this requires accurate    
and about the low frequency of dangerous behaviour ● encouragement to persuade public figures who  have had a mental illness to speak out about their  experiences 

● a focus on young people, whose attitudes may be less  fixed than those of their elders. 

Although stigma can be reduced, this cannot be  done easily or quickly. In the past, people with epilepsy  were stigmatized, but as knowledge of the condition  spread and as treatment improved, attitudes grad 

ually changed. Changes are now beginning to be seen  in the stigma attached to some psychiatric disorders.  For example, autism is now generally a much less stig

information about mental illness and better understand ing of mentally ill people. 

Psychiatric stigma arises from a number of false  beliefs. For example, concern about dangerousness is a  major component of psychiatric stigma. Other important  components are ideas that:   
● people with mental illness are unpredictable ● people with mental illness feel different from the rest of us   
matizing term than it was previously, whereas schizo phrenia is not. Thus there is an ongoing need for public  education campaigns to reduce the fear and misun derstanding that perpetuate stigma. However, existing  anti-stigma programmes have had only modest ben efits (Griffiths et al., 2014). For reviews of stigma and  its reduction, see Sartorius et al. (2010) and Henderson  et al. (2013).

**The history of classification** 

Efforts to classify abnormal mental states have occurred  

mental disorders into mania with delirium, mania with 

mebo  
since antiquity. One reason for including a chrono logical perspective here is that contemporary psychiatric  classifications are, in part, a ‘hybrid’ of various historical  themes and opinions. 

The early Greek medical writings contained descrip tions of different manifestations of mental disorder—   
out delirium, melancholia, dementia, and idiocy. Pinel’s  compatriot, Esquirol, wrote another widely read text book, which was published in English in 1845, and  added a new category, ‘monomania’, characterized by  ‘partial insanity’, in which there were fixed false ideas  that could not be changed by logical reasoning (i.e.    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
for example, excitement, depression, confusion, and  memory loss. This simple classification was adopted by  Roman medicine and developed by the Greek physician  Galen, whose system of classification remained in use  until the eighteenth century. 

Interest in the classification of natural phenomena  developed in the eighteenth century, partly stimu lated by the publication of a classification of plants by  Linnaeus, a medically qualified professor of botany who  also devised a less well-known classification of diseases  in which one major class was mental disorders. Many  classifications were proposed, notably one published  in 1772 by William Cullen, a Scottish physician. He  grouped mental disorders together, apart from delirium,    
delusions). Like other psychiatrists of the time, Pinel  and Esquirol did not discuss neuroses (in the modern  sense), because these conditions were generally treated  by physicians. 

Meanwhile, in Germany, Kahlbaum formulated two  requirements for research on nosology, namely that the  total clinical picture, and its entire course, were both fun damental to the definition of a mental illness and thus    
mebo  
to classification. These ideas were adopted at the end  of the nineteenth century by Emil Kraepelin, who used  these criteria to make the landmark distinction between  manic–depressive psychosis (bipolar disorder) and  schizophrenia. Successive editions of Kraepelin’s text 

book made further refinements to the classification of    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
which he classified with febrile conditions. According  to his scheme, mental disorders were part of a broad  class of ‘neuroses’, a term that he used to denote dis eases which affect the nervous system (Hunter and  MacAlpine, 1963). Cullen’s classification contained an  aetiological principle—that mental illnesses were disor ders of the nervous system—as well as a descriptive prin   
mental illness, which form the basis of today’s systems. At the same time, separate developments in the  emerging specialty of neurology led to decreasing  medical interest in the ‘nervous patient’, a term used  throughout the nineteenth century in the United  Kingdom and North America to refer to a large group of  patients with varied complaints. These were gradually  

ciple for distinguishing individual clinical syndromes  

seen as a part of the new specialty of psychiatry along 

mebo  
within the neuroses. In Cullen’s usage, the term neurosis  covered the whole range of mental disorders, as well as  many neurological conditions. The modern narrower  usage developed later (see page 27). 

In the early nineteenth century, several French writ ers published influential classifications. Pinel’s *Treatise*    
side the major mental illnesses. The writings of Sigmund  Freud and his contemporaries led to greater recognition  of the psychological causes of nervous symptoms and  ‘neurotic’ disorders, and to the modern concepts of hys 

teria and anxiety disorder.

Pichot (1994) and Zachar and Kendler (2007). 

**Organizing principles of contemporary classifications** 

As well as these historical roots, it is worth considering    
disorders. Organic disorders are those that arise from  

the major issues that contemporary classifications have  

a demonstrable cerebral or systemic pathological pro   
mebo  
faced with regard to their organizing principles. 

**Organic and functional** 

The first issue concerns the distinction that is con   
cess; the core disorders are dementia, delirium, and the  various neuropsychiatric syndromes (David *et al.*, 2009).  ‘Functional disorder’ is consequently an umbrella or  default term for all other psychiatric disorders. The  organic–functional dichotomy has two main implica

tions for classification.

● It has a philosophical dimension, being inextricably  linked to dualism and concepts of mind and body. At  its extreme, the implication is that functional disor ders have no biological basis, whilst psychological and  social factors are irrelevant to organic disorders. This  polarization can be reflected in the apparent divide  between psychiatry and neurology. The same dualism  may also unintentionally encourage psychiatrists to be  either ‘mindless’ or ‘brainless’, rather than seeing that  both aspects of aetiology always make a contribution    
**Organizing principles of contemporary classifications** 

In modern usage, the term psychosis refers broadly  to severe psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia,  and some organic and affective disorders. Numerous  criteria have been proposed to achieve a more precise  mebo  
definition, but there are problems with all of them.  Greater severity of illness is a common suggestion, but  some cases are relatively mild (and some neuroses are  severe and at least as disabling). Lack of insight is often  suggested as a criterion, but insight itself is difficult to  define (see page 20). A somewhat more straightforward    
mebooksfree.com

(Eisenberg, 1986; Anonymous, 1994). Equally, it has  led to the suggestion that the two specialties should  use a merged classificatory system (White *et al.*, 2012). 

● It has practical implications, since the term ‘organic’  defines disorders aetiologically or pathologically,  whereas all other psychiatric disorders are, by default,  purely descriptive and based on clusters of symptoms  and signs. This is not only unsatisfactory for psychia 

try (Arango and Fraguas, 2016) but leads to inconsist encies and difficulties at the intersection; these are  currently best illustrated with regard to schizophrenia  and organic schizophrenia-like disorders (Chapter 11). 

There is general agreement that, for these and other  mebooksfree.com 

criterion is the inability to distinguish between subject ive experience and external reality, as shown by the  presence of delusions and hallucinations. Indeed, the  presence of a delusion is sometimes regarded as sufficient  to diagnose a psychosis. However, as well as the prob lems involved in fully defining these terms (ICD-10 even  avoids defining delusion), the label ‘psychosis’ is unsat isfactory because the conditions embraced by the term    
mebo  
have little in common, and it is usually more inform ative to classify the particular disorder concerned. For  these reasons, the neurosis–psychosis distinction, which  was a fundamental organizing principle, was abandoned  in ICD-10 and DSM-IV. Nevertheless, psychosis remains  a convenient term for disorders that are usually severe,    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
reasons, the organic–functional dichotomy is neither  valid nor helpful (Spitzer *et al.*, 1992). However, it has  proved difficult to come up with an alternative. The  ways in which ICD-10 and DSM-5 deal with the issue are  discussed below and in Chapter 14. 

**Neurosis and psychosis** 

and which feature delusions, hallucinations, or unusual  or bizarre behaviour (presumed to be secondary to these  phenomena), especially when a more precise diagnosis  cannot yet be made. The adjectival form is also useful,  and survives in ICD-10 categories such as ‘Other nonor 

ganic psychotic disorders’. Another example is the use of  the term ‘antipsychotic’ drugs. 

In the past, the concepts of neurosis and psychosis were

mebo  
important in most systems of classification. Although  neither is used as an organizing principle in ICD-10  or DSM-5, in everyday clinical practice these terms are  still useful as general descriptors, so it is of relevance to  understand their history. 

As already noted, the term *neurosis* was introduced  by Cullen to denote diseases of the nervous system.  Gradually the category of neurosis narrowed, first as  neurological disorders with a distinct neuropathology  (e.g. epilepsy and stroke) were removed, and later with

**Psychosis** 

The term *psychosis* was suggested by Feuchtersleben,  who in 1845 published a book entitled *Principles of  Medical Psychology*. He proposed the use of the term for  severe mental disorders, whilst he used the term *neuro* 

*sis* for mental disorders as a whole. Thus he wrote that  ‘every psychosis is at the same time a neurosis, but not  every neurosis is a psychosis’ (Hunter and MacAlpine,  1963, page 950). As the concept of neurosis narrowed,  psychosis (also used in the plural, psychoses) came to  be regarded as independent. Many of the difficulties  encountered today in defining the terms neurosis and  psychosis are related to these origins.   
the development of a separate category of psychosis. The objections to the term neurosis are similar to  the objections to the term psychosis, and explain its  removal as an organizing principle in current classifi cation. First, the concept is difficult to define (Gelder,  1986). Second, the conditions that neurosis embraces  have little in common. Thirdly, more information can  mebo  
be conveyed by using a more specific and descriptive  diagnosis, such as ‘anxiety disorder’. A further objection  is that the term neurosis has been widely used with the  unproven assumption of an aetiological meaning in the  psychodynamic literature. 

In the same way as for psychosis, the terms ‘neur osis’ and ‘neurotic’ remain useful as simple descriptors,

**Categorical classification**   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
Traditionally, psychiatric disorders have been classified  by dividing them into categories that are supposed to  represent discrete clinical entities. As already noted,  in the absence of knowledge of underlying pathology,  these categories can only be defined in terms of symp   
being whether the person has a psychiatric disorder that  merits treatment, and, if so, which one. These clinical  imperatives strongly favour categorical approaches to  classification. 

**The multiaxial approach** 

The term *multiaxial* is applied to schemes of classifica   
tom patterns and course. Such categorization facilitates  

tions in which two or more separate sets of informa

the decisions that have to be made in clinical work about  treatment and management, but presents two problems. 

● Although definitions and descriptions can be agreed  upon (to improve *reliability*; see page 29), there is  uncertainty about the extent to which these catego ries represent distinct entities or ‘carve Nature at her  

tion (such as symptoms, aetiology, and personality  type) are coded. Essen-Møller was probably the first to  propose such a system for use in psychiatry, using one  axis for the clinical syndrome and another for aetiol 

ogy (Essen-Møller, 1971). Multiaxial classification is  available within ICD-10. However, although attractive

joints’ (*validity*; see page 30). 

● A significant proportion of patients do not closely  match the descriptions of any disorder, or meet criteria  for two or more categories (*comorbidity*; see page 29). 

These are all significant points, and they are addressed  further in the following sections. However, a more satis factory and practical alternative system has not yet been  devised. 

**Dimensional classification** 

Dimensional classification does not use separate cat egories, but characterizes the subject by means of scores  on two or more dimensions. In the past, Kretschmer  

for several reasons, there is a danger that multiaxial  schemes are too complicated and time-consuming to  be suitable for everyday use, especially if the clinical  utility of each axis has not been demonstrated. Indeed,  for these reasons, DSM-5 removed the multiaxial diag 

nostic classification system used in DSM-IV, replacing it  with a simpler approach. A multiaxial scheme remains  mebo  
popular in child and adolescent psychiatry, with the  axes describing intellectual level, functional impair ment, and psychosocial adversity (Rutter, 2011; see  Chapter 16). 

**Hierarchies of diagnosis**   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
and several other psychiatrists advocated it, and subse quently it was strongly promoted by the psychologist  Hans Eysenck, on the grounds that there is no system atic objective evidence to support the existence of dis crete categories. Eysenck (1970b) proposed a system  of three dimensions—psychoticism, neuroticism, and  introversion–extroversion. 

The concept of dimensionality has been revived and  advanced by epidemiological surveys that have empha sized that there is a continuum between the healthy  population and individuals with diagnosed psychi atric disorders. This applies, for example, to psychotic  symptoms, and argues that even a severe disorder such  as schizophrenia can be seen as occurring at one end  

Categorical systems often include an implicit hierarchy  of categories. If two or more disorders are present, it has  been conventional (although not always made explicit)  to assume that one takes precedence and is regarded  as the main disorder for the purposes of treatment  and recording. For example, organic disorders ‘trump’  schizophrenia, and schizophrenia takes precedence over  affective disorders and anxiety. This type of assumption    
mebo  
is justified because there is some clinical evidence for an  inbuilt hierarchy of significance between the disorders.  For instance, anxiety symptoms occur commonly with  depressive disorders, and are sometimes the presenting  feature. If the anxiety is treated, there is little response  in the depressive symptoms, but if the depressive dis

as well as in the depressive symptoms. These points may  be important when making decisions about the order of  treatment to be used and when deciding which disorder  to record in service statistics if only one is required.  Nevertheless, they must not obscure the importance of  noting in the case record all disorders and symptoms  that are present, and how they change with time and  treatment. 

**Comorbidity**   
**Reliability and validity** 

perspective. Thirdly, the diagnostic ‘rules’ used in  current classificatory systems allow, if not encourage,  multiple diagnoses to be made, and it has been argued  that at least some psychiatric comorbidity is in fact an  mebo  
artefact of this (Maj, 2005), and that a simpler classi ficatory system which reduced it would be desirable  (Goldberg, 2010). 

The term *comorbidity* covers two different  circumstances: 

● *Disorders that are currently considered to be distinct but*    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
Recently, less emphasis has been placed on hierar chies of diagnosis, with greater weight being placed  on comorbidity (also called *dual diagnosis*). This has  occurred for three reasons. First, research has shown  that comorbidity is very common (Kessler, 2004). For  example, about 50% of patients with major depres sive disorder also meet the criteria for an anxiety dis order. Secondly, it reminds the clinician to focus on  all the various disorders that may be present, and not  to assume that the disorder highest in the hierarchy is  necessarily the only, or even the most important, tar get for treatment. The advent of multiaxial systems of  classification, mentioned above, in part reflects this    
*which are probably causally related*. In other words,  there is one disease process, but there are two or more  clinical manifestations, which are currently diagnosed  separately owing to lack of knowledge or because of  clinical convention. 

● *Disorders that are causally unrelated*. This refers to the  chance co-occurrence of two disorders—for example,  mebo  
the onset of presenile dementia in a person with long standing panic disorder. 

Note that comorbidity applies only when the criteria  for two or more diagnoses are met. It should not be used  for patients who fall between diagnostic categories but  who do not meet the criteria for any one of them.

**Reliability of psychiatric**

A prerequisite for any satisfactory classification scheme,  whatever its organizing principle, is that the items (diag noses) that are being classified can be recognized reli ably (Kendell, 1975). However, although reliability is

for symptoms and syndromes. A key study by Stengel  (1959) illustrated ‘the chaotic state of the classifica tions in current use’ by collecting 28 classifications in  a variety of languages. None of the 28 classifications  was accompanied by any indication of the meaning of  the constituent terms.

now known and is reasonable for most categories, this  was not the case until relatively recently, for the reasons  described below. Studies conducted in the 1950s and  1960s demonstrated substantial diagnostic disagreement  between psychiatrists, which arose for two main reasons  (Kreitman, 1961): 

● *The interviewing technique and characteristics of the  psychiatrist*. This included the way in which symp toms and signs were elicited and interpreted and  the weight attached to them. These elements in turn  probably reflect many influences, including training,  professional culture, etc. 

● *The differing use of diagnostic terms and criteria*. At the  e.com   
Illustrating the importance of these factors, one  study concluded that 62% of diagnostic disagreement  arose from inadequate use of diagnostic terms, 32%  from inadequate interview technique, and only 5% was  due to inconsistency in the patient (Ward *et al.*, 1962). 

**International studies of diagnostic criteria** 

The increasing concern in the 1960s about the level of  mebo  
diagnostic disagreement between countries heralded  international studies intended to identify the source of  the variation, and then to improve the reliability. This  work adopted the suggestion of the philosopher Carl  Hempel that *operational definitions* should be developed— 

that is, the specification of a category (e.g. a symptom)

A key study was the US–UK Diagnostic Study (Cooper  *et al.*, 1972), which followed on from the demonstration  that both diagnostic and admission rates for manic depres sion and schizophrenia differed considerably between the  

of the symptoms and behaviours. This led to the devel opment of computer programs such as CATEGO (Wing  *et al.*, 1974), which generate a diagnosis using the symp tom ratings, eliminating both the personal bias of the

diagnosticians and any chance errors made for other rea

illness in the UK was more than 10 times that in equivalent  mental hospitals in the USA, whereas the rate for schizo phrenia was about twice as high in the USA (and even  higher in New York) as it was in the UK. Another seminal  study was the International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia    
sons. Although computer-generated diagnoses inevitably  reflect the diagnostic preferences of whoever wrote the  program, they have proved valuable for epidemiological  studies, and are widely used in research.

(IPSS), a large international collaborative study organized  by the World Health Organization, with centres in nine  countries taking part. The IPSS first demonstrated clearly  that structured interviews could be translated and used in  different cultures, enabling it to show that patients with  typical symptoms of schizophrenia could be found in all  nine countries (World Health Organization, 1973). The  IPSS findings are discussed further in Chapter 11. 

**Standardized interview schedules** 

A major step towards improving diagnostic reliability came  with the development of standardized interview schedules  that minimize the variations in interviewing technique and  symptom rating between psychiatrists. This development    
**Validity of psychiatric diagnoses** 

The above discussion has focused upon the reliability of  diagnoses, because without a reasonable level of inter observer reliability it is not possible to test whether or  not a concept is valid. Validity is a much more difficult  topic. In a general sense, validity refers to the extent to  which a concept means what it is supposed to mean. It  mebo  
is also closely connected with usefulness (utility). For a  discussion of reliability and validity in psychiatry, see  Jablensky (2016). 

Three forms of validity are usually recognized. 

● *Face validity* is the correspondence with the clinical

was closely linked with the international studies men tioned above. Thus the US–UK Diagnostic Study used the  Present State Examination (PSE), one of the first structured  psychiatric interviews (Wing *et  al.*, 1974). Standardized  interview schedules specify the content and sequence of  the interview, and provide scoring rules by which the pres ence and severity of symptoms are rated. They are now  widely used and both specialist and lay forms are available,  for use in different settings and with different populations.  Further examples are given in Chapter 3. 

**Diagnosis by computer** 

The IPSS also revealed that, although a great deal of the  variation between psychiatrists in the rating of symptoms    
concepts and descriptions currently accepted in clin ical practice. This is fairly easy to achieve by the careful  use of glossaries and lists of criteria (illustrating the fact  that reliability and validity are not wholly separate). 

● *Predictive validity* is the extent to which disorders pre dict response to treatment and outcome. This has  high utility. 

● *Construct validity* is the third and most fundamental  mebo  
form of validity, in which there is a demonstrable  relationship between a disorder and its underlying  aetiology and pathophysiology. Unfortunately, most  psychiatric disorders have an unknown and probably  low construct validity, reflecting the descriptive crite

**ICD-10** 

By the time ICD-10 was due, it had become evident  that a major process of international collaboration was  needed. The objectives of this process were that ICD-10  Chapter V should be: 

● suitable for international communication about sta tistics for morbidity and mortality 

● a reference standard for national and other psychi atric classifications 

● acceptable and useful to a wide range of users in dif ferent cultures 

● an aid to education.   
In 1952 the American Psychiatric Association (APA) pub lished the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual (DSM-I) as an alternative to the widely criticized  ICD-6. DSM-I was strongly influenced by the views of  Adolf Meyer and Karl Menninger, and its simple glossary  reflected the prevailing acceptance of psychoanalytic  ideas in the USA. DSM-II was published in 1968, and  combined psychoanalytic ideas with those of Kraepelin. mebo  
DSM-III was published in 1980, and was an impor tant step forward, containing five main innovations. 

● Operational criteria were provided for each diagno sis, with explicit rules for inclusion and exclusion  (Feighner *et al.*, 1972). This was the first complete clas sification to do so, and the first to be based on criteria

The process started in 1982, and included extensive  field trials to demonstrate the reliability and utility of  the diagnostic categories. The final version, entitled  *Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines*, was pub 

lished as ICD-10 in 1992 (World Health Organization,  1992b). It contains descriptions of each of the disor ders, and the diagnostic instructions for users make  it clear that these allow some latitude for clinical  judgement. 

All of the diagnostic codes start with the letter F  and, like the other chapters, it has 10 major divisions  (Box 2.2), each of which can be divided into 10 subdivi sions, and so on. For example, F20, schizophrenia, can

be followed by a further number for the category within  the group (e.g. F20.1, hebephrenic schizophrenia), and  a fourth character if it is necessary to subdivide further.  Although ICD-10 is basically a descriptive classifica 

tion, available knowledge and ingrained clinical practice  mean that aetiology is a defining criterion in some of  the main categories, notably organic (F0), substance use related (F1), and stress-related (F4). 

Because ICD-10 is used for several purposes, it  exists in several forms, each of which is derived from,  and compatible with, the core version. For example,  the primary healthcare version has only 27 categories,  each with reminders about likely management and  treatment. There is a research version (DCR-10), which

The efforts were largely successful, with the  systems sharing most fundamental concepts and cate gories, but there were some differences (Table 2.1). The  arrival of DSM-5 has slightly increased the differences  with ICD-10, but most of these are minor and are dis cussed as appropriate in later chapters. However, a few

much greater use of dimensions rather than categories.  However, it became apparent that for all major disorders  both steps were premature, and DSM-5 retains the same  key elements as its predecessors, albeit with some new  and revised diagnostic criteria and other features that  have generated controversy for several reasons, includ 

ing concerns about specificity and sensitivity, reliabil ity, and conflicts of interest (Frances and Nardo, 2013;  Blashfield *et al.*, 2014).

classification, and reflects the professional, educational,  and financial priorities of its parent organization, the  American Psychiatric Association. Notably, even in the  USA, hospital records utilize the ICD system, not DSM.

**Current and future issues in psychiatric classification** 

Many of the issues relating to classification discussed  in this chapter continue to be topical and under active  debate. This section raises some additional issues, espe cially those that may influence future developments. 

**Cultural issues** 

Although ICD-10 and DSM-5 make national approaches  to classification less important (see Box 2.3), local and  cultural factors remain important in classification in sev eral respects.   
Psychiatrists and physicians in countries that  have their own longstanding and comprehensive sys tems of ideas about health and illness, such as India,  Pakistan, and China, sometimes complain that classi fications developed in Europe and North America give    
mebo  
too much emphasis to separation of mind and body.  For example, the concept of somatoform disorders  depends on viewing mind and body as alternatives.  This approach causes problems in western medicine  and is not understood at all elsewhere. Investigation of  these issues is difficult, as outsiders may not appreciate

The descriptive concepts introduced by Kraepelin  and Bleuler have been very influential in most European  countries, particularly in Germany, UK, and Scandinavian  countries. In Scandinavia, emphasis has also been placed  on the concept of psychogenic or reactive psychoses  (Strömgren, 1985). In addition, Scandinavia was notable  for its early concepts of multidimensional diagnoses. 

In France, Kraepelinian views of schizophrenia were  less widely accepted, and two other diagnostic cat egories of psychosis not commonly used elsewhere  have persisted, namely bouffée délirante and délires  chroniques. Bouffée délirante is the sudden onset of  a delusional state with trance-like feelings, of short  

sified as ‘persistent delusional disorders’, and are subdi vided into the ‘non-focused’, in which several areas of  mental activity are affected, and the ‘focused’, with a  single delusional theme, such as erotomania. These dis orders are discussed in Chapter 12. 

Another example of international variation is the  Chinese national classification (Chinese Classification  of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, CCMD-3), introduced in  2001\. Although largely based upon ICD-10, it excludes  almost all of the somatoform disorders, so that particular  prominence can be given to the category of neurasthe nia, which remains one of the most frequent diagnoses in  Chinese psychiatry.

about whether ICD-11 should strive for harmonization  with DSM-5 in light of concerns with aspects of the lat ter (Frances and Nardo, 2013). 

The main principles and properties of ICD-11 will  remain unchanged from ICD-10, including the lack of  operationalized criteria, and the intention that it can  be used by many professional groups in all cultures and  health systems. Although the detailed content of ICD

● Sleep–wake disorders and sexuality-related conditions  and dysfunctions will have their own chapters. 

**Research domain criteria** 

The scientific arguments for a dimensional rather than  categorical approach to diagnostic classification have  been outlined above. One manifestation of this was the  move in 2010 by the United States’ National Institute  mebo  
for Mental Health to advocate ‘domains’, and to require  these to be used as the basis for research funding, not  DSM-5 (or ICD-10) categories (Cuthbert and Insel,  2013). Such domains may include neuropsychological  constructs (such as working memory, or reward sensitiv 

ity) or brain systems (e.g. corticostriatal circuits), which

● For schizophrenia, first-rank symptoms (see page 255\)  will be of less diagnostic importance, and the subtypes  of schizophrenia omitted. 

● In mood disorders, bipolar II disorder will become a  distinct entity (as it is in DSM). In contrast, unlike  DSM-5, reactions to bereavement will continue to be  excluded from diagnosis of a depressive episode. 

**Classification in this book** 

In this book, both ICD-10 and DSM-5 classifications    
underpin—and are thought to cut across—current  diagnostic categories. The advent of Research Domain  Criteria (RDoC) is having a major, if controversial,  impact on psychiatric research. However, it is not of  clinical relevance until (and unless) it discovers domains  that have the necessary utility and reliability to accom

Psychiatric assessment has three main goals: 

● *To make a diagnosis*. Despite its limitations (see  Chapter  2), diagnosis is central to the practice of  psychiatry, since it provides the basis for rational,    
discussions about management, and to adhere to any  treatment decisions which are agreed upon. 

The *process* of psychiatric assessment, also known as  the *psychiatric interview*, can be broken down into the  

evidence-based approaches to treatment and prog nosis (Craddock and Mynors-Wallis, 2014). A  major

goal of most assessments, especially those of new  patients, is therefore to allow a diagnosis or differen tial diagnosis to be made. This in turn requires that  the symptoms and signs of psychiatric disorder (see  Chapter 1) can be elicited, and their diagnostic signifi   
● *Preparation*. This includes having the interviewing  skills necessary to achieve the above goals, acquiring  as much background information as possible (e.g. the  reason for referral, and whether informants are avail 

able) to help guide the assessment and identify areas

cance appreciated. 

● *To understand the context of the diagnosis*. The psych iatrist needs to have sufficient information about the  patient’s life history, current circumstances, and per sonality. This is necessary to try and understand why  the disorder has occurred in this person at this time; it  also has a major bearing on decisions about manage ment and prognosis. 

● *To establish a therapeutic relationship*. The psychiatrist  must ensure that the patient feels able and willing to  give an accurate and full history. Without this skill,  the necessary diagnostic information is unlikely to be  obtained. Thus, establishment of a therapeutic rela 

tionship is essential if the patient is to engage fully in  

for particular focus, and anticipating whether the  interview may need to be adapted (e.g. owing to lan guage difficulties, or a shortage of time). 

● *Collecting the information*. This is usually addressed by  means of a series of headings covering the psychiatric  history, mental state examination, and other compo nents, as described below. 

mebo  
● *Evaluating the information* to arrive at a diagnosis or  differential diagnosis. This is the hardest part of the  process to describe to readers new to psychiatry, as it  requires knowledge of the diagnostic significance of  particular symptoms and symptom combinations.  It is therefore suggested that this chapter should  be returned to at regular intervals, to refine how

● *Recording and communicating the information collected,  and the conclusions drawn.* The information must be  shared with other health professionals involved with  the care of the patient both now and in the future,  and with the patient and their significant others.  Various modes of communication are necessary (e.g.    
termined, one of extensive data collection. In practice,  however, assessment is an active, selective process, in  which diagnostic clues are pursued, hypotheses tested,  and the focus of questioning adapted to the particu 

lar circumstances. This ‘dynamic’ aspect of assessment  can only be learned from practical experience. It also

This chapter covers these areas in turn, concen trating on the full initial assessment of a patient by a  general adult psychiatrist. It also discusses how this pro   
requires a working knowledge of the main psychiatric  syndromes for the significance of specific symptoms or  history items that emerge during the assessment to be  appreciated. It was for this reason that the preceding  chapter covered psychiatric classification. 

It is assumed that the reader is already competent in  medical history-taking and physical examination, and

**Preparing for the assessment** 

Psychiatric assessments are conducted in many settings.  The following recommendations should be followed as  far as is practicable, but they cannot always be achieved  in their entirety. In some locations, such as an Accident  and Emergency department, the setting may be far from  ideal. Nevertheless, it is important to do what is pos 

is expected to last. This is especially relevant to inter views in the community; 

● ensure that help can be called if it is needed. In hos pital, check for an emergency call button and its pos ition, and otherwise try to arrange for another person  to be within earshot; 

● ensure that neither the patient nor any obstruction is  

sible to ensure safety and confidentiality, and to put the  

between you and the exit;   
mebo  
patient at ease. 

Before starting the interview, it is always worth  finding out what is already known about the patient  and the circumstances in which the assessment has  come about. This will often be in the form of a refer   
● remove from sight any objects that could be used as  weapons.

ral letter from another doctor, or there may be notes  available from previous assessments. This information  will reveal areas of enquiry that may require particular  emphasis, and may modify the diagnosis that is sub 

sequently made. Equally, every assessment should, of  course, begin with an open mind (not least since prior  diagnoses may be incorrect, or the present presenta tion may be different). 

Only a small minority of patients are potentially  dangerous, but the need for precautions should be con sidered before every interview. The interviewer should  always: 

● make sure that another person knows where and  when the interview is taking place and how long it  

**Starting the assessment** 

The psychiatrist should welcome the patient by name,  give their own name and status, and explain in a few  words the reason for and purpose of the assessment. If  

the patient is being seen at the request of another doc mebo  
tor, the interviewer should indicate this. If the patient  is accompanied, the interviewer should greet the  companion(s) and explain how long they should expect  to wait and whether they will be interviewed. It is usu 

ally better to see the patient alone first, provided that he  is able to provide an adequate history. The interviewer  should explain that notes will be taken, and that these

will be confidential. If the interview is for the purposes  of a report to an outside agency (e.g. a medicolegal  report), this should be made clear. The general structure  of the interview should be explained, and the time avail 

able stated; the latter is not only a matter of courtesy but  is also valuable if the psychiatrist later needs to interrupt  the patient, or ask him to give more concise answers, to  ensure the assessment can be completed.

and signs of psychiatric disorder, leaving the other kinds  of problem until later. 

From the start, consider the possible diagnoses and, as  the interview progresses, select questions to confirm or  reject these diagnoses. For example, if the patient men tions hearing voices, this immediately raises the possi

his chair at an angle. If possible, the interviewer should  also avoid sitting at a much higher level. Whenever pos sible, the interviewer should make notes (whether on  paper or electronically) during the interview, as writing  up an assessment afterwards is time-consuming and not  always wholly accurate. However, it is usually better to  delay note-taking for some minutes until the patient  feels that he has the interviewer’s undivided atten tion. The patient should be placed at the left side of a  right-handed interviewer. With this arrangement, the  interviewer can attend to the patient and maintain an  informal atmosphere while writing. 

The following techniques have been shown to  improve the results of the interview (Goldberg *et  al.*,    
bility of schizophrenia and requires that, at some stage  in the assessment, the other cardinal features of the dis order are sought, and their presence or absence clearly  noted.

It is an active and iterative process in  which the focus of attention is directed by hypotheses

This  active process of interviewing is particularly necessary  when time is short and when immediate treatment deci sions must be made.

1980). The interviewer should: 

● adopt a relaxed posture and appear unhurried—even  when time is short; 

● maintain appropriate eye contact with the patient  and not appear engrossed in note-taking; 

● be alert to verbal and non-verbal cues of distress as  well as to the factual content of the interview; ● maintain control of the interview if the patient is  over-talkative or discursive.

or she becomes better at thinking of possible diagnoses,  and proceeding in a way that rules them in or out more  rapidly and convincingly. 

It is generally better to establish clearly the nature  of the symptoms before asking how and when they  developed. If there is any doubt about the nature of  the symptoms, the patient should be asked to describe  mebo  
specific examples. When all of the presenting symp toms have been explored sufficiently, direct questions  are asked about others that have not come to light but  which may be relevant. In doing this, the interviewer  uses his knowledge of psychiatric syndromes to decide  what further questions to ask. For example, a person  who complains of feeling depressed would be asked    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
The interview should begin with an open question (one  that cannot be answered with a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’),  such as ‘Tell me about your problems or difficulties’. The  patient should be allowed to talk freely for several min 

utes before further questions are asked. As the patient  describes their problems, the interviewer should observe  their responses and manner—for example, whether they  are reticent or unduly circumstantial. 

The first step is to obtain a clear account of the  patient’s problems. It is important to separate symptoms  from their consequences, and from other life problems  that the patient may want to discuss. For example,  a patient may have low mood, sexual difficulties, or    
about thoughts concerning the future, and about sui cidal ideas. If suicidal thoughts are acknowledged, fur ther specific questions should be asked. Also ask about  the impact that the symptoms have had on the patient’s  life, looking for evidence of functional impairment. 

The onset and course of the symptoms are clarified  next, together with their relationship to any stressful  mebo  
events or physical illness. Considerable persistence may  be needed to date the onset or an exacerbation of symp toms accurately. It sometimes helps to ask how the onset  related to an event that the patient is likely to remember,  such as a birthday. The patient’s attempts to cope with  the symptoms are noted—for example, increased drink ing of alcohol to relieve distress. If treatment has already

been given, its nature, timing, and effects are noted,  together with the patient’s concordance with it. The interviewer completes the relevant parts of the  full assessment schedule, which is described in later sec tions of this chapter. When time is adequate, the mental  state is usually examined at the end of the interview,  together with any relevant physical examination. If time  is short, it may be better to examine the mental state  after the presenting complaints have been clarified. This  can make it easier to select the key points to be asked  

**Box 3.1 Some techniques**  

**for effective psychiatric assessments** 

● Help the patient to talk freely. This can be done  using open questions, and by non-verbal cues such  as nodding, or saying ‘Go on’ or ‘Tell me more  about that’   
● Keep the patient to relevant topics. Again, non verbal cues are useful, as well as specific interven

about in the rest of the history. 

Throughout the interview, allow the patient, as far  as possible, to describe their problems spontaneously.  In this way, unexpected material may be volunteered  that might not be revealed by the answers to questions.  However, questions may be needed to bring the patient  back to the point after a digression, and to elicit spe 

cific information—for example, about the relationship  between symptoms and stressful events. Whenever  possible, the interviewer should use open rather than  leading or closed questions (a leading question suggests  the answer, whereas a closed question allows only the  answers ‘yes’ or ‘no’). Thus, for example, instead of the  closed question ‘Are you happily married?’ the inter 

tions such as ‘At this point I’d like to ask you more  about how you’ve been feeling. We can return to  your money worries later’   
● Make systematic enquiries, but avoid asking so  many questions that other, unanticipated issues are  not volunteered   
● Check your understanding, and that you have  enquired about all of the areas the patient thinks  are important, by summarizing the key points of the  history back to the patient. This step also helps you  to begin to formulate your views on the diagnosis  and causes   
● Be flexible in assessments, with regard to both their

viewer might ask ‘How do you and your wife get on?’  When there is no alternative to a closed question, the  answer should be followed by a request for an example. 

Before ending the interview, it is good practice to ask  a general question such as ‘Is there anything that I have  not asked you about, that you think I should know?’ It is  also useful to summarize for the patient what you con 

sider to be the key points, to check for any errors of fact,  and to see whether the patient agrees with your initial  understanding of events.

plan. In addition, they provide an opportunity to learn  what burdens the illness has placed on the partner or  relative, and how they have tried to cope. A history from  an informant is essential when the patient is unable to  give an accurate account of his or her condition (e.g.  because of impaired memory). Finally, when it is impor   
mebooksfree.com

Whenever possible, the patient’s history should be  supplemented by information from a close relative or  another person who knows them well. This is much  more important in psychiatry than in the rest of medi 

cine, for several reasons. Some psychiatric patients are  unaware of the extent or significance of their symptoms.  Others are aware of their problems but do not wish to  reveal them—for example, people who misuse alcohol  often conceal the extent of their drinking. Patients and  relatives may also give quite different accounts of per 

sonality characteristics, or have contrasting interpreta tions of recent events and symptoms. Interviews with a  partner or relative are used not only to obtain additional    
tant to know about the patient’s early development or  childhood, an interview with a parent is usually the best  way to discover the relevant information. 

Informants can either be seen separately from the  patient, or invited to join the interview. The choice  depends on both the assessor’s and the patient’s pref erence, but in both instances the patient must give  mebo  
consent. If the patient refuses, explore the reasons for  this and explain the difficulties that it will pose. There  are a few situations in which the patient’s permission  is not required before interviewing a relative or other  informant—for example, if the patient is a child, or  when adult patients are mute or confused. In other cases,  the doctor should explain to the patient the reasons for

interviewing the informant, while emphasizing that  confidential information given by the patient will not  be passed on. If any information needs to be given to  a relative—for example, about treatment—the patient’s  permission should be obtained. Questions from relatives  should be dealt with in the same way. 

The psychiatrist begins by explaining the purpose  of the interview, and may need to reassure the inform ant. For example, a relative may fear that they will be  viewed as responsible in some way for the patient’s

primary duty to the patient. If the informant has been  interviewed separately from the patient, the psych iatrist should not tell the patient what has been said  unless the informant has given their permission. This  mebo  
is important even when the informant has revealed  something that should be discussed with the patient— for example, an account of excessive drinking. 

Sometimes it is necessary to speak to employers, edu cators, friends, police, or others to collect further infor mation. This should be done only with the patient’s

The assessment is then completed by the physical exam ination, and sometimes by further investigations. This  section covers the psychiatric history, followed by the  mental state examination, and then the other aspects of  the assessment. 

A commonly used scheme for history-taking is given  below. For ease of reference, the scheme is presented  as a list of headings and items. More details, and some    
sible, signed. 

**A scheme for history-taking** 

Information is grouped under the headings shown in  Box 3.2. For clarity, this section is written in the style of  short notes and illustrative questions. The next section  explains why these topics are relevant, and some of the  

background information to the questions, are provided  in the subsequent notes. As noted above, much of the  interview is designed to elicit diagnostic symptoms,

needed to achieve these goals and form the basis for a  subsequent therapeutic relationship. 

The following scheme is comprehensive and sys tematic, as an ability to conduct this form of assess ment is essential before briefer interviews are attempted.  Modification of the interview for use in briefer or spe cific settings is described later. Moreover, although it  is neither possible nor necessary to take a full history  on every occasion, the information that has been elic ited should always be recorded systematically and in a  standard order. This practice helps the interviewer to  remember all of the potentially important topics and to  add further information later. The practice also makes it  easier for colleagues who need to refer to the notes in the  

of acquaintance of any other person(s) interviewed.

description of their history will have provided some  indication about their personality. However, a specific  focus is also necessary, covering the domains noted in  Box 3.4. Personality can be a relatively difficult area of  the history, as outlined below in the section ‘Notes on  history-taking’.   
If not, this in itself is useful information. For example,  the patient may disagree that they are depressed, believ ing that their somatic symptoms are due to cancer. This  may affect their willingness to engage fully in the assess ment or accept the treatment for depression that is sub sequently recommended.

genetic or environmental influences. A genetic contri bution is more likely for some disorders than for others,  and increases as more relatives are affected. Although  family environment has, as a rule, proved to be less  important than genes in explaining family history  (see Chapter 5), knowledge about the family’s circum stances remains part of the basic information required  mebo  
for understanding the origin and presentation of the  patient’s problems. 

Recent events in the family may have been stress ful to the patient—for example, the serious illness or  divorce of a family member. Events in the family may  throw light on the patient’s concerns. For example,

Child development 

Few patients know whether they have passed through  developmental stages normally. Failure to do so may be  a sign of learning disability and also a risk factor for later  disorders such as schizophrenia. However, this informa 

tion is usually more important if the patient is a child  or adolescent, in which case the parents are likely to be  available for interview. The effects of separation from  the mother vary considerably, and depend in part on the  age of the child, the duration, and the reason for sepa

Sexual history 

The interviewer should use common sense when decid ing how much to ask the individual patient, depend ing on the response to initial questions, demographic  factors (such as age and relationship status), and the  nature of the presenting complaint. Usually the inter viewer is concerned to establish generally whether the    
mebo  
patient’s sexual life is in any way involved in their  current difficulties, whether as a cause, a correlate, or  a consequence. If so, then more detailed enquiry is  appropriate. 

Judgement must also be used about the optimal tim ing and amount of detail of questioning about childhood

opment provides information about early temperament  and emerging personality, and abnormalities or delays  may serve as risk factors for, or early signs of, later prob lems. However, childhood behavioural characteristics as  a rule are weak predictors of adult disorders, and only  require detailed consideration when assessing children  and adolescents. Assessment in child psychiatry is cov ered in Chapter 16. 

Education 

The school record gives an indication of intelligence,  achievements, and social development. Ask whether the  patient made friends and got on well with teachers, and  about success at games and other activities. Bullying is a  

abuse, especially sexual abuse. Unfortunately, such past  experiences are sufficiently common to merit enquiry.  However, often it may not be appropriate to raise the  matter in a first interview, unless prompted by the  patient or in the light of background information avail 

able to the interviewer. The decision to raise the topic  also depends on the clinical suspicion, and the time and  mebo  
expertise available to the interviewer. Sensitivity is also  necessary when deciding what information to record  and with whom it should be shared.

Occupational history 

Information about the present job helps the interviewer  to understand the patient’s current abilities, interests,  and financial and social circumstances, and may be a  potential source of stress. A list of previous jobs and rea 

sons for leaving is relevant to the assessment of person ality. If the status of jobs has declined, this may reflect  chronic illness or substance misuse.

Pregnancy, childbirth, miscarriages, and terminations  are events that are sometimes associated with adverse  psychological reactions. Information about the patient’s  children is relevant to present worries and the pattern  and characteristics of family life. 

Consideration of the welfare and needs of any chil dren is always integral to an assessment, as their health  mebo  
and care may be adversely affected by the parent’s illness  or its treatment. For example, if a seriously depressed  woman has a young baby, due steps to ensure the baby’s  wellbeing are essential, and the situation may influence  decisions about the mother’s care (e.g. about medication  if she is breastfeeding, and about hospital admission). In  turn, any concerns about the care or welfare of children

patient’s circumstances. Assets and resources (including  potential carers) are assessed, as well as problems and  sources of stress. There can be no general rule about the  amount of detail to elicit, and this must be guided by  common sense. 

Substance use and misuse 

This includes past as well as present consumption of  alcohol and other substances, and the impact of their  use on the patient’s health and life. Misuse of prescribed  drugs should also be considered. The patient’s answers  may be evasive or misleading, and may need to be  checked with other informants and sources of informa 

tion (e.g. urine screens, blood tests). See Chapter 20 for  

well, and by observing behaviour. Good indications of  personality can often be obtained by asking how the  patient has behaved in particular circumstances, espe cially at times when social roles are changing, such as  when starting work, or becoming a parent. However,  mistakes can arise from paying too much attention to  the patient’s own assessment of their personality, espe cially during a single interview. Some people give an

**Past psychiatric and medical history** In many instances, a patient being assessed will have a  past psychiatric history. A previous diagnosis increases  the probability that the current diagnosis will prove to  be similar, but it is important always to keep an open  

of the situation and the anxiety that it may provoke.  These factors mean that it is essential to interview other  informants whenever possible, and to avoid drawing  premature or unjustified conclusions about personality.  Personality tests are now rarely used in clinical practice,  but interview schedules for diagnosis of personality dis 

order are widely used in forensic and other settings (see

The medical history is also important (Phelan and

Blair, 2008). A  medical disorder or its treatment may  be directly related to the presentation (e.g. a recurrence  of hypothyroidism presenting with lethargy, or mania  induced by corticosteroids), but may also be indirectly  relevant (e.g. via the psychosocial effects of chronic ill  health, or as a sign of somatoform disorder).

This is important because:

Mood and emotional tone 

Ask whether the patient is generally cheerful or  gloomy and whether they experience marked changes  of mood, and, if so, how quickly these moods appear,  how long they last, and whether they follow life events.  Information about prevailing mood and mood swings  mebo  
may also reveal evidence suggestive of mood disorder,  which can be enquired about further.

**The mental state examination** 

The history records symptoms up to the time of the  interview. The mental state examination is concerned  with symptoms, signs, and behaviour during the  interview, and is usually conducted after the history.  Although the distinction is traditional, and conceptu 

ally useful, in practice the boundary between the his tory and the mental state examination is somewhat  blurred. In particular, very recent symptoms and signs  are often recorded in the mental state examination,  even if the phenomena are not experienced or elicited  during the interview. The mental state examination is  

in conjunction with the history of the present condi tion, most of the key diagnostic information. The ability  to carry out and record an accurate and comprehen sive mental state examination is therefore a core skill  required by all psychiatrists and other mental health  mebo  
professionals. It is also specified by the United Kingdom  General Medical Council as a requirement for all newly  qualified doctors (General Medical Council, 2009).

also sometimes used to elicit and record symptoms and  signs which, for whatever reason, have not been covered  previously in the interview (e.g. whether the patient is  suicidal). For a history of the mental state examination,  see Huline-Dickens (2013).

Much diagnostically useful information can be obtained  from the patient’s appearance and behaviour.

**Posture and movement** 

Posture and movement also reflect mood. A depressed  patient characteristically sits with hunched shoulders,  

Speech may be unusually fast and increased in amount,  as in mania (‘*pressure of speech’*), or slow, sparse, and  mebo

with the head and gaze inclined downwards. An anx ious patient may sit on the edge of their chair, with  their hands gripping its sides. Anxious people and  patients with agitated depression may be tremulous  and restless—for example, touching their jewellery or  picking at their fingernails. Manic patients are over active and restless. Other abnormalities of movement  include tardive dyskinesia (see page 729\) and the  motor signs seen mainly in catatonic schizophrenia  (see page 256). 

**Social behaviour** 

The patient’s social behaviour and interactions with  the interviewer are influenced by their personality and  

If the patient is having problems finding or articulating  words, consider the possibility of dysphasia or dysar thria. For further details, see Box 3.6 and consult a neu rology textbook (e.g. Kaufman and Milstein, 2017). 

**Neologisms** 

Neologisms are private words invented by the patient,  mebo  
often to describe morbid experiences. If the interviewer  is uncertain whether a word is a neologism, ask the  patient to repeat and spell the word, and explain its  meaning. 

**Flow of speech**

by their attitude to the assessment, as outlined above.  However, their behaviour can also be influenced by psy chiatric disorder, so it provides another potential source  of diagnostic information. Manic patients tend to be  unduly familiar or disinhibited, whereas those with  dementia may behave as if they were somewhere other  than in a medical interview. A person with schizophre nia may be withdrawn and preoccupied, whilst a person  with antisocial personality disorder may behave aggres sively. If the patient’s social behaviour is highly unusual,  note what exactly is unusual, rather than simply using  imprecise terms such as ‘bizarre’. 

**Speech**   
Abnormalities in the flow of speech may simply reflect  an anxious, distracted patient, or one of low intelligence.  More significantly, such abnormalities may be evidence  of disturbances in the stream or form of thoughts. For  example, sudden interruptions may indicate thought  blocking, and rapid shifts from one topic to another sug 

gest flight of ideas. For a description of these features, see  Chapter 1\. It can be difficult to be certain about these  mebo  
abnormalities; if possible, write down a representative  example. 

**Mood** 

Conventionally, the mood section includes recording of

Speech and thoughts are recorded in different parts of  the mental state examination, even though it is only  through speech that thoughts become known to the  interviewer. By convention, the ‘speech’ section covers  the rate, quantity, volume, and flow of speech, and any  delays in responding to questions or apparent difficul 

ties producing or articulating speech. The content of  speech, in the sense that it reveals the patient’s thoughts  (e.g. preoccupations about death, grandiose delusions) is  deferred until the ‘Thoughts’ section.

other emotions such as anxiety, and also related phe nomena, including suicidal thoughts. The phenomenol ogy of mood and its disorders are discussed in more  detail in Chapters 9 and 10. 

**Depression and mania** 

The assessment of mood begins with the observations of  behaviour described already, and continues with direct  mebo  
questions such as ‘What is your mood like?’ or ‘How  are you in your spirits?’ To assess depression, questions  should be asked about a feeling of being about to cry  (actual tearfulness is often denied), pessimistic thoughts  about the present, hopelessness about the future, and  guilt about the past. Suitable questions are ‘What do you

**Language abilities** 

**Dysarthria** is difficulty in the production of speech by the  speech organs. **Dysphasia** is partial failure of language  function of cortical origin; it can be receptive or expres sive. Testing for dysarthria can be done by giving difficult  phrases such as ‘West Register Street’ or a tongue twister. 

● **Ideomotor apraxia** is tested by asking the patient to  perform increasingly complicated tasks to command,  usually ending with a three-stage sequence such  as: (1) touch the right ear with (2) the left middle finger  while (3) placing the right thumb on the table. 

Apraxia, especially if the patient fails to complete the  

mebo

**Receptive dysphasia** can be detected by asking the  patient to read a passage of appropriate difficulty or, if  they fail in this, individual words or letters. If they can read  the passage, they are asked to explain it. Comprehension  of spoken language is tested by asking the patient to lis 

ten to a spoken passage and explain it (first checking that  memory is intact) or to respond to simple commands (e.g.  to point at named objects). 

**Expressive dysphasia** is detected by asking the  patient to name common objects such as a watch, key,  and pen, and some of their parts (e.g. the face of a watch),  and parts of the body. The patient is also asked to talk  spontaneously (e.g. about hobbies) and to write a brief  passage, first to dictation, and then spontaneously, on a    
left side of figures or dressing on the left side, suggests a  right-sided lesion in the posterior parietal region. It may  be associated with other disorders related to this region,  namely sensory inattention and anosognosia. 

**Agnosia** is the inability to understand the significance  of sensory stimuli even though the sensory pathways and  sensorium are sufficiently intact for the patient to be able  to do so. Agnosia cannot be diagnosed until there is good  evidence that the sensory pathways are intact and con 

sciousness is not impaired. 

● **Astereognosia** is failure to identify three-dimensional  form; it is tested by asking the patient to identify  objects placed in their hand while their eyes are  closed. Suitable items are keys, coins of different sizes,  

mebo

familiar topic (e.g. the members of the family). A patient  who cannot do these tests should be asked to copy a  short passage. 

Language disorders point to the left hemisphere in  right-handed people. In left-handed patients localization  is less certain, but in many it is still the left hemisphere.  The type of language disorder gives some further guide  to localization. Expressive dysphasia suggests an anterior  lesion, receptive dysphasia suggests a posterior lesion,  mainly auditory dysphasia suggests a lesion towards the  temporal region, and mainly visual dysphasia suggests a  more posterior lesion.

and paper clips. 

● **Atopognosia** is inability to locate the position of an  object on the skin.   
● In **finger agnosia** the patient cannot identify which  of their fingers has been touched when their eyes are  closed. Right–left confusion is tested by touching one  hand or ear and asking the patient which side of the  body has been touched.   
● **Agraphognosia** is failure to identify letters or numbers  ‘written’ on the skin. It is tested by tracing numbers  on the palms with a closed fountain pen or similar  object.   
● **Anosognosia** is failure to identify functional deficits  caused by disease. It is seen most often as unaware

**Apraxia** is inability to perform a volitional act even  though the motor system and sensorium are sufficiently  intact for the person to do so. Apraxia can be tested in  several ways.

Lesions of either parietal lobe can cause contralat eral astereognosia, agraphognosia, and atopognosia.  Sensory inattention and anosognosia are more com mon with right parietal lesions. Finger agnosia and  right–left disorientation are said to be more common  with lesions of the dominant parietal region.

been blaming yourself for anything?’ Questions about  elevated mood correspond to those about depression— for example, ‘How are you in your spirits?’ followed, if  necessary, by direct questions such as ‘Do you feel in  unusually good spirits?’ Note that the mood in mania  can be irritable as well as cheerful. It can be useful to ask  the patient to rate their current mood on a numerical or  other scale. 

A distinction is sometimes drawn between ‘objective’  mebooksfree.com 

Some inexperienced interviewers are wary of asking  about suicide due to fear that they may suggest it to the  mebo  
patient. There is no evidence to warrant this caution, and  an explicit assessment of suicide risk should be part of  every mental state examination. Nevertheless, question ing should be handled sensitively and in stages, start ing with open questions such as ‘Have you ever thought  that life is not worth living?’ and, if appropriate, going  on to ask ‘Have you ever wished that you could die?’ or

and ‘subjective’ mood. The latter is the patient’s view of  their own mood; the former refers to the interviewer’s  conclusion based upon their observation of the patient  during the interview and the responses to their ques 

tions. On occasion the two may differ—for example,  a severely depressed person may deny low mood. It is  important therefore to record the presence of the various  

‘Have you ever considered any way in which you might  end your life?’ and then leading on to direct questioning  about current suicidal intent or plans. The interviewer  may also be concerned that they will not be able to  cope if the patient does admit to being suicidal. A basic  training in this topic, and knowledge of self-harm and  suicide, should preclude these worries. Questions about

mental state examination to include questioning about  other diagnostic features of mood disorder, if these have  not been asked about already. Whether the interviewer  chooses to record them in the notes under this heading  or to insert them into the relevant part of the history is a  matter of personal preference and convenience. 

**Fluctuating and incongruous mood** 

As well as assessing the prevailing mood, the interviewer  should ascertain how mood varies. When mood var ies excessively, it is said to be *labile*—for example, the  patient appears dejected at one point in the interview  but quickly changes to a normal or unduly cheerful  mood. Any lack of emotional response, sometimes called    
observation. For example, the interviewer should start  with a general question such as ‘Have you noticed any  changes in your body when you feel upset?’ and then go  on to enquire specifically about palpitations, dry mouth,  sweating, trembling, and the various other symptoms of  autonomic activity and muscle tension. Such features  may also be apparent during the interview. To detect  anxious thoughts, the interviewer can ask ‘What goes  mebo  
through your mind when you are feeling anxious?’  Possible replies include thoughts of fainting or losing  control. Many of these questions overlap with enquiries  about the history of the disorder. 

**Depersonalization and derealization**

blunting or flattening of affect (see page 5), should also  be noted. 

Normally, mood varies during an interview in paral lel with the topics that are being discussed. The patient  appears sad while talking about unhappy events, angry  while describing things that have irritated them, and so  on. When the mood is not suited to the context, it is  recorded as *incongruent*—for example, if the patient gig gles when describing the death of their mother. Before  concluding that such behaviour reflects an incongruous  mood, consider whether it could be a sign of embarrass ment or an effort to conceal distress.

These are usually symptoms of anxiety disorders, but  occasionally they are diagnosed as a separate disorder  (see page 656). Their importance in the mental state  examination is largely due to the fact that they are eas

them may say that they have done so because they  have misunderstood the questions. Try to obtain spe cific examples of the patient’s experiences. It is useful to  begin by asking ‘Do you ever feel that things around you  are unreal?’ and ‘Do you ever feel unreal or that part of  your body is unreal?’ Patients with derealization often

describe things in the environment as seeming artificial  and lifeless. Patients with depersonalization may say  that they feel detached, unable to feel emotion, or as if  they are acting a part. 

**Thoughts** 

In this section, any predominant *content* of the person’s  thoughts can first be noted. For example, there may be a  preoccupation with persecutory themes, negative or self 

**Delusions** 

A delusion cannot be asked about directly, because the  patient does not recognize it as differing from other  mebo  
beliefs. Because of the difficulty that this poses for the  interviewer, and the diagnostic significance of delusions,  these were described in detail in Chapter 1. 

The interviewer may be alerted to the possibility of  delusions by information from other people or by events  in the history. When searching for delusional ideas, it  

mebooksfree.com   
is useful to begin by asking what might be the reason    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
deprecating responses to questions, or a repeated return  of the conversation to diet and body shape. This infor mation may signify a delusional disorder, depression,  and an eating disorder, respectively, and indicate areas  for further questioning. However, the main purpose of  this section is to determine the *nature* of the patient’s  thoughts, and in particular to identify obsessions and  delusions. 

Thinking can also be abnormal in terms of the flow  of thoughts, and the links from one topic to another,  called *formal thought disorder*. This was introduced in  Chapter 1 (see page 15). 

**Obsessions** 

for other symptoms or unpleasant experiences that the  patient has described. For example, a patient who says  that life is no longer worth living may be convinced  that he is thoroughly evil and that his internal organs  are already rotting away. Some patients hide delusions  skilfully, and the interviewer needs to be alert to eva 

sions, changes of topic, or other hints that information  mebo  
is being withheld. However, once the delusion has been  uncovered, patients often elaborate on it without much  prompting. 

When ideas are revealed that could be delusional,  the interviewer needs to determine whether they meet  the criteria for a delusion (see page 9). First, ascertain    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
Obsessions were described on page 13\. An appropriate  question is ‘Do any thoughts keep coming into your  mind, even though you try hard to stop them?’ If the  patient says ‘Yes’, they should be asked for an example.  Patients may be ashamed of obsessional thoughts, espe 

cially those about violence or sexual themes, so per sistent but sympathetic questioning may be required.    
how strongly they are held. Achieving this without  antagonizing the patient requires patience and tact. The  patient should feel that they are having a fair hearing. If  the interviewer expresses contrary opinions to test the  strength of the patient’s beliefs, their manner should be  enquiring rather than argumentative. The next step is  to decide whether the beliefs are culturally determined  convictions rather than delusions. This judgement may    
Before recording thoughts as obsessional, the inter 

be difficult if the patient comes from a culture or reli   
mebo  
viewer should be certain that the patient accepts them  as their own (and not implanted by an outside agency). 

**Compulsions** 

Many obsessional thoughts are accompanied by com pulsive acts (see page 14). Some of these can be observed  

gious group whose attitudes and beliefs are not known to  the interviewer. In such cases any doubt can usually be  resolved by finding an informant from the same coun try or religion, and by asking this person whether others  from the same background share the patient’s beliefs.

directly (although rarely during the interview), but oth ers are private events (e.g. repeating phrases silently),  and are detected only because they interrupt the  patient’s conversation. Appropriate questions are ‘Do  you have to keep checking activities that you know you  have completed?’, ‘Do you have to do things over and  over again when most people would have done them  only once?’, and ‘Do you have to repeat exactly the same  action many times?’ If the patient answers ‘Yes’ to any of  these questions, the interviewer should ask for specific  examples.

Some types of delusion, which are characteristic  of schizophrenia and included in the list of *first rank  symptoms* (see page 255), present particular problems of  recognition: 

● *Delusions of thought broadcasting* must be distinguished  from the belief that other people can infer a person’s  thoughts from his expression or behaviour. When  mebo

viewer should ask how other people know this. (Some  patients answer ‘Yes’ when they mean that others can  infer their thoughts from their facial expression.)

**Auditory hallucinations** 

If the patient describes auditory hallucinations, certain  further questions are required depending on the type  mebo  
of experience, because of their diagnostic significance.  Has the patient heard a single voice or several? If there  were several voices, did they appear to talk to the patient  or to each other about the patient in the third person?  The latter experience must be distinguished from that of  hearing actual people talking and believing that they are  discussing the patient (an idea or delusion of reference).    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
feel that some outside force is trying to take control of  you?’ or ‘Do you ever feel that your actions are con trolled by some person or thing outside you?’ Some  patients misunderstand the question and answer ‘Yes’  when they mean that they have a religious or philo sophical conviction that man is controlled by God or  some other agency. Others think that the questions  refer to the experience of being ‘out of control’ dur ing extreme anxiety, while some say ‘Yes’ when in  fact they have experienced auditory hallucinations  commanding them to do things. Therefore positive  answers should be followed by further questions to  eliminate these possibilities. 

mebooksfree.com 

If the patient says that the voices are speaking to them,  the interviewer should find out what the voices say and,  if the words are experienced as commands, whether  the patient feels that they must be obeyed. Note down  examples of the words spoken by hallucinatory voices. 

**Visual hallucinations**   
mebo  
Visual hallucinations must be distinguished from vis ual illusions. Unless the hallucination is experienced  at the time of the interview, this distinction may be  difficult because it depends on the presence or absence  of a visual stimulus which has been misinterpreted.  Ascertaining whether there is an ‘as if’ quality to the    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
Finally, the reader is reminded of the various catego ries of delusion described in Chapter 1 (see page 10). The  interviewer should also distinguish between primary  and secondary delusions, and be alert for the (rare) expe riences of delusional perception and delusional mood.  These issues only need to be addressed when there is  already clear evidence of a psychosis, when they are use ful in distinguishing schizophrenia from other psychotic  disorders. 

**Perceptions** 

When asking about hallucinations, as with delusions,  enquiries should be made tactfully to avoid distressing  

image, or asking if it is seen ‘out there, or in your mind’s  eye’ may aid the distinction. The interviewer should  also distinguish hallucinations from dissociative expe riences. The latter are described by the patient as the  feeling of being in the presence of another person or  a spirit with whom they can converse. Such experi ences are reported by people with histrionic personal ity, although they are not confined to them, and are  mebo  
encouraged by some religious groups. They have little  diagnostic significance. 

**Cognitive function** 

Early on in the interview, any significant cognitive dif

the patient and to encourage them to elaborate on their  experiences without being ridiculed. Questions can be  introduced by saying ‘Some people find that, when  their nerves are upset, they have unusual experiences.’  This can be followed by enquiries about hearing sounds  or voices when no one else is within earshot. Whenever  the history makes it relevant, corresponding questions  should be asked about visual hallucinations and those  in other modalities. Conversely, in assessments where  there has been no previous evidence of psychosis at  all, it may be appropriate to omit assessment of them  altogether. 

ficulties will have already become apparent from the  patient’s interactions with the interviewer and their  responses to questions. If so, the assessment of cogni tive function should be brought forward, as the result  may lead the interviewer to curtail the rest of the inter view or to postpone it until an informant is available.  The Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein *et  al.*,  1975) is a widely used cognitive screen in the elderly or    
mebo  
where dementia or other organic disorder is suspected;  see Chapter  14 for discussion of cognitive assessment  in these contexts. Conversely, if the interview is near ing completion and no evidence or suspicion of any

difficulties with memory or attention has arisen, cogni tion can be assessed very briefly. 

**Orientation** 

This is assessed by asking about the patient’s awareness  of time, place, and person. Specific questions begin with  the day, month, and year. When assessing the replies,  remember that many healthy people do not know the  exact date and that, understandably, patients in hospital  may be uncertain about the day of the week or their pre 

by standardized psychological tests. Objective evidence of  memory impairment and its impact on normal activities  (e.g. shopping, dressing) is also essential. 

*Short-term memory* can be assessed by asking the  mebo  
patient to memorize a name and a simple address, to  repeat it immediately (to make sure that it has been reg istered correctly), and to retain it. The interview contin ues on other topics for 5 minutes before recall is tested.  A  healthy person of average intelligence should make  only minor errors. If recall is imperfect, memory can be

cise location. If the patient cannot answer these basic  questions correctly, they should be asked about their  own identity; this is preserved except in severe demen tia, dissociative disorders, or malingering. 

**Attention and concentration** 

While taking the history the interviewer should look out    
prompted (e.g. by saying ‘35, Juniper ...’ and the patient  may then recall ‘Street’). 

*Memory for recent events* can be assessed by asking  about news items from the last few days. 

*Remote memory* can be assessed by asking the patient  to recall personal events or well-known items of news  from former years. Personal items could be the birth  

for evidence of attention and concentration. In this way    
dates of children or the names of grandchildren (pro

sions. A  useful first test is ‘*serial sevens*’:  the patient is  asked to subtract 7 from 100 and then to keep subtract   
vided these are known to the interviewer), and news  items could be the names of well-known former polit ical leaders. Awareness of the sequence of events is as  

important as the recall of individual items. The reader is again referred to Chapter 14 for detailed  assessment of cognitive functioning.

ing 7 from the remainder until the resulting number  is less than 7.  The time taken to do this is recorded,  together with the number of errors. If poor performance  seems to be due to lack of skill in arithmetic, the patient  should be asked to do a simpler subtraction, or to state  the months of the year in reverse order. 

**Memory** 

While taking the history the interviewer should compare  the patient’s account of past events with those of any  other informants, and be alert for gaps or inconsistencies.  If memory is impaired, any evidence of confabulation (see  page 355\) should be noted. During the mental state exam   
mebooksfree.com 

**Insight** 

A note that merely records ‘insight present’ or ‘no  insight’ is of little value. Instead the interviewer should  enquire about the different aspects of insight discussed  on page 20\. This includes the patient’s appraisal of their  mebo  
difficulties and prospects, and whether they ascribe  them to illness or to some other cause (e.g. persecution).  If the patient recognizes that they are ill, do they think  that the illness is physical or mental, and do they think  that they need any treatment? If so, what are their views  on medication, psychotherapy, or admission, as appro 

priate? The interviewer should also find out whether    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
ination, tests are given of short-term, recent, and remote  memory. Since none of these is wholly satisfactory, the  results should be assessed alongside other information  about memory and, if there is any doubt, supplemented  

the patient thinks that stressful life experiences or their  own actions have played a part in causing their illness.  The patient’s views on these matters are a guide to their  likely collaboration with treatment. 

**Other components of psychiatric assessment**   
mebo  
Although the psychiatric history and mental state exam ination are the main parts of the psychiatric assessment,  several other elements may also be necessary as part of the  ‘work-up’ of a patient. This section does not cover more

**Physical examination** 

Physical examination provides three kinds of informa tion in the assessment. 

● It may reveal diagnostically useful signs (e.g. a goitre or  absent reflexes), and it is therefore particularly import ant in the diagnosis or exclusion of organic disorders  (see Chapter 14). Neurological (including cerebrovas cular) and endocrine systems most commonly require  detailed examination, although other systems should

biochemical screening may be needed—for example, if  there is a strong suspicion of a treatable organic disorder,  a familial dementia, or learning disability. There is no  one set of routine investigations that is applicable to  mebo  
every case although, by convention, routine blood tests  (full blood count, renal, liver, and thyroid function) are  usually carried out on admission to hospital. 

Investigations are discussed further in the chapters  on individual syndromes and drug treatments.

not be neglected. The reader should consult a relevant  textbook (e.g. Kaufman and Milstein, 2017) if instruc tion is required in these aspects of clinical practice. 

● Psychotropic drugs may produce physical side-effects,  which need to be identified or measured (e.g. hyper tension, parkinsonism, or a rash). 

● The patient’s general health, nutritional status, and    
**Psychological assessment** 

Clinical psychologists and psychological testing can  contribute to psychiatric assessment in several ways.  However, they are not required in most cases, and their  availability is increasingly limited in many settings. We  therefore only introduce the topic briefly here, illustrat

recently carried out an appropriate physical examin ation, and hence the latter is unnecessary for most  patients seen in outpatient clinic or the community.  In the case of inpatients, the psychiatrist is generally  responsible for their physical as well as their mental  health, and every newly admitted patient should have a    
memory, speed of processing, or tests that putatively  assess functioning of a particular part of the brain (Lezak  *et  al.*, 2012). Neuropsychological testing in psychiatry  is primarily used in the following areas (Adams and  Grant, 2009): 

● In learning disability, where IQ defines the severity of    
full physical examination. Whatever the circumstances,  

the condition. 

mebo  
the psychiatrist should decide what physical examin ation is relevant, and either carry it out themselves or  ensure that this is or has been done by another doc tor. Discussion with a neurologist or other physician is  appropriate if the initial examination reveals equivocal  or complex findings, or if a second opinion is sought. In  

● In dementia, where tests measure the severity and  domains of cognitive impairment. 

● If a decline in performance from premorbid abilities is  suspected. In this instance, a discrepancy may be seen  between verbal and performance IQ.

some cases, more detailed assessment of higher neuro logical functions is required, as in the neuropsychiatric  examination, which is summarized in Box 3.6. This may  be a prelude to formal neuropsychological or neuro logical assessment. 

**Laboratory and other**    
**investigations**   
● To monitor the progress of neuropsychological defi cits during the course of illness, by repeated adminis tration of tests. 

● To reveal deficits that may be subtle and neglected  clinically, but which may be functionally impor tant. For example, in schizophrenia there are per sistent impairments in specific domains of memory  and attention, and these predict poor outcome (see  

Chapter 11).   
mebo  
These vary according to the nature of the differen tial diagnosis, the treatments that are being given, the  patient’s general health, and the resources available. At  one extreme, no investigations may be necessary. At  the other, extensive brain imaging, genetic testing, and    
● If an organic cause of psychiatric disorder is suspected,  he profile of test results may suggest the location of  the lesion. However, this use of neuropsychologi cal testing to localize brain lesions has largely been  replaced by neuroimaging.

**Cognitive assessment** 

The term ‘cognitive’ is sometimes used interchange ably with the term ‘neuropsychological’. In the present

Observations and ratings of behaviour are useful in  everyday clinical practice, especially for inpatients.  When no ready-made rating scale is available, ad hoc  ratings can be devised. For example, a scale could be  devised for the nurses to show how much of the time  a patient with depression was active and occupied.  This could be a five-point scale, in which the criteria

Therefore it is important to seek full informa tion on this not only by questioning the patient but,  in appropriate cases, from additional sources, including  relatives and close acquaintances, previous medical and  social services records, and in certain cases the police.

components of a patient’s disorder—for example, in  a phobia, the elements of anticipatory anxiety, avoid ance, and coping strategies, and their relationship to  stimuli in the environment (e.g. heights), more general  circumstances (e.g. crowded places), or internal cues  (e.g. awareness of heart action). Behavioural assessment  is a necessary preliminary to behaviour therapy (see  page 683). 

**Personality assessment** 

In the past, detailed personality testing, including the  use of ‘projective’ tests such as the Rorschach test, was  often part of psychiatric assessment. These tests are  now rarely used in psychiatry, as they do not measure  mebooksfree.com 

Antisocial, impulsive, or irritable features in the person ality are a further risk factor. Social circumstances at the  time of any previous episodes of violence may reveal  provoking factors, and should be compared with the  patient’s current situation (see below). A parental history  of violence, social isolation, and a recent life crisis also  increase the risk. Among the illness factors, psychotic  mebo  
disorder and drug or alcohol misuse are important, and  the combination of psychosis, substance misuse, and  personality disorder is associated with the highest risk  of violence. 

The mental state factors in Box 3.7 require careful  consideration. Thoughts of violence to others are very  important, especially if they are concerned with a spe

aspects of personality that are most relevant to psy chiatric disorder, and they have not been shown to be  valid predictors of diagnosis or outcome. Instead, per sonality is assessed descriptively as part of the history  (described above), supplemented for research purposes  with schedules for diagnosing personality disorders (see  Chapter 15). 

**Risk assessment** 

Risk assessment is an essential part of psychiatric  assessment. Risk in this context refers to risk of harm  to others (through violence or neglect) and risk to self  

cific person to whom the patient has access. The entry  concerning suicidal ideas refers to the occasional kill ing, usually of family members, by a patient with severe  (usually psychotic) depression. Features of morbid jeal ousy and other delusional disorders may pose specific  risks of harm against a perceived aggressor or rival (see  page 307).   
mebo  
Situational factors are extremely important. Actual or  perceived confrontational behaviour towards the patient  by others may trigger violence, as may a return to situa tions in which violence has been expressed in the past.

Clinical experience and common sense have to be  used to combine the risk factors into an overall assess ment. Risk assessment schedules have been developed,  but they cannot replace thorough and repeated clinical  assessment (Fazel *et  al.*, 2011). The assessment of risk  should be shared among the members of the team treat ing the patient or, if the patient is in individual treat ment, it may need to be discussed with a colleague. In  certain circumstances the assessment may need to be  made known to an individual at risk. Risk assessments    
is very difficult, especially about the future.’ Even a  complete risk assessment provides only a weak guide to  future harm to others. Many such acts are carried out  by people with no past history of violence, and many  of those who have multiple risk factors will never com   
mebo  
mit further acts of violence (Szmukler, 2001; Fazel *et al.*,  2011c). 

**Assessment of needs** 

For patients with severe or enduring mental illness, par ticularly psychosis, it is important to focus on their needs    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
should be reviewed regularly, combining information  from the members of the clinical team. For further infor mation, see Mullen and Ogloff (2009). 

Although risk assessment is essential, and can be of  value in a number of respects (Abderhalden *et al.*, 2008),  it is also important to put it in context. First, the vast  majority of psychiatric patients pose no risk to others,  and are more likely to be the victims than the perpe 

trators of violence. The assumption that all patients  with severe mental illness, especially schizophrenia, are  potentially violent, is unwarranted and contributes to  the stigma that is attached to all psychiatric patients.  Secondly, as the physicist Niels Bohr said, ‘Prediction    
in the broadest sense (e.g. physical health, hygiene,  social isolation, domestic skills, etc.). The concern  arises from findings that such needs are often substan tial, and are neither well recognized nor met. Although  the conceptual status of needs is not as straightforward  as is often implied, interest in its measurement is well  established. The Camberwell Assessment of Need scale  mebo  
is widely used. This rates 22 domains as absent, present,  or modified, has versions for different age and patient  groups (e.g. those with learning disability), and is avail able in several languages (Phelan *et al.*, 1995).

**Chapter 3 Assessment** 

**Special kinds of psychiatric assessment** 

So far this chapter has been concerned with the com plete psychiatric assessment as carried out by psychiatrists  on patients who are being seen in a psychiatric setting,  and for whom sufficient time is available. However, most  assessments do not meet all of these criteria. Many are con ducted by non-specialists in non-psychiatric settings, with  limited time and imperfect surroundings. Nevertheless,

a well-focused interview can often yield a reliable  diagnosis and plan of action in a surprisingly short time.  This section considers how psychiatric assessment and  interviewing are modified in these circumstances.

on the key issues, and effective in leading to a provi sional diagnosis and a plan of immediate action. These  assessments generally involve acutely distressed or dis turbed patients, and often take place in difficult settings,  

**Interviews in general practice** 

In general practice, many presentations are with psy chiatric disorders, notably depression and anxiety dis   
mebo  
such as a police station or medical ward. The diagnoses  that are usually in question are the psychoses (schizo 

orders, as well as substance misuse and somatoform  disorders. Such cases commonly present with physical

phrenia, mania, drug-induced), and delirium and other  organic brain disorders. Throughout, the interviewer  should consider which questions need to be answered at  the time and which can be deferred. The most import 

ant issues are those that impact on immediate manage ment decisions. The latter are likely to include whether  the patient should be detained, whether laboratory  investigations are indicated, whether medication should  be given, and whether acute medical treatment is also  required. 

Because the assessment may be limited by the  patient’s ability or willingness to participate fully, seek  out all available information before commencing the  interview. For example, ask whoever is accompanying  

complaints (e.g. chronic pain, fatigue), and the doctor  needs to be aware of the possibility that the symptoms  reflect an underlying psychiatric disorder. The interplay  of physical and psychological factors is emphasized by  the finding that general practitioners who diagnose psy 

chiatric disorder accurately, as compared with a standard  assessment, have a good knowledge of general medicine  mebo  
(Goldberg and Huxley, 1980). Other patients present in  primary care with an explicit psychological complaint  (e.g. low mood, panic attacks). 

Whether the presentation is physical or psycho logical, it is a challenge to undertake an effective psy chiatric assessment, given the very limited time that is

the person what they know about the patient and the  recent events. The patient’s belongings may reveal evi dence of prior illness or medication. If the patient has  a past psychiatric history, strenuous efforts should be  made to obtain their case notes or to contact a profes sional involved in their care. The safety of the patient  and those around them must also be actively consid   
usually available. There are two components to achiev ing this goal. First, the chances of detecting psychiatric  disorder can be increased by attending to the way that  the interview is conducted—for example, by being alert  to cues in the patient’s history, appearance, and behav iour. Secondly, screening questions can be used that  detect the common disorders and identify areas that  may require more detailed assessment (see Table 3.1).

and emergency department or a medical ward (Segal and  Ranjith, 2016). In these situations, particular attention  again needs to be given to physical symptoms and the  possibility of somatoform disorder, and to the assess

in this setting. The questions in Table 3.1 are adapted  from Spitzer *et al.* (1994).

**Patient characteristics that may affect the interview** 

Interviews can prove difficult for a variety of reasons.  Many of these reflect the situation (e.g. noisy surround ings, lack of time) or interviewer characteristics (e.g.  inexperience, tiredness). However, other problems arise  from the characteristics of the patient, and these are  outlined here. Remember that such problems can be  diagnostically useful—for example, a patient may be  monosyllabic because of depression, and a disturbed  patient may have delirium. 

mebooksfree.com   
**Overactive patients** 

Some patients are so active and restless that systematic  questioning about their mental state is difficult. The    
mebo  
interviewer then has to limit their questions to a few that  seem particularly important, and concentrate on observ ing the patient’s behaviour. However, if the patient is  being seen in an emergency, some of their overactivity  may be a reaction to other people’s attempts to restrain  them. In such cases a quiet but confident approach by    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
**Anxious patients** 

Although anxiety may be part of the patient’s disorder,  it may also relate to the interview. If the person seems  unduly anxious, the interviewer can say that many peo ple feel anxious when they first take part in a psychi atric interview, and then go on to explore the patient’s  concerns. 

**Taciturn patients** 

Taciturn patients can be encouraged to speak more freely  if the interviewer shows non-verbal expressions of con   
the interviewer may calm the patient enough to allow  more adequate examination. 

**Confused patients** 

When the patient gives a history in a muddled way, or  appears perplexed, the interviewer should test cognitive  functions early in the interview. If there is evidence of    
mebo  
impaired cognition or consciousness, the interviewer  should try to orientate and reassure the patient, before  starting the interview again in a simplified form. In such  cases every effort should be made to interview another  informant.

cern (e.g. leaning forward a little in the chair with an  expression of interest), in addition to verbal expressions  that are part of any good interview. 

**Garrulous patients** 

It is not easy to curb an over-talkative patient. If efforts  to focus the interview are unsuccessful, the interviewer  should wait for a natural break in the flow of speech and  then explain that, because time is limited, they will need  to interrupt from time to time to help the patient to  keep focused on the issues that are important for plan 

ning treatment. If this proposal is made tactfully, most  garrulous patients will accept it. 

**Uncooperative or ‘difficult’**    
**patients** 

Some patients are reluctant to be interviewed and have  come at the insistence of a third party (e.g. their part ner). If the patient seems unwilling to collaborate, the  interviewer should talk over the circumstances of the  mebo  
referral, and try to persuade them that the interview will  be in their own interests. Remember that lack of cooper ation may occur because the patient does not realize that  they are ill (e.g. some patients with delirium, or with  psychosis). In such cases it may be necessary to inter view an informant before returning to the patient.

If the patient is mute or stuporous, it is essential to  interview an informant who can describe the onset and  course of the condition. With regard to the mental state,  the interviewer can only observe behaviour, but this can  be informative. Because some stuporous patients change  rapidly from inactivity to violent overactivity, it is wise  to have help available when seeing such a patient. 

Before deciding that a patient is mute, the inter viewer should allow adequate time for reply, and try sev eral topics. If the patient still fails to respond, attempt  to persuade them to communicate in writing. Apart  from observations of behaviour, the interviewer should  note whether the patient’s eyes are open or closed. If

Expectations and fears about treat ment may be based on knowledge of health services in  the country of origin. Behaviours that suggest illness in  one culture may be socially sanctioned ways of express ing distress in others (e.g. displays of extreme emotion).  Ideas about causation may differ, an extreme example  mebo  
being that distress may be ascribed to the actions of evil  spirits. It may be particularly difficult to decide whether  strongly held ideas are delusional or normal within the  culture or subculture. The influence of cultural differ

may be difficult to avoid closed questions, but if they are  used the answers should be checked. For example, if the  question ‘Are you sad?’ is answered ‘Yes’, the question  ‘Are you happy?’ should not be answered in the same  way.

The prognosis depends primarily on the disorder con cerned. It also depends on the individual characteris tics of the patient (e.g. their age, severity of symptoms,

comorbid conditions, etc.). Not all of this information  may be available after an initial assessment. However,  it is usually possible to make a cautious prediction  about the short-term outcome at this stage, and most  patients will expect and appreciate this. The patient can  be told that more accurate and longer-term prognostic

If the patient has children or other dependants, their  welfare must be taken into account. If necessary, more  information should be obtained, and a plan developed,  to ensure that this duty of care can be discharged. 

**Why has the disorder occurred?** 

Aetiology is discussed in Chapter  5\. Here we are con cerned with how aetiological factors are applied to the  individual patient. A useful approach is a chronological  one, with causes being divided into those that are *pre disposing, precipitating*, and *perpetuating*. Predisposing  factors may be genetic or related to temperament, or to  damage to the brain in early life. Precipitating factors  mebooksfree.com   
judgements will be possible as further information is  obtained, and the course of the disorder is followed over  subsequent weeks and months. 

**What other information is needed to answer  these questions?** 

For many patients, assessment is not complete after one  mebo  
interview. Assessment should be viewed as an iterative  process in which opinions and conclusions undergo  continuing review (both within the initial interview and  thereafter), as further information about the patient and  their illness is obtained. For descriptive purposes, this  chapter focuses on the diagnostic purpose of assessment,  but in practice there is no firm distinction between this

ing) factors may be continuing stressors or be related to  the way that the patient attempts to cope with stress ors (e.g. avoiding anxiety-provoking situations, misus ing alcohol). Perpetuating factors are highly relevant  to treatment. Intersecting this chronological approach  to causation, one can divide the causal factors into *bio*   
and the other goals of assessment (e.g. to assess risk,  or response to treatment). Each interaction between  the psychiatrist and the patient contains a mixture of  assessment, evaluation, review, and decision-making.  Assessment, and its revision, is a process that continues  throughout treatment and follow-up.

Anyone  new to psychiatry should follow this approach closely  until they have mastered the process and have a good  grounding of psychiatric knowledge.

Other mental health profes sionals may emphasize one or other of these factors to  a greater extent, depending on their background. For  example, psychologists focus on variation from the  norm, whereas social workers focus on the role of reac

**Recording and communicating information**

Having completed the assessment, it is necessary to  record and communicate your understanding of the  patient, their disorder, and its management. These  records and communications take a variety of forms  (e.g. written, verbal, electronic), and differ according to  their source, purpose, and intended recipients. As with  assessment itself, it is helpful to learn the ‘traditional’  and relatively detailed formats for communicating  information (e.g. case summaries and formulations),  while also appreciating that in practice many other— and briefer—modes of communication are the norm.  Regardless of format, all communications should follow  certain basic principles. 

e.com   
● Information should be presented clearly and con cisely. Include important negatives (e.g. ‘He is not sui cidal’). Avoid repetition of information that is already  known to the recipient. Use subheadings to highlight  key points (e.g. ‘Diagnosis:  .  ...’, ‘Current medica tion: . ...’, ‘Acute risks: . ...’). 

● In many countries, patients are entitled to read what  is written about them. This information may also be    
mebo  
used for legal purposes. In some countries, including  the UK, it is now expected that patients are copied  into all correspondence between doctors that con cerns them, unless there is a compelling reason not  to do so or unless they decline the offer. Ensure that  all information is accurate, and that any opinions

or inferences you make are reasonable, and avoid  unwarranted or unnecessarily personal comments.  It is sometimes better to communicate verbally with  the doctor or other health professional to expand on  some details of the case. 

● All communications should be kept confidential.

When discussing the conclusions from your assessment  with the patient, and with their relatives, it may be use ful to begin by briefly summarizing the key points for  them.

with the patient, and sets the scene for discussion about  the diagnosis and how you propose to proceed. When introducing the diagnosis, do not use medical  terms without explaining them. The patient may misun derstand their meaning or make incorrect assumptions  about their implications. Explain the significance of the  diagnosis in terms of cause, prognosis, and treatment  options—and any diagnostic uncertainty that remains. When discussing the proposed plan of manage ment, it is useful to begin by asking what treatment  the patient has been expecting, and whether they have  strong views—for example, with regard to the use of  medication. Whether drug treatment or psychological  treatment is planned, there are several relevant issues to

raise and discuss (see Chapters 24 and 25). It is import ant to set aside enough time for this explanation dur ing the interview, as it is likely to improve concordance  with the treatment plan. If, after they have been given a  full explanation, the patient refuses to accept part of the  plan, the interviewer should document this, and try to  negotiate an acceptable alternative. 

Box 3.9 summarizes the points that should be con sidered when communicating with patients and their  relatives. In the NHS in the UK, this information will  usually be recorded on a pro forma as part of the Care  Programme Approach (CPA) for any patients who  require either prolonged or complex secondary care (see  Chapter 26).

a serious untoward incident, after a complaint has been  made, or in court, he or she will be greatly assisted by  notes which are comprehensive but concise, well organ

**Admission notes**   
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
When a patient is admitted to hospital urgently, the doc tor often has only limited time available. The admission  note should contain at least the following: 

● The reasons for admission. 

● Any information that is required for a decision about  provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment. This  may include a physical examination and laboratory  investigations. 

● Any other relevant information that will not be avail able later, such as details of the mental state on admis sion (and prior to medication), and information from  any informant who may not be available again.   
formal discussions between members of the team. 

**Discharge notes** 

It is particularly important to set out clearly the plans  made for the patient’s further care on discharge from  hospital, including the identity of the key worker, and  how the patient or their carer can contact the team in    
mebo  
an emergency. These arrangements are formalized in  the UK in the CPA (see above and Chapter 26), in part  because it is recognized that the days after discharge are  a particularly high-risk period for suicide. A phone call  to the patient’s general practitioner is desirable if there  are any acute concerns about the patient’s welfare, or if    
mebooksfree.com

If there is time, a systematic history can be added.  However, inexperienced interviewers sometimes spend  too much time on details that are not essential to the  immediate decisions, while failing to record details of  the mental state that may be transitory and yet of great  importance in diagnosis. The rest of the assessment can  always be completed over the next few days. The admis 

sion note should end with a brief plan of immediate  management, which has been agreed with the senior  nurses caring for the patient at the time. 

**Continuation (progress) notes**

there is any delay anticipated in production of the dis charge letter or case summary. A statement of the diag nosis at the time of discharge is also important, since it  may have changed since admission. 

**Case summaries** 

mebo  
Case summaries are generally used for inpatients, but  they are valuable for all patients with complex, long standing, or recurrent disorders. In the inpatient set ting they are ideally written in two parts, the first part  being written soon after admission, to record the initial  presentation, and the second part being written at dis charge, filling in the subsequent progress. In practice,    
mebooksfree.com   
mebooksfree.com   
Continuation notes for both inpatients and patients  in the community need to be succinct, clear, and regu larly updated, and to contain specific information if  they are to be of value. Instead of recording merely that  the patient feels better or is behaving more normally,  record in what ways they feel better (e.g. less preoccu pied with thoughts of suicide). The notes should also  record treatments, including both medication and other  interventions, accompanied by a brief explanation of  the rationale for the treatment, and the temporal rela tionship between a change in treatment (e.g. dose of  drug) and change in clinical state. A  note should be  

however, a single summary covering all of the salient  aspects of the case is often produced, not least since  inpatient stays are generally much shorter than was the  case in the past. 

Summaries should be brief but comprehensive,  written in telegraphic style using a standard format,  

to help other people to find particular items of infor mebo

**Opening statement** 

Mrs AB is a 34-year-old married woman with a 3-month  history of worsening depression, now with psychotic fea tures. Admitted following serious suicide attempt. 

**Differential diagnosis** 

Recurrent depressive disorder (current episode:  psy chotic). For: subjective and objective low mood, anhe donia, anergia, poor concentration, early-morning  waking, loss of appetite and libido, self-blame. Suicidal.  Delusional belief that she caused her son’s epilepsy. Past  history of depressive episode. Against: none, unless cur rent depressive episode is better explained by one of the  

depressive disorder, current episode severe with psy chotic symptoms. 

**Aetiology** 

Predisposing: genetic—family history of mood disorder.  Death of mother when aged 4. Unhappy childhood and  not close to father. Personality traits. Previous depressive  episode. 

Precipitating: discovery of husband’s infidelity. Perpetuating: ongoing marital arguments, worry  about debts.

Bipolar disorder (current episode: depressive). For: depres sive symptoms as listed above; longstanding mood vari ability, family history of bipolar disorder. Against: no  evidence of past clinically significant mood elevation, nor  

current hypomanic or mixed affective symptoms. Organic mood disorder. For: history of hypothyroidism.  Against: no current symptoms or signs of hypothyroidism  (or other abnormalities on physical exam); TSH normal. Schizophrenia.

Joint interviews  with the patient and her husband may help to reduce the  marital problems. Suggest sources of financial advice to  reduce this stressor. 

**Prognosis** 

Mrs AB has a good chance of a full therapeutic response  to the planned treatment plan, especially if the mari tal problems can be improved. However, given her his tory and the predisposing factors noted above, she is at  increased risk of further depressive episodes, particularly  at times of stress.

A problem list is useful in cases where there are mul tiple issues to be addressed, especially complex social  mebo  
problems. The list identifies the range of problems (or  needs), summarizes the solution(s) proposed, states who  is responsible for each action, and gives a review date. It  is best to draw up the list with the patient, to ensure that  they are fully involved in the identification of problems  and in how these will be addressed. This is formalized in

sis, aetiology, treatment, and prognosis (see Box 3.11).  Although now uncommon in clinical practice, formula tions are extremely useful for developing skills in diag nostic reasoning, for understanding how psychiatric  knowledge can be applied to the individual patient, and  for learning how to prioritize and focus on the problems  that require attention. We therefore encourage all psy   
problem-solving counselling (see page 685). Table 3.2 shows a problem list that might be drawn  up following the initial assessment of a man who had  taken a serious overdose and was found to have anxi ety symptoms, psoriasis, and social problems, including  concerns about how he and his partner were caring for  their son. As progress is made in dealing with problems  in this list, new ones may be added or existing ones

of probability, together with a note of the evidence for  and against each alternative. To produce a good differen tial diagnosis, it is necessary to have elicited and inter preted the key symptoms and signs (see Chapter 1) and  to know the cardinal features of the major psychiatric  disorders and how they are classified (see Chapter  2).  Under aetiology, predisposing, precipitating, and per petuating, causes should be identified. This requires a  grounding in the causation of psychiatric disorders (see  Chapter 5). There follows a list of outstanding problems  and any further information that is needed. Next a con cise plan of management is outlined, and finally there is  a statement about prognosis.

That is, keep let ters concise, focusing only on those issues that have  changed since the last letter (e.g. symptoms, circum stances, treatments, and what is expected of the general  practitioner). It is also helpful to highlight at the top  of the letter the diagnosis, current state, current treat ments (especially drugs and doses), and date of the next  appointment.

Psychiatrists need to be aware of the  policies and procedures regarding electronic records and  ‘digital health’ in their own clinical setting, and to keep  up to date with the rapid and significant developments  that will undoubtedly occur in the coming years (Glenn  and Monteith, 2014).

documents should be prepared with this in mind. 

**Standardized assessment methods** 

In research, and sometimes in clinical practice, it is  helpful to use standardized methods to assess symp toms and syndromes, as well as disabilities and other  consequences of psychiatric disorders. Such methods  improve reliability and facilitate comparison of find ings across time and between psychiatrists. For a review  of rating scales in psychiatry, see Tyrer and Methuen

**Present State Examination and Schedules  for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry** The Present State Examination (PSE) is the archetypal  interview schedule for use by trained psychiatrists. Its  development began in the late 1950s, and the ninth edi tion was the first to be published for use by others (Wing  *et al.*, 1974). It became widely used, notably in seminal  international studies on the diagnosis of schizophrenia  (see Chapter  11). The interviewer identifies abnormal

phenomena that have been present during a specified  period of time and rates their severity. Each of the 140  items is defined in detail in a glossary.

This chapter is concerned with the ways in which general  ethical principles, relating to matters such as confidenti ality, consent, and autonomy, are applied in the care of  people with mental disorders. We assume that the reader  has already studied ethical aspects of general medicine,  otherwise they should consult Hope *et  al.* (2008) or a  comparable textbook of medical ethics (Beauchamp and    
In this chapter we also consider some aspects of the  Mental Health Act and the law relevant to psychiatry.  These aspects are necessarily general ones because the  specific provisions of the law differ from one country to  another. It is important that the reader makes themself  familiar with legal provisions in their own country and,  if in any doubt, always seek expert advice.

Ethical considerations are important in all branches  of medicine. However, in psychiatry they have add itional importance because some patients lack the cap acity to make judgements about their own need for care,
