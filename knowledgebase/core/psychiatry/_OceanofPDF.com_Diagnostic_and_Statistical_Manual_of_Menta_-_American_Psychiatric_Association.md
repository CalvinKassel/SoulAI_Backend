Preface The American Psychiatric

Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM) is a classification of mental disorders with associated criteria
designed to facilitate more reliable diagnoses of these disorders. With
successive editions over the past 60 years, it has become a standard
reference for clinical practice in the mental health field. Since a
complete description of the underlying pathological processes is not
possible for most mental disorders, it is important to emphasize that
the current diagnostic criteria are the best available description of
how mental disorders are expressed and can be recognized by trained
clinicians. DSM is intended to serve as a practical, functional, and
flexible guide for organizing information that can aid in the accurate
diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. It is a tool for
clinicians, an essential educational resource for students and
practitioners, and a reference for researchers in the field. Although
this edition of DSM was designed first and foremost to be a useful guide
to clinical practice, as an official nomenclature it must be applicable
in a wide diversity of contexts. DSM has been used by clinicians and
researchers from different orientations (biological, psychodynamic,
cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, family/systems), all of whom
strive for a common language to communicate the essential
characteristics of mental disorders presented by their patients. The
information is of value to all professionals associated with various
aspects of mental health care, including psychiatrists, other
physicians, psychologists, social workers, nurses, counselors, forensic
and legal specialists, occupational and rehabilitation therapists, and
other health professionals. The criteria are concise and explicit and
intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations
in a variety of clinical settings---inpatient, outpatient, partial
hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary
care---as well in general community epidemiological studies of mental
disorders. DSM-5 is also a tool for collecting and communicating
accurate public health statistics on mental disorder morbidity and
mortality rates. Finally, the criteria and corresponding text serve as a
textbook for

students early in their profession who need a structured way to
understand and diagnose mental disorders as well as for seasoned
professionals encountering rare disorders for the first time.
Fortunately, all of these uses are mutually compatible. These diverse
needs and interests were taken into consideration in planning DSM-5. The
classification of disorders is harmonized with the World Health
Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD), the
official coding system used in the United States, so that the DSM
criteria define disorders identified by ICD diagnostic names and code
numbers. In DSM-5, both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes (the latter
scheduled for adoption in October 2015) are attached to the relevant
disorders in the classification. Although DSM-5 remains a categorical
classification of separate disorders, we recognize that mental disorders
do not always fit completely within the boundaries of a single disorder.
Some symptom domains, such as depression and anxiety, involve multiple
diagnostic categories and may reflect common underlying vulnerabilities
for a larger group of disorders. In recognition of this reality, the
disorders included in DSM-5 were reordered into a revised organizational
structure meant to stimulate new clinical perspectives. This new
structure corresponds with the organizational arrangement of disorders
planned for ICD-11 scheduled for release in 2015. Other enhancements
have been introduced to promote ease of use across all settings:
Representation of developmental issues related to diagnosis. The change
in chapter organization better reflects a lifespan approach, with
disorders more frequently diagnosed in childhood (e.g.,
neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the manual and
disorders more applicable to older adulthood (e.g., neurocognitive
disorders) at the end of the manual. Also, within the text, subheadings
on development and course provide descriptions of how disorder
presentations may change across the lifespan. Age-related factors
specific to diagnosis (e.g., symptom presentation and prevalence
differences in certain age groups) are also included in the text. For
added emphasis, these age-related factors have been added to the
criteria themselves where applicable (e.g., in the criteria sets for
insomnia disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, specific criteria

describe how symptoms might be expressed in children). Likewise, gender
and cultural issues have been integrated into the disorders where
applicable. Integration of scientific findings from the latest research
in genetics and neuroimaging. The revised chapter structure was informed
by recent research in neuroscience and by emerging genetic linkages
between diagnostic groups. Genetic and physiological risk factors,
prognostic indicators, and some putative diagnostic markers are
highlighted in the text. This new structure should improve clinicians'
ability to identify diagnoses in a disorder spectrum based on common
neurocircuitry, genetic vulnerability, and environmental exposures.
Consolidation of autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and pervasive
developmental disorder into autism spectrum disorder. Symptoms of these
disorders represent a single continuum of mild to severe impairments in
the two domains of social communication and restrictive repetitive
behaviors/interests rather than being distinct disorders. This change is
designed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria for
the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and to identify more focused
treatment targets for the specific impairments identified. Streamlined
classification of bipolar and depressive disorders. Bipolar and
depressive disorders are the most commonly diagnosed conditions in
psychiatry. It was therefore important to streamline the presentation of
these disorders to enhance both clinical and educational use. Rather
than separating the definition of manic, hypomanic, and major depressive
episodes from the definition of bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder,
and major depressive disorder as in the previous edition, we included
all of the component criteria within the respective criteria for each
disorder. This approach will facilitate bedside diagnosis and treatment
of these important disorders. Likewise, the explanatory notes for
differentiating bereavement and major depressive disorders will provide
far greater clinical guidance than was previously provided in the simple
bereavement exclusion criterion. The new specifiers of anxious

distress and mixed features are now fully described in the narrative on
specifier variations that accompanies the criteria for these disorders.
Restructuring of substance use disorders for consistency and clarity.
The categories of substance abuse and substance dependence have been
eliminated and replaced with an overarching new category of substance
use disorders---with the specific substance used defining the specific
disorders. "Dependence" has been easily confused with the term
"addiction" when, in fact, the tolerance and withdrawal that previously
defined dependence are actually very normal responses to prescribed
medications that affect the central nervous system and do not
necessarily indicate the presence of an addiction. By revising and
clarifying these criteria in DSM-5, we hope to alleviate some of the
widespread misunderstanding about these issues. Enhanced specificity for
major and mild neurocognitive disorders. Given the explosion in
neuroscience, neuropsychology, and brain imaging over the past 20 years,
it was critical to convey the current state-of-the-art in the diagnosis
of specific types of disorders that were previously referred to as the
"dementias" or organic brain diseases. Biological markers identified by
imaging for vascular and traumatic brain disorders and specific
molecular genetic findings for rare variants of Alzheimer's disease and
Huntington's disease have greatly advanced clinical diagnoses, and these
disorders and others have now been separated into specific subtypes.
Transition in conceptualizing personality disorders. Although the
benefits of a more dimensional approach to personality disorders have
been identified in previous editions, the transition from a categorical
diagnostic system of individual disorders to one based on the relative
distribution of personality traits has not been widely accepted. In
DSM-5, the categorical personality disorders are virtually unchanged
from the previous edition. However, an alternative "hybrid" model has
been proposed in Section III to guide future research that separates
interpersonal functioning assessments and the expression of pathological
personality traits for six specific disorders. A more dimensional
profile of personality trait expression is also proposed for a
trait-specified approach.

Section III: new disorders and features. A new section (Section III) has
been added to highlight disorders that require further study but are not
sufficiently well established to be a part of the official
classification of mental disorders for routine clinical use. Dimensional
measures of symptom severity in 13 symptom domains have also been
incorporated to allow for the measurement of symptom levels of varying
severity across all diagnostic groups. Likewise, the WHO Disability
Assessment Schedule (WHODAS), a standard method for assessing global
disability levels for mental disorders that is based on the
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)
and is applicable in all of medicine, has been provided to replace the
more limited Global Assessment of Functioning scale. It is our hope that
as these measures are implemented over time, they will provide greater
accuracy and flexibility in the clinical description of individual
symptomatic presentations and associated disability during diagnostic
assessments. Online enhancements. DSM-5 features online supplemental
information. Additional cross-cutting and diagnostic severity measures
are available online (www.psychiatry.org/dsm5), linked to the relevant
disorders. In addition, the Cultural Formulation Interview, Cultural
Formulation Interview---Informant Version, and supplementary modules to
the core Cultural Formulation Interview are also included online at
www.psychiatry.org/dsm5. These innovations were designed by the leading
authorities on mental disorders in the world and were implemented on the
basis of their expert review, public commentary, and independent peer
review. The 13 work groups, under the direction of the DSM-5 Task Force,
in conjunction with other review bodies and, eventually, the APA Board
of Trustees, collectively represent the global expertise of the
specialty. This effort was supported by an extensive base of advisors
and by the professional staff of the APA Division of Research; the names
of everyone involved are too numerous to mention here but are listed in
the Appendix. We owe tremendous thanks to those who devoted countless
hours and invaluable expertise to this effort to improve the diagnosis
of mental disorders.

We would especially like to acknowledge the chairs, text coordinators,
and members of the 13 work groups, listed in the front of the manual,
who spent many hours in this volunteer effort to improve the scientific
basis of clinical practice over a sustained 6-year period. Susan K.
Schultz, M.D., who served as text editor, worked tirelessly with Emily
A. Kuhl, Ph.D., senior science writer and DSM-5 staff text editor, to
coordinate the efforts of the work groups into a cohesive whole. William
E. Narrow, M.D., M.P.H., led the research group that developed the
overall research strategy for DSM-5, including the field trials, that
greatly enhanced the evidence base for this revision. In addition, we
are grateful to those who contributed so much time to the independent
review of the revision proposals, including Kenneth S. Kendler, M.D.,
and Robert Freedman, M.D., co-chairs of the Scientific Review Committee;
John S. McIntyre, M.D., and Joel Yager, M.D., co-chairs of the Clinical
and Public Health Committee; and Glenn Martin, M.D., chair of the APA
Assembly review process. Special thanks go to Helena C. Kraemer, Ph.D.,
for her expert statistical consultation; Michael B. First, M.D., for his
valuable input on the coding and review of criteria; and Paul S.
Appelbaum, M.D., for feedback on forensic issues. Maria N. Ward, M.Ed.,
RHIT, CCS-P, also helped in verifying all ICD coding. The Summit Group,
which included these consultants, the chairs of all review groups, the
task force chairs, and the APA executive officers, chaired by Dilip V.
Jeste, M.D., provided leadership and vision in helping to achieve
compromise and consensus. This level of commitment has contributed to
the balance and objectivity that we feel are hallmarks of DSM-5. We
especially wish to recognize the outstanding APA Division of Research
staff---identified in the Task Force and Work Group listing at the front
of this manual---who worked tirelessly to interact with the task force,
work groups, advisors, and reviewers to resolve issues, serve as
liaisons between the groups, direct and manage the academic and routine
clinical practice field trials, and record decisions in this important
process. In particular, we appreciate the support and guidance provided
by James H. Scully Jr., M.D., Medical Director and CEO of the APA,
through the years and travails of the development process. Finally, we
thank the editorial and production staff of American Psychiatric
Publishing---specifically, Rebecca Rinehart, Publisher; John McDuffie,
Editorial Director; Ann Eng, Senior Editor; Greg Kuny, Managing Editor;
and Tammy Cordova, Graphics

Design Manager---for their guidance in bringing this all together and
creating the final product. It is the culmination of efforts of many
talented individuals who dedicated their time, expertise, and passion
that made DSM-5 possible. David J. Kupfer, M.D. DSM-5 Task Force Chair

SECTION I DSM-5 Basics Introduction Use of the Manual Cautionary
Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5

This section is a basic orientation to the purpose, structure, content,
and use of DSM-5. It is not intended to provide an exhaustive account of
the evolution of DSM-5, but rather to give readers a succinct overview
of its key elements. The introductory section describes the public,
professional, and expert review process that was used to extensively
evaluate the diagnostic criteria presented in Section II. A summary of
the DSM-5 structure, harmonization with ICD-11, and the transition to a
nonaxial system with a new approach to assessing disability is also
presented. "Use of the Manual" includes "Definition of a Mental
Disorder," forensic considerations, and a brief overview of the
diagnostic process and use of coding and recording procedures.

Introduction The creation of the fifth edition of Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) was a massive undertaking
that involved hundreds of people working toward a common goal over a
12-year process. Much thought and deliberation were involved in
evaluating the diagnostic criteria, considering the organization of
every aspect of the manual, and creating new features believed to be
most useful to clinicians. All of these efforts were directed toward the
goal of enhancing the clinical usefulness of DSM-5 as a guide in the
diagnosis of mental disorders. Reliable diagnoses are essential for
guiding treatment recommendations, identifying prevalence rates for
mental health service planning, identifying patient groups for clinical
and basic research, and documenting important public health information
such as morbidity and mortality rates. As the understanding of mental
disorders and their treatments has evolved, medical, scientific, and
clinical professionals have focused on the characteristics of specific
disorders and their implications for treatment and research. While DSM
has been the cornerstone of substantial progress in reliability, it has
been well recognized by both the American Psychiatric Association (APA)
and the broad scientific community working on mental disorders that past
science was not mature enough to yield fully validated diagnoses---that
is, to provide consistent, strong, and objective scientific validators
of individual DSM disorders. The science of mental disorders continues
to evolve. However, the last two decades since DSM-IV was released have
seen real and durable progress in such areas as cognitive neuroscience,
brain imaging, epidemiology, and genetics. The DSM-5 Task Force
overseeing the new edition recognized that research advances will
require careful, iterative changes if DSM is to maintain its place as
the touchstone classification of mental disorders. Finding the right
balance is critical. Speculative results do not belong in an official
nosology, but at the same time, DSM must evolve in the context of other
clinical research initiatives in the field. One important aspect of this
transition derives from the broad recognition that a too-rigid
categorical system does not capture clinical

experience or important scientific observations. The results of numerous
studies of comorbidity and disease transmission in families, including
twin studies and molecular genetic studies, make strong arguments for
what many astute clinicians have long observed: the boundaries between
many disorder "categories" are more fluid over the life course than
DSM-IV recognized, and many symptoms assigned to a single disorder may
occur, at varying levels of severity, in many other disorders. These
findings mean that DSM, like other medical disease classifications,
should accommodate ways to introduce dimensional approaches to mental
disorders, including dimensions that cut across current categories. Such
an approach should permit a more accurate description of patient
presentations and increase the validity of a diagnosis (i.e., the degree
to which diagnostic criteria reflect the comprehensive manifestation of
an underlying psychopathological disorder). DSM-5 is designed to better
fill the need of clinicians, patients, families, and researchers for a
clear and concise description of each mental disorder organized by
explicit diagnostic criteria, supplemented, when appropriate, by
dimensional measures that cross diagnostic boundaries, and a brief
digest of information about the diagnosis, risk factors, associated
features, research advances, and various expressions of the disorder.
Clinical training and experience are needed to use DSM for determining a
diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria identify symptoms, behaviors,
cognitive functions, personality traits, physical signs, syndrome
combinations, and durations that require clinical expertise to
differentiate from normal life variation and transient responses to
stress. To facilitate a thorough examination of the range of symptoms
present, DSM can serve clinicians as a guide to identify the most
prominent symptoms that should be assessed when diagnosing a disorder.
Although some mental disorders may have well-defined boundaries around
symptom clusters, scientific evidence now places many, if not most,
disorders on a spectrum with closely related disorders that have shared
symptoms, shared genetic and environmental risk factors, and possibly
shared neural substrates (perhaps most strongly established for a subset
of anxiety disorders by neuroimaging and animal models). In short, we
have come to recognize that the boundaries between disorders are more
porous than originally perceived. Many health profession and educational
groups have been involved in the development and testing of DSM-5,
including physicians, psychologists, social workers, nurses, counselors,
epidemiologists, statisticians,

neuroscientists, and neuropsychologists. Finally, patients, families,
lawyers, consumer organizations, and advocacy groups have all
participated in revising DSM-5 by providing feedback on the mental
disorders described in this volume. Their monitoring of the descriptions
and explanatory text is essential to improve understanding, reduce
stigma, and advance the treatment and eventual cures for these
conditions.

A Brief History The APA first published a predecessor of DSM in 1844, as
a statistical classification of institutionalized mental patients. It
was designed to improve communication about the types of patients cared
for in these hospitals. This forerunner to DSM also was used as a
component of the full U.S. census. After World War II, DSM evolved
through four major editions into a diagnostic classification system for
psychiatrists, other physicians, and other mental health professionals
that described the essential features of the full range of mental
disorders. The current edition, DSM-5, builds on the goal of its
predecessors (most recently, DSM-IV-TR, or Text Revision, published in
2000) of providing guidelines for diagnoses that can inform treatment
and management decisions.

DSM-5 Revision Process In 1999, the APA launched an evaluation of the
strengths and weaknesses of DSM based on emerging research that did not
support the boundaries established for some mental disorders. This
effort was coordinated with the World Health Organization (WHO) Division
of Mental Health, the World Psychiatric Association, and the National
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in the form of several conferences,
the proceedings of which were published in 2002 in a monograph entitled
A Research Agenda for DSM-V. Thereafter, from 2003 to 2008, a
cooperative agreement with the APA and the WHO was supported by the
NIMH, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National
Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) to convene 13
international DSM-5 research planning conferences, involving 400
participants from 39 countries, to review the world literature in
specific diagnostic areas to prepare for revisions in developing both
DSM-5 and the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision
(ICD-11). Reports from these conferences formed the basis

for future DSM-5 Task Force reviews and set the stage for the new
edition of DSM. In 2006, the APA named David J. Kupfer, M.D., as Chair
and Darrel A. Regier, M.D., M.P.H., as Vice-Chair of the DSM-5 Task
Force. They were charged with recommending chairs for the 13 diagnostic
work groups and additional task force members with a multidisciplinary
range of expertise who would oversee the development of DSM-5. An
additional vetting process was initiated by the APA Board of Trustees to
disclose sources of income and thus avoid conflicts of interest by task
force and work group members. The full disclosure of all income and
research grants from commercial sources, including the pharmaceutical
industry, in the previous 3 years, the imposition of an income cap from
all commercial sources, and the publication of disclosures on a Web site
set a new standard for the field. Thereafter, the task force of 28
members was approved in 2007, and appointments of more than 130 work
group members were approved in 2008. More than 400 additional work group
advisors with no voting authority were also approved to participate in
the process. A clear concept of the next evolutionary stage for the
classification of mental disorders was central to the efforts of the
task force and the work groups. This vision emerged as the task force
and work groups recounted the history of DSMIV's classification, its
current strengths and limitations, and strategic directions for its
revision. An intensive 6-year process involved conducting literature
reviews and secondary analyses, publishing research reports in
scientific journals, developing draft diagnostic criteria, posting
preliminary drafts on the DSM-5 Web site for public comment, presenting
preliminary findings at professional meetings, performing field trials,
and revising criteria and text.

Proposals for Revisions Proposals for the revision of DSM-5 diagnostic
criteria were developed by members of the work groups on the basis of
rationale, scope of change, expected impact on clinical management and
public health, strength of the supporting research evidence, overall
clarity, and clinical utility. Proposals encompassed changes to
diagnostic criteria; the addition of new disorders, subtypes, and
specifiers; and the deletion of existing disorders. In the proposals for
revisions, strengths and weaknesses in the current criteria and nosology
were first identified. Novel scientific findings over the

previous two decades were considered, leading to the creation of a
research plan to assess potential changes through literature reviews and
secondary data analyses. Four principles guided the draft revisions: 1)
DSM-5 is primarily intended to be a manual to be used by clinicians, and
revisions must be feasible for routine clinical practice; 2)
recommendations for revisions should be guided by research evidence; 3)
where possible, continuity should be maintained with previous editions
of DSM; and 4) no a priori constraints should be placed on the degree of
change between DSMIV and DSM-5. Building on the initial literature
reviews, work groups identified key issues within their diagnostic
areas. Work groups also examined broader methodological concerns, such
as the presence of contradictory findings within the literature;
development of a refined definition of mental disorder; cross-cutting
issues relevant to all disorders; and the revision of disorders
categorized in DSM-IV as "not otherwise specified." Inclusion of a
proposal for revision in Section II was informed by consideration of its
advantages and disadvantages for public health and clinical utility, the
strength of the evidence, and the magnitude of the change. New diagnoses
and disorder subtypes and specifiers were subject to additional
stipulations, such as demonstration of reliability (i.e., the degree to
which two clinicians could independently arrive at the same diagnosis
for a given patient). Disorders with low clinical utility and weak
validity were considered for deletion. Placement of conditions in
"Conditions for Further Study" in Section III was contingent on the
amount of empirical evidence generated on the diagnosis, diagnostic
reliability or validity, presence of clear clinical need, and potential
benefit in advancing research.

DSM-5 Field Trials The use of field trials to empirically demonstrate
reliability was a noteworthy improvement introduced in DSM-III. The
design and implementation strategy of the DSM-5 Field Trials represent
several changes over approaches used for DSM-III and DSM-IV,
particularly in obtaining data on the precision of kappa reliability
estimates (a statistical measure that assesses level of agreement
between raters that corrects for chance agreement due to prevalence
rates) in the context of clinical settings with high levels of
diagnostic comorbidity. For DSM-5, field trials were extended by using
two distinctive designs: one in large, diverse medical-

academic settings, and the other in routine clinical practices. The
former capitalized on the need for large sample sizes to test hypotheses
on reliability and clinical utility of a range of diagnoses in a variety
of patient populations; the latter supplied valuable information about
how proposed revisions performed in everyday clinical settings among a
diverse sample of DSM users. It is anticipated that future clinical and
basic research studies will focus on the validity of the revised
categorical diagnostic criteria and the underlying dimensional features
of these disorders (including those now being explored by the NIMH
Research Domain Criteria initiative). The medical-academic field trials
were conducted at 11 North American medical-academic sites and assessed
the reliability, feasibility, and clinical utility of select revisions,
with priority given to those that represented the greatest degree of
change from DSM-IV or those potentially having the greatest public
health impact. The full clinical patient populations coming to each site
were screened for DSM-IV diagnoses or qualifying symptoms likely to
predict several specific DSM-5 disorders of interest. Stratified samples
of four to seven specific disorders, plus a stratum containing a
representative sample of all other diagnoses, were identified for each
site. Patients consented to the study and were randomly assigned for a
clinical interview by a clinician blind to the diagnosis, followed by a
second interview with a clinician blind to previous diagnoses. Patients
first filled out a computer-assisted inventory of cross-cutting symptoms
in more than a dozen psychological domains. These inventories were
scored by a central server, and results were provided to clinicians
before they conducted a typical clinical interview (with no structured
protocol). Clinicians were required to score the presence of qualifying
criteria on a computer-assisted DSM-5 diagnostic checklist, determine
diagnoses, score the severity of the diagnosis, and submit all data to
the central Web-based server. This study design allowed the calculation
of the degree to which two independent clinicians could agree on a
diagnosis (using the intraclass kappa statistic) and the agreement of a
single patient or two different clinicians on two separate ratings of
cross-cutting symptoms, personality traits, disability, and diagnostic
severity measures (using intraclass correlation coefficients) along with
information on the precision of these estimates of reliability. It was
also possible to assess the prevalence rates of both DSM-IV and DSM5
conditions in the respective clinical populations.

The routine clinical practice field trials involved recruitment of
individual psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians. A volunteer
sample was recruited that included generalist and specialty
psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers,
counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice
psychiatric mental health nurses. The field trials provided exposure of
the proposed DSM-5 diagnoses and dimensional measures to a wide range of
clinicians to assess their feasibility and clinical utility.

Public and Professional Review In 2010, the APA launched a unique Web
site to facilitate public and professional input into DSM-5. All draft
diagnostic criteria and proposed changes in organization were posted on
www.dsm5.org for a 2-month comment period. Feedback totaled more than
8,000 submissions, which were systematically reviewed by each of the 13
work groups, whose members, where appropriate, integrated questions and
comments into discussions of draft revisions and plans for field trial
testing. After revisions to the initial draft criteria and proposed
chapter organization, a second posting occurred in 2011. Work groups
considered feedback from both Web postings and the results of the DSM-5
Field Trials when drafting proposed final criteria, which were posted on
the Web site for a third and final time in 2012. These three iterations
of external review produced more than 13,000 individually signed
comments on the Web site that were received and reviewed by the work
groups, plus thousands of organized petition signers for and against
some proposed revisions, all of which allowed the task force to actively
address concerns of DSM users, as well as patients and advocacy groups,
and ensure that clinical utility remained a high priority.

Expert Review The members of the 13 work groups, representing expertise
in their respective areas, collaborated with advisors and reviewers
under the overall direction of the DSM-5 Task Force to draft the
diagnostic criteria and accompanying text. This effort was supported by
a team of APA Division of Research staff and developed through a network
of text coordinators from each work group. The preparation of the text
was coordinated by the text editor, working in close collaboration with
the work groups and under the direction of the task force chairs. The
Scientific Review Committee (SRC)

was established to provide a scientific peer review process that was
external to that of the work groups. The SRC chair, vice-chair, and six
committee members were charged with reviewing the degree to which the
proposed changes from DSM-IV could be supported with scientific
evidence. Each proposal for diagnostic revision required a memorandum of
evidence for change prepared by the work group and accompanied by a
summary of supportive data organized around validators for the proposed
diagnostic criteria (i.e., antecedent validators such as familial
aggregation, concurrent validators such as biological markers, and
prospective validators such as response to treatment or course of
illness). The submissions were reviewed by the SRC and scored according
to the strength of the supportive scientific data. Other justifications
for change, such as those arising from clinical experience or need or
from a conceptual reframing of diagnostic categories, were generally
seen as outside the purview of the SRC. The reviewers' scores, which
varied substantially across the different proposals, and an accompanying
brief commentary were then returned to the APA Board of Trustees and the
work groups for consideration and response. The Clinical and Public
Health Committee (CPHC), composed of a chair, vice-chair, and six
members, was appointed to consider additional clinical utility, public
health, and logical clarification issues for criteria that had not yet
accumulated the type or level of evidence deemed sufficient for change
by the SRC. This review process was particularly important for DSM-IV
disorders with known deficiencies for which proposed remedies had
neither been previously considered in the DSM revision process nor been
subjected to replicated research studies. These selected disorders were
evaluated by four to five external reviewers, and the blinded results
were reviewed by CPHC members, who in turn made recommendations to the
APA Board of Trustees and the work groups. Forensic reviews by the
members of the APA Council on Psychiatry and Law were conducted for
disorders frequently appearing in forensic environments and ones with
high potential for influencing civil and criminal judgments in courtroom
settings. Work groups also added forensic experts as advisors in
pertinent areas to complement expertise provided by the Council on
Psychiatry and Law. The work groups themselves were charged with the
responsibility to review the entire research literature surrounding a
diagnostic area, including old, revised, and new diagnostic criteria, in
an intensive 6-year review

process to assess the pros and cons of making either small iterative
changes or major conceptual changes to address the inevitable
reification that occurs with diagnostic conceptual approaches that
persist over several decades. Such changes included the merger of
previously separate diagnostic areas into more dimensional spectra, such
as that which occurred with autism spectrum disorder, substance use
disorders, sexual dysfunctions, and somatic symptom and related
disorders. Other changes included correcting flaws that had become
apparent over time in the choice of operational criteria for some
disorders. These types of changes posed particular challenges to the SRC
and CPHC review processes, which were not constructed to evaluate the
validity of DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. However, the DSM-5 Task Force,
which had reviewed proposed changes and had responsibility for reviewing
the text describing each disorder contemporaneously with the work groups
during this period, was in a unique position to render an informed
judgment on the scientific merits of such revisions. Furthermore, many
of these major changes were subject to field trial testing, although
comprehensive testing of all proposed changes could not be accommodated
by such testing because of time limitations and availability of
resources. A final recommendation from the task force was then provided
to the APA Board of Trustees and the APA Assembly's Committee on DSM-5
to consider some of the clinical utility and feasibility features of the
proposed revisions. The assembly is a deliberative body of the APA
representing the district branches and wider membership that is composed
of psychiatrists from throughout the United States who provide
geographic, practice size, and interest-based diversity. The Committee
on DSM-5 is a committee made up of a diverse group of assembly leaders.
Following all of the preceding review steps, an executive "summit
committee" session was held to consolidate input from review and
assembly committee chairs, task force chairs, a forensic advisor, and a
statistical advisor, for a preliminary review of each disorder by the
assembly and APA Board of Trustees executive committees. This preceded a
preliminary review by the full APA Board of Trustees. The assembly
voted, in November 2012, to recommend that the board approve the
publication of DSM-5, and the APA Board of Trustees approved its
publication in December 2012. The many experts, reviewers, and advisors
who contributed to this process are listed in the Appendix.

Organizational Structure The individual disorder definitions that
constitute the operationalized sets of diagnostic criteria provide the
core of DSM-5 for clinical and research purposes. These criteria have
been subjected to scientific review, albeit to varying degrees, and many
disorders have undergone field testing for interrater reliability. In
contrast, the classification of disorders (the way in which disorders
are grouped, which provides a high-level organization for the manual)
has not generally been thought of as scientifically significant, despite
the fact that judgments had to be made when disorders were initially
divided into chapters for DSM-III. DSM is a medical classification of
disorders and as such serves as a historically determined cognitive
schema imposed on clinical and scientific information to increase its
comprehensibility and utility. Not surprisingly, as the foundational
science that ultimately led to DSM-III has approached a half-century in
age, challenges have begun to emerge for clinicians and scientists alike
that are inherent in the DSM structure rather than in the description of
any single disorder. These challenges include high rates of comorbidity
within and across DSM chapters, an excessive use of and need to rely on
"not otherwise specified" (NOS) criteria, and a growing inability to
integrate DSM disorders with the results of genetic studies and other
scientific findings. As the APA and the WHO began to plan their
respective revisions of the DSM and the International Classification of
Disorders (ICD), both considered the possibility of improving clinical
utility (e.g., by helping to explain apparent comorbidity) and
facilitating scientific investigation by rethinking the organizational
structures of both publications in a linear system designated by
alphanumeric codes that sequence chapters according to some rational and
relational structure. It was critical to both the DSM-5 Task Force and
the WHO International Advisory Group on the revision of the ICD-10
Section on Mental and Behavioral Disorders that the revisions to the
organization enhance clinical utility and remain within the bounds of
well-replicated scientific information. Although the need for reform
seemed apparent, it was important to respect the state of the science as
well as the challenge that overly rapid change would pose for the
clinical and research communities. In that spirit, revision of the
organization was approached as a conservative, evolutionary diagnostic
reform that would be guided by

emerging scientific evidence on the relationships between disorder
groups. By reordering and regrouping the existing disorders, the revised
structure is meant to stimulate new clinical perspectives and to
encourage researchers to identify the psychological and physiological
cross-cutting factors that are not bound by strict categorical
designations. The use of DSM criteria has the clear virtue of creating a
common language for communication between clinicians about the diagnosis
of disorders. The official criteria and disorders that were determined
to have accepted clinical applicability are located in Section II of the
manual. However, it should be noted that these diagnostic criteria and
their relationships within the classification are based on current
research and may need to be modified as new evidence is gathered by
future research both within and across the domains of proposed
disorders. "Conditions for Further Study," described in Section III, are
those for which we determined that the scientific evidence is not yet
available to support widespread clinical use. These diagnostic criteria
are included to highlight the evolution and direction of scientific
advances in these areas to stimulate further research. With any ongoing
review process, especially one of this complexity, different viewpoints
emerge, and an effort was made to consider various viewpoints and, when
warranted, accommodate them. For example, personality disorders are
included in both Sections II and III. Section II represents an update of
the text associated with the same criteria found in DSM-IV-TR, whereas
Section III includes the proposed research model for personality
disorder diagnosis and conceptualization developed by the DSM-5
Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group. As this field evolves,
it is hoped that both versions will serve clinical practice and research
initiatives.

Harmonization With ICD-11 The groups tasked with revising the DSM and
ICD systems shared the overarching goal of harmonizing the two
classifications as much as possible, for the following reasons: The
existence of two major classifications of mental disorders hinders the
collection and use of national health statistics, the design of clinical
trials aimed at developing new treatments, and the

consideration of global applicability of the results by international
regulatory agencies. More broadly, the existence of two classifications
complicates attempts to replicate scientific results across national
boundaries. Even when the intention was to identify identical patient
populations, DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnoses did not always agree. Early in
the course of the revisions, it became apparent that a shared
organizational structure would help harmonize the classifications. In
fact, the use of a shared framework helped to integrate the work of DSM
and ICD work groups and to focus on scientific issues. The DSM-5
organization and the proposed linear structure of the ICD-11 have been
endorsed by the leadership of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
project as consistent with the initial overall structure of that
project. Of course, principled disagreements on the classification of
psychopathology and on specific criteria for certain disorders were
expected given the current state of scientific knowledge. However, most
of the salient differences between the DSM and the ICD classifications
do not reflect real scientific differences, but rather represent
historical by-products of independent committee processes. To the
surprise of participants in both revision processes, large sections of
the content fell relatively easily into place, reflecting real strengths
in some areas of the scientific literature, such as epidemiology,
analyses of comorbidity, twin studies, and certain other genetically
informed designs. When disparities emerged, they almost always reflected
the need to make a judgment about where to place a disorder in the face
of incomplete---or, more often, conflicting---data. Thus, for example,
on the basis of patterns of symptoms, comorbidity, and shared risk
factors, attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was placed with
neurodevelopmental disorders, but the same data also supported strong
arguments to place ADHD within disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct
disorders. These issues were settled with the preponderance of evidence
(most notably validators approved by the DSM-5 Task Force). The work
groups recognize, however, that future discoveries might change the
placement as well as the contours of individual disorders and,
furthermore, that the simple and linear organization that best supports
clinical practice

may not fully capture the complexity and heterogeneity of mental
disorders. The revised organization is coordinated with the mental and
behavioral disorders chapter (Chapter V) of ICD-11, which will utilize
an expanded numeric--alphanumeric coding system. However, the official
coding system in use in the United States at the time of publication of
this manual is that of the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)---the U.S. adaptation
of ICD-9. International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-10CM), adapted from ICD-10, is scheduled for
implementation in the United States in October 2015. Given the impending
release of ICD-11, it was decided that this iteration, and not ICD-10,
would be the most relevant on which to focus harmonization. However,
given that adoption of the ICD-9CM coding system will remain at the time
of the DSM-5 release, it will be necessary to use the ICD-9-CM codes.
Furthermore, given that DSM-5's organizational structure reflects the
anticipated structure of ICD-11, the eventual ICD-11 codes will follow
the sequential order of diagnoses in the DSM-5 chapter structure more
closely. At present, both the ICD-9-CM and the ICD-10-CM codes have been
indicated for each disorder. These codes will not be in sequential order
throughout the manual because they were assigned to complement earlier
organizational structures.

Dimensional Approach to Diagnosis Structural problems rooted in the
basic design of the previous DSM classification, constructed of a large
number of narrow diagnostic categories, have emerged in both clinical
practice and research. Relevant evidence comes from diverse sources,
including studies of comorbidity and the substantial need for not
otherwise specified diagnoses, which represent the majority of diagnoses
in areas such as eating disorders, personality disorders, and autism
spectrum disorder. Studies of both genetic and environmental risk
factors, whether based on twin designs, familial transmission, or
molecular analyses, also raise concerns about the categorical structure
of the DSM system. Because the previous DSM approach considered each
diagnosis as categorically separate from health and from other
diagnoses, it did not capture the widespread sharing of symptoms and
risk factors across many disorders that is apparent in studies of
comorbidity. Earlier editions of DSM focused on excluding false-positive
results from diagnoses; thus, its categories were overly narrow, as is

apparent from the widespread need to use NOS diagnoses. Indeed, the once
plausible goal of identifying homogeneous populations for treatment and
research resulted in narrow diagnostic categories that did not capture
clinical reality, symptom heterogeneity within disorders, and
significant sharing of symptoms across multiple disorders. The
historical aspiration of achieving diagnostic homogeneity by progressive
subtyping within disorder categories no longer is sensible; like most
common human ills, mental disorders are heterogeneous at many levels,
ranging from genetic risk factors to symptoms. Related to
recommendations about alterations in the chapter structure of DSM-5,
members of the diagnostic spectra study group examined whether
scientific validators could inform possible new groupings of related
disorders within the existing categorical framework. Eleven such
indicators were recommended for this purpose: shared neural substrates,
family traits, genetic risk factors, specific environmental risk
factors, biomarkers, temperamental antecedents, abnormalities of
emotional or cognitive processing, symptom similarity, course of
illness, high comorbidity, and shared treatment response. These
indicators served as empirical guidelines to inform decision making by
the work groups and the task force about how to cluster disorders to
maximize their validity and clinical utility. A series of papers was
developed and published in a prominent international journal
(Psychological Medicine, Vol. 39, 2009) as part of both the DSM-5 and
the ICD-11 developmental processes to document that such validators were
most useful for suggesting large groupings of disorders rather than for
"validating" individual disorder diagnostic criteria. The regrouping of
mental disorders in DSM-5 is intended to enable future research to
enhance understanding of disease origins and pathophysiological
commonalities between disorders and provide a base for future
replication wherein data can be reanalyzed over time to continually
assess validity. Ongoing revisions of DSM-5 will make it a "living
document," adaptable to future discoveries in neurobiology, genetics,
and epidemiology. On the basis of the published findings of this common
DSM-5 and ICD11 analysis, it was demonstrated that clustering of
disorders according to what has been termed internalizing and
externalizing factors represents an empirically supported framework.
Within both the internalizing group (representing disorders with
prominent anxiety, depressive, and somatic

symptoms) and the externalizing group (representing disorders with
prominent impulsive, disruptive conduct, and substance use symptoms),
the sharing of genetic and environmental risk factors, as shown by twin
studies, likely explains much of the systematic comorbidities seen in
both clinical and community samples. The adjacent placement of
"internalizing disorders," characterized by depressed mood, anxiety, and
related physiological and cognitive symptoms, should aid in developing
new diagnostic approaches, including dimensional approaches, while
facilitating the identification of biological markers. Similarly,
adjacencies of the "externalizing group," including disorders exhibiting
antisocial behaviors, conduct disturbances, addictions, and
impulse-control disorders, should encourage advances in identifying
diagnoses, markers, and underlying mechanisms. Despite the problem posed
by categorical diagnoses, the DSM-5 Task Force recognized that it is
premature scientifically to propose alternative definitions for most
disorders. The organizational structure is meant to serve as a bridge to
new diagnostic approaches without disrupting current clinical practice
or research. With support from DSM-associated training materials, the
National Institutes of Health other funding agencies, and scientific
publications, the more dimensional DSM-5 approach and organizational
structure can facilitate research across current diagnostic categories
by encouraging broad investigations within the proposed chapters and
across adjacent chapters. Such a reformulation of research goals should
also keep DSM-5 central to the development of dimensional approaches to
diagnosis that will likely supplement or supersede current categorical
approaches in coming years.

Developmental and Lifespan Considerations To improve clinical utility,
DSM-5 is organized on developmental and lifespan considerations. It
begins with diagnoses thought to reflect developmental processes that
manifest early in life (e.g., neurodevelopmental and schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorders), followed by diagnoses that more
commonly manifest in adolescence and young adulthood (e.g., bipolar,
depressive, and anxiety disorders), and ends with diagnoses relevant to
adulthood and later life (e.g., neurocognitive disorders). A similar
approach has been taken, where possible, within each chapter. This
organizational structure facilitates the

comprehensive use of lifespan information as a way to assist in
diagnostic decision making. The proposed organization of chapters of
DSM-5, after the neurodevelopmental disorders, is based on groups of
internalizing (emotional and somatic) disorders, externalizing
disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and other disorders. It is hoped
that this organization will encourage further study of underlying
pathophysiological processes that give rise to diagnostic comorbidity
and symptom heterogeneity. Furthermore, by arranging disorder clusters
to mirror clinical reality, DSM5 should facilitate identification of
potential diagnoses by non--mental health specialists, such as primary
care physicians. The organizational structure of DSM-5, along with ICD
harmonization, is designed to provide better and more flexible
diagnostic concepts for the next epoch of research and to serve as a
useful guide to clinicians in explaining to patients why they might have
received multiple diagnoses or why they might have received additional
or altered diagnoses over their lifespan.

Cultural Issues Mental disorders are defined in relation to cultural,
social, and familial norms and values. Culture provides interpretive
frameworks that shape the experience and expression of the symptoms,
signs, and behaviors that are criteria for diagnosis. Culture is
transmitted, revised, and recreated within the family and other social
systems and institutions. Diagnostic assessment must therefore consider
whether an individual's experiences, symptoms, and behaviors differ from
sociocultural norms and lead to difficulties in adaptation in the
cultures of origin and in specific social or familial contexts. Key
aspects of culture relevant to diagnostic classification and assessment
have been considered in the development of DSM-5. In Section III, the
"Cultural Formulation" contains a detailed discussion of culture and
diagnosis in DSM-5, including tools for in-depth cultural assessment. In
the Appendix, the "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress" provides a
description of some common cultural syndromes, idioms of distress, and
causal explanations relevant to clinical practice. The boundaries
between normality and pathology vary across cultures for specific types
of behaviors. Thresholds of tolerance for specific symptoms

or behaviors differ across cultures, social settings, and families.
Hence, the level at which an experience becomes problematic or
pathological will differ. The judgment that a given behavior is abnormal
and requires clinical attention depends on cultural norms that are
internalized by the individual and applied by others around them,
including family members and clinicians. Awareness of the significance
of culture may correct mistaken interpretations of psychopathology, but
culture may also contribute to vulnerability and suffering (e.g., by
amplifying fears that maintain panic disorder or health anxiety).
Cultural meanings, habits, and traditions can also contribute to either
stigma or support in the social and familial response to mental illness.
Culture may provide coping strategies that enhance resilience in
response to illness, or suggest help seeking and options for accessing
health care of various types, including alternative and complementary
health systems. Culture may influence acceptance or rejection of a
diagnosis and adherence to treatments, affecting the course of illness
and recovery. Culture also affects the conduct of the clinical
encounter; as a result, cultural differences between the clinician and
the patient have implications for the accuracy and acceptance of
diagnosis as well as for treatment decisions, prognostic considerations,
and clinical outcomes. Historically, the construct of the culture-bound
syndrome has been a key interest of cultural psychiatry. In DSM-5, this
construct has been replaced by three concepts that offer greater
clinical utility: 1. Cultural syndrome is a cluster or group of
co-occurring, relatively invariant symptoms found in a specific cultural
group, community, or context (e.g., ataque de nervios). The syndrome may
or may not be recognized as an illness within the culture (e.g., it
might be labeled in various ways), but such cultural patterns of
distress and features of illness may nevertheless be recognizable by an
outside observer. 2. Cultural idiom of distress is a linguistic term,
phrase, or way of talking about suffering among individuals of a
cultural group (e.g., similar ethnicity and religion) referring to
shared concepts of pathology and ways of expressing, communicating, or
naming essential features of distress (e.g., kufungisisa). An idiom of
distress need not be associated with specific symptoms, syndromes, or
perceived causes. It may be used to convey a wide range of

discomfort, including everyday experiences, subclinical conditions, or
suffering due to social circumstances rather than mental disorders. For
example, most cultures have common bodily idioms of distress used to
express a wide range of suffering and concerns. 3. Cultural explanation
or perceived cause is a label, attribution, or feature of an explanatory
model that provides a culturally conceived etiology or cause for
symptoms, illness, or distress (e.g., maladi moun). Causal explanations
may be salient features of folk classifications of disease used by
laypersons or healers. These three concepts (for which discussion and
examples are provided in Section III and the Appendix) suggest cultural
ways of understanding and describing illness experiences that can be
elicited in the clinical encounter. They influence symptomatology, help
seeking, clinical presentations, expectations of treatment, illness
adaptation, and treatment response. The same cultural term often serves
more than one of these functions.

Gender Differences Sex and gender differences as they relate to the
causes and expression of medical conditions are established for a number
of diseases, including selected mental disorders. Revisions to DSM-5
included review of potential differences between men and women in the
expression of mental illness. In terms of nomenclature, sex differences
are variations attributable to an individual's reproductive organs and
XX or XY chromosomal complement. Gender differences are variations that
result from biological sex as well as an individual's
self-representation that includes the psychological, behavioral, and
social consequences of one's perceived gender. The term gender
differences is used in DSM-5 because, more commonly, the differences
between men and women are a result of both biological sex and individual
self-representation. However, some of the differences are based on only
biological sex. Gender can influence illness in a variety of ways.
First, it may exclusively determine whether an individual is at risk for
a disorder (e.g., as in premenstrual dysphoric disorder). Second, gender
may moderate the overall risk for development of a disorder as shown by
marked gender differences in the prevalence and incidence rates for
selected mental

disorders. Third, gender may influence the likelihood that particular
symptoms of a disorder are experienced by an individual.
Attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder is an example of a disorder with
differences in presentation that are most commonly experienced by boys
or girls. Gender likely has other effects on the experience of a
disorder that are indirectly relevant to psychiatric diagnosis. It may
be that certain symptoms are more readily endorsed by men or women, and
that this contributes to differences in service provision (e.g., women
may be more likely to recognize a depressive, bipolar, or anxiety
disorder and endorse a more comprehensive list of symptoms than men).
Reproductive life cycle events, including estrogen variations, also
contribute to gender differences in risk and expression of illness.
Thus, a specifier for postpartum onset of mania or major depressive
episode denotes a time frame wherein women may be at increased risk for
the onset of an illness episode. In the case of sleep and energy,
alterations are often normative postpartum and thus may have lower
diagnostic reliability in postpartum women. The manual is configured to
include information on gender at multiple levels. If there are
gender-specific symptoms, they have been added to the diagnostic
criteria. A gender-related specifier, such as perinatal onset of a mood
episode, provides additional information on gender and diagnosis.
Finally, other issues that are pertinent to diagnosis and gender
considerations can be found in the section "Gender-Related Diagnostic
Issues."

Use of Other Specified and Unspecified Disorders To enhance diagnostic
specificity, DSM-5 replaces the previous NOS designation with two
options for clinical use: other specified disorder and unspecified
disorder. The other specified disorder category is provided to allow the
clinician to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does
not meet the criteria for any specific category within a diagnostic
class. This is done by recording the name of the category, followed by
the specific reason. For example, for an individual with clinically
significant depressive symptoms lasting 4 weeks but whose symptomatology
falls short of the diagnostic threshold for a major depressive episode,
the clinician would record "other specified depressive disorder,
depressive episode with insufficient symptoms." If the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason

that the criteria are not met for a specific disorder, then "unspecified
depressive disorder" would be diagnosed. Note that the differentiation
between other specified and unspecified disorders is based on the
clinician's decision, providing maximum flexibility for diagnosis.
Clinicians do not have to differentiate between other specified and
unspecified disorders based on some feature of the presentation itself.
When the clinician determines that there is evidence to specify the
nature of the clinical presentation, the other specified diagnosis can
be given. When the clinician is not able to further specify and describe
the clinical presentation, the unspecified diagnosis can be given. This
is left entirely up to clinical judgment. For a more detailed discussion
of how to use other specified and unspecified designations, see "Use of
the Manual" in Section I.

The Multiaxial System Despite widespread use and its adoption by certain
insurance and governmental agencies, the multiaxial system in DSM-IV was
not required to make a mental disorder diagnosis. A nonaxial assessment
system was also included that simply listed the appropriate Axis I, II,
and III disorders and conditions without axial designations. DSM-5 has
moved to a nonaxial documentation of diagnosis (formerly Axes I, II, and
III), with separate notations for important psychosocial and contextual
factors (formerly Axis IV) and disability (formerly Axis V). This
revision is consistent with the DSM-IV text that states, "The multiaxial
distinction among Axis I, Axis II, and Axis III disorders does not imply
that there are fundamental differences in their conceptualization, that
mental disorders are unrelated to physical or biological factors or
processes, or that general medical conditions are unrelated to
behavioral or psychosocial factors or processes." The approach of
separately noting diagnosis from psychosocial and contextual factors is
also consistent with established WHO and ICD guidance to consider the
individual's functional status separately from his or her diagnoses or
symptom status. In DSM-5, Axis III has been combined with Axes I and II.
Clinicians should continue to list medical conditions that are important
to the understanding or management of an individual's mental
disorder(s). DSM-IV Axis IV covered psychosocial and environmental
problems that may affect the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of
mental disorders. Although this axis provided helpful information, even
if it was not used as

frequently as intended, the DSM-5 Task Force recommended that DSM-5
should not develop its own classification of psychosocial and
environmental problems, but rather use a selected set of the ICD-9-CM V
codes and the new Z codes contained in ICD-10-CM. The ICD-10 Z codes
were examined to determine which are most relevant to mental disorders
and also to identify gaps. DSM-IV Axis V consisted of the Global
Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, representing the clinician's
judgment of the individual's overall level of "functioning on a
hypothetical continuum of mental health-- illness." It was recommended
that the GAF be dropped from DSM-5 for several reasons, including its
conceptual lack of clarity (i.e., including symptoms, suicide risk, and
disabilities in its descriptors) and questionable psychometrics in
routine practice. In order to provide a global measure of disability,
the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) is included, for further
study, in Section III of DSM-5 (see the chapter "Assessment Measures").
The WHODAS is based on the International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health (ICF) for use across all of medicine and health
care. The WHODAS (version 2.0), and a modification developed for
children/adolescents and their parents by the Impairment and Disability
Study Group were included in the DSM-5 field trial.

Online Enhancements It was challenging to determine what to include in
the print version of DSM-5 to be most clinically relevant and useful and
at the same time maintain a manageable size. For this reason, the
inclusion of clinical rating scales and measures in the print edition is
limited to those considered most relevant. Additional assessment
measures used in the field trials are available online
(www.psychiatry.org/dsm5), linked to the relevant disorders. The
Cultural Formulation Interview, Cultural Formulation
Interview---Informant Version, and supplementary modules to the core
Cultural Formulation Interview are also available online at
www.psychiatry.org/dsm5. DSM-5 is available as an online subscription at
PsychiatryOnline.org as well as an e-book. The online component contains
modules and assessment tools to enhance the diagnostic criteria and
text. Also available online is a complete set of supportive references
as well as additional helpful

information. The organizational structure of DSM-5, its use of
dimensional measures, and compatibility with ICD codes will allow it to
be readily adaptable to future scientific discoveries and refinements in
its clinical utility. DSM-5 will be analyzed over time to continually
assess its validity and enhance its value to clinicians.

Use of the Manual The introduction contains much of the history and
developmental process of the DSM-5 revision. This section is designed to
provide a practical guide to using DSM-5, particularly in clinical
practice. The primary purpose of DSM-5 is to assist trained clinicians
in the diagnosis of their patients' mental disorders as part of a case
formulation assessment that leads to a fully informed treatment plan for
each individual. The symptoms contained in the respective diagnostic
criteria sets do not constitute comprehensive definitions of underlying
disorders, which encompass cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and
physiological processes that are far more complex than can be described
in these brief summaries. Rather, they are intended to summarize
characteristic syndromes of signs and symptoms that point to an
underlying disorder with a characteristic developmental history,
biological and environmental risk factors, neuropsychological and
physiological correlates, and typical clinical course.

Approach to Clinical Case Formulation The case formulation for any given
patient must involve a careful clinical history and concise summary of
the social, psychological, and biological factors that may have
contributed to developing a given mental disorder. Hence, it is not
sufficient to simply check off the symptoms in the diagnostic criteria
to make a mental disorder diagnosis. Although a systematic check for the
presence of these criteria as they apply to each patient will assure a
more reliable assessment, the relative severity and valence of
individual criteria and their contribution to a diagnosis require
clinical judgment. The symptoms in our diagnostic criteria are part of
the relatively limited repertoire of human emotional responses to
internal and external stresses that are generally maintained in a
homeostatic balance without a disruption in normal functioning. It
requires clinical training to recognize when the combination of
predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and protective factors has
resulted in a psychopathological condition in which physical signs and
symptoms exceed normal ranges. The ultimate goal of a clinical case
formulation is to use the available contextual

and diagnostic information in developing a comprehensive treatment plan
that is informed by the individual's cultural and social context.
However, recommendations for the selection and use of the most
appropriate evidence-based treatment options for each disorder are
beyond the scope of this manual. Although decades of scientific effort
have gone into developing the diagnostic criteria sets for the disorders
included in Section II, it is well recognized that this set of
categorical diagnoses does not fully describe the full range of mental
disorders that individuals experience and present to clinicians on a
daily basis throughout the world. As noted previously in the
introduction, the range of genetic/environmental interactions over the
course of human development affecting cognitive, emotional and
behavioral function is virtually limitless. As a result, it is
impossible to capture the full range of psychopathology in the
categorical diagnostic categories that we are now using. Hence, it is
also necessary to include "other specified/unspecified" disorder options
for presentations that do not fit exactly into the diagnostic boundaries
of disorders in each chapter. In an emergency department setting, it may
be possible to identify only the most prominent symptom expressions
associated with a particular chapter---for example, delusions,
hallucinations, mania, depression, anxiety, substance intoxication, or
neurocognitive symptoms---so that an "unspecified" disorder in that
category is identified until a fuller differential diagnosis is
possible.

Definition of a Mental Disorder Each disorder identified in Section II
of the manual (excluding those in the chapters entitled
"Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of
Medication" and "Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical
Attention") must meet the definition of a mental disorder. Although no
definition can capture all aspects of all disorders in the range
contained in DSM-5, the following elements are required: A mental
disorder is a syndrome characterized by clinically significant
disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or
behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological,
or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental
disorders are usually associated with significant distress or disability
in social, occupational, or other important activities. An expectable or
culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the
death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. Socially deviant
behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are

primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders
unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the
individual, as described above.

The diagnosis of a mental disorder should have clinical utility: it
should help clinicians to determine prognosis, treatment plans, and
potential treatment outcomes for their patients. However, the diagnosis
of a mental disorder is not equivalent to a need for treatment. Need for
treatment is a complex clinical decision that takes into consideration
symptom severity, symptom salience (e.g., the presence of suicidal
ideation), the patient's distress (mental pain) associated with the
symptom(s), disability related to the patient's symptoms, risks and
benefits of available treatments, and other factors (e.g., psychiatric
symptoms complicating other illness). Clinicians may thus encounter
individuals whose symptoms do not meet full criteria for a mental
disorder but who demonstrate a clear need for treatment or care. The
fact that some individuals do not show all symptoms indicative of a
diagnosis should not be used to justify limiting their access to
appropriate care. Approaches to validating diagnostic criteria for
discrete categorical mental disorders have included the following types
of evidence: antecedent validators (similar genetic markers, family
traits, temperament, and environmental exposure), concurrent validators
(similar neural substrates, biomarkers, emotional and cognitive
processing, and symptom similarity), and predictive validators (similar
clinical course and treatment response). In DSM-5, we recognize that the
current diagnostic criteria for any single disorder will not necessarily
identify a homogeneous group of patients who can be characterized
reliably with all of these validators. Available evidence shows that
these validators cross existing diagnostic boundaries but tend to
congregate more frequently within and across adjacent DSM-5 chapter
groups. Until incontrovertible etiological or pathophysiological
mechanisms are identified to fully validate specific disorders or
disorder spectra, the most important standard for the DSM-5 disorder
criteria will be their clinical utility for the assessment of clinical
course and treatment response of individuals grouped by a given set of
diagnostic criteria. This definition of mental disorder was developed
for clinical, public health, and research purposes. Additional
information is usually required beyond that contained in the DSM-5
diagnostic criteria in order to make legal judgments on such issues as
criminal responsibility, eligibility for

disability compensation, and competency (see "Cautionary Statement for
Forensic Use of DSM-5" elsewhere in this manual).

Criterion for Clinical Significance There have been substantial efforts
by the DSM-5 Task Force and the World Health Organization (WHO) to
separate the concepts of mental disorder and disability (impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning). In the
WHO system, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) covers
all diseases and disorders, while the International Classification of
Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a separate
classification of global disability. The WHO Disability Assessment
Schedule (WHODAS) is based on the ICF and has proven useful as a
standardized measure of disability for mental disorders. However, in the
absence of clear biological markers or clinically useful measurements of
severity for many mental disorders, it has not been possible to
completely separate normal and pathological symptom expressions
contained in diagnostic criteria. This gap in information is
particularly problematic in clinical situations in which the patient's
symptom presentation by itself (particularly in mild forms) is not
inherently pathological and may be encountered in individuals for whom a
diagnosis of "mental disorder" would be inappropriate. Therefore, a
generic diagnostic criterion requiring distress or disability has been
used to establish disorder thresholds, usually worded "the disturbance
causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning." The text
following the revised definition of a mental disorder acknowledges that
this criterion may be especially helpful in determining a patient's need
for treatment. Use of information from family members and other third
parties (in addition to the individual) regarding the individual's
performance is recommended when necessary.

Elements of a Diagnosis Diagnostic Criteria and Descriptors Diagnostic
criteria are offered as guidelines for making diagnoses, and their use
should be informed by clinical judgment. Text descriptions, including
introductory sections of each diagnostic chapter, can help support
diagnosis

(e.g., providing differential diagnoses; describing the criteria more
fully under "Diagnostic Features"). Following the assessment of
diagnostic criteria, clinicians should consider the application of
disorder subtypes and/or specifiers as appropriate. Severity and course
specifiers should be applied to denote the individual's current
presentation, but only when the full criteria are met. When full
criteria are not met, clinicians should consider whether the symptom
presentation meets criteria for an "other specified" or "unspecified"
designation. Where applicable, specific criteria for defining disorder
severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe, extreme), descriptive features
(e.g., with good to fair insight; in a controlled environment), and
course (e.g., in partial remission, in full remission, recurrent) are
provided with each diagnosis. On the basis of the clinical interview,
text descriptions, criteria, and clinician judgment, a final diagnosis
is made. The general convention in DSM-5 is to allow multiple diagnoses
to be assigned for those presentations that meet criteria for more than
one DSM-5 disorder.

Subtypes and Specifiers Subtypes and specifiers (some of which are coded
in the fourth, fifth, or sixth digit) are provided for increased
specificity. Subtypes define mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive
phenomenological subgroupings within a diagnosis and are indicated by
the instruction "Specify whether" in the criteria set. In contrast,
specifiers are not intended to be mutually exclusive or jointly
exhaustive, and as a consequence, more than one specifier may be given.
Specifiers are indicated by the instruction "Specify" or "Specify if" in
the criteria set. Specifiers provide an opportunity to define a more
homogeneous subgrouping of individuals with the disorder who share
certain features (e.g., major depressive disorder, with mixed features)
and to convey information that is relevant to the management of the
individual's disorder, such as the "with other medical comorbidity"
specifier in sleepwake disorders. Although a fifth digit is sometimes
assigned to code a subtype or specifier (e.g., 294.11 \[F02.81\] major
neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease, with behavioral
disturbance) or severity (296.21 \[F32.0\] major depressive disorder,
single episode, mild), the majority of subtypes and specifiers included
in DSM-5 cannot be coded within the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM systems and
are indicated only by

including the subtype or specifier after the name of the disorder (e.g.,
social anxiety disorder \[social phobia\], performance type). Note that
in some cases, a specifier or subtype is codable in ICD-10-CM but not in
ICD-9CM. Accordingly, in some cases the 4th or 5th character codes for
the subtypes or specifiers are provided only for the ICD-10-CM coding
designations. A DSM-5 diagnosis is usually applied to the individual's
current presentation; previous diagnoses from which the individual has
recovered should be clearly noted as such. Specifiers indicating course
(e.g., in partial remission, in full remission) may be listed after the
diagnosis and are indicated in a number of criteria sets. Where
available, severity specifiers are provided to guide clinicians in
rating the intensity, frequency, duration, symptom count, or other
severity indicator of a disorder. Severity specifiers are indicated by
the instruction "Specify current severity" in the criteria set and
include disorder-specific definitions. Descriptive features specifiers
have also been provided in the criteria set and convey additional
information that can inform treatment planning (e.g.,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, with poor insight). Not all disorders
include course, severity, and/or descriptive features specifiers.

Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Conditions That May Be a Focus
of Clinical Attention

Other

In addition to important psychosocial and environmental factors (see
"The Multiaxial System" in the "Introduction" elsewhere in this manual),
these chapters in Section II also contain other conditions that are not
mental disorders but may be encountered by mental health clinicians.
These conditions may be listed as a reason for clinical visit in
addition to, or in place of, the mental disorders listed in Section II.
A separate chapter is devoted to medication-induced disorders and other
adverse effects of medication that may be assessed and treated by
clinicians in mental health practice such as akathisia, tardive
dyskinesia, and dystonia. The description of neuroleptic malignant
syndrome is expanded from that provided in DSM-IV-TR to highlight the
emergent and potentially life-threatening nature of this condition, and
a new entry on antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is provided. An
additional chapter discusses other conditions that may be a focus of
clinical attention. These include relational problems,

problems related to abuse and neglect, problems with adherence to
treatment regimens, obesity, antisocial behavior, and malingering.

Principal Diagnosis When more than one diagnosis for an individual is
given in an inpatient setting, the principal diagnosis is the condition
established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the
admission of the individual. When more than one diagnosis is given for
an individual in an outpatient setting, the reason for visit is the
condition that is chiefly responsible for the ambulatory care medical
services received during the visit. In most cases, the principal
diagnosis or the reason for visit is also the main focus of attention or
treatment. It is often difficult (and somewhat arbitrary) to determine
which diagnosis is the principal diagnosis or the reason for visit,
especially when, for example, a substance-related diagnosis such as
alcohol use disorder is accompanied by a non-substance-related diagnosis
such as schizophrenia. For example, it may be unclear which diagnosis
should be considered "principal" for an individual hospitalized with
both schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder, because each condition may
have contributed equally to the need for admission and treatment. The
principal diagnosis is indicated by listing it first, and the remaining
disorders are listed in order of focus of attention and treatment. When
the principal diagnosis or reason for visit is a mental disorder due to
another medical condition (e.g., major neurocognitive disorder due to
Alzheimer's disease, psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neoplasm),
ICD coding rules require that the etiological medical condition be
listed first. In that case, the principal diagnosis or reason for visit
would be the mental disorder due to the medical condition, the second
listed diagnosis. In most cases, the disorder listed as the principal
diagnosis or the reason for visit is followed by the qualifying phrase
"(principal diagnosis)" or "(reason for visit)."

Provisional Diagnosis The specifier "provisional" can be used when there
is a strong presumption that the full criteria will ultimately be met
for a disorder but not enough information is available to make a firm
diagnosis. The clinician can indicate the diagnostic uncertainty by
recording "(provisional)" following the diagnosis. For example, this
diagnosis might be used when an individual who appears to have a major
depressive disorder is unable to give an

adequate history, and thus it cannot be established that the full
criteria are met. Another use of the term provisional is for those
situations in which differential diagnosis depends exclusively on the
duration of illness. For example, a diagnosis of schizophreniform
disorder requires a duration of less than 6 months but of at least 1
month and can only be given provisionally if assigned before remission
has occurred.

Coding and Reporting Procedures Each disorder is accompanied by an
identifying diagnostic and statistical code, which is typically used by
institutions and agencies for data collection and billing purposes.
There are specific recording protocols for these diagnostic codes
(identified as coding notes in the text) that were established by WHO,
the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health
Statistics to ensure consistent international recording of prevalence
and mortality rates for identified health conditions. For most
clinicians, the codes are used to identify the diagnosis or reason for
visit for CMS and private insurance service claims. The official coding
system in use in the United States as of publication of this manual is
ICD-9-CM. Official adoption of ICD-10-CM is scheduled to take place on
October 1, 2015, and these codes, which are shown parenthetically in
this manual, should not be used until the official implementation
occurs. Both ICD-9CM and ICD-10-CM codes have been listed 1) preceding
the name of the disorder in the classification and 2) accompanying the
criteria set for each disorder. For some diagnoses (e.g., neurocognitive
and substance/medication-induced disorders), the appropriate code
depends on further specification and is listed within the criteria set
for the disorder, as coding notes, and, in some cases, further clarified
in a section on recording procedures. The names of some disorders are
followed by alternative terms enclosed in parentheses, which, in most
cases, were the DSM-IV names for the disorders.

Looking to the Future: Assessment and Monitoring Tools The various
components of DSM-5 are provided to facilitate patient assessment and to
aid in developing a comprehensive case formulation.

Whereas the diagnostic criteria in Section II are well-established
measures that have undergone extensive review, the assessment tools, a
cultural formulation interview, and conditions for further study
included in Section III are those for which we determined that the
scientific evidence is not yet available to support widespread clinical
use. These diagnostic aids and criteria are included to highlight the
evolution and direction of scientific advances in these areas and to
stimulate further research. Each of the measures in Section III is
provided to aid in a comprehensive assessment of individuals that will
contribute to a diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to the individual
presentation and clinical context. Where cultural dynamics are
particularly important for diagnostic assessment, the cultural
formulation interview should be considered as a useful aid to
communication with the individual. Cross-cutting symptom and
diagnosisspecific severity measures provide quantitative ratings of
important clinical areas that are designed to be used at the initial
evaluation to establish a baseline for comparison with ratings on
subsequent encounters to monitor changes and inform treatment planning.
The use of such measures will undoubtedly be facilitated by digital
applications, and the measures are included in Section III to provide
for further evaluation and development. As with each DSM edition, the
diagnostic criteria and the DSM-5 classification of mental disorders
reflect the current consensus on the evolving knowledge in our field.

Cautionary Statement for Forensic Use of DSM-5 Although the DSM-5
diagnostic criteria and text are primarily designed to assist clinicians
in conducting clinical assessment, case formulation, and treatment
planning, DSM-5 is also used as a reference for the courts and attorneys
in assessing the forensic consequences of mental disorders. As a result,
it is important to note that the definition of mental disorder included
in DSM-5 was developed to meet the needs of clinicians, public health
professionals, and research investigators rather than all of the
technical needs of the courts and legal professionals. It is also
important to note that DSM-5 does not provide treatment guidelines for
any given disorder. When used appropriately, diagnoses and diagnostic
information can assist legal decision makers in their determinations.
For example, when the presence of a mental disorder is the predicate for
a subsequent legal determination (e.g., involuntary civil commitment),
the use of an established system of diagnosis enhances the value and
reliability of the determination. By providing a compendium based on a
review of the pertinent clinical and research literature, DSM-5 may
facilitate legal decision makers' understanding of the relevant
characteristics of mental disorders. The literature related to diagnoses
also serves as a check on ungrounded speculation about mental disorders
and about the functioning of a particular individual. Finally,
diagnostic information about longitudinal course may improve decision
making when the legal issue concerns an individual's mental functioning
at a past or future point in time. However, the use of DSM-5 should be
informed by an awareness of the risks and limitations of its use in
forensic settings. When DSM-5 categories, criteria, and textual
descriptions are employed for forensic purposes, there is a risk that
diagnostic information will be misused or misunderstood. These dangers
arise because of the imperfect fit between the questions of ultimate
concern to the law and the information contained in a clinical
diagnosis. In most situations, the clinical diagnosis of a DSM-5 mental

disorder such as intellectual disability (intellectual developmental
disorder), schizophrenia, major neurocognitive disorder, gambling
disorder, or pedophilic disorder does not imply that an individual with
such a condition meets legal criteria for the presence of a mental
disorder or a specified legal standard (e.g., for competence, criminal
responsibility, or disability). For the latter, additional information
is usually required beyond that contained in the DSM-5 diagnosis, which
might include information about the individual's functional impairments
and how these impairments affect the particular abilities in question.
It is precisely because impairments, abilities, and disabilities vary
widely within each diagnostic category that assignment of a particular
diagnosis does not imply a specific level of impairment or disability.
Use of DSM-5 to assess for the presence of a mental disorder by
nonclinical, nonmedical, or otherwise insufficiently trained individuals
is not advised. Nonclinical decision makers should also be cautioned
that a diagnosis does not carry any necessary implications regarding the
etiology or causes of the individual's mental disorder or the
individual's degree of control over behaviors that may be associated
with the disorder. Even when diminished control over one's behavior is a
feature of the disorder, having the diagnosis in itself does not
demonstrate that a particular individual is (or was) unable to control
his or her behavior at a particular time.

This section contains the diagnostic criteria approved for routine
clinical use along with the ICD-9-CM codes (ICD-10 codes are shown
parenthetically). For each mental disorder, the diagnostic criteria are
followed by descriptive text to assist in diagnostic decision making.
Where needed, specific recording procedures are presented with the
diagnostic criteria to provide guidance in selecting the most
appropriate code. In some cases, separate recording procedures for
ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM are provided. Although not considered as official
DSM-5 disorders, medication-induced movement disorders and other adverse
effects of medication, as well as other conditions that may be a focus
of clinical attention (including additional ICD-9-CM V codes and
forthcoming ICD10-CM Z codes), are provided to indicate other reasons
for a clinical visit such as environmental factors and relational
problems. These codes are adapted from ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM and were
neither reviewed nor approved as official DSM-5 diagnoses, but can
provide additional context for a clinical formulation and treatment
plan. These three components---the criteria and their descriptive text,
the medication-induced movement disorders and other adverse effects of
medication, and the descriptions of other conditions that may be a focus
of clinical attention---represent the key elements of the clinical
diagnostic process and thus are presented together.

Neurodevelopmental Disorders The neurodevelopmental disorders are a
group of conditions with onset in the developmental period. The
disorders typically manifest early in development, often before the
child enters grade school, and are characterized by developmental
deficits that produce impairments of personal, social, academic, or
occupational functioning. The range of developmental deficits varies
from very specific limitations of learning or control of executive
functions to global impairments of social skills or intelligence. The
neurodevelopmental disorders frequently co-occur; for example,
individuals with autism spectrum disorder often have intellectual
disability (intellectual developmental disorder), and many children with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also have a specific
learning disorder. For some disorders, the clinical presentation
includes symptoms of excess as well as deficits and delays in achieving
expected milestones. For example, autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed
only when the characteristic deficits of social communication are
accompanied by excessively repetitive behaviors, restricted interests,
and insistence on sameness. Intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder) is characterized by deficits in general mental
abilities, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract
thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience. The
deficits result in impairments of adaptive functioning, such that the
individual fails to meet standards of personal independence and social
responsibility in one or more aspects of daily life, including
communication, social participation, academic or occupational
functioning, and personal independence at home or in community settings.
Global developmental delay, as its name implies, is diagnosed when an
individual fails to meet expected developmental milestones in several
areas of intellectual functioning. The diagnosis is used for individuals
who are unable to undergo systematic assessments of intellectual
functioning, including children who are too young to participate in
standardized testing. Intellectual disability may result from an
acquired insult during the

developmental period from, for example, a severe head injury, in which
case a neurocognitive disorder also may be diagnosed. The communication
disorders include language disorder, speech sound disorder, social
(pragmatic) communication disorder, and childhood-onset fluency disorder
(stuttering). The first three disorders are characterized by deficits in
the development and use of language, speech, and social communication,
respectively. Childhood-onset fluency disorder is characterized by
disturbances of the normal fluency and motor production of speech,
including repetitive sounds or syllables, prolongation of consonants or
vowel sounds, broken words, blocking, or words produced with an excess
of physical tension. Like other neurodevelopmental disorders,
communication disorders begin early in life and may produce lifelong
functional impairments. Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by
persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction
across multiple contexts, including deficits in social reciprocity,
nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and
skills in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships. In
addition to the social communication deficits, the diagnosis of autism
spectrum disorder requires the presence of restricted, repetitive
patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Because symptoms change
with development and may be masked by compensatory mechanisms, the
diagnostic criteria may be met based on historical information, although
the current presentation must cause significant impairment. Within the
diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, individual clinical
characteristics are noted through the use of specifiers (with or without
accompanying intellectual impairment; with or without accompanying
structural language impairment; associated with a known medical or
genetic condition or environmental factor; associated with another
neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder), as well as
specifiers that describe the autistic symptoms (age at first concern;
with or without loss of established skills; severity). These specifiers
provide clinicians with an opportunity to individualize the diagnosis
and communicate a richer clinical description of the affected
individuals. For example, many individuals previously diagnosed with
Asperger's disorder would now receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum
disorder without language or intellectual impairment.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by impairing levels of
inattention, disorganization, and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity.
Inattention and disorganization entail inability to stay on task,
seeming not to listen, and losing materials, at levels that are
inconsistent with age or developmental level. Hyperactivity-impulsivity
entails overactivity, fidgeting, inability to stay seated, intruding
into other people's activities, and inability to wait---symptoms that
are excessive for age or developmental level. In childhood, ADHD
frequently overlaps with disorders that are often considered to be
"externalizing disorders," such as oppositional defiant disorder and
conduct disorder. ADHD often persists into adulthood, with resultant
impairments of social, academic and occupational functioning. The
neurodevelopmental motor disorders include developmental coordination
disorder, stereotypic movement disorder, and tic disorders.
Developmental coordination disorder is characterized by deficits in the
acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills and is manifested
by clumsiness and slowness or inaccuracy of performance of motor skills
that cause interference with activities of daily living. Stereotypic
movement disorder is diagnosed when an individual has repetitive,
seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor behaviors, such as
hand flapping, body rocking, head banging, self-biting, or hitting. The
movements interfere with social, academic, or other activities. If the
behaviors cause self-injury, this should be specified as part of the
diagnostic description. Tic disorders are characterized by the presence
of motor or vocal tics, which are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic,
sterotyped motor movements or vocalizations. The duration, presumed
etiology, and clinical presentation define the specific tic disorder
that is diagnosed: Tourette's disorder, persistent (chronic) motor or
vocal tic disorder, provisional tic disorder, other specified tic
disorder, and unspecified tic disorder. Tourette's disorder is diagnosed
when the individual has multiple motor and vocal tics that have been
present for at least 1 year and that have a waxing-waning symptom
course. Specific learning disorder, as the name implies, is diagnosed
when there are specific deficits in an individual's ability to perceive
or process information efficiently and accurately. This
neurodevelopmental disorder first manifests during the years of formal
schooling and is characterized by persistent and impairing difficulties
with learning foundational academic

skills in reading, writing, and/or math. The individual's performance of
the affected academic skills is well below average for age, or
acceptable performance levels are achieved only with extraordinary
effort. Specific learning disorder may occur in individuals identified
as intellectually gifted and manifest only when the learning demands or
assessment procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose barriers that cannot be
overcome by their innate intelligence and compensatory strategies. For
all individuals, specific learning disorder can produce lifelong
impairments in activities dependent on the skills, including
occupational performance. The use of specifiers for the
neurodevelopmental disorder diagnoses enriches the clinical description
of the individual's clinical course and current symptomatology. In
addition to specifiers that describe the clinical presentation, such as
age at onset or severity ratings, the neurodevelopmental disorders may
include the specifier "associated with a known medical or genetic
condition or environmental factor." This specifier gives clinicians an
opportunity to document factors that may have played a role in the
etiology of the disorder, as well as those that might affect the
clinical course. Examples include genetic disorders, such as fragile X
syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Rett syndrome; medical conditions such
as epilepsy; and environmental factors, including very low birth weight
and fetal alcohol exposure (even in the absence of stigmata of fetal
alcohol syndrome).

Intellectual Disabilities Intellectual Disability (Intellectual
Developmental Disorder) Diagnostic Criteria Intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder) is a disorder with onset during
the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive
functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains. The
following three criteria must be met: a. Deficits in intellectual
functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract
thinking, judgment, academic learning, and

learning from experience, confirmed by both clinical assessment and
individualized, standardized intelligence testing. b. Deficits in
adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and
sociocultural standards for personal independence and social
responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit
functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as
communication, social participation, and independent living, across
multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community.
c. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental
period. Note: The diagnostic term intellectual disability is the
equivalent term for the ICD-11 diagnosis of intellectual developmental
disorders. Although the term intellectual disability is used throughout
this manual, both terms are used in the title to clarify relationships
with other classification systems. Moreover, a federal statute in the
United States (Public Law 111-256, Rosa's Law) replaces the term mental
retardation with intellectual disability, and research journals use the
term intellectual disability. Thus, intellectual disability is the term
in common use by medical, educational, and other professions and by the
lay public and advocacy groups. Specify current severity (see Table 1):

Specifiers The various levels of severity are defined on the basis of
adaptive functioning, and not IQ scores, because it is adaptive
functioning that determines the level of supports required. Moreover, IQ
measures are less valid in the lower end of the IQ range. TABLE 1

desires and emotions largely through nonverbal, nonsymbolic
communication. The individual enjoys relationships with well-known
family members, caretakers, and familiar others, and initiates and
responds to social interactions through gestural and emotional cues.
Cooccurring sensory and physical impairments may prevent many social
activities.

Individuals without severe physical impairments may assist with some
daily work tasks at home, like carrying dishes to the table. Simple
actions with objects may be the basis of participation in some
vocational activities with high levels of ongoing support. Recreational
activities may involve, for example, enjoyment in listening to music,
watching movies, going out for walks, or participating in water
activities, all with the support of others. Cooccurring physical and
sensory impairments are frequent barriers to participation (beyond
watching) in home, recreational, and vocational activities. Maladaptive
behavior is present in a significant minority.

Diagnostic Features The essential features of intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder) are deficits in general mental
abilities (Criterion A) and impairment in everyday adaptive functioning,
in comparison to an individual's age-, gender-, and socioculturally
matched peers (Criterion B).

Onset is during the developmental period (Criterion C). The diagnosis of
intellectual disability is based on both clinical assessment and
standardized testing of intellectual and adaptive functions. Criterion A
refers to intellectual functions that involve reasoning, problem
solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, learning from
instruction and experience, and practical understanding2, 4, 9, 12, 14,
22, 26. Critical components include verbal comprehension, working
memory, perceptual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract thought,
and cognitive efficacy. Intellectual functioning is typically measured
with individually administered and psychometrically valid,
comprehensive, culturally appropriate, psychometrically sound tests of
intelligence. Individuals with intellectual disability have scores of
approximately two standard deviations or more below the population mean,
including a margin for measurement error (generally +5 points). On tests
with a standard deviation of 15 and a mean of 100, this involves a score
of 65--75 (70 ± 5). Clinical training and judgment are required to
interpret test results and assess intellectual performance. Factors that
may affect test scores include practice effects and the "Flynn effect"
(i.e., overly high scores due to out-of-date test norms). Invalid scores
may result from the use of brief intelligence screening tests or group
tests; highly discrepant individual subtest scores may make an overall
IQ score invalid. Instruments must be normed for the individual's
sociocultural background and native language. Co-occurring disorders
that affect communication, language, and/or motor or sensory function
may affect test scores. Individual cognitive profiles based on
neuropsychological testing are more useful for understanding
intellectual abilities than a single IQ score. Such testing may identify
areas of relative strengths and weaknesses, an assessment important for
academic and vocational planning. IQ test scores are approximations of
conceptual functioning but may be insufficient to assess reasoning in
real-life situations and mastery of practical tasks6, 9, 22, 27. For
example, a person with an IQ score above 70 may have such severe
adaptive behavior problems in social judgment, social understanding, and
other areas of adaptive functioning that the person's actual functioning
is comparable to that of individuals with a lower IQ score. Thus,
clinical judgment is needed in interpreting the results of IQ tests.

Deficits in adaptive functioning (Criterion B) refer to how well a
person meets community standards of personal independence and social
responsibility, in comparison to others of similar age and sociocultural
background25. Adaptive functioning involves adaptive reasoning in three
domains: conceptual, social, and practical. The conceptual (academic)
domain involves competence in memory, language, reading, writing, math
reasoning, acquisition of practical knowledge, problem solving, and
judgment in novel situations, among others. The social domain involves
awareness of others' thoughts, feelings, and experiences; empathy;
interpersonal communication skills; friendship abilities; and social
judgment, among others. The practical domain involves learning and
selfmanagement across life settings, including personal care, job
responsibilities, money management, recreation, self-management of
behavior, and school and work task organization, among others.
Intellectual capacity, education, motivation, socialization, personality
features, vocational opportunity, cultural experience, and coexisting
general medical conditions or mental disorders influence adaptive
functioning. Adaptive functioning is assessed using both clinical
evaluation and individualized, culturally appropriate, psychometrically
sound measures. Standardized measures are used with knowledgeable
informants (e.g., parent or other family member; teacher; counselor;
care provider) and the individual to the extent possible. Additional
sources of information include educational, developmental, medical, and
mental health evaluations. Scores from standardized measures and
interview sources must be interpreted using clinical judgment. When
standardized testing is difficult or impossible, because of a variety of
factors (e.g., sensory impairment, severe problem behavior), the
individual may be diagnosed with unspecified intellectual disability.
Adaptive functioning may be difficult to assess in a controlled setting
(e.g., prisons, detention centers); if possible, corroborative
information reflecting functioning outside those settings should be
obtained. Criterion B is met when at least one domain of adaptive
functioning--- conceptual, social, or practical---is sufficiently
impaired that ongoing support is needed in order for the person to
perform adequately in one or more life settings at school, at work, at
home, or in the community. To meet diagnostic criteria for intellectual
disability, the deficits in adaptive functioning must be directly
related to the intellectual impairments

described in Criterion A. Criterion C, onset during the developmental
period, refers to recognition that intellectual and adaptive deficits
are present during childhood or adolescence.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Intellectual disability is a
heterogeneous condition with multiple causes. There may be associated
difficulties with social judgment; assessment of risk; self-management
of behavior, emotions, or interpersonal relationships; or motivation in
school or work environments. Lack of communication skills may predispose
to disruptive and aggressive behaviors. Gullibility is often a feature,
involving naiveté in social situations and a tendency for being easily
led by others7, 8. Gullibility and lack of awareness of risk may result
in exploitation by others and possible victimization, fraud,
unintentional criminal involvement, false confessions, and risk for
physical and sexual abuse. These associated features can be important in
criminal cases, including Atkins-type hearings involving the death
penalty5, 24. Individuals with a diagnosis of intellectual disability
with co-occurring mental disorders are at risk for suicide. They think
about suicide, make suicide attempts, and may die from them13. Thus,
screening for suicidal thoughts is essential in the assessment process.
Because of a lack of awareness of risk and danger, accidental injury
rates may be increased3.

Prevalence Intellectual disability has an overall general population
prevalence of approximately 1%, and prevalence rates vary by age.
Prevalence for severe intellectual disability is approximately 6 per
1,0001, 19.

Development and Course Onset of intellectual disability is in the
developmental period. The age and characteristic features at onset
depend on the etiology and severity of brain dysfunction. Delayed motor,
language, and social milestones may be identifiable within the first 2
years of life among those with more severe intellectual disability,
while mild levels may not be identifiable until school age when
difficulty with academic learning becomes apparent18. All criteria
(including Criterion C) must be fulfilled by history or current
presentation. Some children under age 5 years whose presentation will
eventually meet

criteria for intellectual disability have deficits that meet criteria
for global developmental delay. When intellectual disability is
associated with a genetic syndrome, there may be a characteristic
physical appearance (as in, e.g., Down syndrome). Some syndromes have a
behavioral phenotype, which refers to specific behaviors that are
characteristic of particular genetic disorder (e.g., LeschNyhan
syndrome)10. In acquired forms, the onset may be abrupt following an
illness such as meningitis or encephalitis or head trauma occurring
during the developmental period. When intellectual disability results
from a loss of previously acquired cognitive skills, as in severe
traumatic brain injury, the diagnoses of intellectual disability and of
a neurocognitive disorder may both be assigned. Although intellectual
disability is generally nonprogressive, in certain genetic disorders
(e.g., Rett syndrome) there are periods of worsening, followed by
stabilization, and in others (e.g., San Phillippo syndrome) progressive
worsening of intellectual function. After early childhood, the disorder
is generally lifelong, although severity levels may change over time.
The course may be influenced by underlying medical or genetic conditions
and co-occurring conditions (e.g., hearing or visual impairments,
epilepsy). Early and ongoing interventions may improve adaptive
functioning throughout childhood and adulthood. In some cases, these
result in significant improvement of intellectual functioning, such that
the diagnosis of intellectual disability is no longer appropriate. Thus,
it is common practice when assessing infants and young children to delay
diagnosis of intellectual disability until after an appropriate course
of intervention is provided. For older children and adults, the extent
of support provided may allow for full participation in all activities
of daily living and improved adaptive function. Diagnostic assessments
must determine whether improved adaptive skills are the result of a
stable, generalized new skill acquisition (in which case the diagnosis
of intellectual disability may no longer be appropriate) or whether the
improvement is contingent on the presence of supports and ongoing
interventions (in which case the diagnosis of intellectual disability
may still be appropriate).

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Prenatal
etiologies include genetic syndromes (e.g., sequence variations or copy
number variants involving one or more

genes; chromosomal disorders)11, inborn errors of metabolism, brain
malformations, maternal disease (including placental disease)16, and
environmental influences (e.g., alcohol, other drugs, toxins,
teratogens). Perinatal causes include a variety of labor and
delivery-related events leading to neonatal encephalopathy. Postnatal
causes include hypoxic ischemic injury, traumatic brain injury,
infections, demyelinating disorders, seizure disorders (e.g., infantile
spasms), severe and chronic social deprivation, and toxic metabolic
syndromes and intoxications (e.g., lead, mercury)9.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Intellectual disability occurs in all
races and cultures. Cultural sensitivity and knowledge are needed during
assessment, and the individual's ethnic, cultural, and linguistic
background, available experiences, and adaptive functioning within his
or her community and cultural setting must be taken into account.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Overall, males are more likely than
females to be diagnosed with both mild (average male:female ratio 1.6:1)
and severe (average male:female ratio 1.2:1) forms of intellectual
disability1. However, gender ratios vary widely in reported studies.
Sex-linked genetic factors and male vulnerability to brain insult may
account for some of the gender differences9.

Diagnostic Markers A comprehensive evaluation includes an assessment of
intellectual capacity and adaptive functioning; identification of
genetic and nongenetic etiologies; evaluation for associated medical
conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, seizure disorder); and evaluation for
co-occurring mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Components of
the evaluation may include basic preand perinatal medical history,
three-generational family pedigree, physical examination, genetic
evaluation (e.g., karyotype or chromosomal microarray analysis and
testing for specific genetic syndromes), and metabolic screening and
neuroimaging assessment.

Differential Diagnosis

The diagnosis of intellectual disability should be made whenever
Criteria A, B, and C are met. A diagnosis of intellectual disability
should not be assumed because of a particular genetic or medical
condition. A genetic syndrome linked to intellectual disability should
be noted as a concurrent diagnosis with the intellectual disability.
Major and mild neurocognitive disorders. Intellectual disability is
categorized as a neurodevelopmental disorder and is distinct from the
neurocognitive disorders, which are characterized by a loss of cognitive
functioning. Major neurocognitive disorder may co-occur with
intellectual disability (e.g., an individual with Down syndrome who
develops Alzheimer's disease, or an individual with intellectual
disability who loses further cognitive capacity following a head
injury). In such cases, the diagnoses of intellectual disability and
neurocognitive disorder may both be given. Communication disorders and
specific learning disorder. These neurodevelopmental disorders are
specific to the communication and learning domains and do not show
deficits in intellectual and adaptive behavior. They may co-occur with
intellectual disability. Both diagnoses are made if full criteria are
met for intellectual disability and a communication disorder or specific
learning disorder. Autism spectrum disorder. Intellectual disability is
common among individuals with autism spectrum disorder15, 17. Assessment
of intellectual ability may be complicated by social-communication and
behavior deficits inherent to autism spectrum disorder, which may
interfere with understanding and complying with test procedures.
Appropriate assessment of intellectual functioning in autism spectrum
disorder is essential, with reassessment across the developmental
period, because IQ scores in autism spectrum disorder may be unstable,
particularly in early childhood.

Comorbidity Co-occurring mental, neurodevelopmental, medical, and
physical conditions are frequent in intellectual disability, with rates
of some conditions (e.g., mental disorders, cerebral palsy, and
epilepsy) three to four times higher than in the general population9.
The prognosis and outcome of co-occurring diagnoses may be influenced by
the presence of intellectual disability. Assessment procedures may
require modifications because of

associated disorders, including communication disorders, autism spectrum
disorder, and motor, sensory, or other disorders. Knowledgeable
informants are essential for identifying symptoms such as irritability,
mood dysregulation, aggression, eating problems, and sleep problems, and
for assessing adaptive functioning in various community settings. The
most common co-occurring mental and neurodevelopmental disorders are
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; depressive and bipolar
disorders; anxiety disorders; autism spectrum disorder; stereotypic
movement disorder (with or without self-injurious behavior);
impulsecontrol disorders; and major neurocognitive disorder. Major
depressive disorder may occur throughout the range of severity of
intellectual disability. Self-injurious behavior requires prompt
diagnostic attention and may warrant a separate diagnosis of stereotypic
movement disorder. Individuals with intellectual disability,
particularly those with more severe intellectual disability, may also
exhibit aggression and disruptive behaviors, including harm of others or
property destruction.

Relationship to Other Classifications ICD-11 (in development at the time
of this publication) uses the term intellectual developmental disorders
to indicate that these are disorders that involve impaired brain
functioning early in life. These disorders are described in ICD-11 as a
metasyndrome occurring in the developmental period analogous to dementia
or neurocognitive disorder in later life20, 21, 26. There are four
subtypes in ICD-11: mild, moderate, severe, and profound. The American
Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) also
uses the term intellectual disability with a similar meaning to the term
as used in this manual. The AAIDD's classification is multidimensional
rather than categorical and is based on the disability construct. Rather
than listing specifiers as is done in DSM-5, the AAIDD emphasizes a
profile of supports based on severity23.

Global Developmental Delay 315.8 (F88) This diagnosis is reserved for
individuals under the age of 5 years when the clinical severity level
cannot be reliably assessed during early childhood. This category is
diagnosed when an individual fails to meet expected developmental
milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning, and applies to
individuals who are unable to undergo systematic assessments of
intellectual functioning, including children who are too young to
participate in standardized testing. This category requires reassessment
after a period of time.

Unspecified Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental
Disorder) 319 (F79) This category is reserved for individuals over the
age of 5 years when assessment of the degree of intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder) by means of locally available
procedures is

rendered difficult or impossible because of associated sensory or
physical impairments, as in blindness or prelingual deafness; locomotor
disability; or presence of severe problem behaviors or co-occurring
mental disorder. This category should only be used in exceptional
circumstances and requires reassessment after a period of time.

Communication Disorders Disorders of communication include deficits in
language, speech, and communication. Speech is the expressive production
of sounds and includes an individual's articulation, fluency, voice, and
resonance quality. Language includes the form, function, and use of a
conventional system of symbols (i.e., spoken words, sign language,
written words, pictures) in a rulegoverned manner for communication.
Communication includes any verbal or nonverbal behavior (whether
intentional or unintentional) that influences the behavior, ideas, or
attitudes of another individual. Assessments of speech, language and
communication abilities must take into account the individual's cultural
and language context, particularly for individuals growing up in
bilingual environments. The standardized measures of language
development and of nonverbal intellectual capacity must be relevant for
the cultural and linguistic group (i.e., tests developed and
standardized for one group may not provide appropriate norms for a
different group). The diagnostic category of communication disorders
includes the following: language disorder, speech sound disorder,
childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering), social (pragmatic)
communication disorder, and other specified and unspecified
communication disorders.

Language Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

315.32 (F80.2)

a.  Persistent difficulties in the acquisition and use of language
    across modalities (i.e., spoken, written, sign language, or other)
    due to deficits in comprehension or production that include the
    following:

<!-- -->

1.  Reduced vocabulary (word knowledge and use).

2. Limited sentence structure (ability to put words and word endings
together to form sentences based on the rules of grammar and
morphology). 3. Impairments in discourse (ability to use vocabulary and
connect sentences to explain or describe a topic or series of events or
have a conversation). b. Language abilities are substantially and
quantifiably below those expected for age, resulting in functional
limitations in effective communication, social participation, academic
achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any
combination. c. Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.
d. The difficulties are not attributable to hearing or other sensory
impairment, motor dysfunction, or another medical or neurological
condition and are not better explained by intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay.

Diagnostic Features The core diagnostic features of language disorder
are difficulties in the acquisition and use of language due to deficits
in the comprehension or production of vocabulary, sentence structure,
and discourse. The language deficits are evident in spoken
communication, written communication, or sign language. Language
learning and use is dependent on both receptive and expressive skills.
Expressive ability refers to the production of vocal, gestural, or
verbal signals, while receptive ability refers to the process of
receiving and comprehending language messages. Language skills need to
be assessed in both expressive and receptive modalities as these may
differ in severity. For example, an individual's expressive language may
be severely impaired, while his receptive language is hardly impaired at
all. Language disorder usually affects vocabulary and grammar, and these
effects then limit the capacity for discourse. The child's first words
and phrases are likely to be delayed in onset2, vocabulary size is
smaller and less varied than expected; and sentences are shorter and
less complex with grammatical errors, especially in past tense6, 8.
Deficits in comprehension of language are frequently underestimated, as
children may be good at

using context to infer meaning. There may be word-finding problems,
impoverished verbal definitions, or poor understanding of synonyms,
multiple meanings, or word play appropriate for age and culture.
Problems with remembering new words and sentences are manifested by
difficulties following instructions of increasing length, difficulties
rehearsing strings of verbal information (e.g., remembering a phone
number or a shopping list), and difficulties remembering novel sound
sequences, a skill that may be important for learning new words.
Difficulties with discourse are shown by a reduced ability to provide
adequate information about the key events and to narrate a coherent
story. The language difficulty is manifest by abilities substantially
and quantifiably below that expected for age and significantly
interfering with academic achievement, occupational performance,
effective communication, or socialization (Criterion B). A diagnosis of
language disorder is made based on the synthesis of the individual's
history, direct clinical observation in different contexts (i.e., home,
school, or work), and scores from standardized tests of language ability
that can be used to guide estimates of severity.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis A positive family history of
language disorders is often present. Individuals, even children, can be
adept at accommodating to their limited language. They may appear to be
shy or reticent to talk. Affected individuals may prefer to communicate
only with family members or other familiar individuals. Although these
social indicators are not diagnostic of a language disorder, if they are
notable and persistent, they warrant referral for a full language
assessment. Language disorder, particularly expressive deficits, may
co-occur with speech sound disorder11.

Development and Course Language acquisition is marked by changes from
onset in toddlerhood to the adult level of competency that appears
during adolescence. Changes appear across the dimensions of language
(sounds, words, grammar, narratives/expository texts, and conversational
skills) in age-graded increments and synchronies. Language disorder
emerges during the early developmental period; however, there is
considerable variation in early

vocabulary acquisition and early word combinations, and individual
differences are not, as single indicators, highly predictive of later
outcomes. By age 4 years, individual differences in language ability are
more stable, with better measurement accuracy, and are highly predictive
of later outcomes4, 10. Language disorder diagnosed from 4 years of age
is likely to be stable over time3 and typically persists into
adulthood7, although the particular profile of language strengths and
deficits is likely to change over the course of development.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Children with receptive language impairments
have a poorer prognosis than those with predominantly expressive
impairments. They are more resistant to treatment, and difficulties with
reading comprehension are frequently seen. Genetic and physiological.
Language disorders are highly heritable, and family members are more
likely to have a history of language impairment.

Differential Diagnosis Normal variations in language. Language disorder
needs to be distinguished from normal developmental variations, and this
distinction may be difficult to make before 4 years of age. Regional,
social, or cultural/ethnic variations of language (e.g., dialects) must
be considered when an individual is being assessed for language
impairment. Hearing or other sensory impairment. Hearing impairment
needs to be excluded as the primary cause of language difficulties.
Language deficits may be associated with a hearing impairment, other
sensory deficit, or a speech-motor deficit. When language deficits are
in excess of those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis
of language disorder may be made. Intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder). Language delay is often the presenting feature
of intellectual disability, and the definitive diagnosis may not be made
until the child is able to complete standardized assessments. A separate
diagnosis is not given unless the language deficits are clearly in
excess of the intellectual limitations.

Neurological disorders. Language disorder can be acquired in association
with neurological disorders, including epilepsy (e.g., acquired aphasia
or Landau-Kleffner syndrome). Language regression. Loss of speech and
language in a child younger than 3 years may be a sign of autism
spectrum disorder (with developmental regression) or a specific
neurological condition, such as Landau-Kleffner syndrome. Among children
older than 3 years, language loss may be a symptom of seizures, and a
diagnostic assessment is necessary to exclude the presence of epilepsy
(e.g., routine and sleep electroencephalogram).

Comorbidity Language disorder is strongly associated with other
neurodevelopmental disorders in terms of specific learning disorder
(literacy and numeracy), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
autism spectrum disorder, and developmental coordination disorder2, 5,
12. It is also associated with social (pragmatic) communication
disorder1. A positive family history of speech or language disorders is
often present9.

Speech Sound Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

315.39 (F80.0)

a.  Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes
    with speech intelligibility or prevents verbal communication of
    messages.
b.  The disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that
    interfere with social participation, academic achievement, or
    occupational performance, individually or in any combination.
c.  Onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.

d. The difficulties are not attributable to congenital or acquired
conditions, such as cerebral palsy, cleft palate, deafness or hearing
loss, traumatic brain injury, or other medical or neurological
conditions.

Diagnostic Features Speech sound production describes the clear
articulation of the phonemes (i.e., individual sounds) that in
combination make up spoken words. Speech sound production requires both
the phonological knowledge of speech sounds and the ability to
coordinate the movements of the articulators (i.e., the jaw, tongue, and
lips,) with breathing and vocalizing for speech. Children with speech
production difficulties may experience difficulty with phonological
knowledge of speech sounds or the ability to coordinate movements for
speech in varying degrees. Speech sound disorder is thus heterogeneous
in its underlying mechanisms and includes phonological disorder and
articulation disorder. A speech sound disorder is diagnosed when speech
sound production is not what would be expected based on the child's age
and developmental stage and when the deficits are not the result of a
physical, structural, neurological, or hearing impairment. Among
typically developing children at age 4 years, overall speech should be
intelligible, whereas at age 2 years, only 50% may be understandable.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Language disorder, particularly
expressive deficits, may be found to cooccur with speech sound
disorder4. A positive family history of speech or language disorders is
often present. If the ability to rapidly coordinate the articulators is
a particular aspect of difficulty, there may be a history of delay or
incoordination in acquiring skills that also utilize the articulators
and related facial musculature; among others, these skills include
chewing, maintaining mouth closure, and blowing the nose. Other areas of
motor coordination may be impaired as in developmental coordination
disorder. Verbal dyspraxia is a term also used for speech production
problems. Speech may be differentially impaired in certain genetic
conditions (e.g., Down syndrome, 22q deletion, FoxP2 gene mutation). If
present, these

should also be coded.

Development and Course Learning to produce speech sounds clearly and
accurately and learning to produce connected speech fluently are
developmental skills. Articulation of speech sounds follows a
developmental pattern, which is reflected in the age norms of
standardized tests. It is not unusual for typically developing children
to use developmental processes for shortening words and syllables as
they are learning to talk, but their progression in mastering speech
sound production should result in mostly intelligible speech by age 3
years. Children with speech sound disorder continue to use immature
phonological simplification processes past the age when most children
can produce words clearly. Most speech sounds should be produced clearly
and most words should be pronounced accurately according to age and
community norms by age 7 years3. The most frequently misarticulated
sounds also tend to be learned later, leading them to be called the
"late eight" (l, r, s, z, th, ch, dzh, and zh)2. Misarticulation of any
of these sounds by itself could be considered within normal limits up to
age 8 years. When multiple sounds are involved, it may be appropriate to
target some of those sounds as part of a plan to improve intelligibility
prior to the age at which almost all children can produce them
accurately. Lisping (i.e., misarticulating sibilants) is particularly
common and may involve frontal or lateral patterns of airstream
direction. It may be associated with an abnormal tongue-thrust
swallowing pattern. Most children with speech sound disorder respond
well to treatment, and speech difficulties improve over time, and thus
the disorder may not be lifelong4. However, when a language disorder is
also present, the speech disorder has a poorer prognosis and may be
associated with specific learning disorders.

Differential Diagnosis Normal variations in speech. Regional, social, or
cultural/ethnic variations of speech should be considered before making
the diagnosis. Hearing or other sensory impairment. Hearing impairment
or deafness may result in abnormalities of speech. Deficits of speech
sound production

may be associated with a hearing impairment, other sensory deficit, or a
speech-motor deficit. When speech deficits are in excess of those
usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of speech sound
disorder may be made. Structural deficits. (e.g., cleft palate).

Speech impairment may be due to structural deficits

Dysarthria. Speech impairment may be attributable to a motor disorder,
such as cerebral palsy. Neurological signs, as well as distinctive
features of voice, differentiate dysarthria from speech sound disorder,
although in young children (under 3 years) differentiation may be
difficult, particularly when there is no or minimal general body motor
involvement (as in, e.g., Worster-Drought syndrome). Selective mutism.
Limited use of speech may be a sign of selective mutism, an anxiety
disorder that is characterized by a lack of speech in one or more
contexts or settings. Selective mutism may develop in children with a
speech disorder because of embarassment about their impairments, but
many children with selective mutism exhibit normal speech in "safe"
settings, such as at home or with close friends1.

Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)

Diagnostic Criteria

315.35 (F80.81)

a.  Disturbances in the normal fluency and time patterning of speech
    that are inappropriate for the individual's age and language skills,
    persist over time, and are characterized by frequent and marked
    occurrences of one (or more) of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Sound and syllable repetitions.
2.  Sound prolongations of consonants as well as vowels.
3.  Broken words (e.g., pauses within a word).
4.  Audible or silent blocking (filled or unfilled pauses in speech).
5.  Circumlocutions (word substitutions to avoid problematic words).
6.  Words produced with an excess of physical tension.
7.  Monosyllabic whole-word repetitions (e.g., "I-I-I-I see him").

<!-- -->

b.  The disturbance causes anxiety about speaking or limitations in
    effective communication, social participation, or academic or
    occupational performance, individually or in any combination.
c.  The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period. (Note:
    Later-onset cases are diagnosed as 307.0 \[F98.5\] adult-onset
    fluency disorder.)
d.  The disturbance is not attributable to a speech-motor or sensory
    deficit, dysfluency associated with neurological insult (e.g.,
    stroke, tumor, trauma), or another medical condition and is not
    better explained by another mental disorder.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of childhood-onset fluency
disorder (stuttering) is a disturbance in the normal fluency and time
patterning of speech that is inappropriate for the individual's age.
This disturbance is characterized by frequent repetitions or
prolongations of sounds or syllables and by other types of speech
dysfluencies, including broken words (e.g., pauses within a word),
audible or silent blocking (i.e., filled or unfilled pauses in speech),
circumlocutions (i.e., word substitutions to avoid problematic words),

words produced with an excess of physical tension, and monosyllabic
whole-word repetitions (e.g., "I-I-I-I see him"). The disturbance in
fluency interferes with academic or occupational achievement or with
social communication. The extent of the disturbance varies from
situation to situation and often is more severe when there is special
pressure to communicate (e.g., giving a report at school, interviewing
for a job). Dysfluency is often absent during oral reading, singing, or
talking to inanimate objects or to pets.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Fearful anticipation of the
problem may develop. The speaker may attempt to avoid dysfluencies by
linguistic mechanisms (e.g., altering the rate of speech, avoiding
certain words or sounds) or by avoiding certain speech situations, such
as telephoning or public speaking. In addition to being features of the
condition, stress and anxiety have been shown to exacerbate dysfluency.
Childhood-onset fluency disorder may also be accompanied by motor
movements (e.g., eye blinks, tics, tremors of the lips or face, jerking
of the head, breathing movements, fist clenching). Children with fluency
disorder show a range of language abilities, and the relationship
between fluency disorder and language abilities is unclear3.

Development and Course Childhood-onset fluency disorder, or
developmental stuttering, occurs by age 6 for 80%--90% of affected
individuals, with age at onset ranging from 2 to 7 years2. The onset can
be insidious or more sudden. Typically, dysfluencies start gradually,
with repetition of initial consonants, first words of a phrase, or long
words. The child may not be aware of dysfluencies. As the disorder
progresses, the dysfluencies become more frequent and interfering,
occurring on the most meaningful words or phrases in the utterance. As
the child becomes aware of the speech difficulty, he or she may develop
mechanisms for avoiding the dysfluencies and emotional responses,
including avoidance of public speaking and use of short and simple
utterances. Longitudinal research shows that 65%--85% of children
recover from the dysfluency2, 4, with severity of fluency disorder at
age 8 years predicting recovery or persistence into adolescence and
beyond1.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. The risk of
stuttering among first-degree biological relatives of individuals with
childhood-onset fluency disorder is more than three times the risk in
the general population.

Functional Consequences of Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)
In addition to being features of the condition, stress and anxiety can
exacerbate dysfluency. Impairment of social functioning may result from
this anxiety.

Differential Diagnosis Sensory deficits. Dysfluencies of speech may be
associated with a hearing impairment or other sensory deficit or a
speech-motor deficit. When the speech dysfluencies are in excess of
those usually associated with these problems, a diagnosis of
childhood-onset fluency disorder may be made. Normal speech
dysfluencies. The disorder must be distinguished from normal
dysfluencies that occur frequently in young children, which include
whole-word or phrase repetitions (e.g., "I want, I want ice cream"),
incomplete phrases, interjections, unfilled pauses, and parenthetical
remarks. If these difficulties increase in frequency or complexity as
the child grows older, a diagnosis of childhood-onset fluency disorder
is appropriate. Medication side effects. Stuttering may occur as a side
effect of medication and may be detected by a temporal relationship with
exposure to the medication. Adult-onset dysfluencies. If onset of
dysfluencies is during or after adolescence, it is an "adult-onset
dysfluency" rather than a neurodevelopmental disorder. Adult-onset
dysfluencies are associated with specific neurological insults and a
variety of medical conditions and mental disorders and may be specified
with them, but they are not a DSM-5 diagnosis. Tourette's disorder.
Vocal tics and repetitive vocalizations of Tourette's disorder should be
distinguishable from the repetitive sounds of childhood-

onset fluency disorder by their nature and timing.

Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

315.39 (F80.89)

a.  Persistent difficulties in the social use of verbal and nonverbal
    communication as manifested by all of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Deficits in using communication for social purposes, such as
    greeting and sharing information, in a manner that is appropriate
    for the social context.
2.  Impairment of the ability to change communication to match context
    or the needs of the listener, such as speaking differently in a
    classroom than on a playground, talking differently to a child than
    to an adult, and avoiding use of overly formal language.
3.  Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling, such
    as taking turns in conversation, rephrasing when misunderstood, and
    knowing how to use verbal and nonverbal signals to regulate
    interaction.
4.  Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g.,
    making inferences) and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of

language (e.g., idioms, humor, metaphors, multiple meanings that depend
on the context for interpretation). b. The deficits result in functional
limitations in effective communication, social participation, social
relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance,
individually or in combination. c. The onset of the symptoms is in the
early developmental period (but deficits may not become fully manifest
until social communication demands exceed limited capacities). d. The
symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological
condition or to low abilities in the domains of word structure and
grammar, and are not better explained by autism spectrum disorder,
intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), global
developmental delay, or another mental disorder.

Diagnostic Features Social (pragmatic) communication disorder is
characterized by a primary difficulty with pragmatics, or the social use
of language and communication, as manifested by deficits in
understanding and following social rules of verbal and nonverbal
communication in naturalistic contexts, changing language according to
the needs of the listener or situation, and following rules for
conversations and storytelling. The deficits in social communication
result in functional limitations in effective communication, social
participation, development of social relationships, academic
achievement, or occupational performance. The deficits are not better
explained by low abilities in the domains of structural language or
cognitive ability.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The most common associated
feature of social (pragmatic) communication disorder is language
impairment2, which is characterized by a history of delay in reaching
language milestones, and historical, if not current, structural language
problems (see "Language Disorder" earlier in this chapter). Individuals
with social communication deficits may avoid social interactions.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), behavioral

problems, and specific learning disorders are also more common among
affected individuals6, 7.

Development and Course Because social (pragmatic) communication depends
on adequate developmental progress in speech and language, diagnosis of
social (pragmatic) communication disorder is rare among children younger
than 4 years. By age 4 or 5 years, most children should possess adequate
speech and language abilities to permit identification of specific
deficits in social communication. Milder forms of the disorder may not
become apparent until early adolescence, when language and social
interactions become more complex. The outcome of social (pragmatic)
communication disorder is variable, with some children improving
substantially over time and others continuing to have difficulties
persisting into adulthood. Even among those who have significant
improvements, the early deficits in pragmatics may cause lasting
impairments in social relationships and behavior7, 13 and also in
acquisition of other related skills, such as written expression5.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. A family history
of autism spectrum disorder, communication disorders, or specific
learning disorder appears to increase the risk for social (pragmatic)
communication disorder8, 12.

Differential Diagnosis Autism spectrum disorder. Autism spectrum
disorder is the primary diagnostic consideration for individuals
presenting with social communication deficits. The two disorders can be
differentiated by the presence in autism spectrum disorder of
restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities and
their absence in social (pragmatic) communication disorder2, 3, 9, 10.
Individuals with autism spectrum disorder may only display the
restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities
during the early developmental period, so a comprehensive history should
be obtained. Current absence of symptoms would not preclude a diagnosis
of autism spectrum disorder, if the restricted interests and repetitive
behaviors were present in the past. A diagnosis of social

(pragmatic) communication disorder should be considered only if the
developmental history fails to reveal any evidence of
restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Primary deficits of ADHD may
cause impairments in social communication and functional limitations of
effective communication, social participation, or academic achievement1.
Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). The symptoms of social
communication disorder overlap with those of social anxiety disorder4.
The differentiating feature is the timing of the onset of symptoms. In
social (pragmatic) communication disorder, the individual has never had
effective social communication; in social anxiety disorder, the social
communication skills developed appropriately but are not utilized
because of anxiety, fear, or distress about social interactions.
Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) and global
developmental delay. Social communication skills may be deficient among
individuals with global developmental delay or intellectual
disability11, but a separate diagnosis is not given unless the social
communication deficits are clearly in excess of the intellectual
limitations.

Unspecified Communication Disorder 307.9 (F80.9) This category applies
to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of communication
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or

impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
communication disorder or for any of the disorders in the
neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
communication disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for communication disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental
disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Autism Spectrum Disorder Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

299.00 (F84.0)

a.  Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction
    across multiple contexts, as manifested by all of the following,
    currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive;
    see text):

<!-- -->

1.  Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from
    abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-andforth
    conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect;
    to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions.
2.  Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social
    interaction, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and
    nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body
    language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a
    total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication.
3.  Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding
    relationships, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting
    behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing
    imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in
    peers.

Specify current severity: Severity is based on social communication
impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (see Table
2). b. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or
activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or
by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text): 1.
Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech
(e.g., simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects,
echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases). 2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible
adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal
behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with
transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take
same route or eat same food every day). 3. Highly restricted, fixated
interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., strong
attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively
circumscribed or perseverative interests). 4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity
to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the
environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse
response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching
of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement). Specify current
severity: Severity is based on social communication impairments and
restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior (see Table 2). c. Symptoms
must be present in the early developmental period (but may not become
fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be
masked by learned strategies in later life). d. Symptoms cause
clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of current functioning. e. These disturbances are not
better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental
disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and
autism spectrum disorder frequently co-

occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and
intellectual disability, social communication should be below that
expected for general developmental level. Note: Individuals with a
well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger's
disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified
should be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals
who have marked deficits in social communication, but whose symptoms do
not otherwise meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder, should be
evaluated for social (pragmatic) communication disorder. Specify if:
With or without accompanying intellectual impairment With or without
accompanying language impairment Associated with a known medical or
genetic condition or environmental factor (Coding note: Use additional
code to identify the associated medical or genetic condition.)
Associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral
disorder (Coding note: Use additional code\[s\] to identify the
associated neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder\[s\].)
With catatonia (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with
another mental disorder, pp. 119--120, for definition) (Coding note: Use
additional code 293.89 \[F06.1\] catatonia associated with autism
spectrum disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid catatonia.)

Recording Procedures For autism spectrum disorder that is associated
with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor, or
with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder, record
autism spectrum disorder associated with (name of condition, disorder,
or factor) (e.g., autism spectrum disorder associated with Rett
syndrome). Severity should be recorded as level of support needed for
each of the two psychopathological domains in Table 2 (e.g., "requiring
very substantial support for deficits in social communication and
requiring substantial support for restricted, repetitive behaviors").
Specification of "with accompanying intellectual impairment" or "without
accompanying

intellectual impairment" should be recorded next. Language impairment
specification should be recorded thereafter. If there is accompanying
language impairment, the current level of verbal functioning should be
recorded (e.g., "with accompanying language impairment---no intelligible
speech" or "with accompanying language impairment---phrase speech"). If
catatonia is present, record separately "catatonia associated with
autism spectrum disorder."

Specifiers The severity specifiers (see Table 2) may be used to describe
succinctly the current symptomatology (which might fall below level 1),
with the recognition that severity may vary by context and fluctuate
over time. Severity of social communication difficulties and restricted,
repetitive behaviors should be separately rated. The descriptive
severity categories should not be used to determine eligibility for and
provision of services; these can only be developed at an individual
level and through discussion of personal priorities and targets.
Regarding the specifier "with or without accompanying intellectual
impairment," understanding the (often uneven) intellectual profile of a
child or adult with autism spectrum disorder is necessary for
interpreting diagnostic features. Separate estimates of verbal and
nonverbal skill are necessary (e.g., using untimed nonverbal tests to
assess potential strengths in individuals with limited language). TABLE

or without accompanying language impairment," the current level of
verbal functioning should be assessed and described. Examples of the
specific descriptions for "with accompanying

language impairment" might include no intelligible speech (nonverbal),
single words only, or phrase speech. Language level in individuals
"without accompanying language impairment" might be further described by
speaks in full sentences or has fluent speech. Since receptive language
may lag behind expressive language development in autism spectrum
disorder, receptive and expressive language skills should be considered
separately. The specifier "associated with a known medical or genetic
condition or environmental factor" should be used when the individual
has a known genetic disorder (e.g., Rett syndrome, Fragile X syndrome,
Down syndrome), a medical disorder (e.g., epilepsy), or a history of
environmental exposure (e.g., valproate, fetal alcohol syndrome, very
low birth weight). Additional neurodevelopmental, mental or behavioral
conditions should also be noted (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder; developmental coordination disorder; disruptive behavior,
impulse-control, or conduct disorders; anxiety, depressive, or bipolar
disorders; tics or Tourette's disorder; self-injury; feeding,
elimination, or sleep disorders).

Diagnostic Features The essential features of autism spectrum disorder
are persistent impairment in reciprocal social communication and social
interaction (Criterion A), and restricted, repetitive patterns of
behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B). These symptoms are
present from early childhood and limit or impair everyday functioning
(Criteria C and D). The stage at which functional impairment becomes
obvious will vary according to characteristics of the individual and his
or her environment. Core diagnostic features are evident in the
developmental period, but intervention, compensation, and current
supports may mask difficulties in at least some contexts. Manifestations
of the disorder also vary greatly depending on the severity of the
autistic condition, developmental level, and chronological age; hence,
the term spectrum. Autism spectrum disorder encompasses disorders
previously referred to as early infantile autism, childhood autism,
Kanner's autism, high-functioning autism, atypical autism, pervasive
developmental disorder not otherwise specified, childhood disintegrative
disorder, and Asperger's disorder. The impairments in communication and
social interaction specified in Criterion A are pervasive and sustained.
Diagnoses are most valid and reliable when based on multiple sources of
information, including

clinician's observations, caregiver history, and, when possible,
self-report. Verbal and nonverbal deficits in social communication have
varying manifestations, depending on the individual's age, intellectual
level, and language ability, as well as other factors such as treatment
history and current support. Many individuals have language deficits,
ranging from complete lack of speech through language delays, poor
comprehension of speech, echoed speech, or stilted and overly literal
language. Even when formal language skills (e.g., vocabulary, grammar)
are intact, the use of language for reciprocal social communication is
impaired in autism spectrum disorder. Deficits in social-emotional
reciprocity (i.e., the ability to engage with others and share thoughts
and feelings) are clearly evident in young children with the disorder,
who may show little or no initiation of social interaction and no
sharing of emotions, along with reduced or absent imitation of others'
behavior. What language exists is often one-sided, lacking in social
reciprocity, and used to request or label rather than to comment, share
feelings, or converse. In adults without intellectual disabilities or
language delays, deficits in social-emotional reciprocity may be most
apparent in difficulties processing and responding to complex social
cues (e.g., when and how to join a conversation, what not to say).
Adults who have developed compensation strategies for some social
challenges still struggle in novel or unsupported situations and suffer
from the effort and anxiety of consciously calculating what is socially
intuitive for most individuals. Deficits in nonverbal communicative
behaviors used for social interaction are manifested by absent, reduced,
or atypical use of eye contact (relative to cultural norms), gestures,
facial expressions, body orientation, or speech intonation. An early
feature of autism spectrum disorder is impaired joint attention as
manifested by a lack of pointing, showing, or bringing objects to share
interest with others, or failure to follow someone's pointing or eye
gaze. Individuals may learn a few functional gestures, but their
repertoire is smaller than that of others, and they often fail to use
expressive gestures spontaneously in communication. Among adults with
fluent language, the difficulty in coordinating nonverbal communication
with speech may give the impression of odd, wooden, or exaggerated "body
language" during interactions. Impairment may be relatively subtle
within individual modes (e.g., someone may have relatively good eye
contact when speaking) but

noticeable in poor integration of eye contact, gesture, body posture,
prosody, and facial expression for social communication. Deficits in
developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships should be
judged against norms for age, gender, and culture. There may be absent,
reduced, or atypical social interest, manifested by rejection of others,
passivity, or inappropriate approaches that seem aggressive or
disruptive. These difficulties are particularly evident in young
children, in whom there is often a lack of shared social play and
imagination (e.g., ageappropriate flexible pretend play) and, later,
insistence on playing by very fixed rules. Older individuals may
struggle to understand what behavior is considered appropriate in one
situation but not another (e.g., casual behavior during a job
interview), or the different ways that language may be used to
communicate (e.g., irony, white lies). There may be an apparent
preference for solitary activities or for interacting with much younger
or older people. Frequently, there is a desire to establish friendships
without a complete or realistic idea of what friendship entails (e.g.,
one-sided friendships or friendships based solely on shared special
interests). Relationships with siblings, co-workers, and caregivers are
also important to consider (in terms of reciprocity). Autism spectrum
disorder is also defined by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior,
interests, or activities (as specified in Criterion B), which show a
range of manifestations according to age and ability, intervention, and
current supports. Stereotyped or repetitive behaviors include simple
motor stereotypies (e.g., hand flapping, finger flicking), repetitive
use of objects (e.g., spinning coins, lining up toys), and repetitive
speech (e.g., echolalia, the delayed or immediate parroting of heard
words; use of "you" when referring to self; stereotyped use of words,
phrases, or prosodic patterns). Excessive adherence to routines and
restricted patterns of behavior may be manifest in resistance to change
(e.g., distress at apparently small changes, such as in packaging of a
favorite food; insistence on adherence to rules; rigidity of thinking)
or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., repetitive
questioning, pacing a perimeter). Highly restricted, fixated interests
in autism spectrum disorder tend to be abnormal in intensity or focus
(e.g., a toddler strongly attached to a pan; a child preoccupied with
vacuum cleaners; an adult spending hours writing out timetables). Some
fascinations and routines may relate to apparent hyper- or
hyporeactivity to sensory input, manifested through extreme responses to
specific sounds or

textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, fascination with
lights or spinning objects, and sometimes apparent indifference to pain,
heat, or cold. Extreme reaction to or rituals involving taste, smell,
texture, or appearance of food or excessive food restrictions are common
and may be a presenting feature of autism spectrum disorder. Many adults
with autism spectrum disorder without intellectual or language
disabilities learn to suppress repetitive behavior in public. Special
interests may be a source of pleasure and motivation and provide avenues
for education and employment later in life. Diagnostic criteria may be
met when restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or
activities were clearly present during childhood or at some time in the
past, even if symptoms are no longer present. Criterion D requires that
the features must cause clinically significant impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of current functioning. Criterion
E specifies that the social communication deficits, although sometimes
accompanied by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental
disorder), are not in line with the individual's developmental level;
impairments exceed difficulties expected on the basis of developmental
level. Standardized behavioral diagnostic instruments with good
psychometric properties, including caregiver interviews, questionnaires
and clinician observation measures, are available and can improve
reliability of diagnosis over time and across clinicians.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Many individuals with autism
spectrum disorder also have intellectual impairment and/or language
impairment (e.g., slow to talk, language comprehension behind
production). Even those with average or high intelligence have an uneven
profile of abilities. The gap between intellectual and adaptive
functional skills is often large. Motor deficits are often present,
including odd gait, clumsiness, and other abnormal motor signs (e.g.,
walking on tiptoes). Self-injury (e.g., head banging, biting the wrist)
may occur, and disruptive/challenging behaviors are more common in
children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder than other
disorders, including intellectual disability. Adolescents and adults
with autism spectrum disorder are prone to anxiety and depression11.
Some individuals develop catatonic-like motor behavior (slowing and
"freezing"

mid-action), but these are typically not of the magnitude of a catatonic
episode. However, it is possible for individuals with autism spectrum
disorder to experience a marked deterioration in motor symptoms and
display a full catatonic episode with symptoms such as mutism,
posturing, grimacing and waxy flexibility. The risk period for comorbid
catatonia appears to be greatest in the adolescent years.

Prevalence In recent years, reported frequencies for autism spectrum
disorder across U.S. and non-U.S. countries have approached 1% of the
population, with similar estimates in child and adult samples4. It
remains unclear whether higher rates reflect an expansion of the
diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV to include subthreshold cases, increased
awareness, differences in study methodology, or a true increase in the
frequency of autism spectrum disorder.

Development and Course The age and pattern of onset also should be noted
for autism spectrum disorder. Symptoms are typically recognized during
the second year of life (12--24 months of age) but may be seen earlier
than 12 months if developmental delays are severe, or noted later than
24 months if symptoms are more subtle. The pattern of onset description
might include information about early developmental delays or any losses
of social or language skills. In cases where skills have been lost,
parents or caregivers may give a history of a gradual or relatively
rapid deterioration in social behaviors or language skills. Typically,
this would occur between 12 and 24 months of age and is distinguished
from the rare instances of developmental regression occurring after at
least 2 years of normal development (previously described as childhood
disintegrative disorder). The behavioral features of autism spectrum
disorder first become evident in early childhood, with some cases
presenting a lack of interest in social interaction in the first year of
life. Some children with autism spectrum disorder experience
developmental plateaus or regression, with a gradual or relatively rapid
deterioration in social behaviors or use of language, often during the
first 2 years of life. Such losses are rare in other disorders and may
be a useful "red flag" for autism spectrum disorder1. Much more

unusual and warranting more extensive medical investigation are losses
of skills beyond social communication (e.g., loss of self-care,
toileting, motor skills) or those occurring after the second birthday
(see also Rett syndrome in the section "Differential Diagnosis" for this
disorder). First symptoms of autism spectrum disorder frequently involve
delayed language development, often accompanied by lack of social
interest or unusual social interactions (e.g., pulling individuals by
the hand without any attempt to look at them), odd play patterns (e.g.,
carrying toys around but never playing with them), and unusual
communication patterns (e.g., knowing the alphabet but not responding to
own name). Deafness may be suspected but is typically ruled out. During
the second year, odd and repetitive behaviors and the absence of typical
play become more apparent. Since many typically developing young
children have strong preferences and enjoy repetition (e.g., eating the
same foods, watching the same video multiple times), distinguishing
restricted and repetitive behaviors that are diagnostic of autism
spectrum disorder can be difficult in preschoolers. The clinical
distinction is based on the type, frequency, and intensity of the
behavior (e.g., a child who daily lines up objects for hours and is very
distressed if any item is moved). Autism spectrum disorder is not a
degenerative disorder, and it is typical for learning and compensation
to continue throughout life. Symptoms are often most marked in early
childhood and early school years, with developmental gains typical in
later childhood in at least some areas (e.g., increased interest in
social interaction). A small proportion of individuals deteriorate
behaviorally during adolescence, whereas most others improve. Only a
minority of individuals with autism spectrum disorder live and work
independently in adulthood; those who do tend to have superior language
and intellectual abilities and are able to find a niche that matches
their special interests and skills. In general, individuals with lower
levels of impairment may be better able to function independently.
However, even these individuals may remain socially naive and
vulnerable, have difficulties organizing practical demands without aid,
and are prone to anxiety and depression. Many adults report using
compensation strategies and coping mechanisms to mask their difficulties
in public but suffer from the stress and effort of maintaining a
socially acceptable facade. Scarcely anything is known about old age in
autism spectrum disorder6.

Some individuals come for first diagnosis in adulthood, perhaps prompted
by the diagnosis of autism in a child in the family or a breakdown of
relations at work or home. Obtaining detailed developmental history in
such cases may be difficult, and it is important to consider
self-reported difficulties. Where clinical observation suggests criteria
are currently met, autism spectrum disorder may be diagnosed, provided
there is no evidence of good social and communication skills in
childhood. For example, the report (by parents or another relative) that
the individual had ordinary and sustained reciprocal friendships and
good nonverbal communication skills throughout childhood would rule out
a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder; however, the absence of
developmental information in itself should not do so. Manifestations of
the social and communication impairments and restricted/repetitive
behaviors that define autism spectrum disorder are clear in the
developmental period. In later life, intervention or compensation, as
well as current supports, may mask these difficulties in at least some
contexts. However, symptoms remain sufficient to cause current
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.

Risk and Prognostic Factors The best established prognostic factors for
individual outcome within autism spectrum disorder are presence or
absence of associated intellectual disability and language impairment
(e.g., functional language by age 5 years is a good prognostic sign) and
additional mental health problems. Epilepsy, as a comorbid diagnosis, is
associated with greater intellectual disability and lower verbal
ability3. Environmental. A variety of nonspecific risk factors, such as
advanced parental age, low birth weight, or fetal exposure to valproate,
may contribute to risk of autism spectrum disorder. Genetic and
physiological. Heritability estimates for autism spectrum disorder have
ranged from 37% to higher than 90%, based on twin concordance rates5.
Currently, as many as 15% of cases of autism spectrum disorder appear to
be associated with a known genetic mutation, with different de novo copy
number variants or de novo mutations in specific genes associated with
the disorder in different families. However, even when an autism
spectrum disorder is associated with a known genetic

mutation, it does not appear to be fully penetrant. Risk for the
remainder of cases appears to be polygenic, with perhaps hundreds of
genetic loci making relatively small contributions.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Cultural differences will exist in
norms for social interaction, nonverbal communication, and
relationships, but individuals with autism spectrum disorder are
markedly impaired against the norms for their cultural context. Cultural
and socioeconomic factors may affect age at recognition or diagnosis;
for example, in the United States, late or underdiagnosis of autism
spectrum disorder among African American children may occur8.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed
four times more often in males than in females. In clinic samples,
females tend to be more likely to show accompanying intellectual
disability9, suggesting that girls without accompanying intellectual
impairments or language delays may go unrecognized, perhaps because of
subtler manifestation of social and communication difficulties10.

Functional Consequences of Autism Spectrum Disorder In young children
with autism spectrum disorder, lack of social and communication
abilities may hamper learning, especially learning through social
interaction or in settings with peers. In the home, insistence on
routines and aversion to change, as well as sensory sensitivities, may
interfere with eating and sleeping and make routine care (e.g.,
haircuts, dental work) extremely difficult. Adaptive skills are
typically below measured IQ. Extreme difficulties in planning,
organization, and coping with change negatively impact academic
achievement, even for students with above-average intelligence. During
adulthood, these individuals may have difficulties establishing
independence because of continued rigidity and difficulty with novelty.
Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder, even without
intellectual disability, have poor adult psychosocial functioning as
indexed by measures such as independent living and gainful employment7.

Functional consequences in old age are unknown, but social isolation and
communication problems (e.g., reduced help-seeking) are likely to have
consequences for health in older adulthood.

Differential Diagnosis Rett syndrome. Disruption of social interaction
may be observed during the regressive phase of Rett syndrome (typically
between 1--4 years of age); thus, a substantial proportion of affected
young girls may have a presentation that meets diagnostic criteria for
autism spectrum disorder. However, after this period, most individuals
with Rett syndrome improve their social communication skills, and
autistic features are no longer a major area of concern. Consequently,
autism spectrum disorder should be considered only when all diagnostic
criteria are met. Selective mutism. In selective mutism, early
development is not typically disturbed. The affected child usually
exhibits appropriate communication skills in certain contexts and
settings. Even in settings where the child is mute, social reciprocity
is not impaired, nor are restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior
present. Language disorders and social (pragmatic) communication
disorder. In some forms of language disorder, there may be problems of
communication and some secondary social difficulties. However, specific
language disorder is not usually associated with abnormal nonverbal
communication, nor with the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns
of behavior, interests, or activities. When an individual shows
impairment in social communication and social interactions but does not
show restricted and repetitive behavior or interests, criteria for
social (pragmatic) communication disorder, instead of autism spectrum
disorder, may be met. The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder
supersedes that of social (pragmatic) communication disorder whenever
the criteria for autism spectrum disorder are met, and care should be
taken to enquire carefully regarding past or current
restricted/repetitive behavior. Intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder) without autism spectrum disorder. Intellectual
disability without autism spectrum disorder may be difficult to
differentiate from autism spectrum disorder in very young children.
Individuals with intellectual disability who have not

developed language or symbolic skills also present a challenge for
differential diagnosis, since repetitive behavior often occurs in such
individuals as well. A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in an
individual with intellectual disability is appropriate when social
communication and interaction are significantly impaired relative to the
developmental level of the individual's nonverbal skills (e.g., fine
motor skills, nonverbal problem solving). In contrast, intellectual
disability is the appropriate diagnosis when there is no apparent
discrepancy between the level of social-communicative skills and other
intellectual skills. Stereotypic movement disorder. Motor stereotypies
are among the diagnostic characteristics of autism spectrum disorder, so
an additional diagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder is not given
when such repetitive behaviors are better explained by the presence of
autism spectrum disorder. However, when stereotypies cause self-injury
and become a focus of treatment, both diagnoses may be appropriate.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Abnormalities of attention
(overly focused or easily distracted) are common in individuals with
autism spectrum disorder, as is hyperactivity. A diagnosis of
attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should be considered when
attentional difficulties or hyperactivity exceeds that typically seen in
individuals of comparable mental age. Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia with
childhood onset usually develops after a period of normal, or near
normal, development. A prodromal state has been described in which
social impairment and atypical interests and beliefs occur, which could
be confused with the social deficits seen in autism spectrum disorder.
Hallucinations and delusions, which are defining features of
schizophrenia, are not features of autism spectrum disorder. However,
clinicians must take into account the potential for individuals with
autism spectrum disorder to be concrete in their interpretation of
questions regarding the key features of schizophrenia (e.g., "Do you
hear voices when no one is there?" "Yes \[on the radio\]").

Comorbidity Autism spectrum disorder is frequently associated with
intellectual impairment and structural language disorder (i.e., an
inability to comprehend and construct sentences with proper grammar),
which should

be noted under the relevant specifiers when applicable. Many individuals
with autism spectrum disorder have psychiatric symptoms that do not form
part of the diagnostic criteria for the disorder (about 70% of
individuals with autism spectrum disorder may have one comorbid mental
disorder, and 40% may have two or more comorbid mental disorders)11.
When criteria for both ADHD and autism spectrum disorder are met, both
diagnoses should be given. This same principle applies to concurrent
diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and developmental coordination
disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and other comorbid
diagnoses. Among individuals who are nonverbal or have language
deficits, observable signs such as changes in sleep or eating and
increases in challenging behavior should trigger an evaluation for
anxiety or depression. Specific learning difficulties (literacy and
numeracy) are common, as is developmental coordination disorder2.
Medical conditions commonly associated with autism spectrum disorder
should be noted under the "associated with a known medical or genetic
condition or environmental factor" specifier. Such medical conditions
include epilepsy, sleep problems, and constipation. Avoidant/restrictive
food intake disorder is a fairly frequent presenting feature of autism
spectrum disorder, and extreme and narrow food preferences may persist.

and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or
development, as characterized by (1) and/or (2): 1. Inattention: Six (or
more) of the following symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to
a degree that is inconsistent with developmental level and that
negatively impacts directly on social and academic/occupational
activities: Note: The symptoms are not solely a manifestation of
oppositional behavior, defiance, hostility, or failure to

understand tasks or instructions. For older adolescents and adults (age
17 and older), at least five symptoms are required. a. Often fails to
give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in
schoolwork, at work, or during other activities (e.g., overlooks or
misses details, work is inaccurate). b. Often has difficulty sustaining
attention in tasks or play activities (e.g., has difficulty remaining
focused during lectures, conversations, or lengthy reading). c. Often
does not seem to listen when spoken to directly (e.g., mind seems
elsewhere, even in the absence of any obvious distraction). d. Often
does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork,
chores, or duties in the workplace (e.g., starts tasks but quickly loses
focus and is easily sidetracked). e. Often has difficulty organizing
tasks and activities (e.g., difficulty managing sequential tasks;
difficulty keeping materials and belongings in order; messy,
disorganized work; has poor time management; fails to meet deadlines).
f. Often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that
require sustained mental effort (e.g., schoolwork or homework; for older
adolescents and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing
lengthy papers). g. Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities
(e.g., school materials, pencils, books, tools, wallets, keys,
paperwork, eyeglasses, mobile telephones). h. Is often easily distracted
by extraneous stimuli (for older adolescents and adults, may include
unrelated thoughts). i. Is often forgetful in daily activities (e.g.,
doing chores, running errands; for older adolescents and adults,
returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments).

2. Hyperactivity and impulsivity: Six (or more) of the following
symptoms have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is
inconsistent with developmental level and that negatively impacts
directly on social and academic/occupational activities: Note: The
symptoms are not solely a manifestation of oppositional behavior,
defiance, hostility, or a failure to understand tasks or instructions.
For older adolescents and adults (age 17 and older), at least five
symptoms are required. a. Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or
squirms in seat. b. Often leaves seat in situations when remaining
seated is expected (e.g., leaves his or her place in the classroom, in
the office or other workplace, or in other situations that require
remaining in place). c. Often runs about or climbs in situations where
it is inappropriate. (Note: In adolescents or adults, may be limited to
feeling restless.) d. Often unable to play or engage in leisure
activities quietly. e. Is often "on the go," acting as if "driven by a
motor" (e.g., is unable to be or uncomfortable being still for extended
time, as in restaurants, meetings; may be experienced by others as being
restless or difficult to keep up with). f. Often talks excessively. g.
Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed (e.g.,
completes people's sentences; cannot wait for turn in conversation). h.
Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn (e.g., while waiting in
line). i. Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into
conversations, games, or activities; may start using other people's
things without asking or receiving permission; for adolescents and
adults, may intrude into or take over what others are doing).

b. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present
prior to age 12 years. c. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive
symptoms are present in two or more settings (e.g., at home, school, or
work; with friends or relatives; in other activities). d. There is clear
evidence that the symptoms interfere with, or reduce the quality of,
social, academic, or occupational functioning. e. The symptoms do not
occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or another
psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental
disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissociative disorder,
personality disorder, substance intoxication or withdrawal). Specify
whether: 314.01 (F90.2) Combined presentation: If both Criterion A1
(inattention) and Criterion A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) are met for
the past 6 months. 314.00 (F90.0) Predominantly inattentive
presentation: If Criterion A1 (inattention) is met but Criterion A2
(hyperactivity-impulsivity) is not met for the past 6 months. 314.01
(F90.1) Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation: If Criterion
A2 (hyperactivity-impulsivity) is met and Criterion A1 (inattention) is
not met for the past 6 months. Specify if: In partial remission: When
full criteria were previously met, fewer than the full criteria have
been met for the past 6 months, and the symptoms still result in
impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. Specify
current severity: Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those
required to make the diagnosis are present, and symptoms result in no
more than minor impairments in social or occupational functioning.
Moderate: Symptoms or functional impairment between "mild" and "severe"
are present. Severe: Many symptoms in excess of those required to make
the diagnosis, or several symptoms that are particularly severe, are
present,

or the symptoms result in marked impairment in social or occupational
functioning.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent pattern
of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with
functioning or development. Inattention manifests behaviorally in ADHD
as wandering off task, lacking persistence, having difficulty sustaining
focus, and being disorganized and is not due to defiance or lack of
comprehension. Hyperactivity refers to excessive motor activity (such as
a child running about) when it is not appropriate, or excessive
fidgeting, tapping, or talkativeness. In adults, hyperactivity may
manifest as extreme restlessness or wearing others out with their
activity. Impulsivity refers to hasty actions that occur in the moment
without forethought and that have high potential for harm to the
individual (e.g., darting into the street without looking). Impulsivity
may reflect a desire for immediate rewards or an inability to delay
gratification. Impulsive behaviors may manifest as social intrusiveness
(e.g., interrupting others excessively) and/or as making important
decisions without consideration of long-term consequences (e.g., taking
a job without adequate information). ADHD begins in childhood. The
requirement that several symptoms be present before age 12 years conveys
the importance of a substantial clinical presentation during childhood.
At the same time, an earlier age at onset is not specified because of
difficulties in establishing precise childhood onset retrospectively10.
Adult recall of childhood symptoms tends to be unreliable11, 14, and it
is beneficial to obtain ancillary information. Manifestations of the
disorder must be present in more than one setting (e.g., home and
school, work). Confirmation of substantial symptoms across settings
typically cannot be done accurately without consulting informants who
have seen the individual in those settings. Typically, symptoms vary
depending on context within a given setting. Signs of the disorder may
be minimal or absent when the individual is receiving frequent rewards
for appropriate behavior, is under close supervision, is in a novel
setting, is engaged in especially interesting activities, has consistent
external stimulation (e.g., via electronic screens), or is interacting
in oneon-one situations (e.g., the clinician's office).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Mild delays in language, motor,
or social development are not specific to ADHD but often co-occur.
Associated features may include low frustration tolerance, irritability,
or mood lability. Even in the absence of a specific learning disorder,
academic or work performance is often impaired. Inattentive behavior is
associated with various underlying cognitive processes, and individuals
with ADHD may exhibit cognitive problems on tests of attention,
executive function, or memory, although these tests are not sufficiently
sensitive or specific to serve as diagnostic indices. By early
adulthood, ADHD is associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt,
primarily when comorbid with mood, conduct, or substance use disorders1.
No biological marker is diagnostic for ADHD. As a group, compared with
peers, children with ADHD display increased slow wave
electroencephalograms2, reduced total brain volume on magnetic resonance
imaging3, and possibly a delay in posterior to anterior cortical
maturation20, but these findings are not diagnostic. In the uncommon
cases where there is a known genetic cause (e.g., Fragile X syndrome,
22q11 deletion syndrome), the ADHD presentation should still be
diagnosed.

Prevalence Population surveys suggest that ADHD occurs in most cultures
in about 5% of children19 and about 2.5% of adults21.

Development and Course Many parents first observe excessive motor
activity when the child is a toddler, but symptoms are difficult to
distinguish from highly variable normative behaviors before age 4 years.
ADHD is most often identified during elementary school years, and
inattention becomes more prominent and impairing. The disorder is
relatively stable through early adolescence, but some individuals have a
worsened course with development of antisocial behaviors. In most
individuals with ADHD, symptoms of motoric hyperactivity become less
obvious in adolescence and adulthood, but difficulties with
restlessness, inattention, poor planning, and impulsivity persist25. A
substantial proportion of children with ADHD remain relatively impaired
into adulthood.

In preschool, the main manifestation is hyperactivity. Inattention
becomes more prominent during elementary school. During adolescence,
signs of hyperactivity (e.g., running and climbing) are less common and
may be confined to fidgetiness or an inner feeling of jitteriness,
restlessness, or impatience. In adulthood, along with inattention and
restlessness, impulsivity may remain problematic even when hyperactivity
has diminished.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. ADHD is associated with
reduced behavioral inhibition, effortful control, or constraint;
negative emotionality; and/or elevated novelty seeking. These traits may
predispose some children to ADHD but are not specific to the disorder.
Environmental. Very low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams) conveys a
two- to threefold risk for ADHD, but most children with low birth weight
do not develop ADHD. Although ADHD is correlated with smoking during
pregnancy, some of this association reflects common genetic risk24. A
minority of cases may be related to reactions to aspects of diet17, 23.
There may be a history of child abuse, neglect, multiple foster
placements, neurotoxin exposure (e.g., lead), infections (e.g.,
encephalitis), or alcohol exposure in utero. Exposure to environmental
toxicants has been correlated with subsequent ADHD, but it is not known
whether these associations are causal. Genetic and physiological. ADHD
is elevated in the first-degree biological relatives of individuals with
ADHD22. The heritability of ADHD is substantial. While specific genes
have been correlated with ADHD8, they are neither necessary nor
sufficient causal factors. Visual and hearing impairments, metabolic
abnormalities, sleep disorders, nutritional deficiencies, and epilepsy
should be considered as possible influences on ADHD symptoms. ADHD is
not associated with specific physical features, although rates of minor
physical anomalies (e.g., hypertelorism, highly arched palate, low-set
ears) may be relatively elevated. Subtle motor delays and other
neurological soft signs may occur. (Note that marked co-occurring
clumsiness and motor delays should be coded separately \[e.g.,
developmental coordination disorder\].)

Course modifiers. Family interaction patterns in early childhood are
unlikely to cause ADHD but may influence its course or contribute to
secondary development of conduct problems.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Differences in ADHD prevalence rates
across regions appear attributable mainly to different diagnostic and
methodological practices19. However, there also may be cultural
variation in attitudes toward or interpretations of children's
behaviors. Clinical identification rates in the United States for
African American and Latino populations tend to be lower than for
Caucasian populations6, 9, 16. Informant symptom ratings may be
influenced by cultural group of the child and the informant12, 16,
suggesting that culturally appropriate practices are relevant in
assessing ADHD.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues ADHD is more frequent in males than in
females in the general population, with a ratio of approximately 2:1 in
children19 and 1.6:1 in adults9. Females are more likely than males to
present primarily with inattentive features.

Functional Consequences Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

of

Attention-

ADHD is associated with reduced school performance and academic
attainment5, social rejection, and, in adults, poorer occupational
performance, attainment, attendance, and higher probability of
unemployment9 as well as elevated interpersonal conflict. Children with
ADHD are significantly more likely than their peers without ADHD to
develop conduct disorder in adolescence and antisocial personality
disorder in adulthood13, consequently increasing the likelihood for
substance use disorders and incarceration. The risk of subsequent
substance use disorders is elevated, especially when conduct disorder or
antisocial personality disorder develops11. Individuals with ADHD are
more likely than peers to be injured15, 18. Traffic accidents and
violations are more frequent in drivers with ADHD. There may be an
elevated likelihood of obesity among individuals with ADHD4, 7.

Inadequate or variable self-application to tasks that require sustained
effort is often interpreted by others as laziness, irresponsibility, or
failure to cooperate. Family relationships may be characterized by
discord and negative interactions. Peer relationships are often
disrupted by peer rejection, neglect, or teasing of the individual with
ADHD. On average, individuals with ADHD obtain less schooling, have
poorer vocational achievement, and have reduced intellectual scores than
their peers, although there is great variability. In its severe form,
the disorder is markedly impairing, affecting social, familial, and
scholastic/occupational adjustment. Academic deficits, school-related
problems, and peer neglect tend to be most associated with elevated
symptoms of inattention, whereas peer rejection and, to a lesser extent,
accidental injury are most salient with marked symptoms of hyperactivity
or impulsivity26.

Differential Diagnosis Oppositional defiant disorder. Individuals with
oppositional defiant disorder may resist work or school tasks that
require self-application because they resist conforming to others'
demands. Their behavior is characterized by negativity, hostility, and
defiance. These symptoms must be differentiated from aversion to school
or mentally demanding tasks due to difficulty in sustaining mental
effort, forgetting instructions, and impulsivity in individuals with
ADHD. Complicating the differential diagnosis is the fact that some
individuals with ADHD may develop secondary oppositional attitudes
toward such tasks and devalue their importance. Intermittent explosive
disorder. ADHD and intermittent explosive disorder share high levels of
impulsive behavior. However, individuals with intermittent explosive
disorder show serious aggression toward others, which is not
characteristic of ADHD, and they do not experience problems with
sustaining attention as seen in ADHD. In addition, intermittent
explosive disorder is rare in childhood. Intermittent explosive disorder
may be diagnosed in the presence of ADHD. Other neurodevelopmental
disorders. The increased motoric activity that may occur in ADHD must be
distinguished from the repetitive motor behavior that characterizes
stereotypic movement disorder and some cases of autism spectrum
disorder. In stereotypic movement disorder, the motoric

behavior is generally fixed and repetitive (e.g., body rocking,
self-biting), whereas the fidgetiness and restlessness in ADHD are
typically generalized and not characterized by repetitive stereotypic
movements. In Tourette's disorder, frequent multiple tics can be
mistaken for the generalized fidgetiness of ADHD. Prolonged observation
may be needed to differentiate fidgetiness from bouts of multiple tics.
Specific learning disorder. Children with specific learning disorder may
appear inattentive because of frustration, lack of interest, or limited
ability. However, inattention in individuals with a specific learning
disorder who do not have ADHD is not impairing outside of academic work.
Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder). Symptoms
of ADHD are common among children placed in academic settings that are
inappropriate to their intellectual ability. In such cases, the symptoms
are not evident during non-academic tasks. A diagnosis of ADHD in
intellectual disability requires that inattention or hyperactivity be
excessive for mental age. Autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with
ADHD and those with autism spectrum disorder exhibit inattention, social
dysfunction, and difficult-to-manage behavior. The social dysfunction
and peer rejection seen in individuals with ADHD must be distinguished
from the social disengagement, isolation, and indifference to facial and
tonal communication cues seen in individuals with autism spectrum
disorder. Children with autism spectrum disorder may display tantrums
because of an inability to tolerate a change from their expected course
of events. In contrast, children with ADHD may misbehave or have a
tantrum during a major transition because of impulsivity or poor
self-control. Reactive attachment disorder. Children with reactive
attachment disorder may show social disinhibition, but not the full ADHD
symptom cluster, and display other features such as a lack of enduring
relationships that are not characteristic of ADHD. Anxiety disorders.
ADHD shares symptoms of inattention with anxiety disorders. Individuals
with ADHD are inattentive because of their attraction to external
stimuli, new activities, or preoccupation with enjoyable activities.
This is distinguished from the inattention due to worry and rumination
seen in anxiety disorders. Restlessness might be seen in anxiety

disorders. However, in ADHD, the symptom is not associated with worry
and rumination. Depressive disorders. Individuals with depressive
disorders may present with inability to concentrate. However, poor
concentration in mood disorders becomes prominent only during a
depressive episode. Bipolar disorder. Individuals with bipolar disorder
may have increased activity, poor concentration, and increased
impulsivity, but these features are episodic, occurring several days at
a time. In bipolar disorder, increased impulsivity or inattention is
accompanied by elevated mood, grandiosity, and other specific bipolar
features. Children with ADHD may show significant changes in mood within
the same day; such lability is distinct from a manic episode, which must
last 4 or more days to be a clinical indicator of bipolar disorder, even
in children. Bipolar disorder is rare in preadolescents, even when
severe irritability and anger are prominent, whereas ADHD is common
among children and adolescents who display excessive anger and
irritability. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder is characterized by pervasive irritability, and
intolerance of frustration, but impulsiveness and disorganized attention
are not essential features. However, most children and adolescents with
the disorder have symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD, which is
diagnosed separately. Substance use disorders. Differentiating ADHD from
substance use disorders may be problematic if the first presentation of
ADHD symptoms follows the onset of abuse or frequent use. Clear evidence
of ADHD before substance misuse from informants or previous records may
be essential for differential diagnosis. Personality disorders. In
adolescents and adults, it may be difficult to distinguish ADHD from
borderline, narcissistic, and other personality disorders. All these
disorders tend to share the features of disorganization, social
intrusiveness, emotional dysregulation, and cognitive dysregulation.
However, ADHD is not characterized by fear of abandonment, self-injury,
extreme ambivalence, or other features of personality disorder. It may
take extended clinical observation, informant interview, or detailed
history to distinguish impulsive, socially intrusive, or inappropriate
behavior from

narcissistic, aggressive, or domineering behavior to make this
differential diagnosis. Psychotic disorders. ADHD is not diagnosed if
the symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity occur exclusively during
the course of a psychotic disorder. Medication-induced symptoms of ADHD.
Symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity attributable to
the use of medication (e.g., bronchodilators, isoniazid, neuroleptics
\[resulting in akathisia\], thyroid replacement medication) are
diagnosed as other specified or unspecified other (or unknown)
substance--related disorders. Neurocognitive disorders. Early major
neurocognitive disorder (dementia) and/or mild neurocognitive disorder
are not known to be associated with ADHD but may present with similar
clinical features. These conditions are distinguished from ADHD by their
late onset.

Comorbidity In clinical settings, comorbid disorders are frequent in
individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for ADHD. In the general
population, oppositional defiant disorder co-occurs with ADHD in
approximately half of children with the combined presentation and about
a quarter with the predominantly inattentive presentation. Conduct
disorder co-occurs in about a quarter of children or adolescents with
the combined presentation, depending on age and setting26. Most children
and adolescents with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have
symptoms that also meet criteria for ADHD; a lesser percentage of
children with ADHD have symptoms that meet criteria for disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder. Specific learning disorder commonly co-occurs
with ADHD. Anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder occur in a
minority of individuals with ADHD but more often than in the general
population9, 26. Intermittent explosive disorder occurs in a minority of
adults with ADHD, but at rates above population levels. Although
substance use disorders are relatively more frequent among adults with
ADHD in the general population, the disorders are present in only a
minority of adults with ADHD. In adults, antisocial and other
personality disorders may co-occur with ADHD. Other disorders that may
co-occur with ADHD include obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorders,
and autism spectrum disorder.

Other Specified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 314.01 (F90.8)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the
disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The
other specified attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder category is
used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the
specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or any specific
neurodevelopmental disorder. This is done by recording "other specified
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder" followed by the specific
reason (e.g., "with insufficient inattention symptoms").

Unspecified Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 314.01 (F90.9) This
category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder or any of the
disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that
the criteria are not met for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or
for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes presentations
in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis.

Specific Learning Disorder Specific Learning Disorder Diagnostic
Criteria a. Difficulties learning and using academic skills, as
indicated by the presence of at least one of the following symptoms that
have persisted for at least 6 months, despite the provision of
interventions that target those difficulties: 1. Inaccurate or slow and
effortful word reading (e.g., reads single words aloud incorrectly or
slowly and hesitantly, frequently guesses words, has difficulty sounding
out words). 2. Difficulty understanding the meaning of what is read
(e.g., may read text accurately but not understand the sequence,
relationships, inferences, or deeper meanings of what is read). 3.
Difficulties with spelling (e.g., may add, omit, or substitute vowels or
consonants).

4. Difficulties with written expression (e.g., makes multiple
grammatical or punctuation errors within sentences; employs poor
paragraph organization; written expression of ideas lacks clarity). 5.
Difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or calculation (e.g.,
has poor understanding of numbers, their magnitude, and relationships;
counts on fingers to add singledigit numbers instead of recalling the
math fact as peers do; gets lost in the midst of arithmetic computation
and may switch procedures). 6. Difficulties with mathematical reasoning
(e.g., has severe difficulty applying mathematical concepts, facts, or
procedures to solve quantitative problems). b. The affected academic
skills are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for the
individual's chronological age, and cause significant interference with
academic or occupational performance, or with activities of daily
living, as confirmed by individually administered standardized
achievement measures and comprehensive clinical assessment. For
individuals age 17 years and older, a documented history of impairing
learning difficulties may be substituted for the standardized
assessment. c. The learning difficulties begin during school-age years
but may not become fully manifest until the demands for those affected
academic skills exceed the individual's limited capacities (e.g., as in
timed tests, reading or writing lengthy complex reports for a tight
deadline, excessively heavy academic loads). d. The learning
difficulties are not better accounted for by intellectual disabilities,
uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or neurological
disorders, psychosocial adversity, lack of proficiency in the language
of academic instruction, or inadequate educational instruction. Note:
The four diagnostic criteria are to be met based on a clinical synthesis
of the individual's history (developmental, medical, family,
educational), school reports, and psychoeducational assessment.

Coding note: Specify all academic domains and subskills that are
impaired. When more than one domain is impaired, each one should be
coded individually according to the following specifiers. Specify if:
315.00 (F81.0) With impairment in reading: Word reading accuracy Reading
rate or fluency Reading comprehension Note: Dyslexia is an alternative
term used to refer to a pattern of learning difficulties characterized
by problems with accurate or fluent word recognition, poor decoding, and
poor spelling abilities. If dyslexia is used to specify this particular
pattern of difficulties, it is important also to specify any additional
difficulties that are present, such as difficulties with reading
comprehension or math reasoning. 315.2 (F81.81) With impairment in
written expression: Spelling accuracy Grammar and punctuation accuracy
Clarity or organization of written expression 315.1 (F81.2) With
impairment in mathematics: Number sense Memorization of arithmetic facts
Accurate or fluent calculation Accurate math reasoning Note: Dyscalculia
is an alternative term used to refer to a pattern of difficulties
characterized by problems processing numerical information, learning
arithmetic facts, and performing accurate or fluent calculations. If
dyscalculia is used to specify this particular pattern of mathematic
difficulties, it is important also to specify any additional
difficulties that are present, such as difficulties with math reasoning
or word reasoning accuracy. Specify current severity: Mild: Some
difficulties learning skills in one or two academic domains, but of mild
enough severity that the individual may be able to compensate or
function well when provided with appropriate accommodations or support
services, especially during the school years.

Moderate: Marked difficulties learning skills in one or more academic
domains, so that the individual is unlikely to become proficient without
some intervals of intensive and specialized teaching during the school
years. Some accommodations or supportive services at least part of the
day at school, in the workplace, or at home may be needed to complete
activities accurately and efficiently. Severe: Severe difficulties
learning skills, affecting several academic domains, so that the
individual is unlikely to learn those skills without ongoing intensive
individualized and specialized teaching for most of the school years.
Even with an array of appropriate accommodations or services at home, at
school, or in the workplace, the individual may not be able to complete
all activities efficiently.

Recording Procedures Each impaired academic domain and subskill of
specific learning disorder should be recorded. Because of ICD coding
requirements, impairments in reading, impairments in written expression,
and impairments in mathematics, with their corresponding impairments in
subskills, must be coded separately. For example, impairments in reading
and mathematics and impairments in the subskills of reading rate or
fluency, reading comprehension, accurate or fluent calculation, and
accurate math reasoning would be coded and recorded as 315.00 (F81.0)
specific learning disorder with impairment in reading, with impairment
in reading rate or fluency and impairment in reading comprehension;
315.1 (F81.2) specific learning disorder with impairment in mathematics,
with impairment in accurate or fluent calculation and impairment in
accurate math reasoning.

Diagnostic Features Specific learning disorder is a neurodevelopmental
disorder with a biological origin that is the basis for abnormalities at
a cognitive level that are associated with the behavioral signs of the
disorder. The biological origin includes an interaction of genetic,
epigenetic, and environmental factors, which affect the brain's ability
to perceive or process verbal or nonverbal information efficiently and
accurately. One essential feature of specific learning disorder is
persistent difficulties learning keystone academic skills (Criterion A),
with onset during the years

of formal schooling (i.e., the developmental period). Key academic
skills include reading of single words accurately and fluently, reading
comprehension, written expression and spelling, arithmetic calculation,
and mathematical reasoning (solving mathematical problems). In contrast
to talking or walking, which are acquired developmental milestones that
emerge with brain maturation, academic skills (e.g., reading, spelling,
writing, mathematics) have to be taught and learned explicitly. Specific
learning disorder disrupts the normal pattern of learning academic
skills; it is not simply a consequence of lack of opportunity of
learning or inadequate instruction. Difficulties mastering these key
academic skills may also impede learning in other academic subjects
(e.g., history, science, social studies), but those problems are
attributable to difficulties learning the underlying academic skills.
Difficulties learning to map letters with the sounds of one's
language---to read printed words (often called dyslexia)---is one of the
most common manifestations of specific learning disorder. The learning
difficulties manifest as a range of observable, descriptive behaviors or
symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1--A6). These clinical symptoms may be
observed, probed by means of the clinical interview, or ascertained from
school reports, rating scales, or descriptions in previous educational
or psychological assessments. The learning difficulties are persistent,
not transitory. In children and adolescents, persistence is defined as
restricted progress in learning (i.e., no evidence that the individual
is catching up with classmates) for at least 6 months despite the
provision of extra help at home or school. For example, difficulties
learning to read single words that do not fully or rapidly remit with
the provision of instruction in phonological skills or word
identification strategies may indicate a specific learning disorder.
Evidence of persistent learning difficulties may be derived from
cumulative school reports, portfolios of the child's evaluated work,
curriculum-based measures, or clinical interview. In adults, persistent
difficulty refers to ongoing difficulties in literacy or numeracy skills
that manifest during childhood or adolescence, as indicated by
cumulative evidence from school reports, evaluated portfolios of work,
or previous assessments. A second key feature is that the individual's
performance of the affected academic skills is well below average for
age (Criterion B). One robust clinical indicator of difficulties
learning academic skills is low academic achievement for age or average
achievement that is sustainable only by extraordinarily high levels of
effort or support. In children, the low

academic skills cause significant interference in school performance (as
indicated by school reports and teacher's grades or ratings). Another
clinical indicator, particularly in adults, is avoidance of activities
that require the academic skills. Also in adulthood, low academic skills
interfere with occupational performance or everyday activities requiring
those skills (as indicated by self-report or report by others). However,
this criterion also requires psychometric evidence from an individually
administered, psychometrically sound and culturally appropriate test of
academic achievement that is norm-referenced or criterion-referenced.
Academic skills are distributed along a continuum, so there is no
natural cutpoint that can be used to differentiate individuals with and
without specific learning disorder. Thus, any threshold used to specify
what constitutes significantly low academic achievement (e.g., academic
skills well below age expectation) is to a large extent arbitrary. Low
achievement scores on one or more standardized tests or subtests within
an academic domain (i.e., at least 1.5 standard deviations \[SD\] below
the population mean for age, which translates to a standard score of 78
or less, which is below the 7th percentile) are needed for the greatest
diagnostic certainty. However, precise scores will vary according to the
particular standardized tests that are used. On the basis of clinical
judgment, a more lenient threshold may be used (e.g., 1.0--2.5 SD below
the population mean for age), when learning difficulties are supported
by converging evidence from clinical assessment, academic history,
school reports, or test scores. Moreover, since standardized tests are
not available in all languages, the diagnosis may then be based in part
on clinical judgment of scores on available test measures. A third core
feature is that the learning difficulties are readily apparent in the
early school years in most individuals (Criterion C). However, in
others, the learning difficulties may not manifest fully until later
school years, by which time learning demands have increased and exceed
the individual's limited capacities. Another key diagnostic feature is
that the learning difficulties are considered "specific," for four
reasons. First, they are not attributable to intellectual disabilities
(intellectual disability \[intellectual developmental disorder\]);
global developmental delay; hearing or vision disorders, or neurological
or motor disorders) (Criterion D). Specific learning disorder affects
learning in individuals who otherwise demonstrate normal levels of
intellectual functioning (generally estimated by an IQ score of greater
than

about 70 \[±5 points allowing for measurement error\]). The phrase
"unexpected academic underachievement" is often cited as the defining
characteristic of specific learning disorder in that the specific
learning disabilities are not part of a more general learning difficulty
as manifested in intellectual disability or global developmental delay.
Specific learning disorder may also occur in individuals identified as
intellectually "gifted." These individuals may be able to sustain
apparently adequate academic functioning by using compensatory
strategies, extraordinarily high effort, or support, until the learning
demands or assessment procedures (e.g., timed tests) pose barriers to
their demonstrating their learning or accomplishing required tasks17.
Second, the learning difficulty cannot be attributed to more general
external factors, such as economic or environmental disadvantage,
chronic absenteeism, or lack of education as typically provided in the
individual's community context. Third, the learning difficulty cannot be
attributed to a neurological (e.g., pediatric stroke) or motor disorders
or to vision or hearing disorders, which are often associated with
problems learning academic skills but are distinguishable by presence of
neurological signs. Finally, the learning difficulty may be restricted
to one academic skill or domain (e.g., reading single words, retrieving
or calculating number facts). Comprehensive assessment is required.
Specific learning disorder can only be diagnosed after formal education
starts but can be diagnosed at any point afterward in children,
adolescents, or adults, providing there is evidence of onset during the
years of formal schooling (i.e., the developmental period). No single
data source is sufficient for a diagnosis of specific learning disorder.
Rather, specific learning disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on a
synthesis of the individual's medical, developmental, educational, and
family history; the history of the learning difficulty, including its
previous and current manifestation; the impact of the difficulty on
academic, occupational, or social functioning; previous or current
school reports; portfolios of work requiring academic skills;
curriculum-based assessments; and previous or current scores from
individual standardized tests of academic achievement. If an
intellectual, sensory, neurological, or motor disorder is suspected,
then the clinical assessment for specific learning disorder should also
include methods appropriate for these disorders. Thus, comprehensive
assessment will involve professionals with expertise in specific
learning disorder and psychological/cognitive

assessment. Since specific learning disorder typically persists into
adulthood, reassessment is rarely necessary, unless indicated by marked
changes in the learning difficulties (amelioration or worsening) or
requested for specific purposes.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Specific learning disorder is
frequently but not invariably preceded, in preschool years, by delays in
attention, language, or motor skills that may persist and co-occur with
specific learning disorder. An uneven profile of abilities is common,
such as above-average abilities in drawing, design, and other
visuospatial abilities, but slow, effortful, and inaccurate reading and
poor reading comprehension and written expression. Individuals with
specific learning disorder typically (but not invariably) exhibit poor
performance on psychological tests of cognitive processing. However, it
remains unclear whether these cognitive abnormalities are the cause,
correlate, or consequence of the learning difficulties. Also, although
cognitive deficits associated with difficulties learning to read words
are well documented, those associated with other manifestations of
specific learning disorder (e.g., reading comprehension, arithmetic
computation, written expression) are underspecified or unknown.
Moreover, individuals with similar behavioral symptoms or test scores
are found to have a variety of cognitive deficits, and many of these
processing deficits are also found in other neurodevelopmental disorders
(e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \[ADHD\], autistic
spectrum disorder, communication disorders, developmental coordination
disorder). Thus, assessment of cognitive processing deficits is not
required for diagnostic assessment. Specific learning disorder is
associated with increased risk for suicidal ideation and suicide
attempts in children, adolescents, and adults6, 28. There are no known
biological markers of specific learning disorder. As a group,
individuals with the disorder show circumscribed alterations in
cognitive processing and brain structure and function. Genetic
differences are also evident at the group level. But cognitive testing,
neuroimaging, or genetic testing are not useful for diagnosis at this
time5, 19, 26.

Prevalence

The prevalence of specific learning disorder across the academic domains
of reading, writing, and mathematics is 5%--15% among school-age
children across different languages and cultures2, 3, 11. Prevalence in
adults is unknown but appears to be approximately 4%.

Development and Course Onset, recognition, and diagnosis of specific
learning disorder usually occurs during the elementary school years when
children are required to learn to read, spell, write, and learn
mathematics. However, precursors such as language delays or deficits,
difficulties in rhyming or counting, or difficulties with fine motor
skills required for writing commonly occur in early childhood before the
start of formal schooling17. Manifestations may be behavioral (e.g., a
reluctance to engage in learning; oppositional behavior). Specific
learning disorder is lifelong, but the course and clinical expression
are variable, in part depending on the interactions among the task
demands of the environment, the range and severity of the individual's
learning difficulties, the individual's learning abilities, comorbidity,
and the available support systems and intervention. Nonetheless,
problems with reading fluency and comprehension, spelling, written
expression, and numeracy skills in everyday life typically persist into
adulthood7, 8. Changes in manifestation of symptoms occur with age, so
that an individual may have a persistent or shifting array of learning
difficulties across the lifespan8, 16. Examples of symptoms that may be
observed among preschool-age children include a lack of interest in
playing games with language sounds (e.g., repetition, rhyming), and they
may have trouble learning nursery rhymes. Preschool children with
specific learning disorder may frequently use baby talk, mispronounce
words, and have trouble remembering names of letters, numbers, or days
of the week. They may fail to recognize letters in their own names and
have trouble learning to count. Kindergarten-age children with specific
learning disorder may be unable to recognize and write letters, may be
unable to write their own names, or may use invented spelling. They may
have trouble breaking down spoken words into syllables (e.g., "cowboy"
into "cow" and "boy") and trouble recognizing words that rhyme (e.g.,
cat, bat, hat). Kindergarten-age children also may have trouble
connecting letters with their sounds (e.g., letter b makes the sound
/b/) and

may be unable to recognize phonemes (e.g., do not know which in a set of
words \[e.g., dog, man, car\] starts with the same sound as "cat").
Specific learning disorder in elementary school--age children typically
manifests as marked difficulty learning letter-sound correspondence
(particularly in English-speaking children), fluent word decoding,
spelling, or math facts; reading aloud is slow, inaccurate, and
effortful, and some children struggle to understand the magnitude that a
spoken or written number represents. Children in primary grades (grades
1--3) may continue to have problems recognizing and manipulating
phonemes, be unable to read common one-syllable words (such as mat or
top), and be unable recognize common irregularly spelled words (e.g.,
said, two). They may commit reading errors that indicate problems in
connecting sounds and letters (e.g., "big" for "got") and have
difficulty sequencing numbers and letters. Children in grades 1-3 also
may have difficulty remembering number facts or arithmetic procedures
for adding, subtracting, and so forth, and may complain that reading or
arithmetic is hard and avoid doing it. Children with specific learning
disorder in the middle grades (grades 4--6) may mispronounce or skip
parts of long, multisyllable words (e.g., say "conible" for
"convertible," "aminal" for "animal") and confuse words that sound alike
(e.g., "tornado" for "volcano"). They may have trouble remembering
dates, names, and telephone numbers and may have trouble completing
homework or tests on time. Children in the middle grades also may have
poor comprehension with or without slow, effortful, and inaccurate
reading, and they may have trouble reading small function words (e.g.,
that, the, an, in). They may have very poor spelling and poor written
work. They may get the first part of a word correctly, then guess wildly
(e.g., read "clover" as "clock"), and may express fear of reading aloud
or refuse to read aloud. By contrast, adolescents may have mastered word
decoding, but reading remains slow and effortful, and they are likely to
show marked problems in reading comprehension and written expression
(including poor spelling) and poor mastery of math facts or mathematical
problem solving. During adolescence and into adulthood, individuals with
specific learning disorder may continue to make numerous spelling
mistakes and read single words and connected text slowly and with much
effort, with trouble pronouncing multisyllable words. They may
frequently need to reread material to understand or get the main point
and have trouble making inferences from

written text. Adolescents and adults may avoid activities that demand
reading or arithmetic (reading for pleasure, reading instructions).
Adults with specific learning disorder have ongoing spelling problems,
slow and effortful reading, or problems making important inferences from
numerical information in work-related written documents. They may avoid
both leisure and work-related activities that demand reading or writing
or use alternative approaches to access print (e.g.,
text-to-speech/speech-to-text software, audiobooks, audiovisual media).
An alternative clinical expression is that of circumscribed learning
difficulties that persist across the lifespan, such as an inability to
master the basic sense of number (e.g., to know which of a pair of
numbers or dots represents the larger magnitude), or lack of proficiency
in word identification or spelling. Avoidance of or reluctance to engage
in activities requiring academic skills is common in children,
adolescents, and adults. Episodes of severe anxiety or anxiety
disorders, including somatic complaints or panic attacks, are common
across the lifespan and accompany both the circumscribed and the broader
expression of learning difficulties12, 18.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Prematurity or very low birth
weight increases the risk for specific learning disorder1, as does
prenatal exposure to nicotine20. Genetic and physiological. Specific
learning disorder appears to aggregate in families, particularly when
affecting reading, mathematics, and spelling. The relative risk of
specific learning disorder in reading or mathematics is substantially
higher (e.g., 4--8 times and 5--10 times higher, respectively) in
first-degree relatives of individuals with these learning difficulties
compared with those without them25, 30. Family history of reading
difficulties (dyslexia) and parental literacy skills predict literacy
problems or specific learning disorder in offspring, indicating the
combined role of genetic and environmental factors27, 29. There is high
heritability for both reading ability and reading disability in
alphabetic and nonalphabetic languages, including high heritability for
most manifestations of learning abilities and disabilities (e.g.,
heritability estimate values greater than 0.6). Covariation between
various manifestations of learning difficulties is high, suggesting that
genes related

to one presentation are highly correlated with genes related to another
manifestation10, 13, 30. Course modifiers. Marked problems with
inattentive behavior in preschool years is predictive of later
difficulties in reading and mathematics (but not necessarily specific
learning disorder) and nonresponse to effective academic interventions4,
21. Delay or disorders in speech or language, or impaired cognitive
processing (e.g., phonological awareness, working memory, rapid serial
naming) in preschool years, predicts later specific learning disorder in
reading and written expression14. Comorbidity with ADHD is predictive of
worse mental health outcome than that associated with specific learning
disorder without ADHD16, 24. Systematic, intensive, individualized
instruction, using evidence-based interventions, may improve or
ameliorate the learning difficulties in some individuals or promote the
use of compensatory strategies in others, thereby mitigating the
otherwise poor outcomes26.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Specific learning disorder occurs
across languages, cultures, races, and socioeconomic conditions but may
vary in its manifestation according to the nature of the spoken and
written symbol systems and cultural and educational practices9. For
example, the cognitive processing requirements of reading and of working
with numbers vary greatly across orthographies. In the English language,
the observable hallmark clinical symptom of difficulties learning to
read is inaccurate and slow reading of single words; in other alphabetic
languages that have more direct mapping between sounds and letters
(e.g., Spanish, German) and in non-alphabetic languages (e.g., Chinese,
Japanese), the hallmark feature is slow but accurate reading. In
English-language learners, assessment should include consideration of
whether the source of reading difficulties is a limited proficiency with
English or a specific learning disorder. Risk factors for specific
learning disorder in English-language learners include a family history
of specific learning disorder or language delay in the native language,
as well as learning difficulties in English and failure to catch up with
peers. If there is suspicion of cultural or language differences (e.g.,
as in an Englishlanguage learner), the assessment needs to take into
account the individual's language proficiency in his or her first or
native language as well as in the

second language (in this example, English). Also, assessment should
consider the linguistic and cultural context in which the individual is
living, as well as his or her educational and learning history in the
original culture and language.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Specific learning disorder is more
common in males than in females (ratios range from about 2:1 to 3:1) and
cannot be attributed to factors such as ascertainment bias, definitional
or measurement variation, language, race, or socioeconomic status22, 23.

Functional Consequences of Specific Learning Disorder Specific learning
disorder can have negative functional consequences across the lifespan,
including lower academic attainment, higher rates of high school
dropout, lower rates of postsecondary education, high levels of
psychological distress and poorer overall mental health, higher rates of
unemployment and under-employment, and lower incomes8. School dropout
and co-occurring depressive symptoms increase the risk for poor mental
health outcomes, including suicidality, whereas high levels of social or
emotional support predict better mental health outcomes16, 28.

Differential Diagnosis Normal variations in academic attainment.
Specific learning disorder is distinguished from normal variations in
academic attainment due to external factors (e.g., lack of educational
opportunity, consistently poor instruction, learning in a second
language), because the learning difficulties persist in the presence of
adequate educational opportunity and exposure to the same instruction as
the peer group, and competency in the language of instruction, even when
it is different from one's primary spoken language. Intellectual
disability (intellectual developmental disorder). Specific learning
disorder differs from general learning difficulties associated with
intellectual disability, because the learning difficulties occur in the
presence of normal levels of intellectual functioning (i.e., IQ score of
at least 70 ± 5). If intellectual disability is present, specific
learning disorder can be

diagnosed only when the learning difficulties are in excess of those
usually associated with the intellectual disability. Learning
difficulties due to neurological or sensory disorders. Specific learning
disorder is distinguished from learning difficulties due to neurological
or sensory disorders (e.g., pediatric stroke, traumatic brain injury,
hearing impairment, vision impairment), because in these cases there are
abnormal findings on neurological examination. Neurocognitive disorders.
Specific learning disorder is distinguished from learning problems
associated with neurodegenerative cognitive disorders, because in
specific learning disorder the clinical expression of specific learning
difficulties occurs during the developmental period, and the
difficulties do not manifest as a marked decline from a former state.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Specific learning disorder is
distinguished from the poor academic performance associated with ADHD,
because in the latter condition the problems may not necessarily reflect
specific difficulties in learning academic skills but rather may reflect
difficulties in performing those skills. However, the co-occurrence of
specific learning disorder and ADHD is more frequent than expected by
chance. If criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be
given. Psychotic disorders. Specific learning disorder is distinguished
from the academic and cognitive-processing difficulties associated with
schizophrenia or psychosis, because with these disorders there is a
decline (often rapid) in these functional domains.

Comorbidity Specific learning disorder commonly co-occurs with
neurodevelopmental (e.g., ADHD, communication disorders, developmental
coordination disorder, autistic spectrum disorder) or other mental
disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders).
These comorbidities do not necessarily exclude the diagnosis specific
learning disorder but may make testing and differential diagnosis more
difficult, because each of the cooccurring disorders independently
interferes with the execution of activities of daily living, including
learning. Thus, clinical judgment is required to attribute such
impairment to learning difficulties. If there is an indication that
another diagnosis could account for the difficulties learning keystone

academic skills described in Criterion A, specific learning disorder
should not be diagnosed.

Motor Disorders Developmental Coordination Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

315.4 (F82)

a. The acquisition and execution of coordinated motor skills is
substantially below that expected given the individual's chronological
age and opportunity for skill learning and use. Difficulties are
manifested as clumsiness (e.g., dropping or bumping into objects) as
well as slowness and inaccuracy of performance of motor skills (e.g.,
catching an object, using scissors or cutlery, handwriting, riding a
bike, or participating in sports). b. The motor skills deficit in
Criterion A significantly and persistently interferes with activities of
daily living appropriate to chronological age (e.g., self-care and
self-maintenance) and impacts academic/school productivity,
prevocational and vocational activities, leisure, and play. c. Onset of
symptoms is in the early developmental period. d. The motor skills
deficits are not better explained by intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder) or visual impairment and are not
attributable to a neurological condition affecting movement (e.g.,
cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, degenerative disorder).

Diagnostic Features The diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder
is made by a clinical synthesis of the history (developmental and
medical), physical examination, school or workplace report, and
individual assessment using psychometrically sound and culturally
appropriate standardized tests. The manifestation of impaired skills
requiring motor coordination (Criterion A) varies with age. Young
children may be delayed in achieving motor milestones (i.e., sitting,
crawling, walking), although many achieve typical motor milestones. They
also may be delayed in developing skills such as negotiating stairs,
pedaling, buttoning shirts, completing puzzles, and using zippers. Even
when the skill is achieved, movement execution may appear awkward, slow,
or less precise than that of peers. Older children and adults may
display slow speed or inaccuracy with motor aspects of activities such
as assembling puzzles, building models, playing ball games (especially
in teams), handwriting, typing, driving, or carrying out self-care
skills.

Developmental coordination disorder is diagnosed only if the impairment
in motor skills significantly interferes with the performance of, or
participation in, daily activities in family, social, school, or
community life (Criterion B). Examples of such activities include
getting dressed, eating meals with age-appropriate utensils and without
mess, engaging in physical games with others, using specific tools in
class such as rulers and scissors, and participating in team exercise
activities at school. Not only is ability to perform these actions
impaired, but also marked slowness in execution is common. Handwriting
competence is frequently affected, consequently affecting legibility
and/or speed of written output and affecting academic achievement (the
impact is distinguished from specific learning difficulty by the
emphasis on the motoric component of written output skills). In adults,
everyday skills in education and work, especially those in which speed
and accuracy are required, are affected by coordination problems.
Criterion C states that the onset of symptoms of developmental
coordination disorder must be in the early developmental period.
However, developmental coordination disorder is typically not diagnosed
before age 5 years because there is considerable variation in the age at
acquisition of many motor skills or a lack of stability of measurement
in early childhood (e.g., some children catch up) or because other
causes of motor delay may not have fully manifested. Criterion D
specifies that the diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder is
made if the coordination difficulties are not better explained by visual
impairment or attributable to a neurological condition. Thus, visual
function examination and neurological examination must be included in
the diagnostic evaluation. If intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder) is present, the motor difficulties are in excess
of those expected for the mental age; however, no IQ cut-off or
discrepancy criterion is specified. Developmental coordination disorder
does not have discrete subtypes; however, individuals may be impaired
predominantly in gross motor skills or in fine motor skills, including
handwriting skills. Other terms used to describe developmental
coordination disorder include childhood dyspraxia, specific
developmental disorder of motor function, and clumsy child syndrome.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Some children with developmental coordination disorder show additional
(usually suppressed) motor activity, such as choreiform movements of
unsupported limbs or mirror movements. These "overflow" movements are
referred to as neurodevelopmental immaturities or neurological soft
signs rather than neurological abnormalities. In both current
literature8 and clinical practice, their role in diagnosis is still
unclear, requiring further evaluation.

Prevalence The prevalence of developmental coordination disorder in
children ages 5-- 11 years is 5%--6% (in children age 7 years, 1.8% are
diagnosed with severe developmental coordination disorder and 3% with
probable developmental coordination disorder)4. Males are more often
affected than females, with a male:female ratio between 2:1 and 7:1.

Development and Course The course of developmental coordination disorder
is variable but stable at least to 1 year follow-up3. Although there may
be improvement in the longer term, problems with coordinated movements
continue through adolescence in an estimated 50%--70% of children2.
Onset is in early childhood. Delayed motor milestones may be the first
signs, or the disorder is first recognized when the child attempts tasks
such as holding a knife and fork, buttoning clothes, or playing ball
games. In middle childhood, there are difficulties with motor aspects of
assembling puzzles, building models, playing ball, and handwriting, as
well as with organizing belongings, when motor sequencing and
coordination are required. In early adulthood, there is continuing
difficulty in learning new tasks involving complex/automatic motor
skills, including driving and using tools. Inability to take notes and
handwrite quickly may affect performance in the workplace. Co-occurrence
with other disorders (see the section "Comorbidity" for this disorder)
has an additional impact on presentation, course, and outcome.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Developmental coordination
disorder is more common following prenatal exposure to alcohol and in
preterm and low-birth-weight children.

Genetic and physiological. Impairments in underlying neurodevelopmental
processes---particularly in visual-motor skills, both in visual-motor
perception and spatial mentalizing---have been found and affect the
ability to make rapid motoric adjustments as the complexity of the
required movements increases9. Cerebellar dysfunction has been proposed,
but the neural basis of developmental coordination disorder remains
unclear10. Because of the co-occurrence of developmental coordination
disorder with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), specific
learning disabilities, and autism spectrum disorder, shared genetic
effect has been proposed. However, consistent co-occurrence in twins
appears only in severe cases. Course modifiers. Individuals with ADHD
and with developmental coordination disorder demonstrate more impairment
than individuals with ADHD without developmental coordination disorder7.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Developmental coordination disorder
occurs across cultures, races, and socioeconomic conditions. By
definition, "activities of daily living" implies cultural differences
necessitating consideration of the context in which the individual child
is living as well as whether he or she has had appropriate opportunities
to learn and practice such activities.

Functional Consequences Coordination Disorder

of

Developmental

Developmental coordination disorder leads to impaired functional
performance in activities of daily living (Criterion B), and the
impairment is increased with co-occurring conditions. Consequences of
developmental coordination disorder include reduced participation in
team play and sports; poor self-esteem and sense of self-worth;
emotional or behavior problems; impaired academic achievement; poor
physical fitness; and reduced physical activity and obesity.

Differential Diagnosis Motor impairments due to another medical
condition. Problems in coordination may be associated with visual
function impairment and

specific neurological disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy, progressive
lesions of the cerebellum, neuromuscular disorders). In such cases,
there are additional findings on neurological examination. Intellectual
disability (intellectual developmental disorder). If intellectual
disability is present, motor competences may be impaired in accordance
with the intellectual disability. However, if the motor difficulties are
in excess of what could be accounted for by the intellectual disability,
and criteria for developmental coordination disorder are met,
developmental coordination disorder can be diagnosed as well.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Individuals with ADHD may
fall, bump into objects, or knock things over. Careful observation
across different contexts is required to ascertain if lack of motor
competence is attributable to distractibility and impulsiveness rather
than to developmental coordination disorder. If criteria for both ADHD
and developmental coordination disorder are met, both diagnoses can be
given. Autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with autism spectrum
disorder may be uninterested in participating in tasks requiring complex
coordination skills, such as ball sports, which will affect test
performance and function but not reflect core motor competence.
Co-occurrence of developmental coordination disorder and autism spectrum
disorder is common. If criteria for both disorders are met, both
diagnoses can be given. Joint hypermobility syndrome. Individuals with
syndromes causing hyperextensible joints (found on physical examination;
often with a complaint of pain) may present with symptoms similar to
those of developmental coordination disorder.

Comorbidity Disorders that commonly co-occur with developmental
coordination disorder include speech and language disorder; specific
learning disorder (especially reading and writing); problems of
inattention3, including ADHD (the most frequent coexisting condition,
with about 50% co-occurrence); autism spectrum disorder5, disruptive and
emotional behavior problems1, and joint hypermobility syndrome.
Different clusters of co-occurrence may be present (e.g., a cluster with
severe reading disorders, fine motor problems, and handwriting problems;
another cluster with impaired

movement control and motor planning)6. Presence of other disorders does
not exclude developmental coordination disorder but may make testing
more difficult and may independently interfere with the execution of
activities of daily living, thus requiring examiner judgment in
ascribing impairment to motor skills.

Stereotypic Movement Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

307.3 (F98.4)

a.  Repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless motor
    behavior (e.g., hand shaking or waving, body rocking, head banging,
    self-biting, hitting own body).
b.  The repetitive motor behavior interferes with social, academic, or
    other activities and may result in self-injury.
c.  Onset is in the early developmental period.
d.  The repetitive motor behavior is not attributable to the
    physiological effects of a substance or neurological condition and
    is not better explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental
    disorder (e.g., trichotillomania \[hair-pulling disorder\],
    obsessive-compulsive disorder). Specify if: With self-injurious
    behavior (or behavior that would result in an injury if preventive
    measures were not used) Without self-injurious behavior Specify if:
    Associated with a known medical or genetic condition,
    neurodevelopmental disorder, or environmental factor (e.g.,
    LeschNyhan syndrome, intellectual disability \[intellectual
    developmental disorder\], intrauterine alcohol exposure) Coding
    note: Use additional code to identify the associated medical or
    genetic condition, or neurodevelopmental disorder. Specify current
    severity: Mild: Symptoms are easily suppressed by sensory stimulus
    or distraction. Moderate: Symptoms require explicit protective
    measures and behavioral modification.

Severe: Continuous monitoring and protective measures are required to
prevent serious injury.

Recording Procedures For stereotypic movement disorder that is
associated with a known medical or genetic condition, neurodevelopmental
disorder, or environmental factor, record stereotypic movement disorder
associated with (name of condition, disorder, or factor) (e.g.,
stereotypic movement disorder associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome).

Specifiers The severity of non-self-injurious stereotypic movements
ranges from mild presentations that are easily suppressed by a sensory
stimulus or distraction to continuous movements that markedly interfere
with all activities of daily living. Self-injurious behaviors range in
severity along various dimensions, including the frequency, impact on
adaptive functioning, and severity of bodily injury (from mild bruising
or erythema from hitting hand against body, to lacerations or amputation
of digits, to retinal detachment from head banging).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of stereotypic movement
disorder is repetitive, seemingly driven, and apparently purposeless
motor behavior (Criterion A). These behaviors are often rhythmical
movements of the head, hands, or body without obvious adaptive
function6, 9. The movements may or may not respond to efforts to stop
them. Among typically developing children, the repetitive movements may
be stopped when attention is directed to them or when the child is
distracted from performing them. Among children with neurodevelopmental
disorders, the behaviors are typically less responsive to such efforts1.
In other cases, the individual demonstrates self-restraining behaviors
(e.g., sitting on hands, wrapping arms in clothing, finding a protective
device). The repertoire of behaviors is variable; each individual
presents with his or her own individually patterned, "signature"
behavior. Examples of nonself-injurious stereotypic movements include,
but are not limited to, body rocking, bilateral flapping or rotating
hand movements, flicking or

fluttering fingers in front of the face, arm waving or flapping, and
head nodding6, 9. Stereotyped self-injurious behaviors include, but are
not limited to, repetitive head banging, face slapping, eye poking, and
biting of hands, lips, or other body parts1. Eye poking is particularly
concerning; it occurs more frequently among children with visual
impairment. Multiple movements may be combined (e.g., cocking the head,
rocking the torso, waving a small string repetitively in front of the
face). Stereotypic movements may occur many times during a day, lasting
a few seconds to several minutes or longer. Frequency can vary from many
occurrences in a single day to several weeks elapsing between episodes.
The behaviors vary in context, occurring when the individual is
engrossed in other activities, when excited, stressed, fatigued, or
bored6, 9. Criterion A requires that the movements be "apparently"
purposeless. However, some functions may be served by the movements. For
example, stereotypic movements might reduce anxiety in response to
external stressors. Criterion B states that the stereotypic movements
interfere with social, academic, or other activities and, in some
children, may result in self-injury (or would if protective measures
were not used). If self-injury is present, it should be coded using the
specifier. Onset of stereotypic movements is in the early developmental
period (Criterion C). Criterion D states that the repetitive,
stereotyped behavior in stereotypic movement disorder is not
attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or neurological
condition and is not better explained by another neurodevelopmental or
mental disorder. The presence of stereotypic movements may indicate an
undetected neurodevelopmental problem, especially in children ages 1--3
years.

Prevalence Simple stereotypic movements (e.g., rocking) are common in
young typically developing children. Complex stereotypic movements are
much less common (occurring in approximately 3%--4%). Between 4% and 16%
of individuals with intellectual disability (intellectual developmental
disorder) engage in stereotypy and self-injury1, 5. The risk is greater
in individuals with severe intellectual disability. Among individuals
with intellectual disability living in residential facilities, 10%--15%
may have stereotypic movement disorder with self-injury5.

Development and Course Stereotypic movements typically begin within the
first 3 years of life. Simple stereotypic movements are common in
infancy and may be involved in acquisition of motor mastery. In children
who develop complex motor stereotypies, approximately 80% exhibit
symptoms before 24 months of age, 12% between 24 and 35 months, and 8%
at 36 months or older6. In most typically developing children, these
movements resolve over time or can be suppressed. Onset of complex motor
stereotypies may be in infancy or later in the developmental period.
Among individuals with intellectual disability, the stereotyped,
self-injurious behaviors may persist for years, even though the
typography or pattern of self-injury may change1, 2, 5, 7.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Social isolation is a risk
factor for self-stimulation that may progress to stereotypic movements
with repetitive self-injury. Environmental stress may also trigger
stereotypic behavior. Fear may alter physiological state, resulting in
increased frequency of stereotypic behaviors. Genetic and physiological.
Lower cognitive functioning is linked to greater risk for stereotypic
behaviors and poorer response to interventions. Stereotypic movements
are more frequent among individuals with moderate-to-severe/profound
intellectual disability, who by virtue of a particular syndrome (e.g.,
Rett syndrome) or environmental factor (e.g., an environment with
relatively insufficient stimulation) seem to be at higher risk for
stereotypies. Repetitive self-injurious behavior may be a behavioral
phenotype in neurogenetic syndromes5. For example, in Lesch-Nyhan
syndrome, there are both stereotypic dystonic movements and
selfmutilation of fingers, lip biting, and other forms of self-injury
unless the individual is restrained5, 7, and in Rett syndrome and
Cornelia de Lange syndrome, self-injury may result from the
hand-to-mouth stereotypies7. Stereotypic behaviors may result from a
painful medical condition (e.g., middle ear infection, dental problems,
gastroesophageal reflux)3, 4.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Stereotypic movement disorder, with or without self-injury, occurs in
all races and cultures. Cultural attitudes toward unusual behaviors may
result in delayed diagnosis. Overall cultural tolerance and attitudes
toward stereotypic movement vary and must be considered.

Differential Diagnosis Normal development. Simple stereotypic movements
are common in infancy and early childhood. Rocking may occur in the
transition from sleep to awake, a behavior that usually resolves with
age. Complex stereotypies are less common in typically developing
children and can usually be suppressed by distraction or sensory
stimulation. The individual's daily routine is rarely affected, and the
movements generally do not cause the child distress. The diagnosis would
not be appropriate in these circumstances. Autism spectrum disorder.
Stereotypic movements may be a presenting symptom of autism spectrum
disorder and should be considered when repetitive movements and
behaviors are being evaluated. Deficits of social communication and
reciprocity manifesting in autism spectrum disorder are generally absent
in stereotypic movement disorder, and thus social interaction, social
communication, and rigid repetitive behaviors and interests are
distinguishing features. When autism spectrum disorder is present,
stereotypic movement disorder is diagnosed only when there is
self-injury8, 10 or when the stereotypic behaviors are sufficiently
severe to become a focus of treatment. Tic disorders. Typically,
stereotypies have an earlier age at onset (before 3 years) than do tics,
which have a mean age at onset of 5--7 years. They are consistent and
fixed in their pattern or topography compared with tics, which are
variable in their presentation. Stereotypies may involve arms, hands, or
the entire body, while tics commonly involve eyes, face, head, and
shoulders. Stereotypies are more fixed, rhythmic, and prolonged in
duration than tics, which, generally, are brief, rapid, random, and
fluctuating. Tics and stereotypic movements are both reduced by
distraction. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Stereotypic
movement disorder is distinguished from obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD) by the absence of obsessions, as well as by the nature of the
repetitive behaviors. In OCD the individual feels driven to perform
repetitive behaviors in

response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied
rigidly, whereas in stereotypic movement disorder the behaviors are
seemingly driven but apparently purposeless. Trichotillomania
(hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder are
characterized by body-focused repetitive behaviors (i.e., hair pulling
and skin picking) that may be seemingly driven but that are not
apparently purposeless, and that may not be patterned or rhythmical.
Furthermore, onset in trichotillomania and excoriation disorder is not
typically in the early developmental period, but rather around puberty
or later. Other neurological and medical conditions. The diagnosis of
stereotypic movements requires the exclusion of habits, mannerisms,
paroxysmal dyskinesias, and benign hereditary chorea. A neurological
history and examination are required to assess features suggestive of
other disorders, such as myoclonus, dystonia, tics, and chorea.
Involuntary movements associated with a neurological condition may be
distinguished by their signs and symptoms. For example, repetitive,
stereotypic movements in tardive dyskinesia can be distinguished by a
history of chronic neuroleptic use and characteristic oral or facial
dyskinesia or irregular trunk or limb movements. These types of
movements do not result in self-injury. A diagnosis of stereotypic
movement disorder is not appropriate for repetitive skin picking or
scratching associated with amphetamine intoxication or abuse (e.g.,
patients are diagnosed with substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder) and repetitive choreoathetoid
movements associated with other neurological disorders.

Comorbidity Stereotypic movement disorder may occur as a primary
diagnosis or secondary to another disorder9. For example, stereotypies
are a common manifestation of a variety of neurogenetic disorders, such
as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Rett syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Cornelia de
Lange syndrome, and Smith-Magenis syndrome7. When stereotypic movement
disorder co-occurs with another medical condition, both should be coded.

tic disorder.

Specifiers The "motor tics only" or "vocal tics only" specifier is only
required for persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder.

Diagnostic Features Tic disorders comprise four diagnostic categories:
Tourette's disorder, persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder,
provisional tic disorder, and the other specified and unspecified tic
disorders. Diagnosis for any tic disorder is based on the presence of
motor and/or vocal tics (Criterion A), duration of tic symptoms
(Criterion B), age at onset (Criterion C), and absence of any known
cause such as another medical condition or substance use (Criterion D).
The tic disorders are hierarchical in order (i.e., Tourette's disorder,
followed by persistent \[chronic\] motor or vocal tic disorder, followed
by provisional tic disorder, followed by the other specified and
unspecified tic disorders), such that once a tic disorder at one level
of the hierarchy is diagnosed, a lower hierarchy diagnosis cannot be
made (Criterion E). Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor
movements or vocalizations. An individual may have various tic symptoms
over time, but at any point in time, the tic repertoire recurs in a
characteristic fashion. Although tics can include almost any muscle
group or vocalization, certain tic symptoms, such as eye blinking or
throat clearing, are common across patient populations. Tics are
generally experienced as involuntary but can be voluntarily suppressed
for varying lengths of time2, 18. Tics can be either simple or complex.
Simple motor tics are of short duration (i.e., milliseconds) and can
include eye blinking, shoulder shrugging, and extension of the
extremities. Simple vocal tics include throat clearing, sniffing, and
grunting often caused by contraction of the diaphragm or muscles of the
oropharynx. Complex motor tics are of longer duration (i.e., seconds)
and often include a combination of simple tics such as simultaneous head
turning and shoulder shrugging. Complex tics can

appear purposeful, such as a tic-like sexual or obscene gesture
(copropraxia) or a tic-like imitation of someone else's movements
(echopraxia). Similarly, complex vocal tics include repeating one's own
sounds or words (palilalia), repeating the last-heard word or phrase
(echolalia), or uttering socially unacceptable words, including
obscenities, or ethnic, racial, or religious slurs (coprolalia).
Importantly, coprolalia is an abrupt, sharp bark or grunt utterance and
lacks the prosody of similar inappropriate speech observed in human
interactions. The presence of motor and/or vocal tics varies across the
four tic disorders (Criterion A). For Tourette's disorder, both motor
and vocal tics must be present, whereas for persistent (chronic) motor
or vocal tic disorder, only motor or only vocal tics are present. For
provisional tic disorder, motor and/or vocal tics may be present. For
other specified or unspecified tic disorders, the movement disorder
symptoms are best characterized as tics but are atypical in presentation
or age at onset, or have a known etiology. The 1-year minimum duration
criterion (Criterion B) assures that individuals diagnosed with either
Tourette's disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder
have had persistent symptoms. Tics wax and wane in severity, and some
individuals may have tic-free periods of weeks to months; however, an
individual who has had tic symptoms of greater than 1 year's duration
since first tic onset would be considered to have persistent symptoms
regardless of duration of tic-free periods. For an individual with motor
and/or vocal tics of less than 1 year since first tic onset, a
provisional tic disorder diagnosis can be considered. There is no
duration specification for other specified and unspecified tic
disorders. The onset of tics must occur prior to age 18 years (Criterion
C). Tic disorders typically begin in the prepubertal period, with an
average age at onset between 4 and 6 years, and with the incidence of
new-onset tic disorders decreasing in the teen years. New onset of tic
symptoms in adulthood is exceedingly rare8 and is often associated with
exposures to drugs (e.g., excessive cocaine use) or is a result of a
central nervous system insult (e.g., postviral encephalitis). Although
tic onset is uncommon in teenagers and adults, it is not uncommon for
adolescents and adults to present for an initial diagnostic assessment
and, when carefully evaluated, provide a history of milder symptoms
dating back to childhood. New-onset abnormal

movements suggestive of tics outside of the usual age range should
result in evaluation for other movement disorders or for specific
etiologies. Tic symptoms cannot be attributable to the physiological
effects of a substance or another medical condition (Criterion D). When
there is strong evidence from the history, physical examination, and/or
laboratory results to suggest a plausible, proximal, and probable cause
for a tic disorder, a diagnosis of other specified tic disorder should
be used. Having previously met diagnostic criteria for Tourette's
disorder negates a possible diagnosis of persistent (chronic) motor or
vocal tic disorder (Criterion E). Similarly, a previous diagnosis of
persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder negates a diagnosis of
provisional tic disorder or other specified or unspecified tic disorder
(Criterion E).

Prevalence Tics are common in childhood but transient in most cases. The
estimated prevalence of Tourette's disorder ranges from 3 to 8 per 1,000
in school-age children. Males are more commonly affected than females,
with the ratio varying from 2:1 to 4:19. A national survey in the United
States estimated 3 per 1,000 for the prevalence of clinically identified
cases3. The frequency of identified cases was lower among African
Americans and Hispanic Americans, which may be related to differences in
access to care.

Development and Course Onset of tics is typically between ages 4 and 6
years. Peak severity occurs between ages 10 and 12 years, with a decline
in severity during adolescence. Many adults with tic disorders
experience diminished symptoms. A small percentage of individuals will
have persistently severe or worsening symptoms in adulthood1. Tic
symptoms manifest similarly in all age groups and across the lifespan.
Tics wax and wane in severity and change in affected muscle groups and
vocalizations over time. As children get older, they begin to report
their tics being associated with a premonitory urge---a somatic
sensation that precedes the tic---and a feeling of tension reduction
following the expression of the tic10. Tics associated with a
premonitory urge may be experienced as not completely "involuntary" in
that the urge and the tic can be resisted. An individual may also feel
the need to perform a tic in a

specific way or repeat it until he or she achieves the feeling that the
tic has been done "just right." The vulnerability toward developing
co-occurring conditions changes as individuals pass through the age of
risk for various co-occurring conditions. For example, prepubertal
children with tic disorders are more likely to experience
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessivecompulsive
disorder (OCD), and separation anxiety disorder than are teenagers and
adults, who are more likely to experience the new onset of major
depressive disorder, substance use disorder, or bipolar disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Tics are worsened by anxiety,
excitement, and exhaustion and are better during calm, focused
activities. Individuals may have fewer tics when engaged in schoolwork
or tasks at work than when relaxing at home after school or in the
evening. Stressful/exciting events (e.g., taking a test, participating
in exciting activities) often make tics worse. Environmental. Observing
a gesture or sound in another person may result in an individual with a
tic disorder making a similar gesture or sound, which may be incorrectly
perceived by others as purposeful. This can be a particular problem when
the individual is interacting with authority figures (e.g., teachers,
supervisors, police). Genetic and physiological. Genetic and
environmental factors influence tic symptom expression and severity.
Important risk alleles for Tourette's disorder16 and rare genetic
variants in families with tic disorders have been identified6, 15.
Obstetrical complications, older paternal age, lower birth weight, and
maternal smoking during pregnancy are associated with worse tic
severity13.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Tic disorders do not appear to vary in
clinical characteristics, course, or etiology by race, ethnicity, and
culture. However, race, ethnicity, and culture may impact how tic
disorders are perceived and managed in the family and community, as well
as influencing patterns of help seeking, and choices of treatment3, 14.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Males are more commonly affected than
females, but there are no gender differences in the kinds of tics, age
at onset, or course. Women with persistent tic disorders may be more
likely to experience anxiety and depression12.

Functional Consequences of Tic Disorders Many individuals with mild to
moderate tic severity experience no distress or impairment in
functioning and may even be unaware of their tics. Individuals with more
severe symptoms generally have more impairment in daily living, but even
individuals with moderate or even severe tic disorders may function
well. The presence of a co-occurring condition, such as ADHD or OCD, can
have greater impact on functioning7. Less commonly, tics disrupt
functioning in daily activities and result in social isolation,
interpersonal conflict, peer victimization, inability to work or to go
to school, and lower quality of life4, 5. The individual also may
experience substantial psychological distress. Rare complications of
Tourette's disorder include physical injury, such as eye injury (from
hitting oneself in the face), and orthopedic and neurological injury
(e.g., disc disease related to forceful head and neck movements)11.

Differential Diagnosis Abnormal movements that may accompany other
medical conditions and stereotypic movement disorder. Motor stereotypies
are defined as involuntary rhythmic, repetitive, predictable movements
that appear purposeful but serve no obvious adaptive function or purpose
and stop with distraction18. Examples include repetitive hand
waving/rotating, arm flapping, and finger wiggling. Motor stereotypies
can be differentiated from tics based on the former's earlier age at
onset (younger than 3 years), prolonged duration (seconds to minutes),
constant repetitive fixed form and location, exacerbation when engrossed
in activities, lack of a premonitory urge, and cessation with
distraction (e.g., name called or touched). Chorea represents rapid,
random, continual, abrupt, irregular, unpredictable, nonstereotyped
actions that are usually bilateral and affect all parts of the body
(i.e., face, trunk, and limbs). The timing, direction, and distribution
of movements vary from moment to moment, and movements usually worsen

during attempted voluntary action. Dystonia is the simultaneous
sustained contracture of both agonist and antagonist muscles, resulting
in a distorted posture or movement of parts of the body. Dystonic
postures are often triggered by attempts at voluntary movements and are
not seen during sleep17. Substance-induced and paroxysmal dyskinesias.
Paroxysmal dyskinesias usually occur as dystonic or choreoathetoid
movements that are precipitated by voluntary movement or exertion and
less commonly arise from normal background activity. Myoclonus.
Myoclonus is characterized by a sudden unidirectional movement that is
often nonrhythmic. It may be worsened by movement and occur during
sleep. Myoclonus is differentiated from tics by its rapidity, lack of
suppressibility, and absence of a premonitory urge. Obsessive-compulsive
and related disorders. Differentiating obsessivecompulsive behaviors
from tics may be difficult. Clues favoring an obsessive-compulsive
behavior include a cognitive-based drive (e.g., fear of contamination)
and the need to perform the action in a particular fashion a certain
number of times, equally on both sides of the body, or until a "just
right" feeling is achieved. Impulse-control problems and other
repetitive behaviors, including persistent hair pulling, skin picking,
and nail biting, appear more goal directed and complex than tics19.

Comorbidity Many medical and psychiatric conditions have been described
as cooccurring with tic disorders16, with ADHD and obsessive-compulsive
and related disorders being particularly common. The
obsessive-compulsive symptoms observed in tic disorder tend to be
characterized by more aggressive symmetry and order symptoms and poorer
response to pharmacotherapy with selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. Children with ADHD may demonstrate disruptive behavior,
social immaturity, and learning difficulties that may interfere with
academic progress and interpersonal relationships and lead to greater
impairment than that caused by a tic disorder. Individuals with tic
disorders can also have other movement disorders and other mental
disorders, such as depressive, bipolar, or substance use disorders.

Other Specified Tic Disorder 307.20 (F95.8) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a tic disorder that
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for a tic disorder or any of the disorders in
the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The other specified
tic disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does
not meet the criteria for a tic disorder or any specific
neurodevelopmental disorder. This

is done by recording "other specified tic disorder" followed by the
specific reason (e.g., "with onset after age 18 years").

Unspecified Tic Disorder 307.20 (F95.9) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a tic disorder that
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for a tic disorder or for any of the
disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified tic disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a tic disorder or for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder,
and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to
make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Neurodevelopmental Disorders Other Specified Neurodevelopmental
Disorder 315.8 (F88) This category applies to presentations in which
symptoms characteristic of a neurodevelopmental disorder that cause
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The
other specified neurodevelopmental disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific
neurodevelopmental disorder. This is done by recording "other specified
neurodevelopmental disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g.,
"neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol
exposure"). An example of a presentation that can be specified using the
"other specified" designation is the following:

Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure:
Neurodevelopmental disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure is
characterized by a range of developmental disabilities following
exposure to alcohol in utero.

Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder 315.9 (F89) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
neurodevelopmental disorder that cause impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the
neurodevelopmental disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
neurodevelopmental disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a specific neurodevelopmental disorder, and includes
presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders Schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorders include schizophrenia, other
psychotic disorders, and schizotypal (personality) disorder. They are
defined by abnormalities in one or more of the following five domains:
delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking (speech), grossly
disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including catatonia), and
negative symptoms.

Key Features That Define the Psychotic Disorders Delusions Delusions are
fixed beliefs that are not amenable to change in light of conflicting
evidence. Their content may include a variety of themes (e.g.,
persecutory, referential, somatic, religious, grandiose). Persecutory
delusions (i.e., belief that one is going to be harmed, harassed, and so
forth by an individual, organization, or other group) are most common.
Referential delusions (i.e., belief that certain gestures, comments,
environmental cues, and so forth are directed at oneself) are also
common. Grandiose delusions (i.e., when an individual believes that he
or she has exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame) and erotomanic
delusions (i.e., when an individual believes falsely that another person
is in love with him or her) are also seen. Nihilistic delusions involve
the conviction that a major catastrophe will occur, and somatic
delusions focus on preoccupations regarding health and organ function.
Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible and not
understandable to same-culture peers and do not derive from ordinary
life experiences. An example of a bizarre delusion is the belief that an
outside force has removed his or her internal organs and replaced them
with someone else's organs without leaving any wounds or scars. An
example of a nonbizarre delusion is the belief that one is under
surveillance by the

police, despite a lack of convincing evidence. Delusions that express a
loss of control over mind or body are generally considered to be
bizarre; these include the belief that one's thoughts have been
"removed" by some outside force (thought withdrawal), that alien
thoughts have been put into one's mind (thought insertion), or that
one's body or actions are being acted on or manipulated by some outside
force (delusions of control). The distinction between a delusion and a
strongly held idea is sometimes difficult to make and depends in part on
the degree of conviction with which the belief is held despite clear or
reasonable contradictory evidence regarding its veracity.

Hallucinations Hallucinations are perception-like experiences that occur
without an external stimulus. They are vivid and clear, with the full
force and impact of normal perceptions, and not under voluntary control.
They may occur in any sensory modality, but auditory hallucinations are
the most common in schizophrenia and related disorders. Auditory
hallucinations are usually experienced as voices, whether familiar or
unfamiliar, that are perceived as distinct from the individual's own
thoughts. The hallucinations must occur in the context of a clear
sensorium; those that occur while falling asleep (hypnagogic) or waking
up (hypnopompic) are considered to be within the range of normal
experience. Hallucinations may be a normal part of religious experience
in certain cultural contexts.

Disorganized Thinking (Speech) Disorganized thinking (formal thought
disorder) is typically inferred from the individual's speech. The
individual may switch from one topic to another (derailment or loose
associations). Answers to questions may be obliquely related or
completely unrelated (tangentiality). Rarely, speech may be so severely
disorganized that it is nearly incomprehensible and resembles receptive
aphasia in its linguistic disorganization (incoherence or "word salad").
Because mildly disorganized speech is common and nonspecific, the
symptom must be severe enough to substantially impair effective
communication. The severity of the impairment may be difficult to
evaluate if the person making the diagnosis comes from a different
linguistic background than that of the person being examined. Less
severe

disorganized thinking or speech may occur during the prodromal and
residual periods of schizophrenia.

Grossly Disorganized or Abnormal Behavior (Including Catatonia)

Motor

Grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior may manifest itself in a
variety of ways, ranging from childlike "silliness" to unpredictable
agitation. Problems may be noted in any form of goal-directed behavior,
leading to difficulties in performing activities of daily living.
Catatonic behavior is a marked decrease in reactivity to the
environment. This ranges from resistance to instructions (negativism);
to maintaining a rigid, inappropriate or bizarre posture; to a complete
lack of verbal and motor responses (mutism and stupor). It can also
include purposeless and excessive motor activity without obvious cause
(catatonic excitement). Other features are repeated stereotyped
movements, staring, grimacing, mutism, and the echoing of speech.
Although catatonia has historically been associated with schizophrenia,
catatonic symptoms are nonspecific and may occur in other mental
disorders (e.g., bipolar or depressive disorders with catatonia) and in
medical conditions (catatonic disorder due to another medical
condition).

Negative Symptoms Negative symptoms account for a substantial portion of
the morbidity associated with schizophrenia but are less prominent in
other psychotic disorders. Two negative symptoms are particularly
prominent in schizophrenia: diminished emotional expression and
avolition. Diminished emotional expression includes reductions in the
expression of emotions in the face, eye contact, intonation of speech
(prosody), and movements of the hand, head, and face that normally give
an emotional emphasis to speech. Avolition is a decrease in motivated
self-initiated purposeful activities. The individual may sit for long
periods of time and show little interest in participating in work or
social activities. Other negative symptoms include alogia, anhedonia,
and asociality. Alogia is manifested by diminished speech output.
Anhedonia is the decreased ability to experience pleasure from positive
stimuli or a degradation in the recollection of pleasure previously
experienced7. Asociality refers to the apparent lack of interest in

social interactions and may be associated with avolition, but it can
also be a manifestation of limited opportunities for social
interactions.

Disorders in This Chapter This chapter is organized along a gradient of
psychopathology. Clinicians should first consider conditions that do not
reach full criteria for a psychotic disorder or are limited to one
domain of psychopathology. Then they should consider time-limited
conditions. Finally, the diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder
requires the exclusion of another condition that may give rise to
psychosis. Schizotypal personality disorder is noted within this chapter
as it is considered within the schizophrenia spectrum, although its full
description is found in the chapter "Personality Disorders." The
diagnosis schizotypal personality disorder captures a pervasive pattern
of social and interpersonal deficits, including reduced capacity for
close relationships; cognitive or perceptual distortions; and
eccentricities of behavior, usually beginning by early adulthood but in
some cases first becoming apparent in childhood and adolescence.
Abnormalities of beliefs, thinking, and perception are below the
threshold for the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Two conditions are
defined by abnormalities limited to one domain of psychosis: delusions
or catatonia. Delusional disorder is characterized by at least 1 month
of delusions but no other psychotic symptoms. Catatonia is described
later in the chapter and further in this discussion. Brief psychotic
disorder lasts more than 1 day and remits by 1 month. Schizophreniform
disorder is characterized by a symptomatic presentation equivalent to
that of schizophrenia except for its duration (less than 6 months) and
the absence of a requirement for a decline in functioning. Schizophrenia
lasts for at least 6 months and includes at least 1 month of
active-phase symptoms. In schizoaffective disorder, a mood episode and
the active-phase symptoms of schizophrenia occur together and were
preceded or are followed by at least 2 weeks of delusions or
hallucinations without prominent mood symptoms. Psychotic disorders may
be induced by another condition. In substance/medication-induced
psychotic disorder, the psychotic symptoms are judged to be a
physiological consequence of a drug of abuse, a medication, or toxin
exposure and cease after removal of the agent. In

psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, the psychotic
symptoms are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of another
medical condition. Catatonia can occur in several disorders, including
neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive, and other mental
disorders. This chapter also includes the diagnoses catatonia associated
with another mental disorder (catatonia specifier), catatonic disorder
due to another medical condition, and unspecified catatonia, and the
diagnostic criteria for all three conditions are described together.
Other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other
psychotic disorders are included for classifying psychotic presentations
that do not meet the criteria for any of the specific psychotic
disorders, or psychotic symptomatology about which there is inadequate
or contradictory information.

Clinician-Rated Assessment of Symptoms and Related Clinical Phenomena in
Psychosis Psychotic disorders are heterogeneous, and the severity of
symptoms can predict important aspects of the illness, such as the
degree of cognitive or neurobiological deficits1. To move the field
forward, a detailed framework for the assessment of severity is included
in Section III "Assessment Measures," which may help with treatment
planning, prognostic decision making, and research on pathophysiological
mechanisms. Section III "Assessment Measures" also contains dimensional
assessments of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including
hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech (except for
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder and psychotic disorder
due to another medical condition), abnormal psychomotor behavior, and
negative symptoms, as well as dimensional assessments of depression and
mania. The severity of mood symptoms in psychosis has prognostic value
and guides treatment9. There is growing evidence that schizoaffective
disorder is not a distinct nosological category8. Thus, dimensional
assessments of depression and mania for all psychotic disorders alert
clinicians to mood pathology and the need to treat where appropriate.
The Section III scale also includes a dimensional assessment of
cognitive impairment. Many individuals with psychotic disorders have
impairments in a range of cognitive domains10 that predict

functional status4. Clinical neuropsychological assessment can help
guide diagnosis and treatment, but brief assessments without formal
neuropsychological assessment can provide useful information3, 5, 6 that
can be sufficient for diagnostic purposes. Formal neuropsychological
testing, when conducted, should be administered and scored by personnel
trained in the use of testing instruments. If a formal
neuropsychological assessment is not conducted, the clinician should use
the best available information to make a judgment. Further research on
these assessments is necessary in order to determine their clinical
utility; thus, the assessments available in Section III should serve as
a prototype to stimulate such research.

Schizotypal (Personality) Disorder Criteria and text for schizotypal
personality disorder can be found in the chapter "Personality
Disorders." Because this disorder is considered part of the
schizophrenia spectrum of disorders, and is labeled in this section of
ICD-9 and ICD-10 as schizotypal disorder, it is listed in this chapter
and discussed in detail in the DSM-5 chapter "Personality Disorders."

Delusional Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

297.1 (F22)

a.  The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month
    or longer.
b.  Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met. Note:
    Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the
    delusional theme (e.g., the sensation of being infested with insects
    associated with delusions of infestation).
c.  Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications,
    functioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously
    bizarre or odd.
d.  If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been
    brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods.
e.  The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
    a substance or another medical condition and is not better explained
    by

another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Specify whether: Erotomanic type: This
subtype applies when the central theme of the delusion is that another
person is in love with the individual. Grandiose type: This subtype
applies when the central theme of the delusion is the conviction of
having some great (but unrecognized) talent or insight or having made
some important discovery. Jealous type: This subtype applies when the
central theme of the individual's delusion is that his or her spouse or
lover is unfaithful. Persecutory type: This subtype applies when the
central theme of the delusion involves the individual's belief that he
or she is being conspired against, cheated, spied on, followed, poisoned
or drugged, maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the pursuit
of longterm goals. Somatic type: This subtype applies when the central
theme of the delusion involves bodily functions or sensations. Mixed
type: This subtype applies when no one delusional theme predominates.
Unspecified type: This subtype applies when the dominant delusional
belief cannot be clearly determined or is not described in the specific
types (e.g., referential delusions without a prominent persecutory or
grandiose component). Specify if: With bizarre content: Delusions are
deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible, not understandable, and
not derived from ordinary life experiences (e.g., an individual's belief
that a stranger has removed his or her internal organs and replaced them
with someone else's organs without leaving any wounds or scars). Specify
if: The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year
duration of the disorder: First episode, currently in acute episode:
First manifestation of the disorder meeting the defining diagnostic
symptom and time criteria.

An acute episode is a time period in which the symptom criteria are
fulfilled. First episode, currently in partial remission: Partial
remission is a time period during which an improvement after a previous
episode is maintained and in which the defining criteria of the disorder
are only partially fulfilled. First episode, currently in full
remission: Full remission is a period of time after a previous episode
during which no disorder-specific symptoms are present. Multiple
episodes, currently in acute episode Multiple episodes, currently in
partial remission Multiple episodes, currently in full remission
Continuous: Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the
disorder are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with
subthreshold symptom periods being very brief relative to the overall
course. Unspecified Specify current severity: Severity is rated by a
quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including
delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor
behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for
its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale
ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See
Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter
"Assessment Measures.") Note: Diagnosis of delusional disorder can be
made without using this severity specifier.

Subtypes In erotomanic type, the central theme of the delusion is that
another person is in love with the individual. The person about whom
this conviction is held is usually of higher status (e.g., a famous
individual or a superior at work) but can be a complete stranger.
Efforts to contact the object of the delusion are common. In grandiose
type, the central theme of the delusion is the conviction of having some
great talent or insight or of having made

some important discovery. Less commonly, the individual may have the
delusion of having a special relationship with a prominent individual or
of being a prominent person (in which case the actual individual may be
regarded as an impostor). Grandiose delusions may have a religious
content. In jealous type, the central theme of the delusion is that of
an unfaithful partner. This belief is arrived at without due cause and
is based on incorrect inferences supported by small bits of "evidence"
(e.g., disarrayed clothing). The individual with the delusion usually
confronts the spouse or lover and attempts to intervene in the imagined
infidelity. In persecutory type, the central theme of the delusion
involves the individual's belief of being conspired against, cheated,
spied on, followed, poisoned, maliciously maligned, harassed, or
obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals. Small slights may be
exaggerated and become the focus of a delusional system. The affected
individual may engage in repeated attempts to obtain satisfaction by
legal or legislative action. Individuals with persecutory delusions are
often resentful and angry and may resort to violence against those they
believe are hurting them. In somatic type, the central theme of the
delusion involves bodily functions or sensations. Somatic delusions can
occur in several forms. Most common is the belief that the individual
emits a foul odor; that there is an infestation of insects on or in the
skin; that there is an internal parasite; or that parts of the body are
not functioning.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of delusional disorder is the
presence of one or more delusions that persist for at least 1 month
(Criterion A). A diagnosis of delusional disorder is not given if the
individual has ever had a symptom presentation that met Criterion A for
schizophrenia (Criterion B). Apart from the direct impact of the
delusions, impairments in psychosocial functioning may be more
circumscribed than those seen in other psychotic disorders such as
schizophrenia, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd (Criterion
C). If mood episodes occur concurrently with the delusions, the total
duration of these mood episodes is brief relative to the total duration
of the delusional periods (Criterion D). The delusions are not
attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine)
or another medical condition (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) and are not
better

explained by another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder
or obsessive-compulsive disorder (Criterion E). In addition to the five
symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the
assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital
for making critically important distinctions between the various
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Social, marital, or work
problems can result from the delusional beliefs of delusional disorder3,
4, 5, 7. Individuals with delusional disorder may be able to factually
describe that others view their beliefs as irrational but are unable to
accept this themselves (i.e., there may be "factual insight" but no true
insight). Many individuals develop irritable or dysphoric mood, which
can usually be understood as a reaction to their delusional beliefs1.
Anger and violent behavior can occur with persecutory, jealous, and
erotomanic types. The individual may engage in litigious or antagonistic
behavior (e.g., sending hundreds of letters of protest to the
government). Legal difficulties can occur, particularly in jealous and
erotomanic types.

Prevalence The lifetime prevalence of delusional disorder has been
estimated at around 0.2%8, and the most frequent subtype is
persecutory2. Delusional disorder, jealous type, is probably more common
in males than in females, but there are no major gender differences in
the overall frequency of delusional disorder2, 4, 7, 10.

Development and Course On average, global function is generally better
than that observed in schizophrenia1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7. Although the
diagnosis is generally stable, a proportion of individuals go on to
develop schizophrenia7, 9. Delusional disorder has a significant
familial relationship with both schizophrenia and schizotypal
personality disorder6. Although it can occur in younger age groups, the
condition may be more prevalent in older individuals2, 4, 7, 10.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

An individual's cultural and religious background must be taken into
account in evaluating the possible presence of delusional disorder. The
content of delusions also varies across cultural contexts.

Functional Consequences of Delusional Disorder The functional impairment
is usually more circumscribed than that seen with other psychotic
disorders, although in some cases, the impairment may be substantial and
include poor occupational functioning and social isolation1, 3, 5, 7.
When poor psychosocial functioning is present, delusional beliefs
themselves often play a significant role. A common characteristic of
individuals with delusional disorder is the apparent normality of their
behavior and appearance when their delusional ideas are not being
discussed or acted on.

Differential Diagnosis Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. If an
individual with obsessive-compulsive disorder is completely convinced
that his or her obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true, then the
diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, with absent
insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than a
diagnosis of delusional disorder. Similarly, if an individual with body
dysmorphic disorder is completely convinced that his or her body
dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true, then the diagnosis of body
dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier,
should be given rather than a diagnosis of delusional disorder.
Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, psychotic disorder due to
another medical condition, and substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder. Individuals with these disorders may present with symptoms
that suggest delusional disorder. For example, simple persecutory
delusions in the context of major neurocognitive disorder would be
diagnosed as major neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance.
A substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder crosssectionally may
be identical in symptomatology to delusional disorder but can be
distinguished by the chronological relationship of substance use to the
onset and remission of the delusional beliefs.

Schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder. Delusional disorder can be
distinguished from schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder by the
absence of the other characteristic symptoms of the active phase of
schizophrenia. Depressive and bipolar disorders and schizoaffective
disorder. These disorders may be distinguished from delusional disorder
by the temporal relationship between the mood disturbance and the
delusions and by the severity of the mood symptoms. If delusions occur
exclusively during mood episodes, the diagnosis is depressive or bipolar
disorder with psychotic features. Mood symptoms that meet full criteria
for a mood episode can be superimposed on delusional disorder3.
Delusional disorder can be diagnosed only if the total duration of all
mood episodes remains brief relative to the total duration of the
delusional disturbance. If not, then a diagnosis of other specified or
unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder
accompanied by other specified depressive disorder, unspecified
depressive disorder, other specified bipolar and related disorder, or
unspecified bipolar and related disorder is appropriate.

Brief Psychotic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

298.8 (F23)

a.  Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms. At least one of
    these must be (1), (2), or (3):

<!-- -->

1.  Delusions.
2.  Hallucinations.
3.  Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
4.  Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior. Note: Do not include a
    symptom if it is a culturally sanctioned response.

<!-- -->

b.  Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less
    than 1 month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of
    functioning.
c.  The disturbance is not better explained by major depressive or
    bipolar disorder with psychotic features or another psychotic
    disorder such as schizophrenia or catatonia, and is not attributable
    to the physiological

effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another
medical condition. Specify if: With marked stressor(s) (brief reactive
psychosis): If symptoms occur in response to events that, singly or
together, would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar
circumstances in the individual's culture. Without marked stressor(s):
If symptoms do not occur in response to events that, singly or together,
would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in
the individual's culture. With peripartum onset: If onset is during
pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum. Specify if: With catatonia
(refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with another mental
disorder, pp. 119--120, for definition) Coding note: Use additional code
293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with brief psychotic disorder to
indicate the presence of the comorbid catatonia. Specify current
severity: Severity is rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary
symptoms of psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized
speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of
these symptoms may be rated for its current severity (most severe in the
last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4
(present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis
Symptom Severity in the chapter "Assessment Measures.") Note: Diagnosis
of brief psychotic disorder can be made without using this severity
specifier.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of brief psychotic disorder is
a disturbance that involves the sudden onset of at least one of the
following positive psychotic symptoms: delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence), or
grossly abnormal psychomotor behavior, including catatonia (Criterion
A). Sudden onset is defined as change from a

nonpsychotic state to a clearly psychotic state within 2 weeks, usually
without a prodrome. An episode of the disturbance lasts at least 1 day
but less than 1 month, and the individual eventually has a full return
to the premorbid level of functioning (Criterion B). The disturbance is
not better explained by a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic
features, by schizoaffective disorder, or by schizophrenia and is not
attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
hallucinogen) or another medical condition (e.g., subdural hematoma)
(Criterion C). In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified
in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and
mania symptom domains is vital for making critically important
distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other
psychotic disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with brief
psychotic disorder typically experience emotional turmoil or
overwhelming confusion1. They may have rapid shifts from one intense
affect to another. Although the disturbance is brief, the level of
impairment may be severe, and supervision may be required to ensure that
nutritional and hygienic needs are met and that the individual is
protected from the consequences of poor judgment, cognitive impairment,
or acting on the basis of delusions. There appears to be an increased
risk of suicidal behavior, particularly during the acute episode4.

Prevalence In the United States, brief psychotic disorder may account
for 9% of cases of first-onset psychosis6. Psychotic disturbances that
meet Criteria A and C, but not Criterion B, for brief psychotic disorder
(i.e., duration of active symptoms is 1--6 months as opposed to
remission within 1 month) are more common in developing countries than
in developed countries5. Brief psychotic disorder is twofold more common
in females than in males5.

Development and Course Brief psychotic disorder may appear in
adolescence or early adulthood, and onset can occur across the lifespan,
with the average age at onset being the mid 30s3. By definition, a
diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder requires a full remission of all
symptoms and an eventual full return to the premorbid

level of functioning within 1 month of the onset of the disturbance. In
some individuals, the duration of psychotic symptoms may be quite brief
(e.g., a few days).

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Preexisting personality
disorders and traits (e.g., schizotypal personality disorder; borderline
personality disorder; or traits in the psychoticism domain, such as
perceptual dysregulation, and the negative affectivity domain, such as
suspiciousness) may predispose the individual to the development of the
disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues It is important to distinguish
symptoms of brief psychotic disorder from culturally sanctioned response
patterns. For example, in some religious ceremonies, an individual may
report hearing voices, but these do not generally persist and are not
perceived as abnormal by most members of the individual's community. In
addition, cultural and religious background must be taken into account
when considering whether beliefs are delusional.

Functional Consequences of Brief Psychotic Disorder Despite high rates
of relapse, for most individuals, outcome is excellent in terms of
social functioning and symptomatology3.

Differential Diagnosis Other medical conditions. A variety of medical
disorders can manifest with psychotic symptoms of short duration.
Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or a delirium is
diagnosed when there is evidence from the history, physical examination,
or laboratory tests that the delusions or hallucinations are the direct
physiological consequence of a specific medical condition (e.g.,
Cushing's syndrome, brain tumor) (see "Psychotic Disorder Due to Another
Medical Condition" later in this chapter). Substance-related disorders.
Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, substance-induced
delirium, and substance intoxication are distinguished from brief
psychotic disorder by the fact that a substance

(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure to a toxin) is judged to
be etiologically related to the psychotic symptoms (see
"Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder" later in this
chapter). Laboratory tests, such as a urine drug screen or a blood
alcohol level, may be helpful in making this determination, as may a
careful history of substance use with attention to temporal
relationships between substance intake and onset of the symptoms and to
the nature of the substance being used. Depressive and bipolar
disorders. The diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder cannot be made if
the psychotic symptoms are better explained by a mood episode (i.e., the
psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during a full major depressive,
manic, or mixed episode). Other psychotic disorders. If the psychotic
symptoms persist for 1 month or longer, the diagnosis is either
schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, depressive disorder with
psychotic features, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or other
specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorder, depending on the other symptoms in the presentation. The
differential diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder and
schizophreniform disorder is difficult when the psychotic symptoms have
remitted before 1 month in response to successful treatment with
medication. Careful attention should be given to the possibility that a
recurrent disorder (e.g., bipolar disorder, recurrent acute
exacerbations of schizophrenia) may be responsible for any recurring
psychotic episodes. Malingering and factitious disorders. An episode of
factitious disorder, with predominantly psychological signs and
symptoms, may have the appearance of brief psychotic disorder, but in
such cases there is evidence that the symptoms are intentionally
produced. When malingering involves apparently psychotic symptoms, there
is usually evidence that the illness is being feigned for an
understandable goal. Personality disorders. In certain individuals with
personality disorders, psychosocial stressors may precipitate brief
periods of psychotic symptoms2. These symptoms are usually transient and
do not warrant a separate diagnosis. If psychotic symptoms persist for
at least 1 day, an additional diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder may
be appropriate.

Schizophreniform Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

295.40 (F20.81)

a.  Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant
    portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully
    treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):

<!-- -->

1.  Delusions.
2.  Hallucinations.
3.  Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
4.  Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
5.  Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or
    avolition).

<!-- -->

b.  An episode of the disorder lasts at least 1 month but less than 6
    months. When the diagnosis must be made without waiting for
    recovery, it should be qualified as "provisional."

c. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with
psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no major
depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the
active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during
active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the
total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness. d. The
disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition. Specify if: With good prognostic features: This specifier
requires the presence of at least two of the following features: onset
of prominent psychotic symptoms within 4 weeks of the first noticeable
change in usual behavior or functioning; confusion or perplexity; good
premorbid social and occupational functioning; and absence of blunted or
flat affect. Without good prognostic features: This specifier is applied
if two or more of the above features have not been present. Specify if:
With catatonia (refer to the criteria for catatonia associated with
another mental disorder, pp. 119--120, for definition). Coding note: Use
additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia associated with
schizophreniform disorder to indicate the presence of the comorbid
catatonia. Specify current severity: Severity is rated by a quantitative
assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including delusions,
hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and
negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current
severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging
from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated
Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter "Assessment
Measures.") Note: Diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder can be made
without using this severity specifier.

Diagnostic Features The characteristic symptoms of schizophreniform
disorder are identical to those of schizophrenia (Criterion A).
Schizophreniform disorder is distinguished by its difference in
duration: the total duration of the illness, including prodromal,
active, and residual phases, is at least 1 month but less than 6 months
(Criterion B). The duration requirement for schizophreniform disorder is
intermediate between that for brief psychotic disorder, which lasts more
than 1 day and remits by 1 month, and schizophrenia, which lasts for at
least 6 months. The diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made under
two conditions: 1) when an episode of illness lasts between 1 and 6
months and the individual has already recovered, and 2) when an
individual is symptomatic for less than the 6 months' duration required
for the diagnosis of schizophrenia but has not yet recovered. In this
case, the diagnosis should be noted as "schizophreniform disorder
(provisional)" because it is uncertain if the individual will recover
from the disturbance within the 6-month period. If the disturbance
persists beyond 6 months, the diagnosis should be changed to
schizophrenia. Another distinguishing feature of schizophreniform
disorder is the lack of a criterion requiring impaired social and
occupational functioning. While such impairments may potentially be
present, they are not necessary for a diagnosis of schizophreniform
disorder. In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the
diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania
symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions
between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis As with schizophrenia,
currently there are no laboratory or psychometric tests for
schizophreniform disorder. There are multiple brain regions where

neuroimaging, neuropathological, and neurophysiological research has
indicated abnormalities, but none are diagnostic4, 6.

Prevalence Incidence of schizophreniform disorder across sociocultural
settings is likely similar to that observed in schizophrenia5. In the
United States and other developed countries, the incidence is low,
possibly fivefold less than that of schizophrenia1, 2. In developing
countries, the incidence may be higher, especially for the specifier
"with good prognostic features"; in some of these settings
schizophreniform disorder may be as common as schizophrenia.

Development and Course The development of schizophreniform disorder is
similar to that of schizophrenia. About one-third of individuals with an
initial diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder (provisional) recover
within the 6-month period and schizophreniform disorder is their final
diagnosis5. The majority of the remaining two-thirds of individuals will
eventually receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective
disorder2.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Relatives of
individuals schizophreniform disorder have an increased risk for
schizophrenia5.

Functional Consequences of Schizophreniform Disorder For the majority of
individuals with schizophreniform disorder who eventually receive a
diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the functional
consequences are similar to the consequences of those disorders. Most
individuals experience dysfunction in several areas of daily
functioning, such as school or work, interpersonal relationships, and
selfcare. Individuals who recover from schizophreniform disorder have
better functional outcomes.

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders and medical conditions. A wide variety of mental
and medical conditions can manifest with psychotic symptoms that must be
considered in the differential diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder.
These include psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or its
treatment; delirium or major neurocognitive disorder;
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or delirium; depressive
or bipolar disorder with psychotic features; schizoaffective disorder;
other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder; depressive
or bipolar disorder with catatonic features; schizophrenia; brief
psychotic disorder; delusional disorder; other specified or unspecified
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder; schizotypal,
schizoid, or paranoid personality disorders; autism spectrum disorder;
disorders presenting in childhood with disorganized speech;
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; obsessivecompulsive disorder;
posttraumatic stress disorder; and traumatic brain injury. Since the
diagnostic criteria for schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia
differ primarily in duration of illness, the discussion of the
differential diagnosis of schizophrenia also applies to schizophreniform
disorder. Brief psychotic disorder. Schizophreniform disorder differs in
duration from brief psychotic disorder, which has a duration of less
than 1 month.

Schizophrenia Diagnostic Criteria

295.90 (F20.9)

a.  Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant
    portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully
    treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):

<!-- -->

1.  Delusions.
2.  Hallucinations.
3.  Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence).
4.  Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
5.  Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or
    avolition).

<!-- -->

b.  For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the
    disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such
    as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below
    the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in
    childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level
    of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).
c.  Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months.
    This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or
    less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (i.e.,
    active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or
    residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the
    signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms
    or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an
    attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).

d. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with
psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no major
depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the
active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during
active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the
total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness. e. The
disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition. f. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a
communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of
schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in
addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also
present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated). Specify
if: The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year
duration of the disorder and if they are not in contradiction to the
diagnostic course criteria. First episode, currently in acute episode:
First manifestation of the disorder meeting the defining diagnostic
symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is a time period in which
the symptom criteria are fulfilled. First episode, currently in partial
remission: Partial remission is a period of time during which an
improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in which the
defining criteria of the disorder are only partially fulfilled. First
episode, currently in full remission: Full remission is a period of time
after a previous episode during which no disorder-specific symptoms are
present. Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode: Multiple
episodes may be determined after a minimum of two episodes (i.e., after
a first episode, a remission and a minimum of one relapse). Multiple
episodes, currently in partial remission Multiple episodes, currently in
full remission

Continuous: Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom criteria of the
disorder are remaining for the majority of the illness course, with
subthreshold symptom periods being very brief relative to the overall
course. Unspecified Specify if: With catatonia (refer to the criteria
for catatonia associated with another mental disorder, pp. 119--120, for
definition). Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia
associated with schizophrenia to indicate the presence of the comorbid
catatonia. Specify current severity: Severity is rated by a quantitative
assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including delusions,
hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and
negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current
severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging
from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See Clinician-Rated
Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter "Assessment
Measures.") Note: Diagnosis of schizophrenia can be made without using
this severity specifier.

Diagnostic Features The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia involve
a range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dysfunctions, but no
single symptom is pathognomonic of the disorder. The diagnosis involves
the recognition of a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with
impaired occupational or social functioning. Individuals with the
disorder will vary substantially on most features, as schizophrenia is a
heterogeneous clinical syndrome. At least two Criterion A symptoms must
be present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period or
longer. At least one of these symptoms must be the clear presence of
delusions (Criterion A1), hallucinations (Criterion A2), or disorganized
speech (Criterion A3). Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
(Criterion A4) and negative symptoms (Criterion A5) may also be present.
In those situations in which

the active-phase symptoms remit within a month in response to treatment,
Criterion A is still met if the clinician estimates that they would have
persisted in the absence of treatment. Schizophrenia involves impairment
in one or more major areas of functioning (Criterion B). If the
disturbance begins in childhood or adolescence, the expected level of
function is not attained. Comparing the individual with unaffected
siblings may be helpful. The dysfunction persists for a substantial
period during the course of the disorder and does not appear to be a
direct result of any single feature. Avolition (i.e., reduced drive to
pursue goal-directed behavior; Criterion A5) is linked to the social
dysfunction described under Criterion B. There is also strong evidence
for a relationship between cognitive impairment (see the section
"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis" for this disorder) and
functional impairment in individuals with schizophrenia. Some signs of
the disturbance must persist for a continuous period of at least 6
months (Criterion C). Prodromal symptoms often precede the active phase,
and residual symptoms may follow it, characterized by mild or
subthreshold forms of hallucinations or delusions. Individuals may
express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs that are not of delusional
proportions (e.g., ideas of reference or magical thinking); they may
have unusual perceptual experiences (e.g., sensing the presence of an
unseen person); their speech may be generally understandable but vague;
and their behavior may be unusual but not grossly disorganized (e.g.,
mumbling in public). Negative symptoms are common in the prodromal and
residual phases and can be severe. Individuals who had been socially
active may become withdrawn from previous routines. Such behaviors are
often the first sign of a disorder. Mood symptoms and full mood episodes
are common in schizophrenia and may be concurrent with active-phase
symptomatology. However, as distinct from a psychotic mood disorder, a
schizophrenia diagnosis requires the presence of delusions or
hallucinations in the absence of mood episodes. In addition, mood
episodes, taken in total, should be present for only a minority of the
total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness. In
addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic
criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom

domains is vital for making critically important distinctions between
the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with schizophrenia
may display inappropriate affect (e.g., laughing in the absence of an
appropriate stimulus); a dysphoric mood that can take the form of
depression, anxiety, or anger; a disturbed sleep pattern (e.g., daytime
sleeping and nighttime activity); and a lack of interest in eating or
food refusal. Depersonalization, derealization, and somatic concerns may
occur and sometimes reach delusional proportions. Anxiety and phobias
are common28. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are common and are
strongly linked to vocational and functional impairments. These deficits
can include decrements in declarative memory, working memory, language
function, and other executive functions, as well as slower processing
speed16. Abnormalities in sensory processing and inhibitory capacity, as
well as reductions in attention, are also found. Some individuals with
schizophrenia show social cognition deficits, including deficits in the
ability to infer the intentions of other people (theory of mind)4, and
may attend to and then interpret irrelevant events or stimuli as
meaningful, perhaps leading to the generation of explanatory delusions.
These impairments frequently persist during symptomatic remission. Some
individuals with psychosis may lack insight or awareness of their
disorder (i.e., anosognosia). This lack of "insight" includes
unawareness of symptoms of schizophrenia and may be present throughout
the entire course of the illness. Unawareness of illness is typically a
symptom of schizophrenia itself rather than a coping strategy. It is
comparable to the lack of awareness of neurological deficits following
brain damage, termed anosognosia. This symptom is the most common
predictor of nonadherence to treatment, and it predicts higher relapse
rates, increased number of involuntary treatments, poorer psychosocial
functioning, aggression, and a poorer course of illness24. Hostility and
aggression can be associated with schizophrenia, although spontaneous or
random assault is uncommon. Aggression is more frequent for younger
males and for individuals with a past history of violence, nonadherence
with treatment, substance abuse, and impulsivity9. It should be noted
that the vast majority of persons with schizophrenia are not

aggressive and are more frequently victimized than are individuals in
the general population30. Currently, there are no radiological,
laboratory, or psychometric tests for the disorder. Differences are
evident in multiple brain regions between groups of healthy individuals
and persons with schizophrenia, including evidence from neuroimaging,
neuropathological, and neurophysiological studies18. Differences are
also evident in cellular architecture, white matter connectivity, and
gray matter volume in a variety of regions such as the prefrontal and
temporal cortices5. Reduced overall brain volume has been observed25, as
well as increased brain volume reduction with age21. Brain volume
reductions with age are more pronounced in individuals with
schizophrenia than in healthy individuals21. Finally, individuals with
schizophrenia appear to differ from individuals without the disorder in
eyetracking20 and electrophysiological indices13. Neurological soft
signs common in individuals with schizophrenia include impairments in
motor coordination, sensory integration, and motor sequencing of complex
movements; left-right confusion; and disinhibition of associated
movements. In addition, minor physical anomalies of the face and limbs
may occur31.

Prevalence The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia appears to be
approximately 0.3%--0.7%15, although there is reported variation by
race/ethnicity, across countries, and by geographic origin for
immigrants and children of immigrants. The sex ratio differs across
samples and populations: for example, an emphasis on negative symptoms
and longer duration of disorder (associated with poorer outcome) shows
higher incidence rates for males23, whereas definitions allowing for the
inclusion of more mood symptoms and brief presentations (associated with
better outcome) show equivalent risks for both sexes3.

Development and Course The psychotic features of schizophrenia typically
emerge between the late teens and the mid-30s; onset prior to
adolescence is rare. The peak age at onset for the first psychotic
episode is in the early- to mid-20s for males and in the late-20s for
females15. The onset may be abrupt or insidious, but the

majority of individuals manifest a slow and gradual development of a
variety of clinically significant signs and symptoms. Half of these
individuals complain of depressive symptoms. Earlier age at onset has
traditionally been seen as a predictor of worse prognosis. However, the
effect of age at onset is likely related to gender, with males having
worse premorbid adjustment, lower educational achievement, more
prominent negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, and in general a
worse outcome2. Impaired cognition is common, and alterations in
cognition are present during development and precede the emergence of
psychosis, taking the form of stable cognitive impairments during
adulthood29. Cognitive impairments may persist when other symptoms are
in remission and contribute to the disability of the disease. The
predictors of course and outcome are largely unexplained, and course and
outcome may not be reliably predicted. The course appears to be
favorable in about 20% of those with schizophrenia, and a small number
of individuals are reported to recover completely. However, most
individuals with schizophrenia still require formal or informal daily
living supports, and many remain chronically ill, with exacerbations and
remissions of active symptoms, while others have a course of progressive
deterioration. Psychotic symptoms tend to diminish over the life course,
perhaps in association with normal age-related declines in dopamine
activity. Negative symptoms are more closely related to prognosis than
are positive symptoms and tend to be the most persistent27. Furthermore,
cognitive deficits associated with the illness may not improve over the
course of the illness. The essential features of schizophrenia are the
same in childhood, but it is more difficult to make the diagnosis. In
children, delusions and hallucinations may be less elaborate than in
adults, and visual hallucinations are more common and should be
distinguished from normal fantasy play. Disorganized speech occurs in
many disorders with childhood onset (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), as
does disorganized behavior (e.g., attentiondeficit/hyperactivity
disorder). These symptoms should not be attributed to schizophrenia
without due consideration of the more common disorders of childhood.
Childhood-onset cases tend to resemble poor-outcome adult cases, with
gradual onset and prominent negative symptoms. Children who later
receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia are more likely to have
experienced nonspecific emotional-behavioral disturbances and

psychopathology, intellectual and language alterations, and subtle motor
delays. Late-onset cases (i.e., onset after age 40 years) are
overrepresented by females, who may have married12. Often, the course is
characterized by a predominance of psychotic symptoms with preservation
of affect and social functioning. Such late-onset cases can still meet
the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, but it is not yet clear
whether this is the same condition as schizophrenia diagnosed prior to
mid-life (e.g., prior to age 55 years).

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Season of birth has been
linked to the incidence of schizophrenia, including late winter/early
spring in some locations and summer for the deficit form of the
disease7. The incidence of schizophrenia and related disorders is higher
for children growing up in an urban environment14 and for some minority
ethnic groups6. Genetic and physiological. There is a strong
contribution for genetic factors in determining risk for
schizophrenia26, although most individuals who have been diagnosed with
schizophrenia have no family history of psychosis19. Liability is
conferred by a spectrum of risk alleles, common and rare, with each
allele contributing only a small fraction to the total population
variance22. The risk alleles identified to date are also associated with
other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, depression, and
autism spectrum disorder22. Pregnancy and birth complications with
hypoxia and greater paternal age17 are associated with a higher risk of
schizophrenia for the developing fetus. In addition, other prenatal and
perinatal adversities, including stress, infection, malnutrition,
maternal diabetes, and other medical conditions, have been linked with
schizophrenia7. However, the vast majority of offspring with these risk
factors do not develop schizophrenia.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Cultural and socioeconomic factors
must be considered, particularly when the individual and the clinician
do not share the same cultural and socioeconomic background. Ideas that
appear to be delusional in one culture (e.g., witchcraft) may be
commonly held in another. In some

cultures, visual or auditory hallucinations with a religious content
(e.g., hearing God's voice) are a normal part of religious experience.
In addition, the assessment of disorganized speech may be made difficult
by linguistic variation in narrative styles across cultures. The
assessment of affect requires sensitivity to differences in styles of
emotional expression, eye contact, and body language, which vary across
cultures. If the assessment is conducted in a language that is different
from the individual's primary language, care must be taken to ensure
that alogia is not related to linguistic barriers. In certain cultures,
distress may take the form of hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations
and overvalued ideas that may present clinically similar to true
psychosis but are normative to the patient's subgroup.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues A number of features distinguish the
clinical expression of schizophrenia in females and males. The general
incidence of schizophrenia tends to be slightly lower in females,
particularly among treated cases. The age at onset is later in females,
with a second mid-life peak1 as described earlier (see the section
"Development and Course" for this disorder). Symptoms tend to be more
affect-laden among females, and there are more psychotic symptoms, as
well as a greater propensity for psychotic symptoms to worsen in later
life1. Other symptom differences include less frequent negative symptoms
and disorganization. Finally, social functioning tends to remain better
preserved in females. There are, however, frequent exceptions to these
general caveats.

Suicide Risk Approximately 5%--6% of individuals with schizophrenia die
by suicide, about 20% attempt suicide on one or more occasions, and many
more have significant suicidal ideation10. Suicidal behavior is
sometimes in response to command hallucinations to harm oneself or
others. Suicide risk remains high over the whole lifespan for males and
females, although it may be especially high for younger males with
comorbid substance use. Other risk factors include having depressive
symptoms or feelings of hopelessness and being unemployed, and the risk
is higher, also, in the period after a psychotic episode or hospital
discharge10.

Functional Consequences of Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is associated
with significant social and occupational dysfunction. Making educational
progress and maintaining employment are frequently impaired by avolition
or other disorder manifestations, even when the cognitive skills are
sufficient for the tasks at hand. Most individuals are employed at a
lower level than their parents, and most, particularly men, do not marry
or have limited social contacts outside of their family.

Differential Diagnosis Major depressive or bipolar disorder with
psychotic or catatonic features. The distinction between schizophrenia
and major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features or with
catatonia depends on the temporal relationship between the mood
disturbance and the psychosis, and on the severity of the depressive or
manic symptoms. If delusions or hallucinations occur exclusively during
a major depressive or manic episode, the diagnosis is depressive or
bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Schizoaffective disorder. A
diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that a major depressive
or manic episode occur concurrently with the active-phase symptoms and
that the mood symptoms be present for a majority of the total duration
of the active periods. Schizophreniform disorder and brief psychotic
disorder. These disorders are of shorter duration than schizophrenia as
specified in Criterion C, which requires 6 months of symptoms. In
schizophreniform disorder, the disturbance is present less than 6
months, and in brief psychotic disorder, symptoms are present at least 1
day but less than 1 month. Delusional disorder. Delusional disorder can
be distinguished from schizophrenia by the absence of the other symptoms
characteristic of schizophrenia (e.g., delusions, prominent auditory or
visual hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or
catatonic behavior, negative symptoms). Schizotypal personality
disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder may be distinguished from
schizophrenia by subthreshold symptoms that are associated with
persistent personality features.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder. Individuals
with obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder may
present with poor or absent insight, and the preoccupations may reach
delusional proportions. But these disorders are distinguished from
schizophrenia by their prominent obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations
with appearance or body odor, hoarding, or body-focused repetitive
behaviors. Posttraumatic stress disorder. Posttraumatic stress disorder
may include flashbacks that have a hallucinatory quality, and
hypervigilance may reach paranoid proportions. But a traumatic event and
characteristic symptom features relating to reliving or reacting to the
event are required to make the diagnosis. Autism spectrum disorder or
communication disorders. These disorders may also have symptoms
resembling a psychotic episode but are distinguished by their respective
deficits in social interaction with repetitive and restricted behaviors
and other cognitive and communication deficits. An individual with
autism spectrum disorder or communication disorder must have symptoms
that meet full criteria for schizophrenia, with prominent hallucinations
or delusions for at least 1 month, in order to be diagnosed with
schizophrenia as a comorbid condition. Other mental disorders associated
with a psychotic episode. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only
when the psychotic episode is persistent and not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.
Individuals with a delirium or major or minor neurocognitive disorder
may present with psychotic symptoms, but these would have a temporal
relationship to the onset of cognitive changes consistent with those
disorders. Individuals with substance/medicationinduced psychotic
disorder may present with symptoms characteristic of Criterion A for
schizophrenia, but the substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder
can usually be distinguished by the chronological relationship of
substance use to the onset and remission of the psychosis in the absence
of substance use.

Comorbidity Rates of comorbidity with substance-related disorders are
high in schizophrenia. Over half of individuals with schizophrenia have
tobacco

use disorder and smoke cigarettes regularly8. Comorbidity with anxiety
disorders is increasingly recognized in schizophrenia. Rates of
obsessivecompulsive disorder and panic disorder are elevated in
individuals with schizophrenia compared with the general population.
Schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder may sometimes precede the
onset of schizophrenia. Life expectancy is reduced in individuals with
schizophrenia because of associated medical conditions. Weight gain,
diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular and pulmonary disease
are more common in schizophrenia than in the general population11. Poor
engagement in health maintenance behaviors (e.g., cancer screening,
exercise) increases the risk of chronic disease, but other disorder
factors, including medications, lifestyle, cigarette smoking, and diet,
may also play a role. A shared vulnerability for psychosis and medical
disorders may explain some of the medical comorbidity of schizophrenia.

Schizoaffective Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. An uninterrupted period
of illness during which there is a major mood episode (major depressive
or manic) concurrent with Criterion A of schizophrenia. Note: The major
depressive episode must include Criterion A1: Depressed mood. b.
Delusions or hallucinations for 2 or more weeks in the absence of a
major mood episode (depressive or manic) during the lifetime duration of
the illness. c. Symptoms that meet criteria for a major mood episode are
present for the majority of the total duration of the active and
residual portions of the illness. d. The disturbance is not attributable
to the effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or
another medical condition. Specify whether: 295.70 (F25.0) Bipolar type:
This subtype applies if a manic episode is part of the presentation.
Major depressive episodes may also occur. 295.70 (F25.1) Depressive
type: This subtype applies if only major depressive episodes are part of
the presentation. Specify if: With catatonia (refer to the criteria for
catatonia associated with another mental disorder, pp. 119--120, for
definition). Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1) catatonia
associated with schizoaffective disorder to indicate the presence of the
comorbid catatonia. Specify if:

The following course specifiers are only to be used after a 1-year
duration of the disorder and if they are not in contradiction to the
diagnostic course criteria. First episode, currently in acute episode:
First manifestation of the disorder meeting the defining diagnostic
symptom and time criteria. An acute episode is a time period in which
the symptom criteria are fulfilled. First episode, currently in partial
remission: Partial remission is a time period during which an
improvement after a previous episode is maintained and in which the
defining criteria of the disorder are only partially fulfilled. First
episode, currently in full remission: Full remission is a period of time
after a previous episode during which no disorder-specific symptoms are
present. Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode: Multiple
episodes may be determined after a minimum of two episodes (i.e., after
a first episode, a remission and a minimum of one relapse). Multiple
episodes, currently in partial remission Multiple episodes, currently in
full remission Continuous: Symptoms fulfilling the diagnostic symptom
criteria of the disorder are remaining for the majority of the illness
course, with subthreshold symptom periods being very brief relative to
the overall course. Unspecified Specify current severity: Severity is
rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis,
including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, abnormal
psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may
be rated for its current severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a
5-point scale ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe).
(See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the
chapter "Assessment Measures.") Note: Diagnosis of schizoaffective
disorder can be made without using this severity specifier.

Note: For additional information on Development and Course (age-related
factors), Risk and Prognostic Factors (environmental risk factors),

see the corresponding sections in schizophrenia, bipolar I and II
disorders, and major depressive disorder in their respective chapters.

Diagnostic Features The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is based
on the assessment of an uninterrupted period of illness during which the
individual continues to display active or residual symptoms of psychotic
illness. The diagnosis is usually, but not necessarily, made during the
period of psychotic illness. At some time during the period, Criterion A
for schizophrenia has to be met. Criteria B (social dysfunction) and F
(exclusion of autism spectrum disorder or other communication disorder
of childhood onset) for schizophrenia do not have to be met. In addition
to meeting Criterion A for schizophrenia, there is a major mood episode
(major depressive or manic) (Criterion A for schizoaffective disorder).
Because loss of interest or pleasure is common in schizophrenia, to meet
Criterion A for schizoaffective disorder, the major depressive episode
must include pervasive depressed mood (i.e., the presence of markedly
diminished interest or pleasure is not sufficient). Episodes of
depression or mania are present for the majority of the total duration
of the illness (i.e., after Criterion A has been met) (Criterion C for
schizoaffective disorder). To separate schizoaffective disorder from a
depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, delusions or
hallucinations must be present for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a
major mood episode (depressive or manic) at some point during the
lifetime duration of the illness (Criterion B for schizoaffective
disorder). The symptoms must not be attributable to the effects of a
substance or another medical condition (Criterion D for schizoaffective
disorder). Criterion C for schizoaffective disorder specifies that mood
symptoms meeting criteria for a major mood episode must be present for
the majority of the total duration of the active and residual portion of
the illness. Criterion C requires the assessment of mood symptoms for
the entire course of a psychotic illness, which differs from the
criterion in DSM-IV, which required only an assessment of the current
period of illness. If the mood symptoms are present for only a
relatively brief period, the diagnosis is

schizophrenia, not schizoaffective disorder. When deciding whether an
individual's presentation meets Criterion C, the clinician should review
the total duration of psychotic illness (i.e., both active and residual
symptoms) and determine when significant mood symptoms (untreated or in
need of treatment with antidepressant and/or mood-stabilizing
medication) accompanied the psychotic symptoms. This determination
requires sufficient historical information and clinical judgment. For
example, an individual with a 4-year history of active and residual
symptoms of schizophrenia develops depressive and manic episodes that,
taken together, do not occupy more than 1 year during the 4-year history
of psychotic illness. This presentation would not meet Criterion C. In
addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic
criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom
domains is vital for making critically important distinctions between
the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Occupational functioning is
frequently impaired, but this is not a defining criterion (in contrast
to schizophrenia). Restricted social contact and difficulties with
self-care are associated with schizoaffective disorder, but negative
symptoms may be less severe and less persistent than those seen in
schizophrenia9. Anosognosia (i.e., poor insight) is also common in
schizoaffective disorder, but the deficits in insight may be less severe
and pervasive than those in schizophrenia10. Individuals with
schizoaffective disorder may be at increased risk for later developing
episodes of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder if mood
symptoms continue following the remission of symptoms meeting Criterion
A for schizophrenia. There may be associated alcohol and other
substance-related disorders. There are no tests or biological measures
that can assist in making the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder.
Whether schizoaffective disorder differs from schizophrenia with regard
to associated features such as structural or functional brain
abnormalities, cognitive deficits, or genetic risk factors is not
clear5, 9.

Prevalence

Schizoaffective disorder appears to be about one-third as common as
schizophrenia. Lifetime prevalence of schizoaffective disorder is
estimated to be 0.3%17. The incidence of schizoaffective disorder is
higher in females than in males, mainly due to an increased incidence of
the depressive type among females16.

Development and Course The typical age at onset of schizoaffective
disorder is early adulthood, although onset can occur anywhere from
adolescence to late in life. A significant number of individuals
diagnosed with another psychotic illness initially will receive the
diagnosis schizoaffective disorder later when the pattern of mood
episodes has become more apparent6, 19. With the current diagnostic
Criterion C, it is expected that the diagnosis for some individuals will
convert from schizoaffective disorder to another disorder as mood
symptoms become less prominent. The prognosis for schizoaffective
disorder is somewhat better than the prognosis for schizophrenia but
worse than the prognosis for mood disorders11. Schizoaffective disorder
may occur in a variety of temporal patterns. The following is a typical
pattern: An individual may have pronounced auditory hallucinations and
persecutory delusions for 2 months before the onset of a prominent major
depressive episode. The psychotic symptoms and the full major depressive
episode are then present for 3 months. Then, the individual recovers
completely from the major depressive episode, but the psychotic symptoms
persist for another month before they too disappear. During this period
of illness, the individual's symptoms concurrently met criteria for a
major depressive episode and Criterion A for schizophrenia, and during
this same period of illness, auditory hallucinations and delusions were
present both before and after the depressive phase. The total period of
illness lasted for about 6 months, with psychotic symptoms alone present
during the initial 2 months, both depressive and psychotic symptoms
present during the next 3 months, and psychotic symptoms alone present
during the last month. In this instance, the duration of the depressive
episode was not brief relative to the total duration of the psychotic
disturbance, and thus the presentation qualifies for a diagnosis of
schizoaffective disorder.

The expression of psychotic symptoms across the lifespan is variable.
Depressive or manic symptoms can occur before the onset of psychosis,
during acute psychotic episodes, during residual periods, and after
cessation of psychosis. For example, an individual might present with
prominent mood symptoms during the prodromal stage of schizophrenia.
This pattern is not necessarily indicative of schizoaffective disorder,
since it is the cooccurrence of psychotic and mood symptoms that is
diagnostic. For an individual with symptoms that clearly meet the
criteria for schizoaffective disorder but who on further follow-up only
presents with residual psychotic symptoms (such as subthreshold
psychosis and/or prominent negative symptoms), the diagnosis may be
changed to schizophrenia, as the total proportion of psychotic illness
compared with mood symptoms becomes more prominent. Schizoaffective
disorder, bipolar type, may be more common in young adults, whereas
schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, may be more common in older
adults.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Among individuals
with schizophrenia, there may be an increased risk for schizoaffective
disorder in first-degree relatives18. The risk for schizoaffective
disorder may be increased among individuals who have a first-degree
relative with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective
disorder14.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Cultural and socioeconomic factors
must be considered, particularly when the individual and the clinician
do not share the same cultural and economic background. Ideas that
appear to be delusional in one culture (e.g., witchcraft) may be
commonly held in another. There is also some evidence in the literature
for the overdiagnosis of schizophrenia compared with schizoaffective
disorder in African American and Hispanic populations, so care must be
taken to ensure a culturally appropriate evaluation that includes both
psychotic and affective symptoms2, 4, 20.

Suicide Risk The lifetime risk of suicide for schizophrenia and
schizoaffective disorder is 5%, and the presence of depressive symptoms
is correlated with a higher

risk for suicide13. There is evidence that suicide rates are higher in
North American populations than in European, Eastern European, South
American, and Indian populations of individuals with schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder1, 3.

Functional Disorder

Consequences

of

Schizoaffective

Schizoaffective disorder is associated with social and occupational
dysfunction12, 15, but dysfunction is not a diagnostic criterion (as it
is for schizophrenia), and there is substantial variability between
individuals diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.

Differential Diagnosis Other mental disorders and medical conditions. A
wide variety of psychiatric and medical conditions can manifest with
psychotic and mood symptoms that must be considered in the differential
diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. These include psychotic disorder
due to another medical condition; delirium; major neurocognitive
disorder; substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or
neurocognitive disorder; bipolar disorders with psychotic features;
major depressive disorder with psychotic features; depressive or bipolar
disorders with catatonic features; schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid
personality disorder; brief psychotic disorder; schizophreniform
disorder; schizophrenia; delusional disorder; and other specified and
unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.
Medical conditions and substance use can present with a combination of
psychotic and mood symptoms, and thus psychotic disorder due to another
medical condition needs to be excluded. Distinguishing schizoaffective
disorder from schizophrenia and from depressive and bipolar disorders
with psychotic features is often difficult. Criterion C is designed to
separate schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia, and Criterion B is
designed to distinguish schizoaffective disorder from a depressive or
bipolar disorder with psychotic features. More specifically,
schizoaffective disorder can be distinguished from a depressive or
bipolar disorder with psychotic features due to the presence of
prominent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the
absence of a major mood episode. In contrast, in depressive or bipolar
disorders with

psychotic features, the psychotic features primarily occur during the
mood episode(s). Because the relative proportion of mood to psychotic
symptoms may change over time, the appropriate diagnosis may change from
and to schizoaffective disorder (e.g., a diagnosis of schizoaffective
disorder for a severe and prominent major depressive episode lasting 3
months during the first 6 months of a persistent psychotic illness would
be changed to schizophrenia if active psychotic or prominent residual
symptoms persist over several years without a recurrence of another mood
episode). Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. Other
medical conditions and substance use can manifest with a combination of
psychotic and mood symptoms, and thus psychotic disorder due to another
medical condition needs to be excluded. Schizophrenia, bipolar, and
depressive disorders. Distinguishing schizoaffective disorder from
schizophrenia and from depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic
features is often difficult. Criterion C is designed to separate
schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia, and Criterion B is designed
to distinguish schizoaffective disorder from a depressive or bipolar
disorder with psychotic features. More specifically, schizoaffective
disorder can be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar disorder with
psychotic features based on the presence of prominent delusions and/or
hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood
episode. In contrast, in depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic
features, the psychotic features primarily occur during the mood
episode(s). Because the relative proportion of mood to psychotic
symptoms may change over time, the appropriate diagnosis may change from
and to schizoaffective disorder. (For example, a diagnosis of
schizoaffective disorder for a severe and prominent major depressive
episode lasting 3 months during the first 6 months of a chronic
psychotic illness would be changed to schizophrenia if active psychotic
or prominent residual symptoms persist over several years without a
recurrence of another mood episode.)

Comorbidity Many individuals diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder are
also diagnosed with other mental disorders, especially substance use
disorders and anxiety disorders. Similarly, the incidence of medical
conditions is

increased above base rate for the general population and leads to
decreased life expectancy8.

Substance/Medication-Induced Psychotic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a.
Presence of one or both of the following symptoms: 1. Delusions. 2.
Hallucinations. b. There is evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2): 1. The symptoms
in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or
withdrawal or after exposure to a medication. 2. The involved
substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion
A. c. The disturbance is not better explained by a psychotic disorder
that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an
independent psychotic disorder could include the following: The symptoms
preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist
for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the
cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other
evidence of an independent nonsubstance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related
episodes). d. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the
course of a delirium. e. The disturbance causes clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning. Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a
diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when
the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when
they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.

Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance/medication\]-induced psychotic disorders are indicated in the
table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not
there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of
substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the
substance-induced psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is "1,"
and the clinician should record "mild \[substance\] use disorder" before
the substance-induced psychotic disorder (e.g., "mild cocaine use
disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder"). If a moderate or
severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced
psychotic disorder, the 4th position character is "2," and the clinician
should record "moderate \[substance\] use disorder" or "severe
\[substance\] use disorder," depending on the severity of the comorbid
substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder
(e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th
position character is "9," and the clinician should record only the
substance-induced psychotic disorder. ICD-10-CM ICD9-CM

"Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders" for diagnoses associated
with substance class): With onset during intoxication: If the criteria
are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop
during intoxication. With onset during withdrawal: If the criteria are
met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during,
or shortly after, withdrawal. Specify current severity: Severity is
rated by a quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis,
including delusions, hallucinations, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and
negative symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current
severity (most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging
from 0 (not present) to 4 (present and severe). (See ClinicianRated
Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity in the chapter "Assessment
Measures.") Note: Diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder can be made without using this severity specifier.

Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder begins with the specific
substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing
the delusions or hallucinations. The diagnostic code is selected from
the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug
class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
dexamethasone), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in
cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the
specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during
withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which
combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a
single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the
substance use disorder. For example, in the

case of delusions occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe
cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.9 cocaine-induced psychotic
disorder, with onset during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of
304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one
substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of
psychotic symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.9
cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with onset during intoxication, with
severe cannabis use disorder; 292.9 phencyclidine-induced psychotic
disorder, with onset during intoxication, with mild phencyclidine use
disorder). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced
psychotic disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine,
dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delusions or
hallucinations. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included
in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or
absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not
fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for "other
substance" with no comorbid substance use should be used; and in cases
in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
with no comorbid substance use should be used. When recording the name
of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed
first, followed by the word "with," followed by the name of the
substance-induced psychotic disorder, followed by the specification of
onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For
example, in the case of delusions occurring during intoxication in a man
with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.259 severe
cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset
during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine
use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced psychotic disorder
occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time
heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is
noted (e.g., F16.959 phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with
onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to
play a significant role in the development of psychotic symptoms, each
should be listed separately (e.g., F12.259 severe cannabis use disorder
with cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during
intoxication;

F16.159 mild phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced
psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication).

Diagnostic Features The essential features of
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder are prominent delusions
and/or hallucinations (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the
physiological effects of a substance/medication (i.e., a drug of abuse,
a medication, or a toxin exposure) (Criterion B). Hallucinations that
the individual realizes are substance/medication-induced are not
included here and instead would be diagnosed as substance intoxication
or substance withdrawal with the accompanying specifier "with perceptual
disturbances" (applies to alcohol withdrawal; cannabis intoxication;
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; and stimulant
intoxication). A substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is
distinguished from a primary psychotic disorder by considering the
onset, course, and other factors. For drugs of abuse, there must be
evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings
of substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal1, 5.
Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorders arise during or soon
after exposure to a medication or after substance intoxication or
withdrawal but can persist for weeks, whereas primary psychotic
disorders may precede the onset of substance/medication use or may occur
during times of sustained abstinence3, 8. Once initiated, the psychotic
symptoms may continue as long as the substance/medication use continues.
Another consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of a
primary psychotic disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course). For
example, the appearance of delusions de novo in a person older than 35
years without a known history of a primary psychotic disorder should
suggest the possibility of a substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder. Even a prior history of a primary psychotic disorder does not
rule out the possibility of a substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder. In contrast, factors that suggest that the psychotic symptoms
are better accounted for by a primary psychotic disorder include
persistence of psychotic symptoms for a substantial period of time
(i.e., a month or more) after the end of substance intoxication or acute
substance withdrawal or after cessation of medication use; or a history
of prior recurrent primary psychotic disorders2, 4. Other causes of
psychotic symptoms must be considered even in an individual with
substance intoxication or withdrawal,

because substance use problems are not uncommon among individuals with
non-substance/medication-induced psychotic disorders. In addition to the
four symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the
assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital
for making critically important distinctions between the various
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Psychotic disorders can occur
in association with intoxication with the following classes of
substances: alcohol; cannabis; hallucinogens, including phencyclidine
and related substances; inhalants; sedatives, hypnotics, and
anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown)
substances. Psychotic disorders can occur in association with withdrawal
from the following classes of substances: alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics,
and anxiolytics; and other (or unknown) substances. Some of the
medications reported to evoke psychotic symptoms include anesthetics and
analgesics, anticholinergic agents, anticonvulsants, antihistamines,
antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications, antimicrobial
medications, antiparkinsonian medications, chemotherapeutic agents
(e.g., cyclosporine, procarbazine), corticosteroids, gastrointestinal
medications, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
medications, other over-the-counter medications (e.g., phenylephrine,
pseudoephedrine), antidepressant medication, and disulfiram. Toxins
reported to induce psychotic symptoms include anticholinesterase,
organophosphate insecticides, sarin and other nerve gases, carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide, and volatile substances such as fuel or paint.

Prevalence Prevalence of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder
in the general population is unknown. Between 7% and 25% of individuals
presenting with a first episode of psychosis in different settings are
reported to have substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder3.

Development and Course The initiation of the disorder may vary
considerably with the substance. For example, smoking a high dose of
cocaine may produce psychosis within

minutes, whereas days or weeks of high-dose alcohol or sedative use may
be required to produce psychosis. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder,
with hallucinations, usually occurs only after prolonged, heavy
ingestion of alcohol in individuals who have moderate to severe alcohol
use disorder, and the hallucinations are generally auditory in nature.
Psychotic disorders induced by amphetamine and cocaine share similar
clinical features. Persecutory delusions may rapidly develop shortly
after use of amphetamine or a similarly acting sympathomimetic. The
hallucination of bugs or vermin crawling in or under the skin
(formication) can lead to scratching and extensive skin excoriations.
Cannabis-induced psychotic disorder may develop shortly after high-dose
cannabis use and usually involves persecutory delusions, marked anxiety,
emotional lability, and depersonalization. The disorder usually remits
within a day but in some cases may persist for a few days.
Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder may at times persist
when the offending agent is removed, such that it may be difficult
initially to distinguish it from an independent psychotic disorder.
Agents such as amphetamines, phencyclidine, and cocaine have been
reported to evoke temporary psychotic states that can sometimes persist
for weeks or longer despite removal of the agent and treatment with
neuroleptic medication. In later life, polypharmacy for medical
conditions and exposure to medications for parkinsonism, cardiovascular
disease, and other medical disorders may be associated with a greater
likelihood of psychosis induced by prescription medications as opposed
to substances of abuse.

Diagnostic Markers With substances for which relevant blood levels are
available (e.g., blood alcohol level, other quantifiable blood levels
such as digoxin), the presence of a level consistent with toxicity may
increase diagnostic certainty.

Functional Consequences Substance/Medication-Induced Disorder

of Psychotic

Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is typically severely
disabling and consequently is observed most frequently in emergency
rooms, as individuals are often brought to the acute-care setting when
it

occurs7. However, the disability is typically self-limited and resolves
upon removal of the offending agent.

Differential Diagnosis Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal.
Individuals intoxicated with stimulants, cannabis, the opioid
meperidine, or phencyclidine, or those withdrawing from alcohol or
sedatives, may experience altered perceptions that they recognize as
drug effects. If reality testing for these experiences remains intact
(i.e., the individual recognizes that the perception is substance
induced and neither believes in nor acts on it), the diagnosis is not
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Instead, substance
intoxication or substance withdrawal, with perceptual disturbances, is
diagnosed (e.g., cocaine intoxication, with perceptual disturbances).
"Flashback" hallucinations that can occur long after the use of
hallucinogens has stopped are diagnosed as hallucinogen persisting
perception disorder6. If substance/medication-induced psychotic symptoms
occur exclusively during the course of a delirium, as in severe forms of
alcohol withdrawal, the psychotic symptoms are considered to be an
associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately.
Delusions in the context of a major or mild neurocognitive disorder
would be diagnosed as major or mild neurocognitive disorder, with
behavioral disturbance. Primary psychotic disorder. A
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is distinguished from a
primary psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective
disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, other specified
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, or unspecified
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, by the fact that a
substance is judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms.
Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. A
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder due to a prescribed
treatment for a mental or medical condition must have its onset while
the individual is receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if
there is a withdrawal syndrome associated with the medication). Because
individuals with medical conditions often take medications for those
conditions, the clinician must consider the possibility that the
psychotic symptoms are

caused by the physiological consequences of the medical condition rather
than the medication, in which case psychotic disorder due to another
medical condition is diagnosed. The history often provides the primary
basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the
medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may
be needed to determine empirically for that individual whether the
medication is the causative agent. If the clinician has ascertained that
the disturbance is attributable to both a medical condition and
substance/medication use, both diagnoses (i.e., psychotic disorder due
to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced psychotic
disorder) may be given.

Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition Diagnostic Criteria
a. Prominent hallucinations or delusions. b. There is evidence from the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the
disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another
medical condition. c. The disturbance is not better explained by another
mental disorder. d. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during
the course of a delirium. e. The disturbance causes clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning. Specify whether: Code based on
predominant symptom: 293.81 (F06.2) With delusions: If delusions are the
predominant symptom. 293.82 (F06.0) With hallucinations: If
hallucinations are the predominant symptom. Coding note: Include the
name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental disorder
(e.g., 293.81 \[F06.2\] psychotic disorder due to malignant lung
neoplasm, with delusions). The other medical condition should be coded
and listed separately immediately before the psychotic disorder due to
the medical condition (e.g., 162.9 \[C34.90\] malignant lung neoplasm;
293.81 \[F06.2\] psychotic disorder due to malignant lung neoplasm, with
delusions). Specify current severity: Severity is rated by a
quantitative assessment of the primary symptoms of psychosis, including
delusions, hallucinations, abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative
symptoms. Each of these symptoms may be rated for its current severity
(most severe in the last 7 days) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not
present) to 4 (present

and severe). (See Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom
Severity in the chapter "Assessment Measures.") Note: Diagnosis of
psychotic disorder due to another medical condition can be made without
using this severity specifier.

Specifiers In addition to the symptom domain areas identified in the
diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania
symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions
between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders.

Diagnostic Features The essential features of psychotic disorder due to
another medical condition are prominent delusions or hallucinations that
are judged to be attributable to the physiological effects of another
medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder (e.g., the symptoms are not a psychologically mediated response
to a severe medical condition, in which case a diagnosis of brief
psychotic disorder, with marked stressor, would be appropriate).
Hallucinations can occur in any sensory modality (i.e., visual,
olfactory, gustatory, tactile, or auditory), but certain etiological
factors are likely to evoke specific hallucinatory phenomena. Olfactory
hallucinations are suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. Hallucinations
may vary from simple and unformed to highly complex and organized,
depending on etiological and environmental factors. Psychotic disorder
due to another medical condition is generally not diagnosed if the
individual maintains reality testing for the hallucinations and
appreciates that they result from the medical condition. Delusions may
have a variety of themes, including somatic, grandiose, religious, and,
most commonly, persecutory. On the whole, however, associations between
delusions and particular medical conditions appear to be less specific
than is the case for hallucinations. In determining whether the
psychotic disturbance is attributable to another medical condition, the
presence of a medical condition must be identified and considered to be
the etiology of the psychosis through a physiological mechanism.
Although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the
relationship between the psychotic disturbance and

the medical condition is etiological, several considerations provide
some guidance. One consideration is the presence of a temporal
association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical
condition and that of the psychotic disturbance. A second consideration
is the presence of features that are atypical for a psychotic disorder
(e.g., atypical age at onset or presence of visual or olfactory
hallucinations). The disturbance must also be distinguished from a
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or another mental
disorder (e.g., an adjustment disorder).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The temporal association of the
onset or exacerbation of the medical condition offers the greatest
diagnostic certainty that the delusions or hallucinations are
attributable to a medical condition. Additional factors may include
concomitant treatments for the underlying medical condition that confer
a risk for psychosis independently, such as steroid treatment for
autoimmune disorders.

Prevalence Prevalence rates for psychotic disorder due to another
medical condition are difficult to estimate given the wide variety of
underlying medical etiologies. Lifetime prevalence has been estimated to
range from 0.21% to 0.54%2, 5. When the prevalence findings are
stratified by age group, individuals older than 65 years have a
significantly greater prevalence of 0.74% compared with those in younger
age groups5. Rates of psychosis also vary according to the underlying
medical condition; conditions most commonly associated with psychosis
include untreated endocrine and metabolic disorders, autoimmune
disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, N-methyl-Daspartate
(NMDA) receptor autoimmune encephalitis), or temporal lobe epilepsy.
Psychosis due to epilepsy has been further differentiated into ictal,
postictal, and interictal psychosis. The most common of these is
postictal psychosis, observed in 2%--7.8% of epilepsy patients4. Among
older individuals, there may be a higher prevalence of the disorder in
females5, although additional gender-related features are not clear and
vary considerably with the gender distributions of the underlying
medical conditions.

Development and Course Psychotic disorder due to another medical
condition may be a single transient state or it may be recurrent,
cycling with exacerbations and remissions of the underlying medical
condition. Although treatment of the underlying medical condition often
results in a resolution of the psychosis, this is not always the case,
and psychotic symptoms may persist long after the medical event (e.g.,
psychotic disorder due to focal brain injury). In the context of chronic
conditions such as multiple sclerosis or chronic interictal psychosis of
epilepsy, the psychosis may assume a long-term course. The expression of
psychotic disorder due to another medical condition does not differ
substantially in phenomenology depending on age at occurrence. However,
older age groups have a higher prevalence of the disorder, which is most
likely due to the increasing medical burden associated with advanced age
and the cumulative effects of deleterious exposures and age-related
processes (e.g., atherosclerosis). The nature of the underlying medical
conditions is likely to change across the lifespan, with younger age
groups more affected by epilepsy, head trauma, autoimmune, and
neoplastic diseases of early to mid-life, and older age groups more
affected by stroke disease, anoxic events, and multiple system
comorbidities. Underlying factors with increasing age, such as
preexisting cognitive impairment as well as vision and hearing
impairments, may incur a greater risk for psychosis, possibly by serving
to lower the threshold for experiencing psychosis.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Course modifiers. Identification and
treatment of the underlying medical condition has the greatest impact on
course, although preexisting central nervous system injury may confer a
worse course outcome (e.g., head trauma, cerebrovascular disease).

Diagnostic Markers The diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another
medical condition depends on the clinical condition of each individual,
and the diagnostic tests will vary according to that condition. A
variety of medical conditions may cause psychotic symptoms. These
include neurological conditions (e.g., neoplasms, cerebrovascular
disease, Huntington's disease, multiple

sclerosis, epilepsy, auditory or visual nerve injury or impairment,
deafness, migraine, central nervous system infections), endocrine
conditions (e.g., hyper- and hypothyroidism, hyper- and
hypoparathyroidism, hyper- and hypoadrenocorticism), metabolic
conditions (e.g., hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypoglycemia), fluid or
electrolyte imbalances, hepatic or renal diseases, and autoimmune
disorders with central nervous system involvement (e.g., systemic lupus
erythematosus). The associated physical examination findings, laboratory
findings, and patterns of prevalence or onset reflect the etiological
medical condition.

Suicide Risk Suicide risk in the context of psychotic disorder due to
another medical condition is not clearly delineated, although certain
conditions such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis are associated with
increased rates of suicide1, 3, which may be further increased in the
presence of psychosis.

Functional Consequences of Psychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical
Condition Functional disability is typically severe in the context of
psychotic disorder due to another medical condition but will vary
considerably by the type of condition and likely improve with successful
resolution of the condition.

Differential Diagnosis Delirium. Hallucinations and delusions commonly
occur in the context of a delirium; however, a separate diagnosis of
psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the
disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium.
Delusions in the context of a major or mild neurocognitive disorder
would be diagnosed as major or mild neurocognitive disorder, with
behavioral disturbance. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.
If there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including
medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or
exposure to a toxin (e.g., LSD \[lysergic acid diethylamide\]
intoxication, alcohol withdrawal), a substance/medication-induced
psychotic disorder should be considered. Symptoms that occur during or
shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks) of substance intoxication or
withdrawal or after medication use may be

especially indicative of a substance-induced psychotic disorder,
depending on the character, duration, or amount of the substance used.
If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a
medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., psychotic
disorder due to another medical condition and
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder) can be given. Psychotic
disorder. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition must be
distinguished from a psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, delusional
disorder, schizoaffective disorder) or a depressive or bipolar disorder,
with psychotic features. In psychotic disorders and in depressive or
bipolar disorders, with psychotic features, no specific and direct
causative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition
can be demonstrated. Late age at onset and the absence of a personal or
family history of schizophrenia or delusional disorder suggest the need
for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of psychotic
disorder due to another medical condition. Auditory hallucinations that
involve voices speaking complex sentences are more characteristic of
schizophrenia than of psychotic disorder due to a medical condition.
Other types of hallucinations (e.g., visual, olfactory) commonly signal
a psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or a
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder.

Comorbidity Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition in
individuals older than 80 years is associated with concurrent major
neurocognitive disorder (dementia)5.

Catatonia Catatonia can occur in the context of several disorders,
including neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar, depressive disorders,
and other medical conditions (e.g., cerebral folate deficiency, rare
autoimmune and paraneoplastic disorders)3, 4. The manual does not treat
catatonia as an independent class but recognizes a) catatonia associated
with another mental disorder (i.e., a neurodevelopmental, psychotic
disorder, a bipolar disorder, a depressive disorder, or other mental
disorder), b) catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, and
c) unspecified catatonia. Catatonia is defined by the presence of three
or more of 12 psychomotor features5, 6 in the diagnostic criteria for
catatonia associated with another mental disorder and catatonic disorder
due to another medical condition. The essential feature of catatonia is
a marked psychomotor disturbance that may involve decreased motor
activity, decreased engagement during interview or physical examination,
or excessive and peculiar motor activity. The clinical presentation of
catatonia can be puzzling, as the psychomotor disturbance may range from
marked unresponsiveness to marked agitation. Motoric immobility may be
severe (stupor) or moderate (catalepsy and waxy flexibility). Similarly,
decreased engagement may be severe (mutism) or moderate (negativism).
Excessive and peculiar motor behaviors can be complex (e.g., stereotypy)
or simple (agitation) and may include echolalia and echopraxia. In
extreme cases, the same individual may wax and wane between decreased
and excessive motor activity1. The seemingly opposing clinical features
and variable manifestations of the diagnosis contribute to a lack of
awareness and decreased recognition of catatonia10. During severe stages
of catatonia, the individual may need careful supervision to avoid
self-harm or harming others. There are potential risks from
malnutrition, exhaustion, hyperpyrexia and self-inflicted injury3.

Catatonia Associated With Another Mental Disorder (Catatonia Specifier)
293.89 (F06.1) a. The clinical picture is dominated by three (or more)
of the following symptoms: 1. Stupor (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not
actively relating to environment). 2. Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction
of a posture held against gravity). 3. Waxy flexibility (i.e., slight,
even resistance to positioning by examiner).

4. Mutism (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response \[exclude if known
aphasia\]). 5. Negativism (i.e., opposition or no response to
instructions or external stimuli). 6. Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and
active maintenance of a posture against gravity). 7. Mannerism (i.e.,
odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions). 8. Stereotypy (i.e.,
repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goaldirected movements). 9.
Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli. 10. Grimacing. 11.
Echolalia (i.e., mimicking another's speech). 12. Echopraxia (i.e.,
mimicking another's movements). Coding note: Indicate the name of the
associated mental disorder when recording the name of the condition
(i.e., 293.89 \[F06.1\] catatonia associated with major depressive
disorder). Code first the associated mental disorder (e.g.,
neurodevelopmental disorder, brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform
disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder,
major depressive disorder, or other mental disorder) (e.g., 295.70
\[F25.1\] schizoaffective disorder, depressive type; 293.89 \[F06.1\]
catatonia associated with schizoaffective disorder).

Diagnostic Features Catatonia associated with another mental disorder
(catatonia specifier) may be used when criteria are met for catatonia
during the course of a neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar,
depressive, or other mental disorder. The catatonia specifier is
appropriate when the clinical picture is characterized by marked
psychomotor disturbance and involves at least three of the 12 diagnostic
features listed in Criterion A. Catatonia is typically diagnosed in an
inpatient setting and occurs in up to 35% of individuals with
schizophrenia, but the majority of catatonia cases involve individuals
with depressive or bipolar disorders4, 5, 8, 9, 11. Before the

catatonia specifier is used in neurodevelopmental, psychotic, bipolar,
depressive, or other mental disorders, a wide variety of other medical
conditions need to be ruled out; these conditions include, but are not
limited to, medical conditions due to infectious, metabolic, or
neurological conditions (see "Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical
Condition"). Catatonia can also be a side effect of a medication (see
the chapter "Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse
Effects of Medication"). Because of the seriousness of the
complications, particular attention should be paid to the possibility
that the catatonia is attributable to 333.92 (G21.0) neuroleptic
malignant syndrome.

Catatonic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition Diagnostic Criteria

293.89 (F06.1)

a.  The clinical picture is dominated by three (or more) of the
    following symptoms:

<!-- -->

1.  Stupor (i.e., no psychomotor activity; not actively relating to
    environment).
2.  Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction of a posture held against
    gravity).
3.  Waxy flexibility (i.e., slight, even resistance to positioning by
    examiner).
4.  Mutism (i.e., no, or very little, verbal response \[Note: not
    applicable if there is an established aphasia\]).
5.  Negativism (i.e., opposition or no response to instructions or
    external stimuli).
6.  Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture
    against gravity).
7.  Mannerism (i.e., odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions).
8.  Stereotypy (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goaldirected
    movements).
9.  Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli.
10. Grimacing.
11. Echolalia (i.e., mimicking another's speech).

12. Echopraxia (i.e., mimicking another's movements). b. There is
evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings
that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of
another medical condition. c. The disturbance is not better explained by
another mental disorder (e.g., a manic episode). d. The disturbance does
not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. e. The
disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Coding
note: Include the name of the medical condition in the name of the
mental disorder (e.g., 293.89 \[F06.1\]) catatonic disorder due to
hepatic encephalopathy). The other medical condition should be coded and
listed separately immediately before the catatonic disorder due to the
medical condition (e.g., 572.2 \[K71.90\] hepatic encephalopathy; 293.89
\[F06.1\] catatonic disorder due to hepatic encephalopathy).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of catatonic disorder due to
another medical condition is the presence of catatonia that is judged to
be attributed to the physiological effects of another medical condition.
Catatonia can be diagnosed by the presence of at least three of the 12
clinical features in Criterion A. There must be evidence from the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the catatonia
is attributable to another medical condition (Criterion B). The
diagnosis is not given if the catatonia is better explained by another
mental disorder (e.g., manic episode) (Criterion C) or if it occurs
exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis A variety of medical conditions
may cause catatonia, especially neurological conditions (e.g.,
neoplasms, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, encephalitis) and
metabolic conditions (e.g., hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy,
homocystinuria, diabetic ketoacidosis)1, 2. The

associated physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and
patterns of prevalence and onset reflect those of the etiological
medical condition.

Differential Diagnosis A separate diagnosis of catatonic disorder due to
another medical condition is not given if the catatonia occurs
exclusively during the course of a delirium or neuroleptic malignant
syndrome. If the individual is currently taking neuroleptic medication,
consideration should be given to medicationinduced movement disorders
(e.g., abnormal positioning may be due to neuroleptic-induced acute
dystonia) or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (e.g., catatonic-like
features may be present, along with associated vital sign and/or
laboratory abnormalities). Catatonic symptoms may be present in any of
the following five psychotic disorders: brief psychotic disorder,
schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. It may also be present
in some of the neurodevelopmental disorders, in all of the bipolar and
depressive disorders, and in other mental disorders.

Unspecified Catatonia

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of catatonia cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning but either
the nature of the underlying mental disorder or other medical condition
is unclear, full criteria for catatonia are not met, or there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).

Coding note: Code first 781.99 (R29.818) other symptoms involving
nervous and musculoskeletal systems, followed by 293.89 (F06.1)
unspecified catatonia.

Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder
298.8 (F28) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of a schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder category
is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the
specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any
specific schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. This is
done by recording "other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other
psychotic disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "persistent
auditory hallucinations"). Examples of presentations that can be
specified using the "other specified" designation include the
following: 1. Persistent auditory hallucinations occurring in the
absence of any other features. 2. Delusions with significant overlapping
mood episodes: This includes persistent delusions with periods of
overlapping mood episodes that are present for a substantial portion of
the delusional disturbance (such that the criterion stipulating only
brief mood disturbance in delusional disorder is not met). 3. Attenuated
psychosis syndrome: This syndrome is characterized by psychotic-like
symptoms that are below a threshold for full psychosis (e.g., the
symptoms are less severe and more transient, and insight is relatively
maintained).

4. Delusional symptoms in partner of individual with delusional
disorder: In the context of a relationship, the delusional material from
the dominant partner provides content for delusional belief by the
individual who may not otherwise entirely meet criteria for delusional
disorder.

Unspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder 298.9
(F29) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of a schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that
the criteria are not met for a specific schizophrenia spectrum and other
psychotic disorder, and includes presentations in which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).

Bipolar and Related Disorders Bipolar and related disorders are
separated from the depressive disorders in DSM-5 and placed between the
chapters on schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders and
depressive disorders in recognition of their place as a bridge between
the two diagnostic classes in terms of symptomatology, family history,
and genetics. The diagnoses included in this chapter are bipolar I
disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder,
substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder, bipolar and
related disorder due to another medical condition, other specified
bipolar and related disorder, and unspecified bipolar and related
disorder. The bipolar I disorder criteria represent the modern
understanding of the classic manic-depressive disorder or affective
psychosis described in the nineteenth century, differing from that
classic description only to the extent that neither psychosis nor the
lifetime experience of a major depressive episode is a requirement.
However, the vast majority of individuals whose symptoms meet the
criteria for a fully syndromal manic episode also experience major
depressive episodes during the course of their lives. Bipolar II
disorder, requiring the lifetime experience of at least one episode of
major depression and at least one hypomanic episode, is no longer
thought to be a "milder" condition than bipolar I disorder, largely
because of the amount of time individuals with this condition spend in
depression and because the instability of mood experienced by
individuals with bipolar II disorder is typically accompanied by serious
impairment in work and social functioning. The diagnosis of cyclothymic
disorder is given to adults who experience at least 2 years (for
children, a full year) of both hypomanic and depressive periods without
ever fulfilling the criteria for an episode of mania, hypomania, or
major depression. A large number of substances of abuse, some prescribed
medications, and several medical conditions can be associated with
manic-like phenomena. This fact is recognized in the diagnoses of
substance/medication-induced

bipolar and related disorder and bipolar and related disorder due to
another medical condition. The recognition that many individuals,
particularly children and, to a lesser extent, adolescents, experience
bipolar-like phenomena that do not meet the criteria for bipolar I,
bipolar II, or cyclothymic disorder is reflected in the availability of
the other specified bipolar and related disorder category. Indeed,
specific criteria for a disorder involving shortduration hypomania are
provided in Section III in the hope of encouraging further study of this
disorder.

Bipolar I Disorder Diagnostic Criteria For a diagnosis of bipolar I
disorder, it is necessary to meet the following criteria for a manic
episode. The manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed
by hypomanic or major depressive episodes.

Manic Episode a. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently
elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently
increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most
of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is
necessary). b. During the period of mood disturbance and increased
energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if
the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and
represent a noticeable change from usual behavior: 1. Inflated
self-esteem or grandiosity. 2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels
rested after only 3 hours of sleep). 3. More talkative than usual or
pressure to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience
that thoughts are racing. 5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily
drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or
observed.

6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or
school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless
non-goal-directed activity). 7. Excessive involvement in activities that
have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in
unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business
investments). c. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause
marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to
necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there
are psychotic features. d. The episode is not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication, other treatment) or another medical condition. Note: A full
manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,
medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal
level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient
evidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis.
Note: Criteria A--D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime
manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

Hypomanic Episode a. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently
elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently
increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and
present most of the day, nearly every day. b. During the period of mood
disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or more) of the
following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) have persisted,
represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present
to a significant degree: 1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 2.
Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of
sleep). 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.

4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5.
Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or
irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. 6. Increase in
goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)
or psychomotor agitation. 7. Excessive involvement in activities that
have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in
unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business
investments). c. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in
functioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not
symptomatic. d. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning
are observable by others. e. The episode is not severe enough to cause
marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to
necessitate hospitalization. If there are psychotic features, the
episode is, by definition, manic. f. The episode is not attributable to
the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication, other treatment) or another medical condition. Note: A full
hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,
medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal
level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient
evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis. However, caution is
indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly increased
irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are
not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor
necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis. Note: Criteria A--F
constitute a hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes are common in bipolar
I disorder but are not required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

Major Depressive Episode a. Five (or more) of the following symptoms
have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change
from previous

functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood
or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note: Do not include symptoms that
are clearly attributable to another medical condition. 1. Depressed mood
most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective
report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation made by
others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can
be irritable mood.) 2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all,
or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as
indicated by either subjective account or observation). 3. Significant
weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than
5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite
nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected
weight gain.) 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day. 5.
Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by
others; not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed
down). 6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 7. Feelings of
worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be
delusional) nearly every day (not merely selfreproach or guilt about
being sick). 8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or
indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as
observed by others). 9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of
dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a
suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. b. The
symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning. c. The episode is
not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another
medical condition.

Note: Criteria A--C constitute a major depressive episode. Major
depressive episodes are common in bipolar I disorder but are not
required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. Note: Responses to a
significant loss (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a
natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include
the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia,
poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble
a depressive episode. Although such symptoms may be understandable or
considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive
episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should
also be carefully considered. This decision inevitably requires the
exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual's history and the
cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.1

Bipolar I Disorder a. Criteria have been met for at least one manic
episode (Criteria A--D under "Manic Episode" above). b. The occurrence
of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is not better explained by
schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,
delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorder. Coding and Recording Procedures
The diagnostic code for bipolar I disorder is based on type of current
or most recent episode and its status with respect to current severity,
presence of psychotic features, and remission status. Current severity
and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently
met for a manic or major depressive episode. Remission specifiers are
only indicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a manic,
hypomanic, or major depressive episode. Codes are as follows: Bipolar I

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of a manic episode is a
distinct period during which there is an abnormally, persistently
elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased
activity or energy that is present for most of the day, nearly every
day, for a period of at least 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization
is necessary), accompanied by at least three additional symptoms from
Criterion B. If the mood is irritable rather than elevated or expansive,
at least four Criterion B symptoms must be present. Mood in a manic
episode is often described as euphoric, excessively cheerful, high, or
"feeling on top of the world." In some cases, the mood is of such a
highly infectious quality that it is easily recognized as excessive and
may be characterized by unlimited and haphazard enthusiasm for
interpersonal, sexual, or occupational interactions. For example, the
individual may spontaneously start extensive conversations with
strangers in public. Often the predominant mood is irritable rather than
elevated, particularly when the individual's wishes are denied or if the
individual has been using substances. Rapid shifts in mood over brief
periods of time may occur and are referred to as lability (i.e., the
alternation among euphoria, dysphoria, and irritability). In children,
happiness, silliness and "goofiness" are normal in the context of
special occasions; however, if these symptoms are recurrent,
inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the
developmental level of the child, they may meet Criterion A. If the
happiness is unusual for a child (i.e., distinct from baseline), and the
mood change occurs at the same time as symptoms that meet Criterion B
for mania, diagnostic certainty is increased; however, the mood change
must be accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels
that are obvious to those who know the child well. During the manic
episode, the individual may engage in multiple overlapping new projects.
The projects are often initiated with little

knowledge of the topic, and nothing seems out of the individual's reach.
The increased activity levels may manifest at unusual hours of the day.
Inflated self-esteem is typically present, ranging from uncritical
selfconfidence to marked grandiosity, and may reach delusional
proportions (Criterion B1). Despite lack of any particular experience or
talent, the individual may embark on complex tasks such as writing a
novel or seeking publicity for some impractical invention. Grandiose
delusions (e.g., of having a special relationship to a famous person)
are common. In children, overestimation of abilities and belief that,
for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class
is normal; however, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence
to the contrary or the child attempts feats that are clearly dangerous
and, most important, represent a change from the child's normal
behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied. One
of the most common features is a decreased need for sleep (Criterion B2)
and is distinct from insomnia in which the individual wants to sleep or
feels the need to sleep but is unable. The individual may sleep little,
if at all, or may awaken several hours earlier than usual, feeling
rested and full of energy. When the sleep disturbance is severe, the
individual may go for days without sleep, yet not feel tired. Often a
decreased need for sleep heralds the onset of a manic episode. Speech
can be rapid, pressured, loud, and difficult to interrupt (Criterion
B3). Individuals may talk continuously and without regard for others'
wishes to communicate, often in an intrusive manner or without concern
for the relevance of what is said. Speech is sometimes characterized by
jokes, puns, amusing irrelevancies, and theatricality, with dramatic
mannerisms, singing, and excessive gesturing. Loudness and forcefulness
of speech often become more important than what is conveyed. If the
individual's mood is more irritable than expansive, speech may be marked
by complaints, hostile comments, or angry tirades, particularly if
attempts are made to interrupt the individual. Both Criterion A and
Criterion B symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of the opposite
(i.e., depressive) pole (see "with mixed features" specifier,
pp. 149--150). Often the individual's thoughts race at a rate faster
than they can be expressed through speech (Criterion B4). Frequently
there is flight of ideas evidenced by a nearly continuous flow of
accelerated speech, with abrupt shifts from one topic to another. When
flight of ideas is severe, speech may

become disorganized, incoherent, and particularly distressful to the
individual. Sometimes thoughts are experienced as so crowded that it is
very difficult to speak. Distractibility (Criterion B5) is evidenced by
an inability to censor immaterial external stimuli (e.g., the
interviewer's attire, background noises or conversations, furnishings in
the room) and often prevents individuals experiencing mania from holding
a rational conversation or attending to instructions. The increase in
goal-directed activity often consists of excessive planning and
participation in multiple activities, including sexual, occupational,
political, or religious activities. Increased sexual drive, fantasies,
and behavior are often present. Individuals in a manic episode usually
show increased sociability (e.g., renewing old acquaintances or calling
or contacting friends or even strangers), without regard to the
intrusive, domineering, and demanding nature of these interactions. They
often display psychomotor agitation or restlessness (i.e., purposeless
activity) by pacing or by holding multiple conversations simultaneously.
Some individuals write excessive letters, e-mails, text messages, and so
forth, on many different topics to friends, public figures, or the
media. The increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in
children; however, when the child takes on many tasks simultaneously,
starts devising elaborate and unrealistic plans for projects, develops
previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual
preoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to
sexually explicit material), then Criterion B might be met based on
clinical judgment. It is essential to determine whether the behavior
represents a change from the child's baseline behavior; occurs most of
the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in
temporal association with other symptoms of mania. The expansive mood,
excessive optimism, grandiosity, and poor judgment often lead to
reckless involvement in activities such as spending sprees, giving away
possessions, reckless driving, foolish business investments, and sexual
promiscuity that is unusual for the individual, even though these
activities are likely to have catastrophic consequences (Criterion B7).
The individual may purchase many unneeded items without the money to pay
for them and, in some cases, give them away. Sexual behavior may include
infidelity or indiscriminate sexual encounters with

strangers, often disregarding the risk of sexually transmitted diseases
or interpersonal consequences. The manic episode must result in marked
impairment in social or occupational functioning or require
hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others (e.g., financial
losses, illegal activities, loss of employment, selfinjurious behavior).
By definition, the presence of psychotic features during a manic episode
also satisfies Criterion C. Manic symptoms or syndromes that are
attributable to the physiological effects of a drug of abuse (e.g., in
the context of cocaine or amphetamine intoxication), the side effects of
medications or treatments (e.g., steroids, Ldopa, antidepressants,
stimulants), or another medical condition do not count toward the
diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. However, a fully syndromal manic
episode that arises during treatment (e.g., with medications,
electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy) or drug use and persists
beyond the physiological effect of the inducing agent (i.e., after a
medication is fully out of the individual's system or the effects of
electroconvulsive therapy would be expected to have dissipated
completely) is sufficient evidence for a manic episode diagnosis
(Criterion D). Caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms
(particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following
antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a manic
or hypomanic episode, nor necessarily an indication of a bipolar
disorder diathesis. It is necessary to meet criteria for a manic episode
to make a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, but it is not required to
have hypomanic or major depressive episodes. However, they may precede
or follow a manic episode. Full descriptions of the diagnostic features
of a hypomanic episode may be found within the text for bipolar II
disorder, and the features of a major depressive episode are described
within the text for major depressive disorder.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis During a manic episode,
individuals often do not perceive that they are ill or in need of
treatment and vehemently resist efforts to be treated. Individuals may
change their dress, makeup, or personal appearance to a more sexually
suggestive or flamboyant style. Some perceive a sharper sense of smell,
hearing, or vision. Gambling and antisocial behaviors may accompany the
manic episode. Some individuals may become hostile and physically
threatening to others and, when delusional, may become

physically assaultive or suicidal. Catastrophic consequences of a manic
episode (e.g., involuntary hospitalization, difficulties with the law,
serious financial difficulties) often result from poor judgment, loss of
insight, and hyperactivity. Mood may shift very rapidly to anger or
depression. Depressive symptoms may occur during a manic episode and, if
present, may last moments, hours, or, more rarely, days (see "with mixed
features" specifier, pp. 149--150).

Prevalence The 12-month prevalence estimate in the continental United
States was 0.6% for bipolar I disorder as defined in DSM-IV13.
Twelve-month prevalence of bipolar I disorder across 11 countries ranged
from 0.0% to 0.6%13. The lifetime male-to-female prevalence ratio is
approximately 1.1:113.

Development and Course Mean age at onset of the first manic, hypomanic,
or major depressive episode is approximately 18 years for bipolar I
disorder. Special considerations are necessary to detect the diagnosis
in children. Since children of the same chronological age may be at
different developmental stages, it is difficult to define with precision
what is "normal" or "expected" at any given point. Therefore, each child
should be judged according to his or her own baseline. Onset occurs
throughout the life cycle, including first onsets in the 60s or 70s.
Onset of manic symptoms (e.g., sexual or social disinhibition) in late
mid-life or late-life should prompt consideration of medical conditions
(e.g., frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder) and of substance
ingestion or withdrawal. More than 90% of individuals who have a single
manic episode go on to have recurrent mood episodes. Approximately 60%
of manic episodes occur immediately before a major depressive episode.
Individuals with bipolar I disorder who have multiple (four or more)
mood episodes (major depressive, manic, or hypomanic) within 1 year
receive the specifier "with rapid cycling."

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Environmental. Bipolar disorder is more common in high-income than in
low-income countries (1.4% vs. 0.7%)16. Separated, divorced, or widowed
individuals have higher rates of bipolar I disorder than do individuals
who are married or have never been married, but the direction of the
association is unclear. Genetic and physiological. A family history of
bipolar disorder is one of the strongest and most consistent risk
factors for bipolar disorders. There is an average 10-fold increased
risk among adult relatives of individuals with bipolar I and bipolar II
disorders. Magnitude of risk increases with degree of kinship.
Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder likely share a genetic origin9,
reflected in familial co-aggregation of schizophrenia and bipolar
disorder23. Course modifiers. After an individual has a manic episode
with psychotic features, subsequent manic episodes are more likely to
include psychotic features. Incomplete inter-episode recovery is more
common when the current episode is accompanied by mood-incongruent
psychotic features.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Little information exists on specific
cultural differences in the expression of bipolar I disorder. One
possible explanation for this may be that diagnostic instruments are
often translated and applied in different cultures with no transcultural
validation19. In one U.S. study, 12-month prevalence of bipolar I
disorder was significantly lower for Afro-Caribbeans than for African
Americans or whites24.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Females are more likely to experience
rapid cycling and mixed states, and to have patterns of comorbidity that
differ from those of males, including higher rates of lifetime eating
disorders12. Females with bipolar I or II disorder are more likely to
experience depressive symptoms than males1, 22. They also have a higher
lifetime risk of alcohol use disorder than do males and a much greater
likelihood of alcohol use disorder than do females in the general
population3.

Suicide Risk

The lifetime risk of suicide in individuals with bipolar disorder is
estimated to be at least 15 times that of the general population. In
fact, bipolar disorder may account for one-quarter of all completed
suicides. A past history of suicide attempt and percent days spent
depressed in the past year are associated with greater risk of suicide
attempts or completions11.

Functional Consequences of Bipolar I Disorder Although many individuals
with bipolar disorder return to a fully functional level between
episodes, approximately 30% show severe impairment in work role
function6. Functional recovery lags substantially behind recovery from
symptoms, especially with respect to occupational recovery, resulting in
lower socioeconomic status despite equivalent levels of education when
compared with the general population20. Individuals with bipolar I
disorder perform more poorly than healthy individuals on cognitive
tests. Cognitive impairments may contribute to vocational and
interpersonal difficulties2 and persist through the lifespan, even
during euthymic periods4.

Differential Diagnosis Major depressive disorder. Major depressive
disorder may also be accompanied by hypomanic or manic symptoms (i.e.,
fewer symptoms or for a shorter duration than required for mania or
hypomania). When the individual presents in an episode of major
depression, one must depend on corroborating history regarding past
episodes of mania or hypomania. Symptoms of irritability may be
associated with either major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder,
adding to diagnostic complexity. Other bipolar disorders. Diagnosis of
bipolar I disorder is differentiated from bipolar II disorder by
determining whether there have been any past episodes of mania. Other
specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders should be
differentiated from bipolar I and II disorders by considering whether
either the episodes involving manic or hypomanic symptoms or the
episodes of depressive symptoms fail to meet the full criteria for those
conditions. Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition may be
distinguished from bipolar I and II disorders by identifying, based on
best clinical evidence, a causally related medical condition.

Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress
disorder, or other anxiety disorders. These disorders need to be
considered in the differential diagnosis as either the primary disorder
or, in some cases, a comorbid disorder. A careful history of symptoms is
needed to differentiate generalized anxiety disorder from bipolar
disorder, as anxious ruminations may be mistaken for racing thoughts,
and efforts to minimize anxious feelings may be taken as impulsive
behavior. Similarly, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder need to
be differentiated from bipolar disorder. It is helpful to assess the
episodic nature of the symptoms described, as well as to consider
symptom triggers, in making this differential diagnosis.
Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder. Substance use disorders
may manifest with substance.medication-induced manic symptoms that must
be distinguished from bipolar I disorder; response to mood stabilizers
during a substance/medication-induced mania may not necessarily be
diagnostic for bipolar disorder. There may be substantial overlap in
view of the tendency for individuals with bipolar I disorder to overuse
substances during an episode. A primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder
must be established based on symptoms that remain once substances are no
longer being used. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This
disorder may be misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder, especially in
adolescents and children. Many symptoms overlap with the symptoms of
mania, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, and less
need for sleep. The "double counting" of symptoms toward both ADHD and
bipolar disorder can be avoided if the clinician clarifies whether the
symptom(s) represents a distinct episode. Personality disorders.
Personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder may have
substantial symptomatic overlap with bipolar disorders, since mood
lability and impulsivity are common in both conditions. Symptoms must
represent a distinct episode, and the noticeable increase over baseline
required for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder must be present. A
diagnosis of a personality disorder should not be made during an
untreated mood episode. Disorders with prominent irritability. In
individuals with severe irritability, particularly children and
adolescents, care must be taken to

apply the diagnosis of bipolar disorder only to those who have had a
clear episode of mania or hypomania---that is, a distinct time period,
of the required duration, during which the irritability was clearly
different from the individual's baseline and was accompanied by the
onset of Criterion B symptoms. When a child's irritability is persistent
and particularly severe, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder would be more appropriate. Indeed, when any child is being
assessed for mania, it is essential that the symptoms represent a clear
change from the child's typical behavior.

Comorbidity Co-occurring mental disorders are common, with the most
frequent disorders being any anxiety disorder (e.g., panic attacks,
social anxiety disorder \[social phobia\], specific phobia), occurring
in approximately threefourths of individuals; ADHD, any disruptive,
impulse-control, or conduct disorder (e.g., intermittent explosive
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder), and any
substance use disorder (e.g., alcohol use disorder) occur in over half
of individuals with bipolar I disorder14. Adults with bipolar I disorder
have high rates of serious and/or untreated cooccurring medical
conditions7, 10, 18. Metabolic syndrome and migraine are more common
among individuals with bipolar disorder than in the general population5,
17, 21. More than half of individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for
bipolar disorder have an alcohol use disorder, and those with both
disorders are at greater risk for suicide attempt15.

Bipolar II Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

296.89 (F31.81)

For a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder, it is necessary to meet the
following criteria for a current or past hypomanic episode and the
following criteria for a current or past major depressive episode:

Hypomanic Episode a. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently
elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently
increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and
present most of the day, nearly every day. b. During the period of mood
disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or more) of the
following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable),
represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present
to a significant degree: 1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 2.
Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of
sleep). 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4.
Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5.
Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or
irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. 6. Increase in
goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually)
or psychomotor agitation. 7. Excessive involvement in activities that
have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in
unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business
investments). c. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in
functioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not
symptomatic. d. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning
are observable by others.

e. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social
or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization. If there
are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic. f. The
episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance
(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment). Note: A full
hypomanic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e.g.,
medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal
level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient
evidence for a hypomanic episode diagnosis. However, caution is
indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly increased
irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are
not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a hypomanic episode, nor
necessarily indicative of a bipolar diathesis.

Major Depressive Episode a. Five (or more) of the following symptoms
have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change
from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1)
depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. Note: Do not include
symptoms that are clearly attributable to a medical condition. 1.
Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either
subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or hopeless) or observation
made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and
adolescents, can be irritable mood.) 2. Markedly diminished interest or
pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every
day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation). 3.
Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change
of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in
appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make
expected weight gain.) 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.

5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by
others; not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed
down). 6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 7. Feelings of
worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be
delusional) nearly every day (not merely selfreproach or guilt about
being sick). 8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or
indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as
observed by others). 9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of
dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, a suicide
attempt, or a specific plan for committing suicide. b. The symptoms
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning. c. The episode is
not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another
medical condition. Note: Criteria A--C above constitute a major
depressive episode. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g.,
bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious
medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense
sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight
loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode.
Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate
to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to
the normal response to a significant loss should be carefully
considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical
judgment based on the individual's history and the cultural norms for
the expression of distress in the context of loss.2

Bipolar II Disorder a. Criteria have been met for at least one hypomanic
episode (Criteria A--F under "Hypomanic Episode" above) and at least one
major depressive episode (Criteria A--C under "Major Depressive Episode"
above).

b. There has never been a manic episode. c. The occurrence of the
hypomanic episode(s) and major depressive episode(s) is not better
explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform
disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. d. The symptoms of
depression or the unpredictability caused by frequent alternation
between periods of depression and hypomania causes clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning. Coding and Recording Procedures Bipolar
II disorder has one diagnostic code: 296.89 (F31.81). Its status with
respect to current severity, presence of psychotic features, course, and
other specifiers cannot be coded but should be indicated in writing
(e.g., 296.89 \[F31.81\] bipolar II disorder, current episode depressed,
moderate severity, with mixed features; 296.89 \[F31.81\] bipolar II
disorder, most recent episode depressed, in partial remission). Specify
current or most recent episode: Hypomanic Depressed Specify if: With
anxious distress (p. 149) With mixed features (pp. 149--150) With rapid
cycling (pp. 150--151) With melancholic features (p. 151) With atypical
features (pp. 151--152) With mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 152)
With mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 152) With catatonia
(p. 152). Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1). With
peripartum onset (pp. 152--153) With seasonal pattern (pp. 153--154).
Specify course if full criteria for a mood episode are not currently
met: In partial remission (p. 154)

In full remission (p. 154) Specify severity if full criteria for a major
depressive episode are currently met: Mild (p. 154) Moderate (p. 154)
Severe (p. 154)

Diagnostic Features Bipolar II disorder is characterized by a clinical
course of recurring mood episodes consisting of one or more major
depressive episodes (Criteria A--C under "Major Depressive Episode") and
at least one hypomanic episode (Criteria A--F under "Hypomanic
Episode"). The major depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks, and
the hypomanic episode must last at least 4 days, to meet the diagnostic
criteria. During the mood episode(s), the requisite number of symptoms
must be present most of the day, nearly every day, and represent a
noticeable change from usual behavior and functioning. The presence of a
manic episode during the course of illness precludes the diagnosis of
bipolar II disorder (Criterion B under "Bipolar II Disorder"). Episodes
of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder or
substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (representing
the physiological effects of a medication, other somatic treatments for
depression, drugs of abuse, or toxin exposure) or of depressive and
related disorder due to another medical condition or bipolar and related
disorder due to another medical condition do not count toward a
diagnosis of bipolar II disorder unless they persist beyond the
physiological effects of the treatment or substance and then meet
duration criteria for an episode. In addition, the episodes must not be
better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and are not
superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional
disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or
other psychotic disorders (Criterion C under "Bipolar II Disorder"). The
depressive episodes or hypomanic fluctuations must cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning (Criterion D under "Bipolar II
Disorder"); however, for hypomanic episodes, this requirement does not
have to be met. A hypomanic episode that causes significant impairment
would likely qualify for the diagnosis of manic episode and,

therefore, for a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. The recurrent
major depressive episodes are often more frequent and lengthier than
those occurring in bipolar I disorder. Individuals with bipolar II
disorder typically present to a clinician during a major depressive
episode and are unlikely to complain initially of hypomania. Typically,
the hypomanic episodes themselves do not cause impairment. Instead, the
impairment results from the major depressive episodes or from a
persistent pattern of unpredictable mood changes and fluctuating,
unreliable interpersonal or occupational functioning. Individuals with
bipolar II disorder may not view the hypomanic episodes as pathological
or disadvantageous, although others may be troubled by the individual's
erratic behavior. Clinical information from other informants, such as
close friends or relatives, is often useful in establishing the
diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. A hypomanic episode should not be
confused with the several days of euthymia and restored energy or
activity that may follow remission of a major depressive episode.
Despite the substantial differences in duration and severity between a
manic and hypomanic episode, bipolar II disorder is not a "milder form"
of bipolar I disorder. Compared with individuals with bipolar I
disorder, individuals with bipolar II disorder have greater chronicity
of illness and spend, on average, more time in the depressive phase of
their illness, which can be severe and/or disabling15, 16. Depressive
symptoms co-occurring with a hypomanic episode or hypomanic symptoms
co-occurring with a depressive episode are common in individuals with
bipolar II disorder and are overrepresented in females, particularly
hypomania with mixed features36. Individuals experiencing hypomania with
mixed features may not label their symptoms as hypomania, but instead
experience them as depression with increased energy or irritability.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis A common feature of bipolar II
disorder is impulsivity, which can contribute to suicide attempts and
substance use disorders37. Impulsivity may also stem from a concurrent
personality disorder, substance use disorder, anxiety disorder, another
mental disorder, or a medical condition. There may be heightened levels
of creativity in some individuals with a bipolar disorder. However, that
relationship may be nonlinear; that is,

greater lifetime creative accomplishments have been associated with
milder forms of bipolar disorder29, and higher creativity has been found
in unaffected family members34. The individual's attachment to
heightened creativity during hypomanic episodes may contribute to
ambivalence about seeking treatment or undermine adherence to treatment.

Prevalence The 12-month prevalence of bipolar II disorder,
internationally, is 0.3%26. In the United States, 12-month prevalence is
0.8%26. The prevalence rate of pediatric bipolar II disorder is
difficult to establish. DSM-IV bipolar I, bipolar II, and bipolar
disorder not otherwise specified yield a combined prevalence rate of
1.8% in U.S. and non-U.S. community samples, with higher rates (2.7%
inclusive) in youths age 12 years or older41.

Development and Course Although bipolar II disorder can begin in late
adolescence and throughout adulthood, average age at onset is the
mid-20s, which is slightly later than for bipolar I disorder but earlier
than for major depressive disorder15, 40. The illness most often begins
with a depressive episode and is not recognized as bipolar II disorder
until a hypomanic episode occurs; this happens in about 12% of
individuals with the initial diagnosis of major depressive disorder9.
Anxiety, substance use, or eating disorders may also precede the
diagnosis, complicating its detection. Many individuals experience
several episodes of major depression prior to the first recognized
hypomanic episode. The number of lifetime episodes (both hypomanic and
major depressive episodes) tends to be higher for bipolar II disorder
than for major depressive disorder or bipolar I disorder14, 15. However,
individuals with bipolar I disorder are actually more likely to
experience hypomanic symptoms than are individuals with bipolar II
disorder36.The interval between mood episodes in the course of bipolar
II disorder tends to decrease as the individual ages. While the
hypomanic episode is the feature that defines bipolar II disorder,
depressive episodes are more enduring and disabling over time. Despite
the predominance of depression, once a hypomanic episode has occurred,
the diagnosis becomes bipolar II disorder and never reverts to major
depressive disorder.

Approximately 5%--15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder have
multiple (four or more) mood episodes (hypomanic or major depressive)
within the previous 12 months. If this pattern is present, it is noted
by the specifier "with rapid cycling." By definition, psychotic symptoms
do not occur in hypomanic episodes, and they appear to be less frequent
in the major depressive episodes in bipolar II disorder than in those of
bipolar I disorder. Switching from a depressive episode to a manic or
hypomanic episode (with or without mixed features) may occur, both
spontaneously and during treatment for depression10. About 5%--15% of
individuals with bipolar II disorder will ultimately develop a manic
episode, which changes the diagnosis to bipolar I disorder, regardless
of subsequent course. Making the diagnosis in children is often a
challenge, especially in those with irritability and hyperarousal that
is nonepisodic (i.e., lacks the welldemarcated periods of altered mood).
Nonepisodic irritability in youth is associated with an elevated risk
for anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, but not bipolar
disorder, in adulthood. Persistently irritable youths have lower
familial rates of bipolar disorder than do youths who have bipolar
disorder19. For a hypomanic episode to be diagnosed, the child's
symptoms must exceed what is expected in a given environment and culture
for the child's developmental stage. Compared with adult onset of
bipolar II disorder, childhood or adolescent onset of the disorder may
be associated with a more severe lifetime course. The 3-year incidence
rate of first-onset bipolar II disorder in adults older than 60 years is
0.34%6. However, distinguishing individuals older than 60 years with
bipolar II disorder by late versus early age at onset does not appear to
have any clinical utility7.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. The risk of
bipolar II disorder tends to be highest among relatives of individuals
with bipolar II disorder, as opposed to individuals with bipolar I
disorder or major depressive disorder2, 13, 18, 35. There may be genetic
factors influencing the age at onset for bipolar disorders23. Course
modifiers A rapid-cycling pattern is associated with a poorer prognosis.
Return to previous level of social function for individuals with bipolar
II disorder is more likely for individuals of younger age and with

less severe depression, suggesting adverse effects of prolonged illness
on recovery43. More education, fewer years of illness, and being married
are independently associated with functional recovery in individuals
with bipolar disorder, even after diagnostic type (I vs. II), current
depressive symptoms, and presence of psychiatric comorbidity are taken
into account44.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Whereas the gender ratio for bipolar I
disorder is equal, findings on gender differences in bipolar II disorder
are mixed, differing by type of sample (i.e., registry, community, or
clinical) and country of origin. There is little to no evidence of
bipolar gender differences11, whereas some21, 42, but not all12, 17,
clinical samples suggest that bipolar II disorder is more common in
females than in males, which may reflect gender differences in treatment
seeking or other factors. Patterns of illness and comorbidity, however,
seem to differ by gender, with females being more likely than males to
report hypomania with mixed depressive features36 and a rapid-cycling
course1. Childbirth may be a specific trigger for a hypomanic episode,
which can occur in 10%--20% of females in nonclinical populations and
most typically in the early postpartum period33. Distinguishing
hypomania from the elated mood and reduced sleep that normally accompany
the birth of a child may be challenging. Postpartum hypomania may
foreshadow the onset of a depression that occurs in about half of
females who experience postpartum "highs." Accurate detection of bipolar
II disorder may help in establishing appropriate treatment of the
depression, which may reduce the risk of suicide and infanticide.

Suicide Risk Suicide risk is high in bipolar II disorder30.
Approximately one-third of individuals with bipolar II disorder report a
lifetime history of suicide attempt27. The prevalence rates of lifetime
attempted suicide in bipolar II and bipolar I disorder appear to be
similar (32.4% and 36.3%, respectively). However, the lethality of
attempts, as defined by a lower ratio of attempts to completed suicides,
may be higher in individuals with bipolar II disorder compared with
individuals with bipolar I disorder39. There may be an

association between genetic markers and increased risk for suicidal
behavior in individuals with bipolar disorder20, including a 6.5-fold
higher risk of suicide among first-degree relatives of bipolar II
probands compared with those with bipolar I disorder38.

Functional Consequences of Bipolar II Disorder Although many individuals
with bipolar II disorder return to a fully functional level between mood
episodes, at least 15% continue to have some inter-episode dysfunction,
and 20% transition directly into another mood episode without
inter-episode recovery. Functional recovery lags substantially behind
recovery from symptoms of bipolar II disorder, especially in regard to
occupational recovery, resulting in lower socioeconomic status despite
equivalent levels of education with the general population32.
Individuals with bipolar II disorder perform more poorly than healthy
individuals on cognitive tests and, with the exception of memory and
semantic fluency, have similar cognitive impairment as do individuals
with bipolar I disorder5. Cognitive impairments associated with bipolar
II disorder may contribute to vocational difficulties8. Prolonged
unemployment in individuals with bipolar disorder is associated with
more episodes of depression, older age, increased rates of current panic
disorder, and lifetime history of alcohol use disorder45.

Differential Diagnosis Major depressive disorder Perhaps the most
challenging differential diagnosis to consider is major depressive
disorder, which may be accompanied by hypomanic or manic symptoms that
do not meet full criteria (i.e., either fewer symptoms or a shorter
duration than required for a hypomanic episode). This is especially true
in evaluating individuals with symptoms of irritability, which may be
associated with either major depressive disorder or bipolar II disorder.
Cyclothymic disorder. In cyclothymic disorder, there are numerous
periods of hypomanic symptoms and numerous periods of depressive
symptoms that do not meet symptom or duration criteria for a major
depressive episode. Bipolar II disorder is distinguished from
cyclothymic disorder by the presence of one or more major depressive
episodes. If a

major depressive episode occurs after the first 2 years of cyclothymic
disorder, the additional diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is given.
Schizophrenia spectrum and other related psychotic disorders. Bipolar II
disorder must be distinguished from psychotic disorders (e.g.,
schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, and delusional disorder).
Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and delusional disorder are all
characterized by periods of psychotic symptoms that occur in the absence
of prominent mood symptoms. Other helpful considerations include the
accompanying symptoms, previous course, and family history. Panic
disorder or other anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders need to be
considered in the differential diagnosis and may frequently be present
as cooccurring disorders. Substance use disorders. differential
diagnosis.

Substance use disorders are included in the

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be misdiagnosed as
bipolar II disorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many
symptoms of ADHD, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts,
distractibility, and less need for sleep, overlap with the symptoms of
hypomania. The double counting of symptoms toward both ADHD and bipolar
II disorder can be avoided if the clinician clarifies whether the
symptoms represent a distinct episode and if the noticeable increase
over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is
present. Personality disorders. The same convention as applies for ADHD
also applies when evaluating an individual for a personality disorder
such as borderline personality disorder, since mood lability and
impulsivity are common in both personality disorders and bipolar II
disorder. Symptoms must represent a distinct episode, and the noticeable
increase over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder
must be present. A diagnosis of a personality disorder should not be
made during an untreated mood episode unless the lifetime history
supports the presence of a personality disorder. Other bipolar
disorders. Diagnosis of bipolar II disorder should be differentiated
from bipolar I disorder by carefully considering whether there have been
any past episodes of mania and from other specified and

unspecified bipolar and related disorders by confirming the presence of
fully syndromal hypomania and depression.

Comorbidity Bipolar II disorder is more often than not associated with
one or more cooccurring mental disorders, with anxiety disorders being
the most common. Approximately 60% of individuals with bipolar II
disorder have three or more co-occurring mental disorders; 75% have an
anxiety disorder; and 37% have a substance use disorder3, 26. Children
and adolescents with bipolar II disorder have a higher rate of
co-occurring anxiety disorders compared with those with bipolar I
disorder, and the anxiety disorder most often predates the bipolar
disorder4, 31. Anxiety and substance use disorders occur in individuals
with bipolar II disorder at a higher rate than in the general
population16. Approximately 14% of individuals with bipolar II disorder
have at least one lifetime eating disorder, with binge-eating disorder
being more common than bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa24. These
commonly co-occurring disorders do not seem to follow a course of
illness that is truly independent from that of the bipolar disorder, but
rather have strong associations with mood states. For example, anxiety
and eating disorders tend to associate most with depressive symptoms,
and substance use disorders are moderately associated with manic
symptoms22.

Cyclothymic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

301.13 (F34.0)

a.  For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents)
    there have been numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms that do not
    meet criteria for a hypomanic episode and numerous periods with
    depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive
    episode.

b. During the above 2-year period (1 year in children and adolescents),
the hypomanic and depressive periods have been present for at least half
the time and the individual has not been without the symptoms for more
than 2 months at a time. c. Criteria for a major depressive, manic, or
hypomanic episode have never been met. d. The symptoms in Criterion A
are not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,
schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or
unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. e. The
symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). f. The symptoms cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning. Specify if: With anxious distress (see
p. 149)

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of cyclothymic disorder is a
chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of
hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms that are distinct
from each other (Criterion A). The hypomanic symptoms are of
insufficient number, severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full
criteria for a hypomanic episode, and the depressive symptoms are of
insufficient number, severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full
criteria for a major depressive episode. During the initial 2-year
period (1 year for children or adolescents), the symptoms must be
persistent (present more days than not), and any symptom-free intervals
last no longer than 2 months (Criterion B). The diagnosis of cyclothymic
disorder is made only if the criteria for a major depressive, manic, or
hypomanic episode have never been met (Criterion C). If an individual
with cyclothymic disorder subsequently (i.e., after the initial 2 years
in adults or 1 year in children or adolescents) experiences a

major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis changes to
major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, or other specified or
unspecified bipolar and related disorder (subclassified as hypomanic
episode without prior major depressive episode), respectively, and the
cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is dropped. The cyclothymic disorder
diagnosis is not made if the pattern of mood swings is better explained
by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,
delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia
spectrum and other psychotic disorders (Criterion D), in which case the
mood symptoms are considered associated features of the psychotic
disorder. The mood disturbance must also not be attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism)
(Criterion E). Although some individuals may function particularly well
during some of the periods of hypomania, over the prolonged course of
the disorder, there must be clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning as a result of the mood disturbance (Criterion F). The
impairment may develop as a result of prolonged periods of cyclical,
often unpredictable mood changes (e.g., the individual may be regarded
as temperamental, moody, unpredictable, inconsistent, or unreliable).

Prevalence The lifetime prevalence of cyclothymic disorder is
approximately 0.4%-- 1%1. Prevalence in mood disorders clinics may range
from 3% to 5%. In the general population, cyclothymic disorder is
apparently equally common in males and females. In clinical settings,
females with cyclothymic disorder may be more likely to present for
treatment than males.

Development and Course Cyclothymic disorder usually begins in
adolescence or early adult life and is sometimes considered to reflect a
temperamental predisposition to other disorders in this chapter.
Cyclothymic disorder usually has an insidious onset and a persistent
course. There is a 15%--50% risk that an individual with cyclothymic
disorder will subsequently develop bipolar I disorder or bipolar II
disorder. Onset of persistent, fluctuating hypomanic and

depressive symptoms late in adult life needs to be clearly
differentiated from bipolar and related disorder due to another medical
condition and depressive disorder due to another medical condition
(e.g., multiple sclerosis) before the cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is
assigned. Among children with cyclothymic disorder, the mean age at
onset of symptoms is 6.5 years of age.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Major depressive
disorder, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II disorder are more common
among first-degree biological relatives of individuals with cyclothymic
disorder than in the general population. There may also be an increased
familial risk of substancerelated disorders. Cyclothymic disorder may be
more common in the firstdegree biological relatives of individuals with
bipolar I disorder than in the general population.

Differential Diagnosis Bipolar and related disorder due to another
medical condition and depressive disorder due to another medical
condition. The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another
medical condition or depressive disorder due to another medical
condition is made when the mood disturbance is judged to be attributable
to the physiological effect of a specific, usually chronic medical
condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). This determination is based on the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. If it is judged
that the hypomanic and depressive symptoms are not the physiological
consequence of the medical condition, then the primary mental disorder
(i.e., cyclothymic disorder) and the medical condition are coded. For
example, this would be the case if the mood symptoms are considered to
be the psychological (not the physiological) consequence of having a
chronic medical condition, or if there is no etiological relationship
between the hypomanic and depressive symptoms and the medical condition.
Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and
substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.
Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and
substance/medication-induced depressive disorder are distinguished from

cyclothymic disorder by the judgment that a substance/medication
(especially stimulants) is etiologically related to the mood
disturbance. The frequent mood swings in these disorders that are
suggestive of cyclothymic disorder usually resolve following cessation
of substance/medication use. Bipolar I disorder, with rapid cycling, and
bipolar II disorder, with rapid cycling. Both disorders may resemble
cyclothymic disorder by virtue of the frequent marked shifts in mood. By
definition, in cyclothymic disorder the criteria for a major depressive,
manic, or hypomanic episode has never been met, whereas the bipolar I
disorder and bipolar II disorder specifier "with rapid cycling" requires
that full mood episodes be present. Borderline personality disorder.
Borderline personality disorder is associated with marked shifts in mood
that may suggest cyclothymic disorder. If the criteria are met for both
disorders, both borderline personality disorder and cyclothymic disorder
may be diagnosed.

Comorbidity Substance-related disorders and sleep disorders (i.e.,
difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep) may be present in
individuals with cyclothymic disorder. Most children with cyclothymic
disorder treated in outpatient psychiatric settings have comorbid mental
conditions; they are more likely than other pediatric patients with
mental disorders to have comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder2.

Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria a. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood
that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by

or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
activities. b. There is evidence from the history, physical examination,

A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or
after exposure to a medication. 2. The involved substance/medication is
capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A. c. The disturbance is
not better explained by a bipolar or related disorder that is not
substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent bipolar or
related disorder could include the following: The symptoms precede the
onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a
substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of
acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent
non-substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (e.g., a
history of recurrent nonsubstance/medication-related episodes). d. The
disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.
e. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Coding
note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance/medication\]-induced bipolar and related disorders are
indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on
whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for
the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is
comorbid with the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the
4th position character is "1," and the clinician should record "mild
\[substance\] use disorder" before the substance-induced bipolar and
related disorder (e.g., "mild

cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related
disorder"). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, the 4th
position character is "2," and the clinician should record "moderate
\[substance\] use disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use disorder,"
depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If
there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time
heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is "9," and
the clinician should record only the substance-induced bipolar and
related disorder. ICD-10-CM ICD-9- With use CM disorder, mild

Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter "Substance-Related and Addictive
Disorders" for diagnoses associated with substance class): With onset
during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intoxication with the
substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication. With onset
during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance
and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after,

withdrawal.

Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the
substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder begins with
the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed
to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected
from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug
class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
dexamethasone), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in
cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the
specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during
withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which
combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a
single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the
substance use disorder. For example, in the case of irritable symptoms
occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use
disorder, the diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced bipolar and related
disorder, with onset during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of
304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one
substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of
bipolar mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.84
methylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during
intoxication; 292.84 dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder,
with onset during intoxication). ICD-10-CM. The name of the
substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder begins with
the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed
to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected
from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug
class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For
substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
dexamethasone), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in
cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used.

When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use
disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed
by the name of the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder,
followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication,
onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of irritable symptoms
occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use
disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine use disorder with
cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during
intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use
disorder is not given. If the substance-induced bipolar and related
disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a
one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use
disorder is noted (e.g., F15.94 amphetamine-induced bipolar and related
disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance
is judged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood
symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe
methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced bipolar and
related disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19.94
dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during
intoxication).

Diagnostic Features The diagnostic features of
substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder are
essentially the same as those for mania, hypomania, or depression. A key
exception to the diagnosis of substance/medicationinduced bipolar and
related disorder is the case of hypomania or mania that occurs after
antidepressant medication use or other treatments and persists beyond
the physiological effects of the medication. This condition is
considered an indicator of true bipolar disorder, not
substance/medicationinduced bipolar and related disorder1, 2, 3, 4.
Similarly, individuals with apparent electroconvulsive therapy--induced
manic or hypomanic episodes that persist beyond the physiological
effects of the treatment are diagnosed with bipolar disorder, not
substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder. Side effects
of some antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs (e.g., edginess,
agitation) may resemble the primary symptoms of a manic syndrome, but
they are fundamentally distinct from bipolar symptoms and are
insufficient for the diagnosis. That is, the criterion symptoms of

mania/hypomania have specificity (simple agitation is not the same as
excess involvement in purposeful activities), and a sufficient number of
symptoms must be present (not just one or two symptoms) to make these
diagnoses. In particular, the appearance of one or two nonspecific
symptoms---irritability, edginess, or agitation during antidepressant
treatment---in the absence of a full manic or hypomanic syndrome should
not be taken to support a diagnosis of a bipolar disorder.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Etiology (causally related to
the use of psychotropic medications or substances of abuse based on best
clinical evidence) is the key variable in this etiologically specified
form of bipolar disorder. Substances/medications that are typically
considered to be associated with substance/medicationinduced bipolar and
related disorder include the stimulant class of drugs, as well as
phencyclidine and steroids; however, a number of potential substances
continue to emerge as new compounds are synthesized (e.g., socalled bath
salts). A history of such substance use may help increase diagnostic
certainty.

Prevalence There are no epidemiological studies of
substance/medication-induced mania or bipolar disorder. Each etiological
substance may have its own individual risk of inducing a bipolar
(manic/hypomanic) disorder.

Development and Course In phencyclidine-induced mania, the initial
presentation may be one of a delirium with affective features, which
then becomes an atypically appearing manic or mixed manic state6, 7.
This condition follows the ingestion or inhalation quickly, usually
within hours or, at the most, a few days. In stimulant-induced manic or
hypomanic states, the response is in minutes to 1 hour after one or
several ingestions or injections. The episode is very brief and
typically resolves over 1--2 days. With corticosteroids and some
immunosuppressant medications, the mania (or mixed or depressed state)
usually follows several days of ingestion, and the higher doses appear
to have a much greater likelihood of producing bipolar symptoms5, 8, 9.

Diagnostic Markers Determination of the substance of use can be made
through markers in the blood or urine to corroborate diagnosis.

Differential Diagnosis Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related
disorder should be differentiated from other bipolar disorders,
substance intoxication or substance-induced delirium, and medication
side effects (as noted earlier). A full manic episode that emerges
during antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive
therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the
physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a
bipolar I diagnosis. A full hypomanic episode that emerges during
antidepressant treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy)
but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect
of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a bipolar II diagnosis only
if preceded by a major depressive episode.

Comorbidity Comorbidities are those associated with the use of illicit
substances (in the case of illegal stimulants or phencyclidine) or
diversion of prescribed stimulants. Comorbidities related to steroid or
immunosuppressant medications are those medical indications for these
preparations. Delirium can occur before or along with manic symptoms in
individuals ingesting phencyclidine or those who are prescribed steroid
medications or other immunosuppressant medications.

Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition Diagnostic
Criteria a. A prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated,
expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally increased activity or energy
that predominates in the clinical picture. b. There is evidence from the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the
disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another
medical condition. c. The disturbance is not better explained by another
mental disorder. d. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during
the course of a delirium. e. The disturbance causes clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning, or necessitates hospitalization to
prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.

Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for bipolar and related disorder due to
another medical condition is 293.83, which is assigned regardless of the
specifier. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the specifier (see below).
Specify if: (F06.33) With manic features: Full criteria are not met for
a manic or hypomanic episode. (F06.33) With manic- or hypomanic-like
episode: Full criteria are met except Criterion D for a manic episode or
except Criterion F for a hypomanic episode. (F06.34) With mixed
features: Symptoms of depression are also present but do not predominate
in the clinical picture. Coding note: Include the name of the other
medical condition in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.83
\[F06.33\] bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with manic
features). The other medical condition should also be coded and listed
separately immediately before the bipolar and related disorder due to
the medical condition (e.g., 242.90 \[E05.90\] hyperthyroidism; 293.83
\[F06.33\] bipolar disorder due to hyperthyroidism, with manic
features).

Diagnostic Features The essential features of bipolar and related
disorder due to another medical condition are presence of a prominent
and persistent period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable
mood and abnormally increased activity or energy predominating in the
clinical picture that is attributable to another medical condition
(Criterion B). In most cases the manic or hypomanic picture may appear
during the initial presentation of the medical condition (i.e., within 1
month); however, there are exceptions, especially in chronic medical
conditions that might worsen or relapse and herald the appearance of the
manic or hypomanic picture. Bipolar and related disorder due to another
medical condition would not be diagnosed when the manic or hypomanic
episodes definitely preceded the medical condition, since the proper
diagnosis would be bipolar disorder (except in the unusual circumstance
in which all preceding manic or hypomanic episodes---or, when only one
such episode has occurred, the preceding manic or hypomanic
episode---were associated with ingestion of a

substance/medication). The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due
to another medical condition should not be made during the course of a
delirium (Criterion D). The manic or hypomanic episode in bipolar and
related disorder due to another medical condition must cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion
E).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Etiology (i.e., a causal
relationship to another medical condition based on best clinical
evidence) is the key variable in this etiologically specified form of
bipolar disorder. The listing of medical conditions that are said to be
able to induce mania is never complete, and the clinician's best
judgment is the essence of this diagnosis. Among the best known of the
medical conditions that can cause a bipolar manic or hypomanic condition
are Cushing's disease1, 2, 5, 10 and multiple sclerosis3, 9, as well as
stroke and traumatic brain injuries4, 6, 8, 11.

Development and Course Bipolar and related disorder due to another
medical condition usually has its onset acutely or subacutely within the
first weeks or month of the onset of the associated medical condition.
However, this is not always the case, as a worsening or later relapse of
the associated medical condition may precede the onset of the manic or
hypomanic syndrome. The clinician must make a clinical judgment in these
situations about whether the medical condition is causative, based on
temporal sequence as well as plausibility of a causal relationship.
Finally, the condition may remit before or just after the medical
condition remits, particularly when treatment of the manic/hypomanic
symptoms is effective.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Culture-related differences, to the
extent that there is any evidence, pertain to those associated with the
medical condition (e.g., rates of multiple sclerosis and stroke vary
around the world based on dietary, genetic factors, and other
environmental factors).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Gender differences pertain to those associated with the medical
condition (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus is more common in females;
stroke is somewhat more common in middle-age males compared with
females).

Diagnostic Markers Diagnostic markers pertain to those associated with
the medical condition (e.g., steroid levels in blood or urine to help
corroborate the diagnosis of Cushing's disease, which can be associated
with manic or depressive syndromes; laboratory tests confirming the
diagnosis of multiple sclerosis).

Functional Consequences of Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another
Medical Condition Functional consequences of the bipolar symptoms may
exacerbate impairments associated with the medical condition and may
incur worse outcomes due to interference with medical treatment. In
general, it is believed, but not established, that the illness, when
induced by Cushing's disease, will not recur if the Cushing's disease is
cured or arrested. However, it is also suggested, but not established,
that mood syndromes, including depressive and manic/hypomanic ones, may
be episodic (i.e., recurring) with static brain injuries and other
central nervous system diseases.

Differential Diagnosis Symptoms of delirium, catatonia, and acute
anxiety. It is important to differentiate symptoms of mania from excited
or hypervigilant delirious symptoms; from excited catatonic symptoms;
and from agitation related to acute anxiety states. Medication-induced
depressive or manic symptoms. An important differential diagnostic
observation is that the other medical condition may be treated with
medications (e.g., steroids or alpha-interferon) that can induce
depressive or manic symptoms. In these cases, clinical judgment using
all of the evidence in hand is the best way to try to separate the most
likely and/or the most important of two etiological factors (i.e.,
association with the medical condition vs. a
substance/medication-induced syndrome). The differential diagnosis of
the associated medical conditions is relevant but largely beyond the
scope of the present manual.

Comorbidity Conditions comorbid with bipolar and related disorder due to
another medical condition are those associated with the medical
conditions of etiological relevance. Delirium can occur before or along
with manic symptoms in individuals with Cushing's disease.

Other Specified Bipolar and Related Disorder 296.89 (F31.89) This
category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
bipolar and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The
other specified bipolar and related disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific
bipolar and related disorder. This is done by recording "other specified
bipolar and related disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g.,
"short-duration cyclothymia"). Examples of presentations that can be
specified using the "other specified" designation include the
following: 1. Short-duration hypomanic episodes (2--3 days) and major
depressive episodes: A lifetime history of one or more major depressive
episodes in individuals whose presentation has never met full criteria
for a manic or hypomanic episode but who have experienced two or more
episodes of short-duration hypomania that meet the full symptomatic
criteria for a hypomanic episode but that only last for 2--3 days. The
episodes of hypomanic symptoms do not overlap in time with the major
depressive episodes, so the disturbance does not meet criteria for major
depressive episode, with mixed features. 2. Hypomanic episodes with
insufficient symptoms and major depressive episodes: A lifetime history
of one or more major depressive episodes in individuals whose
presentation has never met full criteria for a manic or hypomanic
episode but who have experienced one or more episodes of hypomania that
do not meet full symptomatic criteria (i.e., at least 4 consecutive days
of elevated mood and one or two of the other symptoms of a hypomanic
episode, or irritable mood and two or three of the other symptoms of a
hypomanic episode). The episodes of hypomanic symptoms do not overlap in
time with the major depressive episodes, so the disturbance

does not meet criteria for major depressive episode, with mixed
features. 3. Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive episode:
One or more hypomanic episodes in an individual whose presentation has
never met full criteria for a major depressive episode or a manic
episode. If this occurs in an individual with an established diagnosis
of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), both diagnoses can be
concurrently applied during the periods when the full criteria for a
hypomanic episode are met. 4. Short-duration cyclothymia (less than 24
months): Multiple episodes of hypomanic symptoms that do not meet
criteria for a hypomanic episode and multiple episodes of depressive
symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode that
persist over a period of less than 24 months (less than 12 months for
children or adolescents) in an individual whose presentation has never
met full criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode
and does not meet criteria for any psychotic disorder. During the course
of the disorder, the hypomanic or depressive symptoms are present for
more days than not, the individual has not been without symptoms for
more than 2 months at a time, and the symptoms cause clinically
significant distress or impairment.

Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder 296.80 (F31.9) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a bipolar
and related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the bipolar and related disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified bipolar and related disorder category is used in situations
in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the
criteria are not met for a specific bipolar and related disorder, and
includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to
make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

Specifiers for Bipolar and Related Disorders Specify if: With anxious
distress: The presence of at least two of the following symptoms during
the majority of days of the current or most recent episode of mania,
hypomania, or depression: 1. Feeling keyed up or tense. 2. Feeling
unusually restless. 3. Difficulty concentrating because of worry. 4.
Fear that something awful may happen. 5. Feeling that the individual
might lose control of himself or herself. Specify current severity:
Mild: Two symptoms. Moderate: Three symptoms. Moderate-severe: Four or
five symptoms. Severe: Four or five symptoms with motor agitation. Note:
Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar
and major depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental
health settings1, 2, 3. High levels of anxiety have been associated with
higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood
of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically useful to
specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious distress
for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment. With
mixed features: The mixed features specifier can apply to the current
manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode in bipolar I or bipolar II
disorder: Manic or hypomanic episode, with mixed features: a. Full
criteria are met for a manic episode or hypomanic episode, and at least
three of the following symptoms are present during the majority of days
of the current or most recent episode of mania or hypomania: 1.
Prominent dysphoria or depressed mood as indicated by either subjective
report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g.,
appears tearful).

2. Diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities (as
indicated by either subjective account or observation made by others).
3. Psychomotor retardation nearly every day (observable by others; not
merely subjective feelings of being slowed down). 4. Fatigue or loss of
energy. 5. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
(not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick). 6. Recurrent
thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation
without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for
committing suicide. b. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and
represent a change from the person's usual behavior. c. For individuals
whose symptoms meet full episode criteria for both mania and depression
simultaneously, the diagnosis should be manic episode, with mixed
features, due to the marked impairment and clinical severity of full
mania. d. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological
effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other
treatment). Depressive episode, with mixed features: a. Full criteria
are met for a major depressive episode, and at least three of the
following manic/hypomanic symptoms are present during the majority of
days of the current or most recent episode of depression: 1. Elevated,
expansive mood. 2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 3. More
talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or
subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5. Increase in energy or
goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or
sexually). 6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have
a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in

unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business
investments). 7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite
sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia). b. Mixed
symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the
person's usual behavior. c. For individuals whose symptoms meet full
episode criteria for both mania and depression simultaneously, the
diagnosis should be manic episode, with mixed features. d. The mixed
symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment). Note:
Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been
found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I
or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it is clinically useful to note the
presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of
response to treatment. With rapid cycling (can be applied to bipolar I
or bipolar II disorder): Presence of at least four mood episodes in the
previous 12 months that meet the criteria for manic, hypomanic, or major
depressive episode. Note: Episodes are demarcated by either partial or
full remissions of at least 2 months or a switch to an episode of the
opposite polarity (e.g., major depressive episode to manic episode).
Note: The essential feature of a rapid-cycling bipolar disorder is the
occurrence of at least four mood episodes during the previous 12 months.
These episodes can occur in any combination and order. The episodes must
meet both the duration and symptom number criteria for a major
depressive, manic, or hypomanic episode and must be demarcated by either
a period of full remission or a switch to an episode of the opposite
polarity. Manic and hypomanic episodes are counted as being on the same
pole. Except for the fact that they occur more frequently, the episodes
that occur in a rapid-cycling pattern are no different from those that
occur in a non-rapid-cycling pattern. Mood episodes that count toward
defining a rapid-cycling pattern exclude those episodes directly caused
by a substance (e.g., cocaine, corticosteroids) or another medical
condition.

With melancholic features: a. One of the following is present during the
most severe period of the current episode: 1. Loss of pleasure in all,
or almost all, activities. 2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable
stimuli (does not feel much better, even temporarily, when something
good happens). b. Three (or more) of the following: 1. A distinct
quality of depressed mood characterized by profound despondency,
despair, and/or moroseness or by so-called empty mood. 2. Depression
that is regularly worse in the morning. 3. Early-morning awakening
(i.e., at least 2 hours before usual awakening). 4. Marked psychomotor
agitation or retardation. 5. Significant anorexia or weight loss. 6.
Excessive or inappropriate guilt. Note: The specifier "with melancholic
features" is applied if these features are present at the most severe
stage of the episode. There is a near-complete absence of the capacity
for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the
lack of reactivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not
associated with marked brightening of mood. Either mood does not
brighten at all, or it brightens only partially (e.g., up to 20%--40% of
normal for only minutes at a time). The "distinct quality" of mood that
is characteristic of the "with melancholic features" specifier is
experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic
depressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more
severe, longer lasting, or present without a reason is not considered
distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always present and
are observable by others. Melancholic features exhibit only a modest
tendency to repeat across episodes in the same individual. They are more
frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are less likely to
occur in

milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and are more
likely to occur in those with psychotic features. With atypical
features: This specifier can be applied when these features predominate
during the majority of days of the current or most recent major
depressive episode. a. Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response
to actual or potential positive events). b. Two (or more) of the
following features: 1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.
2. Hypersomnia. 3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in
arms or legs). 4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection
sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results
in significant social or occupational impairment. c. Criteria are not
met for "with melancholic features" or "with catatonia" during the same
episode. Note: "Atypical depression" has historical significance (i.e.,
atypical in contradistinction to the more classical agitated,
"endogenous" presentations of depression that were the norm when
depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and almost never in
adolescents or younger adults) and today does not connote an uncommon or
unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply. Mood reactivity
is the capacity to be cheered up when presented with positive events
(e.g., a visit from children, compliments from others). Mood may become
euthymic (not sad) even for extended periods of time if the external
circumstances remain favorable. Increased appetite may be manifested by
an obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may
include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or daytime napping
that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at least 2 hours more
than when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is defined as feeling heavy,
leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is
generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many
hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical features, pathological

sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection is a trait that has an
early onset and persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection
sensitivity occurs both when the person is and is not depressed, though
it may be exacerbated during depressive periods. With psychotic
features: Delusions or hallucinations are present at any time in the
episode. If psychotic features are present, specify if moodcongruent or
mood-incongruent: With mood-congruent psychotic features: During manic
episodes, the content of all delusions and hallucinations is consistent
with the typical manic themes of grandiosity, invulnerability, etc., but
may also include themes of suspiciousness or paranoia, especially with
respect to others' doubts about the individual's capacities,
accomplishments, and so forth. With mood-incongruent psychotic features:
The content of delusions and hallucinations is inconsistent with the
episode polarity themes as described above, or the content is a mixture
of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes. With catatonia: This
specifier can apply to an episode of mania or depression if catatonic
features are present during most of the episode. See criteria for
catatonia associated with a mental disorder in the chapter
"Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders." With peripartum
onset: This specifier can be applied to the current or, if the full
criteria are not currently met for a mood episode, most recent episode
of mania, hypomania, or major depression in bipolar I or bipolar II
disorder if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in the 4
weeks following delivery. Note: Mood episodes can have their onset
either during pregnancy or postpartum. Although the estimates differ
according to the period of follow-up after delivery, between 3% and 6%
of women will experience the onset of a major depressive episode during
pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery4. Fifty percent
of "postpartum" major depressive episodes actually begin prior to
delivery9. Thus, these episodes are referred to collectively as
peripartum episodes. Women with peripartum major depressive episodes
often have severe anxiety and even panic attacks5. Prospective studies
have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy, as
well as the "baby blues," increase the risk for a postpartum major
depressive episode7.

Peripartum-onset mood episodes can present either with or without
psychotic features. Infanticide is most often associated with postpartum
psychotic episodes that are characterized by command hallucinations to
kill the infant or delusions that the infant is possessed, but psychotic
symptoms can also occur in severe postpartum mood episodes without such
specific delusions or hallucinations. Postpartum mood (major depressive
or manic) episodes with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in
500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common in primiparous
women8. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is
particularly increased for women with prior postpartum mood episodes but
is also elevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or
bipolar disorder (especially bipolar I disorder) and those with a family
history of bipolar disorders. Once a woman has had a postpartum episode
with psychotic features, the risk of recurrence with each subsequent
delivery is between 30% and 50%6. Postpartum episodes must be
differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period, which
is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention. The
postpartum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine
alterations and psychosocial adjustments, the potential impact of
breast-feeding on treatment planning, and the long-term implications of
a history of postpartum mood disorder on subsequent family planning.
With seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to the lifetime pattern of
mood episodes. The essential feature is a regular seasonal pattern of at
least one type of episode (i.e., mania, hypomania, or depression). The
other types of episodes may not follow this pattern. For example, an
individual may have seasonal manias, but his or her depressions do not
regularly occur at a specific time of year. a. There has been a regular
temporal relationship between the onset of manic, hypomanic, or major
depressive episodes and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the fall
or winter) in bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Note: Do not include
cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related
psychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed every winter).

b. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or
hypomania or vice versa) also occur at a characteristic time of the year
(e.g., depression disappears in the spring). c. In the last 2 years, the
individual's manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episodes have
demonstrated a temporal seasonal relationship, as defined above, and no
non-seasonal episodes of that polarity have occurred during that 2-year
period. d. Seasonal manias, hypomanias, or depressions (as described
above) substantially outnumber any nonseasonal manias, hypomanias, or
depressions that may have occurred over the individual's lifetime. Note:
This specifier can be applied to the pattern of major depressive
episodes in bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or major depressive
disorder, recurrent. The essential feature is the onset and remission of
major depressive episodes at characteristic times of the year. In most
cases, the episodes begin in fall or winter and remit in spring. Less
commonly, there may be recurrent summer depressive episodes. This
pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during at
least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during
this period. In addition, the seasonal depressive episodes must
substantially outnumber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over the
individual's lifetime. This specifier does not apply to those situations
in which the pattern is better explained by seasonally linked
psychosocial stressors (e.g., seasonal unemployment or school schedule).
Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often
characterized by loss of energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain,
and a craving for carbohydrates. It is unclear whether a seasonal
pattern is more likely in recurrent major depressive disorder or in
bipolar disorders. However, within the bipolar disorders group, a
seasonal pattern appears to be more likely in bipolar II disorder than
in bipolar I disorder. In some individuals, the onset of manic or
hypomanic episodes may also be linked to a particular season. The
prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern appears to vary with
latitude, age, and sex. Prevalence increases with higher latitudes. Age
is also a strong predictor of seasonality, with younger persons at
higher risk for winter depressive episodes.

Specify if: In partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous
manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode are present but full
criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months
without any significant symptoms of a manic, hypomanic, or major
depressive episode following the end of such an episode. In full
remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of
the disturbance were present. Specify current severity of manic episode:
Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of
those symptoms, and the degree of functional disability. Mild: Minimum
symptom criteria are met for a manic episode. Moderate: Extreme increase
in activity or impairment in judgment. Severe: Almost continual
supervision is required in order to prevent physical harm to self or
others. Specify current severity of major depressive episode: Severity
is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those
symptoms, and the degree of functional disability. Mild: Few, if any,
symptoms in excess of those required to meet the diagnostic criteria are
present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable,
and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational
functioning. Moderate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms,
and/or functional impairment are between those specified for "mild" and
"severe." Severe: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of
those required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is
seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symptoms markedly
interfere with social and occupational functioning.

1 In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is
useful to consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of
emptiness and loss, while in an MDE it is persistent depressed mood and
the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure. The dysphoria in
grief is likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs
in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These waves tend to be
associated with thoughts or

reminders of the deceased. The depressed mood of an MDE is more
persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations. The pain
of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are
uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic
of an MDE. The thought content associated with grief generally features
a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than
the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in an MDE. In grief,
selfesteem is generally preserved, whereas in an MDE, feelings of
worthlessness and self-loathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation
is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis
the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the
deceased how much he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks
about death and dying, such thoughts are generally focused on the
deceased and possibly about "joining" the deceased, whereas in an MDE
such thoughts are focused on ending one's own life because of feeling
worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of
depression. 2 In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode

Depressive Disorders Depressive disorders include disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder, major depressive disorder (including major
depressive episode), persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia),
premenstrual dysphoric disorder, substance/medication-induced depressive
disorder, depressive disorder due to another medical condition, other
specified depressive disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder.
Unlike in DSM-IV, this chapter "Depressive Disorders" has been separated
from the previous chapter "Bipolar and Related Disorders." The common
feature of all of these disorders is the presence of sad, empty, or
irritable mood, accompanied by somatic and cognitive changes that
significantly affect the individual's capacity to function. What differs
among them are issues of duration, timing, or presumed etiology. In
order to address concerns about the potential for the overdiagnosis of
and treatment for bipolar disorder in children, a new diagnosis,
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, referring to the presentation of
children with persistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme
behavioral dyscontrol, is added to the depressive disorders for children
up to 12 years of age. Its placement in this chapter reflects the
finding that children with this symptom pattern typically develop
unipolar depressive disorders or anxiety disorders, rather than bipolar
disorders, as they mature into adolescence and adulthood. Major
depressive disorder represents the classic condition in this group of
disorders. It is characterized by discrete episodes of at least 2 weeks'
duration (although most episodes last considerably longer) involving
clearcut changes in affect, cognition, and neurovegetative functions and
interepisode remissions. A diagnosis based on a single episode is
possible, although the disorder is a recurrent one in the majority of
cases. Careful consideration is given to the delineation of normal
sadness and grief from a major depressive episode. Bereavement may
induce great suffering, but it does not typically induce an episode of
major depressive disorder. When they do occur together, the depressive
symptoms and functional impairment

tend to be more severe and the prognosis is worse compared with
bereavement that is not accompanied by major depressive disorder.
Bereavement-related depression tends to occur in persons with other
vulnerabilities to depressive disorders, and recovery may be facilitated
by antidepressant treatment. A more chronic form of depression,
persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), can be diagnosed when the
mood disturbance continues for at least 2 years in adults or 1 year in
children. This diagnosis, new in DSM-5, includes both the DSM-IV
diagnostic categories of chronic major depression and dysthymia. After
careful scientific review of the evidence, premenstrual dysphoric
disorder has been moved from an appendix of DSM-IV ("Criteria Sets and
Axes Provided for Further Study") to Section II of DSM-5. Almost 20
years of additional research on this condition has confirmed a specific
and treatment-responsive form of depressive disorder that begins
sometime following ovulation and remits within a few days of menses and
has a marked impact on functioning. A large number of substances of
abuse, some prescribed medications, and several medical conditions can
be associated with depression-like phenomena. This fact is recognized in
the diagnoses of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder and
depressive disorder due to another medical condition.

Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

296.99 (F34.8)

a.  Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g., verbal
    rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g., physical aggression toward people
    or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or
    duration to the situation or provocation.
b.  The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level.
c.  The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per
    week.
d.  The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry
    most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others
    (e.g.,

parents, teachers, peers). e. Criteria A--D have been present for 12 or
more months. Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period
lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all of the symptoms in
Criteria A--D. f. Criteria A and D are present in at least two of three
settings (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at
least one of these. g. The diagnosis should not be made for the first
time before age 6 years or after age 18 years. h. By history or
observation, the age at onset of Criteria A--E is before 10 years. i.
There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during
which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or
hypomanic episode have been met. Note: Developmentally appropriate mood
elevation, such as occurs in the context of a highly positive event or
its anticipation, should not be considered as a symptom of mania or
hypomania. j. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode
of major depressive disorder and are not better explained by another
mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, posttraumatic stress
disorder, separation anxiety disorder, persistent depressive disorder
\[dysthymia\]). Note: This diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional
defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder,
though it can coexist with others, including major depressive disorder,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and
substance use disorders. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for
both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant
disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder. If an individual has ever experienced a manic or
hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder should not be assigned. k. The symptoms are not attributable to
the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or
neurological condition.

Diagnostic Features The core feature of disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder is chronic, severe persistent irritability. This severe
irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations, the first of
which is frequent temper outbursts. These outbursts typically occur in
response to frustration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in
the form of aggression against property, self, or others). They must
occur frequently (i.e., on average, three or more times per week)
(Criterion C) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria E
and F), such as in the home and at school, and they must be
developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B). The second manifestation of
severe irritability consists of chronic, persistently irritable or angry
mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable
or angry mood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of
the day, nearly every day, and noticeable by others in the child's
environment (Criterion D). The clinical presentation of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder must be carefully distinguished from
presentations of other, related conditions, particularly pediatric
bipolar disorder. In fact, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was
added to DSM-5 to address the considerable concern about the appropriate
classification and treatment of children who present with chronic,
persistent irritability relative to children who present with classic
(i.e., episodic) bipolar disorder. Some researchers view severe,
non-episodic irritability as characteristic of bipolar disorder in
children, although both DSM-IV and DSM-5 require that both children and
adults have distinct episodes of mania or hypomania to qualify for the
diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. During the latter decades of the 20th
century, this contention by researchers that severe, nonepisodic
irritability is a manifestation of pediatric mania coincided with an
upsurge in the rates at which clinicians assigned the diagnosis of
bipolar disorder to their pediatric patients. This sharp increase in
rates appears to be attributable to clinicians combining at least two
clinical presentations into a single category. That is, both classic,
episodic presentations of mania and non-episodic presentations of severe
irritability have been labeled as bipolar disorder in children1, 10. In
DSM-5, the term bipolar disorder is explicitly reserved for episodic
presentations of bipolar symptoms. DSM-IV did not include a diagnosis
designed to capture youths whose hallmark symptoms

consisted of very severe, non-episodic irritability, whereas DSM-5, with
the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, provides a
distinct category for such presentations.

Prevalence Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among
children presenting to pediatric mental health clinics. Prevalence
estimates of the disorder in the community are unclear. Based on rates
of chronic and severe persistent irritability, which is the core feature
of the disorder, the overall 6month to 1-year period-prevalence of
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder among children and adolescents
probably falls in the 2%--5% range2. However, rates are expected to be
higher in males and school-age children than in females and adolescents.

Development and Course The onset of disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder must be before age 10 years, and the diagnosis should not be
applied to children with a developmental age of less than 6 years. It is
unknown whether the condition presents only in this age-delimited
fashion. Because the symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
are likely to change as children mature, use of the diagnosis should be
restricted to age groups similar to those in which validity has been
established (6--18 years). Approximately half of children with severe,
chronic irritability will have a presentation that continues to meet
criteria for the condition 1 year later2. Rates of conversion from
severe, nonepisodic irritability to bipolar disorder are very low15, 16.
Instead, children with chronic irritability are at risk to develop
unipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood. Age-related
variations also differentiate classic bipolar disorder and disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder. Rates of bipolar disorder generally are
very low prior to adolescence (\<1%), with a steady increase into early
adulthood (1%--2% prevalence)5. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
is more common than bipolar disorder prior to adolescence, and symptoms
of the condition generally become less common as children transition
into adulthood2.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental. Children with chronic irritability typically exhibit
complicated psychiatric histories. In such children, a relatively
extensive history of chronic irritability is common, typically
manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such
prediagnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of
oppositional defiant disorder. Many children with disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder have symptoms that also meet criteria for
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and for an anxiety
disorder, with such diagnoses often being present from a relatively
early age9. For some children, the criteria for major depressive
disorder may also be met. Genetic and physiological. In terms of
familial aggregation and genetics, it has been suggested that children
presenting with chronic, non-episodic irritability can be differentiated
from children with bipolar disorder in their family-based risk. However,
these two groups do not differ in familial rates of anxiety disorders,
unipolar depressive disorders, or substance abuse3. Compared with
children with pediatric bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses,
those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both
commonalities and differences in information-processing deficits. For
example, face-emotion labeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision
making and cognitive control, are present in children with bipolar
disorder and chronically irritable children, as well as in children with
some other psychiatric conditions6, 8, 13. There is also evidence for
disorder-specific dysfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention
deployment in response to emotional stimuli, which has demonstrated
unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic irritability4, 12,
14.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Children presenting to clinics with
features of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are predominantly
male9. Among community samples, a male preponderance appears to be
supported2. This difference in prevalence between males and females
differentiates disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar
disorder, in which there is an equal gender prevalence.

Suicide Risk

In general, evidence documenting suicidal behavior and aggression, as
well as other severe functional consequences, in disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder should be noted when evaluating children with
chronic irritability.

Functional Consequences of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder
Chronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder, is associated with marked disruption in a
child's family and peer relationships, as well as in school performance.
Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children
generally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to
participate in the activities typically enjoyed by healthy children;
their family life is severely disrupted by their outbursts and
irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining
friendships. Levels of dysfunction in children with bipolar disorder and
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are generally comparable. Both
conditions cause severe disruption in the lives of the affected
individual and their families. In both disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder and pediatric bipolar disorder, dangerous behavior, suicidal
ideation or suicide attempts, severe aggression, and psychiatric
hospitalization are common.

Differential Diagnosis Because chronically irritable children and
adolescents typically present with complex histories, the diagnosis of
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be made while considering
the presence or absence of multiple other conditions. Despite the need
to consider many other syndromes, differentiation of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder and oppositional defiant
disorder requires particularly careful assessment. Bipolar disorders.
The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder and bipolar disorders in children involves the longitudinal
course of the core symptoms. In children, as in adults, bipolar I
disorder and bipolar II disorder manifest as an episodic illness with
discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from
the child's typical presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs
during a manic episode is distinctly different from the child's usual
mood. In addition, during a manic episode, the change in mood must be
accompanied by the

onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical
symptoms (e.g., distractibility, increased goal-directed activity),
which are also present to a degree that is distinctly different from the
child's usual baseline. Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents
(and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to
identify a distinct time period during which the child's mood and
behavior were markedly different from usual. In contrast, the
irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent and
is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain
degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child with
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, while bipolar disorders
are episodic conditions, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is not.
In fact, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot
be assigned to a child who has ever experienced a full-duration
hypomanic or manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who has ever had a
manic or hypomanic episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central
differentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and
grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of mania but are not
characteristic of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Oppositional
defiant disorder. While symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder
typically do occur in children with disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder, mood symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are
relatively rare in children with oppositional defiant disorder. The key
features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional
defiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent
outbursts and a persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. In
addition, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
requires severe impairment in at least one setting (i.e., home, school,
or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. For
this reason, while most children whose symptoms meet criteria for
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will also have a presentation
that meets criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, the reverse is
not the case. That is, in only approximately 15% of individuals with
oppositional defiant disorder would criteria for disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder be met. Moreover, even for children in whom
criteria for both disorders are met, only the diagnosis of disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Finally, both the

prominent mood symptoms in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and
the high risk for depressive and anxiety disorders in follow-up studies
justify placement of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder among the
depressive disorders in DSM-5. (Oppositional defiant disorder is
included in the chapter "Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct
Disorders.") This reflects the more prominent mood component among
individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, as compared
with individuals with oppositional defiant disorder. Nevertheless, it
also should be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder appears
to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood problems.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder,
anxiety disorders, and autism spectrum disorder. Unlike children
diagnosed with bipolar disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, a
child whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive
disorder, and/or anxiety disorder. However, children whose irritability
is present only in the context of a major depressive episode or
persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) should receive one of those
diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Children
with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder may have symptoms that also
meet criteria for an anxiety disorder and can receive both diagnoses,
but children whose irritability is manifest only in the context of
exacerbation of an anxiety disorder should receive the relevant anxiety
disorder diagnosis rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.
In addition, children with autism spectrum disorders frequently present
with temper outbursts when, for example, their routines are disturbed.
In that instance, the temper outbursts would be considered secondary to
the autism spectrum disorder, and the child should not receive the
diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Intermittent
explosive disorder. Children with symptoms suggestive of intermittent
explosive disorder present with instances of severe temper outbursts,
much like children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. However,
unlike disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive
disorder does not require persistent disruption in mood between
outbursts. In addition, intermittent explosive disorder requires only 3
months of active symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for

disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, these two diagnoses should
not be made in the same child. For children with outbursts and
intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder should be made.

Comorbidity Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder are extremely high9. It is rare to find individuals whose
symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder alone.
Comorbidity between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and other
DSM-defined syndromes appears higher than for many other pediatric
mental illnesses; the strongest overlap is with oppositional defiant
disorder. Not only is the overall rate of comorbidity high in disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder, but also the range of comorbid illnesses
appears particularly diverse. These children typically present to the
clinic with a wide range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even
autism spectrum symptoms and diagnoses7, 11, 16. However, children with
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not have symptoms that
meet criteria for bipolar disorder, as in that context, only the bipolar
disorder diagnosis should be made. If children have symptoms that meet
criteria for oppositional defiant disorder or intermittent explosive
disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis
of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be assigned. Also, as
noted earlier, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxietyprovoking
context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or
obsessive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a
major depressive episode.

Major Depressive Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. Five (or more) of the
following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and
represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the
symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or
pleasure. Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to
another medical condition. 1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly
every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad,
empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful).
(Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.) 2. Markedly
diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most
of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account
or observation). 3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight
gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or
decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children,
consider failure to make expected weight gain.) 4. Insomnia or
hypersomnia nearly every day. 5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation
nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings
of restlessness or being slowed down).

6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 7. Feelings of
worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be
delusional) nearly every day (not merely selfreproach or guilt about
being sick). 8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or
indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as
observed by others). 9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of
dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a
suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. b. The
symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning. c. The episode is
not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another
medical condition. Note: Criteria A--C represent a major depressive
episode. Note: Responses to a significant loss (e.g., bereavement,
financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical
illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness,
rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss
noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. Although
such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the
loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the
normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully
considered. This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical
judgment based on the individual's history and the cultural norms for
the expression of distress in the context of loss.1 d. The occurrence of
the major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective
disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder,
or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other
psychotic disorders. e. There has never been a manic episode or a
hypomanic episode. Note: This exclusion does not apply if all of the
manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are
attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition.

Coding and Recording Procedures The diagnostic code for major depressive
disorder is based on whether this is a single or recurrent episode,
current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission status.
Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full
criteria are currently met for a major depressive episode. Remission
specifiers are only indicated if the full criteria are not currently met
for a major depressive episode. Codes are as follows: Severity/course
specifier

Single episode Recurrent episode\*

Mild (p. 188)

296.21 (F32.0) 296.31 (F33.0)

Moderate (p. 188)

296.22 (F32.1) 296.32 (F33.1)

Severe (p. 188)

296.23 (F32.2) 296.33 (F33.2)

With psychotic features\*\* (p. 186) 296.24 (F32.3) 296.34 (F33.3) In
partial remission (p. 188)

296.25 (F32.4) 296.35 (F33.41)

In full remission (p. 188)

296.26 (F32.5) 296.36 (F33.42)

Unspecified

296.20 (F32.9) 296.30 (F33.9)

\*For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval
of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which
criteria are not met for a major depressive episode. The definitions of
specifiers are found on the indicated pages. \*\*If psychotic features
are present, code the "with psychotic features" specifier irrespective
of episode severity. In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should
be listed in the following order: major depressive disorder, single or
recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by
as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the
current episode. Specify: With anxious distress (p. 184) With mixed
features (pp. 184--185) With melancholic features (p. 185) With atypical
features (pp. 185--186) With mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 186)
With mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 186)

With catatonia (p. 186). Coding note: Use additional code 293.89
(F06.1). With peripartum onset (pp. 186--187) With seasonal pattern
(recurrent episode only) (pp. 187--188)

Diagnostic Features The criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder
must be present nearly every day to be considered present, with the
exception of weight change and suicidal ideation. Depressed mood must be
present for most of the day, in addition to being present nearly every
day. Often insomnia or fatigue is the presenting complaint, and failure
to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms will result in
underdiagnosis. Sadness may be denied at first but may be elicited
through interview or inferred from facial expression and demeanor. With
individuals who focus on a somatic complaint, clinicians should
determine whether the distress from that complaint is associated with
specific depressive symptoms. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present
in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor disturbances are much less
common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is the
presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt. The essential feature
of a major depressive episode is a period of at least 2 weeks during
which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure
in nearly all activities (Criterion A). In children and adolescents, the
mood may be irritable rather than sad. The individual must also
experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list that
includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity;
decreased energy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty
thinking, concentrating, or making decisions; or recurrent thoughts of
death or suicidal ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To count toward
a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or
must have clearly worsened compared with the person's pre-episode
status. The symptoms must persist for most of the day, nearly every day,
for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The episode must be accompanied by
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with
milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal but requires
markedly increased effort.

The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person
as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or "down in the dumps"
(Criterion A1). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may
subsequently be elicited by interview (e.g., by pointing out that the
individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals
who complain of feeling "blah," having no feelings, or feeling anxious,
the presence of a depressed mood can be inferred from the person's
facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals emphasize somatic
complaints (e.g., bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings
of sadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability
(e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry
outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over
minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood
may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should
be differentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated. Loss
of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some
degree. Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, "not
caring anymore," or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were
previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family members often
notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e.g., a
formerly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer
finds excuses not to practice). In some individuals, there is a
significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire.
Appetite change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some
depressed individuals report that they have to force themselves to eat.
Others may eat more and may crave specific foods (e.g., sweets or other
carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in either direction),
there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a
failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3). Sleep
disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping
excessively (Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it typically takes
the form of middle insomnia (i.e., waking up during the night and then
having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i.e., waking
too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial insomnia (i.e.,
difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with
oversleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at
night or increased daytime sleep. Sometimes the reason that the
individual seeks treatment is for the disturbed sleep.

Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still,
pacing, hand-wringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or
other objects) or retardation (e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body
movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased
in volume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or muteness)
(Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe
enough to be observable by others and not represent merely subjective
feelings. Decreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion
A6). A person may report sustained fatigue without physical exertion.
Even the smallest tasks seem to require substantial effort. The
efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For
example, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the
morning are exhausting and take twice as long as usual. The sense of
worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may
include unrealistic negative evaluations of one's worth or guilty
preoccupations or ruminations over minor past failings (Criterion A7).
Such individuals often misinterpret neutral or trivial day-to-day events
as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense of
responsibility for untoward events. The sense of worthlessness or guilt
may be of delusional proportions (e.g., an individual who is convinced
that he or she is personally responsible for world poverty). Blaming
oneself for being sick and for failing to meet occupational or
interpersonal responsibilities as a result of the depression is very
common and, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to meet this
criterion. Many individuals report impaired ability to think,
concentrate, or make even minor decisions (Criterion A8). They may
appear easily distracted or complain of memory difficulties. Those
engaged in cognitively demanding pursuits are often unable to function.
In children, a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor
concentration. In elderly individuals, memory difficulties may be the
chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs of a dementia
("pseudodementia"). When the major depressive episode is successfully
treated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some
individuals, particularly elderly persons, a major depressive episode
may sometimes be the initial presentation of an irreversible dementia.
Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9)
are common. They may range from a passive wish not to awaken in the
morning or a belief that others would be better off if the individual
were

dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of committing suicide, to a
specific suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals may have put
their affairs in order (e.g., updated wills, settled debts), acquired
needed materials (e.g., a rope or a gun), and chosen a location and time
to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for suicide may include a desire
to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles, an intense
wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful
emotional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the
wish to not be a burden to others. The resolution of such thinking may
be a more meaningful measure of diminished suicide risk than denial of
further plans for suicide. The evaluation of the symptoms of a major
depressive episode is especially difficult when they occur in an
individual who also has a general medical condition (e.g., cancer,
stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, pregnancy). Some of the
criterion signs and symptoms of a major depressive episode are identical
to those of general medical conditions (e.g., weight loss with untreated
diabetes; fatigue with cancer; hypersomnia early in pregnancy; insomnia
later in pregnancy or the postpartum). Such symptoms count toward a
major depressive diagnosis except when they are clearly and fully
attributable to a general medical condition. Nonvegetative symptoms of
dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or worthlessness, impaired concentration or
indecision, and suicidal thoughts should be assessed with particular
care in such cases. Definitions of major depressive episodes that have
been modified to include only these nonvegetative symptoms appear to
identify nearly the same individuals as do the full criteria30.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Major depressive disorder is
associated with high mortality, much of which is accounted for by
suicide; however, it is not the only cause. For example, depressed
individuals admitted to nursing homes have a markedly increased
likelihood of death in the first year. Individuals frequently present
with tearfulness, irritability, brooding, obsessive rumination, anxiety,
phobias, excessive worry over physical health, and complaints of pain
(e.g., headaches; joint, abdominal, or other pains). In children,
separation anxiety may occur. Although an extensive literature exists
describing neuroanatomical, neuroendocrinological, and
neurophysiological correlates of major depressive disorder, no
laboratory test has yielded results of sufficient

sensitivity and specificity to be used as a diagnostic tool for this
disorder. Until recently, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
hyperactivity had been the most extensively investigated abnormality
associated with major depressive episodes, and it appears to be
associated with melancholia, psychotic features, and risks for eventual
suicide10, 26. Molecular studies have also implicated peripheral
factors, including genetic variants in neurotrophic factors and
pro-inflammatory cytokines12. Additionally, functional magnetic
resonance imaging studies provide evidence for functional abnormalities
in specific neural systems supporting emotion processing, reward
seeking, and emotion regulation in adults with major depression21.

Prevalence Twelve-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the
United States is approximately 7%, with marked differences by age group
such that the prevalence in 18- to 29-year-old individuals is threefold
higher than the prevalence in individuals age 60 years or older19.
Females experience 1.5to 3-fold higher rates than males beginning in
early adolescence19.

Development and Course Major depressive disorder may first appear at any
age, but the likelihood of onset increases markedly with puberty. In the
United States, incidence appears to peak in the 20s; however, first
onset in late life is not uncommon19. The course of major depressive
disorder is quite variable, such that some individuals rarely, if ever,
experience remission (a period of 2 or more months with no symptoms, or
only one or two symptoms to no more than a mild degree), while others
experience many years with few or no symptoms between discrete episodes.
It is important to distinguish individuals who present for treatment
during an exacerbation of a chronic depressive illness from those whose
symptoms developed recently. Chronicity of depressive symptoms
substantially increases the likelihood of underlying personality,
anxiety, and substance use disorders and decreases the likelihood that
treatment will be followed by full symptom resolution6, 20. It is
therefore useful to ask individuals presenting with depressive symptoms
to identify

the last period of at least 2 months during which they were entirely
free of depressive symptoms. Recovery typically begins within 3 months
of onset for two in five individuals with major depression and within 1
year for four in five individuals8. Recency of onset is a strong
determinant of the likelihood of near-term recovery, and many
individuals who have been depressed only for several months can be
expected to recover spontaneously. Features associated with lower
recovery rates, other than current episode duration, include psychotic
features9, prominent anxiety5, personality disorders15, and symptom
severity28. The risk of recurrence becomes progessively lower over time
as the duration of remission increases25. The risk is higher in
individuals whose preceding episode was severe7, in younger
individuals7, and in individuals who have already experienced multiple
episodes13. The persistence of even mild depressive symptoms during
remission is a powerful predictor of recurrence24. Many bipolar
illnesses begin with one or more depressive episodes, and a substantial
proportion of individuals who initially appear to have major depressive
disorder will prove, in time, to instead have a bipolar disorder. This
is more likely in individuals with onset of the illness in adolescence,
those with psychotic features, and those with a family history of
bipolar illness14, 31. The presence of a "with mixed features" specifier
also increases the risk for future manic or hypomanic diagnosis. Major
depressive disorder, particularly with psychotic features, may also
transition into schizophrenia, a change that is much more frequent than
the reverse3. Despite consistent differences between genders in
prevalence rates for depressive disorders, there appear to be no clear
differences by gender in phenomenology, course, or treatment response.
Similarly, there are no clear effects of current age on the course or
treatment response of major depressive disorder. Some symptom
differences exist, though, such that hypersomnia and hyperphagia are
more likely in younger individuals, and melancholic symptoms,
particularly psychomotor disturbances, are more common in older
individuals2. The likelihood of suicide attempts lessens in middle and
late life, although the risk of completed suicide does not11.
Depressions with earlier ages at onset are more familial and more likely
to involve personality disturbances. The course of major depressive
disorder

within individuals does not generally change with aging. Mean times to
recovery appear to be stable over long periods25, and the likelihood of
being in an episode does not generally increase or decrease with time11.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Neuroticism (negative
affectivity) is a well-established risk factor for the onset of major
depressive disorder, and high levels appear to render individuals more
likely to develop depressive episodes in response to stressful life
events17. Environmental. Adverse childhood experiences, particularly
when there are multiple experiences of diverse types, constitute a set
of potent risk factors for major depressive disorder4. Stressful life
events are well recognized as precipitants of major depressive episodes,
but the presence or absence of adverse life events near the onset of
episodes does not appear to provide a useful guide to prognosis or
treatment selection. Genetic and physiological. First-degree family
members of individuals with major depressive disorder have a risk for
major depressive disorder two- to fourfold higher than that of the
general population27. Relative risks appear to be higher for early-onset
and recurrent forms27. Heritability is approximately 40%, and the
personality trait neuroticism accounts for a substantial portion of this
genetic liability18. Course modifiers. Essentially all major nonmood
disorders increase the risk of an individual developing depression.
Major depressive episodes that develop against the background of another
disorder often follow a more refractory course. Substance use, anxiety,
and borderline personality disorders are among the most common of these,
and the presenting depressive symptoms may obscure and delay their
recognition. However, sustained clinical improvement in depressive
symptoms may depend on the appropriate treatment of underlying
illnesses. Chronic or disabling medical conditions also increase risks
for major depressive episodes. Such prevalent illnesses as diabetes,
morbid obesity, and cardiovascular disease are often complicated by
depressive episodes, and these episodes are more likely to become
chronic than are depressive episodes in medically healthy individuals.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Surveys of major depressive disorder
across diverse cultures have shown sevenfold differences in 12-month
prevalence rates but much more consistency in female-to-male ratio, mean
ages at onset, and the degree to which presence of the disorder raises
the likelihood of comorbid substance abuse29. While these findings
suggest substantial cultural differences in the expression of major
depressive disorder, they do not permit simple linkages between
particular cultures and the likelihood of specific symptoms. Rather,
clinicians should be aware that in most countries the majority of cases
of depression go unrecognized in primary care settings1 and that in many
cultures, somatic symptoms are very likely to constitute the presenting
complaint. Among the Criterion A symptoms, insomnia and loss of energy
are the most uniformly reported.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Although the most reproducible finding
in the epidemiology of major depressive disorder has been a higher
prevalence in females, there are no clear differences between genders in
symptoms, course, treatment response, or functional consequences. In
women, the risk for suicide attempts is higher, and the risk for suicide
completion is lower. The disparity in suicide rate by gender is not as
great among those with depressive disorders as it is in the population
as a whole.

Suicide Risk The possibility of suicidal behavior exists at all times
during major depressive episodes. The most consistently described risk
factor is a past history of suicide attempts or threats23, but it should
be remembered that most completed suicides are not preceded by
unsuccessful attempts16, 22. Other features associated with an increased
risk for completed suicide include male sex, being single or living
alone, and having prominent feelings of hopelessness. The presence of
borderline personality disorder markedly increases risk for future
suicide attempts.

Functional Consequences of Major Depressive Disorder

Many of the functional consequences of major depressive disorder derive
from individual symptoms. Impairment can be very mild, such that many of
those who interact with the affected individual are unaware of
depressive symptoms. Impairment may, however, range to complete
incapacity such that the depressed individual is unable to attend to
basic self-care needs or is mute or catatonic. Among individuals seen in
general medical settings, those with major depressive disorder have more
pain and physical illness and greater decreases in physical, social, and
role functioning.

Differential Diagnosis Manic episodes with irritable mood or mixed
episodes. Major depressive episodes with prominent irritable mood may be
difficult to distinguish from manic episodes with irritable mood or from
mixed episodes. This distinction requires a careful clinical evaluation
of the presence of manic symptoms. Mood disorder due to another medical
condition. A major depressive episode is the appropriate diagnosis if
the mood disturbance is not judged, based on individual history,
physical examination, and laboratory findings, to be the direct
pathophysiological consequence of a specific medical condition (e.g.,
multiple sclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism).
Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder. This
disorder is distinguished from major depressive disorder by the fact
that a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) appears
to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. For example,
depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from
cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced depressive disorder.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Distractibility and low
frustration tolerance can occur in both attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder and a major depressive episode; if the criteria are met for
both, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be diagnosed in
addition to the mood disorder. However, the clinician must be cautious
not to overdiagnose a major depressive episode in children with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder whose disturbance in mood is
characterized by irritability rather than by sadness or loss of
interest. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood. A major depressive
episode that occurs in response to a psychosocial stressor is
distinguished from

adjustment disorder with depressed mood by the fact that the full
criteria for a major depressive episode are not met in adjustment
disorder. Sadness. Finally, periods of sadness are inherent aspects of
the human experience. These periods should not be diagnosed as a major
depressive episode unless criteria are met for severity (i.e., five out
of nine symptoms), duration (i.e., most of the day, nearly every day for
at least 2 weeks), and clinically significant distress or impairment.
The diagnosis other specified depressive disorder may be appropriate for
presentations of depressed mood with clinically significant impairment
that do not meet criteria for duration or severity.

Comorbidity Other disorders with which major depressive disorder
frequently co-occurs are substance-related disorders, panic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and
borderline personality disorder.

Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) Diagnostic Criteria

300.4 (F34.1)

This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic major
depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. a. Depressed mood for most
of the day, for more days than not, as indicated by either subjective
account or observation by others, for at least 2 years. Note: In
children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and duration must be at
least 1 year. b. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the
following: 1. Poor appetite or overeating. 2. Insomnia or hypersomnia.
3. Low energy or fatigue. 4. Low self-esteem. 5. Poor concentration or
difficulty making decisions. 6. Feelings of hopelessness. c. During the
2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents) of the disturbance,
the individual has never been without the symptoms in Criteria A and B
for more than 2 months at a time.

d. Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously present
for 2 years. e. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic
episode, and criteria have never been met for cyclothymic disorder.
f. The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent
schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other
specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorder. g. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological
effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another
medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism). h. The symptoms cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning. Note: Because the criteria for
a major depressive episode include four symptoms that are absent from
the symptom list for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), a very
limited number of individuals will have depressive symptoms that have
persisted longer than 2 years but will not meet criteria for persistent
depressive disorder. If full criteria for a major depressive episode
have been met at some point during the current episode of illness, they
should be given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Otherwise, a
diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified
depressive disorder is warranted. Specify if: With anxious distress
(p. 184) With mixed features (pp. 184--185) With melancholic features
(p. 185) With atypical features (pp. 185--186) With mood-congruent
psychotic features (p. 186) With mood-incongruent psychotic features
(p. 186) With peripartum onset (pp. 186--187) Specify if: In partial
remission (p. 188) In full remission (p. 188) Specify if: Early onset:
If onset is before age 21 years.

Late onset: If onset is at age 21 years or older. Specify if (for most
recent 2 years of persistent depressive disorder): With pure dysthymic
syndrome: Full criteria for a major depressive episode have not been met
in at least the preceding 2 years. With persistent major depressive
episode: Full criteria for a major depressive episode have been met
throughout the preceding 2-year period. With intermittent major
depressive episodes, with current episode: Full criteria for a major
depressive episode are currently met, but there have been periods of at
least 8 weeks in at least the preceding 2 years with symptoms below the
threshold for a full major depressive episode. With intermittent major
depressive episodes, without current episode: Full criteria for a major
depressive episode are not currently met, but there has been one or more
major depressive episodes in at least the preceding 2 years. Specify
current severity: Mild (p. 188) Moderate (p. 188) Severe (p. 188)

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of persistent depressive
disorder (dysthymia) is a depressed mood that occurs for most of the
day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years, or at least 1 year
for children and adolescents (Criterion A). This disorder represents a
consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive disorder and
dysthymic disorder. Major depression may precede persistent depressive
disorder, and major depressive episodes may occur during persistent
depressive disorder. Individuals whose symptoms meet major depressive
disorder criteria for 2 years should be given a diagnosis of persistent
depressive disorder as well as major depressive disorder. Individuals
with persistent depressive disorder describe their mood as sad or "down
in the dumps." During periods of depressed mood, at least two of the six
symptoms from Criterion B are present. Because these symptoms have
become a part of the individual's day-to-day experience, particularly

in the case of early onset (e.g., "I've always been this way"), they may
not be reported unless the individual is directly prompted. During the
2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents), any symptom-free
intervals last no longer than 2 months (Criterion C).

Prevalence Persistent depressive disorder is effectively an amalgam of
DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive episode. The
12-month prevalence in the United States is approximately 0.5% for
persistent depressive disorder and 1.5% for chronic major depressive
disorder2.

Development and Course Persistent depressive disorder often has an
early13 and insidious onset (i.e., in childhood, adolescence, or early
adult life) and, by definition, a chronic course. Among individuals with
both persistent depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder,
the covariance of the corresponding features over time suggests the
operation of a common mechanism7. Early onset (i.e., before age 21
years) is associated with a higher likelihood of comorbid personality
disorders and substance use disorders3, 8. When symptoms rise to the
level of a major depressive episode, they are likely to subsequently
revert to a lower level. However, depressive symptoms are much less
likely to resolve in a given period of time in the context of persistent
depressive disorder than they are in a major depressive episode9, 15.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Factors predictive of poorer
long-term outcome include higher levels of neuroticism (negative
affectivity), greater symptom severity, poorer global functioning5, 15,
19, and presence of anxiety disorders or conduct disorder2.
Environmental. separation2.

Childhood risk factors include parental loss or

Genetic and physiological. There are no clear differences in illness
development, course, or family history between DSM-IV dysthymic disorder
and chronic major depressive disorder10, 11, 12, 20. Earlier findings

pertaining to either disorder are therefore likely to apply to
persistent depressive disorder. It is thus likely that individuals with
persistent depressive disorder will have a higher proportion of
first-degree relatives with persistent depressive disorder than do
individuals with major depressive disorder1, 10, 13, 16, and more
depressive disorders in general10. A number of brain regions (e.g.,
prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, amygdala, hippocampus) have been
implicated in persistent depressive disorder4, 14. Possible
polysomnographic abnormalities exist as well6.

Functional Consequences of Persistent Depressive Disorder The degree to
which persistent depressive disorder impacts social and occupational
functioning is likely to vary widely, but effects can be as great as or
greater than those of major depressive disorder15.

Differential Diagnosis Major depressive disorder. If there is a
depressed mood plus two or more symptoms meeting criteria for a
persistent depressive episode for 2 years or more, then the diagnosis of
persistent depressive disorder is made. The diagnosis depends on the
2-year duration, which distinguishes it from episodes of depression that
do not last 2 years. If the symptom criteria are sufficient for a
diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any time during this period,
then the diagnosis of major depression should be made and also noted as
a specifier with the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. If the
individual's symptoms currently meet full criteria for a major
depressive episode, then the specifier of "with intermittent major
depressive episodes, with current episode" would be made. If the major
depressive episode has persisted for at least a 2-year duration and
remains present, then the specifier "with persistent major depressive
episode" is used. When full major depressive episode criteria are not
currently met but there has been at least one previous episode of major
depression in the context of at least 2 years of persistent depressive
symptoms, then the specifier of "with intermittent major depressive
episodes, without current episode" is used. If the individual has not
experienced an episode of major depression in the last 2 years, then the
specifier "with pure dysthymic syndrome" is used.

Psychotic disorders. Depressive symptoms are a common associated feature
of chronic psychotic disorders (e.g., schizoaffective disorder,
schizophrenia, delusional disorder). A separate diagnosis of persistent
depressive disorder is not made if the symptoms occur only during the
course of the psychotic disorder (including residual phases). Depressive
or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition.
Persistent depressive disorder must be distinguished from a depressive
or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition. The
diagnosis is depressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another
medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged, based on history,
physical examination, or laboratory findings, to be attributable to the
direct pathophysiological effects of a specific, usually chronic,
medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis). If it is judged that the
depressive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of
another medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (e.g.,
persistent depressive disorder) is recorded, and the medical condition
is noted as a concomitant medical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus).
Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder. A
substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar and related disorder
is distinguished from persistent depressive disorder when a substance
(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) is judged to be
etiologically related to the mood disturbance. Personality disorders.
Often, there is evidence of a coexisting personality disturbance. When
an individual's presentation meets the criteria for both persistent
depressive disorder and a personality disorder, both diagnoses are
given.

Comorbidity In comparison to individuals with major depressive disorder,
those with persistent depressive disorder are at higher risk for
psychiatric comorbidity in general, and for anxiety disorders and
substance use disorders in particular2, 10, 13, 17, 18. Early-onset
persistent depressive disorder is strongly associated with DSM-IV
Cluster B and C personality disorders3.

Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

625.4 (N94.3)

a.  In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be
    present in the final week before the onset of menses, start to
    improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and become
    minimal or absent in the week postmenses.
b.  One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:

1. Marked affective lability (e.g., mood swings; feeling suddenly sad or
tearful, or increased sensitivity to rejection). 2. Marked irritability
or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts. 3. Marked depressed mood,
feelings of hopelessness, or selfdeprecating thoughts. 4. Marked
anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edge. c. One
(or more) of the following symptoms must additionally be present, to
reach a total of five symptoms when combined with symptoms from
Criterion B above. 1. Decreased interest in usual activities (e.g.,
work, school, friends, hobbies). 2. Subjective difficulty in
concentration. 3. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy.
4. Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings. 5.
Hypersomnia or insomnia. 6. A sense of being overwhelmed or out of
control. 7. Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling,
joint or muscle pain, a sensation of "bloating," or weight gain. Note:
The symptoms in Criteria A--C must have been met for most menstrual
cycles that occurred in the preceding year. d. The symptoms are
associated with clinically significant distress or interference with
work, school, usual social activities, or relationships with others
(e.g., avoidance of social activities; decreased productivity and
efficiency at work, school, or home). e. The disturbance is not merely
an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder, such as major
depressive disorder, panic disorder, persistent depressive disorder
(dysthymia), or a personality disorder (although it may co-occur with
any of these disorders). f. Criterion A should be confirmed by
prospective daily ratings during at least two symptomatic cycles. (Note:
The diagnosis may be made

provisionally prior to this confirmation.) g. The symptoms are not
attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug
of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition
(e.g., hyperthyroidism).

Recording Procedures If symptoms have not been confirmed by prospective
daily ratings of at least two symptomatic cycles, "provisional" should
be noted after the name of the diagnosis (i.e., "premenstrual dysphoric
disorder, provisional").

Diagnostic Features The essential features of premenstrual dysphoric
disorder are the expression of mood lability, irritability, dysphoria,
and anxiety symptoms that occur repeatedly during the premenstrual phase
of the cycle and remit around the onset of menses or shortly thereafter.
These symptoms may be accompanied by behavioral and physical symptoms.
Symptoms must have occurred in most of the menstrual cycles during the
past year and must have an adverse effect on work or social functioning.
The intensity and/or expressivity of the accompanying symptoms may be
closely related to social and cultural background characteristics of the
affected female, family perspectives, and more specific factors such as
religious beliefs, social tolerance, and female gender role issues.
Typically, symptoms peak around the time of the onset of menses9.
Although it is not uncommon for symptoms to linger into the first few
days of menses, the individual must have a symptom-free period in the
follicular phase after the menstrual period begins. While the core
symptoms include mood and anxiety symptoms, behavioral and somatic
symptoms commonly also occur. However, the presence of physical and/or
behavioral symptoms in the absence of mood and/or anxious symptoms is
not sufficient for a diagnosis. Symptoms are of comparable severity (but
not duration) to those of another mental disorder, such as a major
depressive episode or generalized anxiety disorder. In order to confirm
a provisional diagnosis, daily prospective symptom ratings are required
for at least two symptomatic cycles.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Delusions and hallucinations
have been described in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle but
are rare16. The premenstrual phase has been considered by some to be a
risk period for suicide1, 15.

Prevalence Twelve-month prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is
between 1.8% and 5.8% of menstruating women6, 21. Estimates are
substantially inflated if they are based on retrospective reports rather
than prospective daily ratings. However, estimated prevalence based on a
daily record of symptoms for 1--2 months may be less representative, as
individuals with the most severe symptoms may be unable to sustain the
rating process. The most rigorous estimate of premenstrual dysphoric
disorder is 1.8% for women whose symptoms meet the full criteria without
functional impairment and 1.3% for women whose symptoms meet the current
criteria with functional impairment and without co-occurring symptoms
from another mental disorder6.

Development and Course Onset of premenstrual dysphoric disorder can
occur at any point after menarche. Incidence of new cases over a
40-month follow-up period is 2.5% (95% confidence interval = 1.7--3.7)7.
Anecdotally, many individuals, as they approach menopause, report that
symptoms worsen. Symptoms cease after menopause, although cyclical
hormone replacement can trigger the re-expression of symptoms.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Environmental factors
associated with the expression of premenstrual dysphoric disorder
include stress3, 7, history of interpersonal trauma7, seasonal
changes11, and sociocultural aspects of female sexual behavior in
general, and female gender role in particular. Genetic and
physiological. Heritability of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is
unknown. However, for premenstrual symptoms, estimates for heritability
range between 30% and 80%, with the most stable component of
premenstrual symptoms estimated to be about 50% heritable10.

Course modifiers. Women who use oral contraceptives may have fewer
premenstrual complaints than do women who do not use oral
contraceptives.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is not
a culture-bound syndrome and has been observed in individuals in the
United States, Europe5, 21, India2, and Asia20. It is unclear as to
whether rates differ by race13, 19. Nevertheless, frequency, intensity,
and expressivity of symptoms and help-seeking patterns may be
significantly influenced by cultural factors.

Diagnostic Markers As indicated earlier, the diagnosis of premenstrual
dysphoric disorder is appropriately confirmed by 2 months of prospective
symptom ratings. A number of scales, including the Daily Rating of
Severity of Problems4 and the Visual Analogue Scales for Premenstrual
Mood Symptoms17, have undergone validation and are commonly used in
clinical trials for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The Premenstrual
Tension Syndrome Rating Scale has a self-report and an observer version,
both of which have been validated18 and used widely to measure illness
severity in women who have premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

Functional Consequences Dysphoric Disorder

of

Premenstrual

Symptoms must be associated with clinically meaningful distress and/or
an obvious and marked impairment in the ability to function socially or
occupationally in the week prior to menses. Impairment in social
functioning may be manifested by marital discord and problems with
children, other family members, or friends. Chronic marital or job
problems should not be confused with dysfunction that occurs only in
association with premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

Differential Diagnosis Premenstrual syndrome. Premenstrual syndrome
differs from premenstrual dysphoric disorder in that a minimum of five
symptoms is not

required, and there is no stipulation of affective symptoms for
individuals who have premenstrual syndrome. This condition may be more
common than premenstrual dysphoric disorder, although the estimated
prevalence of premenstrual syndrome varies. While premenstrual syndrome
shares the feature of symptom expression during the premenstrual phase
of the menstrual cycle, it is generally considered to be less severe
than premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The presence of physical or
behavioral symptoms in the premenstruum, without the required affective
symptoms, likely meets criteria for premenstrual syndrome and not for
premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is a
syndrome of painful menses, but this is distinct from a syndrome
characterized by affective changes. Moreover, symptoms of dysmenorrhea
begin with the onset of menses, whereas symptoms of premenstrual
dysphoric disorder, by definition, begin before the onset of menses,
even if they linger into the first few days of menses. Bipolar disorder,
major depressive disorder, and persistent depressive disorder
(dysthymia). Many women with (either naturally occurring or
substance/medication-induced) bipolar or major depressive disorder or
persistent depressive disorder believe that they have premenstrual
dysphoric disorder. However, when they chart symptoms, they realize that
the symptoms do not follow a premenstrual pattern. Women with another
mental disorder may experience chronic symptoms or intermittent symptoms
that are unrelated to menstrual cycle phase. However, because the onset
of menses constitutes a memorable event, they may report that symptoms
occur only during the premenstruum or that symptoms worsen
premenstrually. This is one of the rationales for the requirement that
symptoms be confirmed by daily prospective ratings14. The process of
differential diagnosis, particularly if the clinician relies on
retrospective symptoms only, is made more difficult because of the
overlap between symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and some
other diagnoses. The overlap of symptoms is particularly salient for
differentiating premenstrual dysphoric disorder from major depressive
episodes, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, and
borderline personality disorder. However, the rate of personality
disorders is no higher in individuals with premenstrual dysphoric
disorder than in those without the disorder.

Use of hormonal treatments. Some women who present with moderate to
severe premenstrual symptoms may be using hormonal treatments, including
hormonal contraceptives. If such symptoms occur after initiation of
exogenous hormone use, the symptoms may be due to the use of hormones
rather than to the underlying condition of premenstrual dysphoric
disorder. If the woman stops hormones and the symptoms disappear, this
is consistent with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder.

Comorbidity A major depressive episode is the most frequently reported
previous disorder in individuals presenting with premenstrual dysphoric
disorder12. A wide range of medical (e.g., migraine, asthma, allergies,
seizure disorders) or other mental disorders (e.g., depressive and
bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, bulimia nervosa, substance use
disorders) may worsen in the premenstrual phase; however, the absence of
a symptom-free period during the postmenstrual interval obviates a
diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These conditions are
better considered premenstrual exacerbation of a current mental or
medical disorder8. Although the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric
disorder should not be assigned in situations in which an individual
only experiences a premenstrual exacerbation of another mental or
physical disorder, it can be considered in addition to the diagnosis of
another mental or physical disorder if the individual experiences
symptoms and changes in level of functioning that are characteristic of
premenstrual dysphoric disorder and markedly different from the symptoms
experienced as part of the ongoing disorder.

Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a.
A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the
clinical picture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly
diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities. b.
There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory
findings of both (1) and (2): 1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed
during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after
exposure to a medication. 2. The involved substance/medication is
capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A.

c. The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorder that
is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent
depressive disorder could include the following: The symptoms preceded
the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a
substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of
acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence
suggesting the existence of an independent
non-substance/medication-induced depressive disorder (e.g., a history of
recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes). d. The disturbance
does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. e. The
disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Note:
This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance
intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion
A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently
severe to warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and
ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific substance/medication\]-induced
depressive disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the
ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance
use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild
substance use disorder is comorbid with the substanceinduced depressive
disorder, the 4th position character is "1," and the clinician should
record "mild \[substance\] use disorder" before the substance-induced
depressive disorder (e.g., "mild cocaine use disorder with
cocaine-induced depressive disorder"). If a moderate or severe substance
use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder,
the 4th position character is "2," and the clinician should record
"moderate \[substance\] use disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use
disorder," depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use
disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a
one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is
"9," and the clinician should record only the substance-induced
depressive disorder. ICD-10-CM

Specify if (see in the chapter "Substance-Related and Addictive
Disorders" for diagnoses associated with substance class): With onset
during intoxication: If criteria are met for intoxication with the
substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication. With onset
during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance
and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.

Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the
substance/medication-induced depressive disorder begins with the
specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be
causing the depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from
the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug
class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,

dexamethasone), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in
cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the
specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during
withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which
combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a
single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the
substance use disorder. For example, in the case of depressive symptoms
occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder,
the diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset
during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use
disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each
should be listed separately (e.g., 292.84 methylphenidate-induced
depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal; 292.84
dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during
intoxication). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced
depressive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine,
dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the depressive symptoms.
The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria
set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a
comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any
of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for "other substance"
should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an
etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the
category "unknown substance" should be used. When recording the name of
the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed
first, followed by the word "with," followed by the name of the
substance-induced depressive disorder, followed by the specification of
onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For
example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during withdrawal
in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24
severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder,
with onset during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid
severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-

induced depressive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use
disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no
accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.94
phencyclidineinduced depressive disorder, with onset during
intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each
should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use
disorder with methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset
during withdrawal; F19.94 dexamethasoneinduced depressive disorder, with
onset during intoxication).

Diagnostic Features The diagnostic features of
substance/medication-induced depressive disorder include the symptoms of
a depressive disorder, such as major depressive disorder; however, the
depressive symptoms are associated with the ingestion, injection, or
inhalation of a substance (e.g., drug of abuse, toxin, psychotropic
medication, other medication), and the depressive symptoms persist
beyond the expected length of physiological effects, intoxication, or
withdrawal period. As evidenced by clinical history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings, the relevant depressive disorder
should have developed during or within 1 month after use of a substance
that is capable of producing the depressive disorder (Criterion B1). In
addition, the diagnosis is not better explained by an independent
depressive disorder. Evidence of an independent depressive disorder
includes the depressive disorder preceded the onset of ingestion or
withdrawal from the substance; the depressive disorder persists beyond a
substantial period of time after the cessation of substance use; or
other evidence suggests the existence of an independent
nonsubstance/medication-induced depressive disorder (Criterion C). This
diagnosis should not be made when symptoms occur exclusively during the
course of a delirium (Criterion D). The depressive disorder associated
with the substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal must cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis
(Criterion E). Some medications (e.g., stimulants, steroids, L-dopa,
antibiotics, central nervous system drugs, dermatological agents,
chemotherapeutic drugs, immunological agents) can induce depressive mood
disturbances. Clinical judgment is essential to determine whether the
medication is truly

associated with inducing the depressive disorder or whether a primary
depressive disorder happened to have its onset while the person was
receiving the treatment. For example, a depressive episode that
developed within the first several weeks of beginning alpha-methyldopa
(an antihypertensive agent) in an individual with no history of major
depressive disorder would qualify for the diagnosis of
medication-induced depressive disorder. In some cases, a previously
established condition (e.g., major depressive disorder, recurrent) can
recur while the individual is coincidentally taking a medication that
has the capacity to cause depressive symptoms (e.g., L-dopa, oral
contraceptives). In such cases, the clinician must make a judgment as to
whether the medication is causative in this particular situation. A
substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from a
primary depressive disorder by considering the onset, course, and other
factors associated with the substance use. There must be evidence from
the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of substance
use, abuse, intoxication, or withdrawal prior to the onset of the
depressive disorder. The withdrawal state for some substances can be
relatively protracted, and thus intense depressive symptoms can last for
a long period after the cessation of substance use.

Prevalence In a nationally representative U.S. adult population, the
lifetime prevalence of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder
is 0.26%1.

Development and Course A depressive disorder associated with the use of
substance (i.e., alcohol, illicit drugs, or a prescribed treatment for a
mental disorder or another medical condition) must have its onset while
the individual is using the substance or during withdrawal, if there is
a withdrawal syndrome associated with the substance. Most often, the
depressive disorder has its onset within the first few weeks or 1 month
of use of the substance. Once the substance is discontinued, the
depressive symptoms usually remit within days to several weeks,
depending on the half-life of the substance/medication and the presence
of a withdrawal syndrome. If symptoms persist 4 weeks beyond the
expected time course of withdrawal

of a particular substance/medication, other causes for the depressive
mood symptoms should be considered. Although there are a few prospective
controlled trials examining the association of depressive symptoms with
use of a medication, most reports are from postmarketing surveillance
studies, retrospective observational studies, or case reports, making
evidence of causality difficult to determine. Substances implicated in
medication-induced depressive disorder, with varying degrees of
evidence, include antiviral agents (efavirenz), cardiovascular agents
(clonidine, guanethidine, methyldopa, reserpine), retinoic acid
derivatives (isotretinoin), antidepressants, anticonvulsants,
anti-migraine agents (triptans), antipsychotics, hormonal agents
(corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone
agonists, tamoxifen), smoking cessation agents (varenicline), and
immunological agents (interferon)2. However, other potential substances
continue to emerge as new compounds are synthesized. A history of such
substance use may help increase diagnostic certainty.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Factors that appear to
increase the risk of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder
can be conceptualized as pertaining to the specific type of drug or to a
group of individuals with underlying alcohol or drug use disorders. Risk
factors common to all drugs include history of major depressive
disorder, history of drug-induced depression, and psychosocial
stressors2. Environmental. There are also risk factors pertaining to a
specific type of medication (e.g., increased immune activation prior to
treatment for hepatitis C associated with interferon-alfa-induced
depression); high doses (greater than 80 mg/day prednisone-equivalents)
of corticosteroids or high plasma concentrations of efavirenz; and high
estrogen/progesterone content in oral contraceptives2. Course modifiers.
In a representative U.S. adult population, compared with individuals
with major depressive disorder who did not have a substance use
disorder, individuals with substance-induced depressive disorder were
more likely to be male, to be black, to have at most a high school
diploma, to lack insurance, and to have lower family income. They were
also more likely to report higher family history of substance use

disorders and antisocial behavior, higher 12-month history of stressful
life events, and a greater number of DSM-IV major depressive disorder
criteria. They were more likely to report feelings of worthlessness,
insomnia/hypersomnia, and thoughts of death and suicide attempts, but
less likely to report depressed mood and parental loss by death before
age 18 years1.

Diagnostic Markers Determination of the substance of use can sometimes
be made through laboratory assays of the suspected substance in the
blood or urine to corroborate the diagnosis.

Suicide Risk Drug-induced or treatment-emergent suicidality represents a
marked change in thoughts and behavior from the person's baseline, is
usually temporally associated with initiation of a substance, and must
be distinguished from the underlying primary mental disorders. In regard
to the treatment-emergent suicidality associated with antidepressants, a
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee considered
meta-analyses of 99,839 participants enrolled in 372 randomized clinical
trials of antidepressants in trials for mental disorders. The analyses
showed that when the data were pooled across all adult age groups, there
was no perceptible increased risk of suicidal behavior or ideation.
However, in age-stratified analyses, the risk for patients ages 18-- 24
years was elevated, albeit not significantly (odds ratio \[OR\] = 1.55;
95% confidence interval \[CI\] = 0.91--2.70). The FDA meta-analyses
reveal an absolute risk of suicide in patients taking investigational
antidepressants of 0.01%3. In conclusion, suicide is clearly an
extremely rare treatmentemergent phenomenon, but the outcome of suicide
was serious enough to prompt the FDA to issue an expanded black-box
warning in 2007 regarding the importance of careful monitoring of
treatment-emergent suicidal ideation in patients receiving
antidepressants.

Differential Diagnosis Substance intoxication and withdrawal. Depressive
symptoms occur commonly in substance intoxication and substance
withdrawal, and the

diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or withdrawal will
usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of
substanceinduced depressive disorder should be made instead of a
diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the
mood symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical
attention. For example, dysphoric mood is a characteristic feature of
cocaine withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder
should be diagnosed instead of cocaine withdrawal only if the mood
disturbance is substantially more intense or longer lasting than what is
usually encountered with cocaine withdrawal and is sufficiently severe
to be a separate focus of attention and treatment. Primary depressive
disorder. A substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is
distinguished from a primary depressive disorder by the fact that a
substance is judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms, as
described earlier (see section "Development and Course" for this
disorder). Depressive disorder due to another medical condition. Because
individuals with other medical conditions often take medications for
those conditions, the clinician must consider the possibility that the
mood symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the
medical condition rather than the medication, in which case depressive
disorder due to another medical condition is diagnosed. The history
often provides the primary basis for such a judgment. At times, a change
in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g., medication
substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine empirically
whether the medication is the causative agent. If the clinician has
ascertained that the disturbance is a function of both another medical
condition and substance use or withdrawal, both diagnoses (i.e.,
depressive disorder due to another medical condition and
substance/medication-induced depressive disorder) may be given. When
there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the depressive
symptoms are associated with substance (including a medication)
ingestion or withdrawal or with another medical condition or are primary
(i.e., not a function of either a substance or another medical
condition), a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or
unspecified depressive disorder would be indicated.

Comorbidity Compared with individuals with major depressive disorder and
no comorbid substance use disorder, those with
substance/medication-induced depressive disorder have higher rates of
comorbidity with any DSM-IV mental disorder; are more likely to have
specific DSM-IV disorders of pathological gambling and paranoid,
histrionic, and antisocial personality disorders; and are less likely to
have persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)1. Compared with
individuals with major depressive disorder and a comorbid substance use
disorder, individuals with substance/medication-induced depressive
disorder are more likely to have alcohol use disorder, any other
substance use disorder, and histrionic personality disorder; however,
they are less likely to have persistent depressive disorder1.

Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition Diagnostic Criteria
a. A prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly
diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities that
predominates in the clinical picture.

b. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct
pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition. c. The
disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g.,
adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, in which the stressor is a
serious medical condition). d. The disturbance does not occur
exclusively during the course of a delirium. e. The disturbance causes
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code
for depressive disorder due to another medical condition is 293.83,
which is assigned regardless of the specifier. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on the specifier (see below). Specify if: (F06.31) With
depressive features: Full criteria are not met for a major depressive
episode. (F06.32) With major depressive--like episode: Full criteria are
met (except Criterion C) for a major depressive episode. (F06.34) With
mixed features: Symptoms of mania or hypomania are also present but do
not predominate in the clinical picture. Coding note: Include the name
of the other medical condition in the name of the mental disorder (e.g.,
293.83 \[F06.31\] depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with
depressive features). The other medical condition should also be coded
and listed separately immediately before the depressive disorder due to
the medical condition (e.g., 244.9 \[E03.9\] hypothyroidism; 293.83
\[F06.31\] depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depressive
features).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of depressive disorder due to
another medical condition is a prominent and persistent period of
depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or
almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture
(Criterion A) and that is thought to be related to the direct
physiological effects of another medical condition

(Criterion B). In determining whether the mood disturbance is due to a
general medical condition, the clinician must first establish the
presence of a general medical condition. Further, the clinician must
establish that the mood disturbance is etiologically related to the
general medical condition through a physiological mechanism. A careful
and comprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make
this judgment. Although there are no infallible guidelines for
determining whether the relationship between the mood disturbance and
the general medical condition is etiological, several considerations
provide some guidance in this area. One consideration is the presence of
a temporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of
the general medical condition and that of the mood disturbance. A second
consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of primary
Mood Disorders (e.g., atypical age at onset or course or absence of
family history). Evidence from the literature that suggests that there
can be a direct association between the general medical condition in
question and the development of mood symptoms can provide a useful
context in the assessment of a particular situation.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Etiology (i.e., a causal
relationship to another medical condition based on best clinical
evidence) is the key variable in depressive disorder due to another
medical condition. The listing of the medical conditions that are said
to be able to induce major depression is never complete, and the
clinician's best judgment is the essence of this diagnosis. There are
clear associations, as well as some neuroanatomical correlates, of
depression with stroke, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and
traumatic brain injury5, 7. Among the neuroendocrine conditions most
closely associated with depression are Cushing's disease1, 3, 15 and
hypothyroidism. There are numerous other conditions thought to be
associated with depression, such as multiple sclerosis13, 14. However,
the literature's support for a causal association is greater with some
conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, than
with others, for which the differential diagnosis may be adjustment
disorder, with depressed mood.

Development and Course Following stroke, the onset of depression appears
to be very acute, occurring within 1 day or a few days of the
cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in the largest case series10, 11.
However, in some cases, onset of the depression is weeks to months
following the CVA. In the largest series, the duration of the major
depressive episode following stroke was 9--11 months on average.
Similarly, in Huntington's disease the depressive state comes quite
early in the course of the illness. With Parkinson's disease6 and
Huntington's disease9, it often precedes the major motor impairments and
cognitive impairments associated with each condition. This is more
prominently the case for Huntington's disease, in which depression is
considered to be the first neuropsychiatric symptom. There is some
observational evidence that depression is less common as the dementia of
Huntington's disease progresses2, 8.

Risk and Prognostic Factors The risk of acute onset of a major
depressive disorder following a CVA (within 1 day to a week of the
event) appears to be strongly correlated with lesion location, with
greatest risk associated with left frontal strokes and least risk
apparently associated with right frontal lesions in those individuals
who present within days of the stroke12. The association with frontal
regions and laterality is not observed in depressive states that occur
in the 2--6 months following stroke.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Gender differences pertain to those
associated with the medical condition (e.g., systemic lupus
erythematosus is more common in females; stroke is somewhat more common
in middle-age males compared with females).

Diagnostic Markers Diagnostic markers pertain to those associated with
the medical condition (e.g., steroid levels in blood or urine to help
corroborate the diagnosis of Cushing's disease, which can be associated
with manic or depressive syndromes).

Suicide Risk There are no epidemiological studies that provide evidence
to differentiate the risk of suicide from a major depressive episode due
to another medical condition compared with the risk from a major
depressive episode in general. There are case reports of suicides in
association with major depressive episodes associated with another
medical condition. There is a clear association between serious medical
illnesses and suicide, particularly shortly after onset or diagnosis of
the illness. Thus, it would be prudent to assume that the risk of
suicide for major depressive episodes associated with medical conditions
is not less than that for other forms of major depressive episode, and
might even be greater.

Functional Consequences of Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical
Condition Functional consequences pertain to those associated with the
medical condition. In general, it is believed, but not established, that
a major depressive episode induced by Cushing's disease will not recur
if the Cushing's disease is cured or arrested. However, it is also
suggested, but not established, that mood syndromes, including
depressive and manic/hypomanic ones, may be episodic (i.e., recurring)
in some individuals with static brain injuries and other central nervous
system diseases.

Differential Diagnosis Depressive disorders not due to another medical
condition. Determination of whether a medical condition accompanying a
depressive disorder is causing the disorder depends on a) the absence of
an episode(s) of depressive episodes prior to the onset of the medical
condition, b) the probability that the associated medical condition has
a potential to promote or cause a depressive disorder, and c) a course
of the depressive symptoms shortly after the onset or worsening of the
medical condition, especially if the depressive symptoms remit near the
time that the medical disorder is effectively treated or remits.
Medication-induced depressive disorder. An important caveat is that some
medical conditions are treated with medications (e.g., steroids or

alpha-interferon) that can induce depressive or manic symptoms. In these
cases, clinical judgment, based on all the evidence in hand, is the best
way to try to separate the most likely and/or the most important of two
etiological factors (i.e., association with the medical condition vs. a
substance-induced syndrome). Adjustment disorders. It is important to
differentiate a depressive episode from an adjustment disorder, as the
onset of the medical condition is in itself a life stressor that could
bring on either an adjustment disorder or an episode of major
depression. The major differentiating elements are the pervasiveness the
depressive picture and the number and quality of the depressive symptoms
that the patient reports or demonstrates on the mental status
examination. The differential diagnosis of the associated medical
conditions is relevant but largely beyond the scope of the present
manual.

Comorbidity Conditions comorbid with depressive disorder due to another
medical condition are those associated with the medical conditions of
etiological relevance. It has been noted that delirium can occur before
or along with depressive symptoms in individuals with a variety of
medical conditions, such as Cushing's disease. The association of
anxiety symptoms, usually generalized symptoms, is common in depressive
disorders, regardless of cause.

Other Specified Depressive Disorder 311 (F32.8)

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a depressive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified depressive disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific depressive
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified depressive
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "short-duration
depressive episode"). Examples of presentations that can be specified
using the "other specified" designation include the following: 1.
Recurrent brief depression: Concurrent presence of depressed mood and at
least four other symptoms of depression for 2--13 days at least once per
month (not associated with the menstrual cycle) for at least 12
consecutive months in an individual whose presentation has never met
criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder and does not
currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder.
2. Short-duration depressive episode (4--13 days): Depressed affect and
at least four of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode
associated with clinically significant distress or impairment that
persists for more than 4 days, but less than 14 days, in an individual
whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or
bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual criteria
for any psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for recurrent
brief depression. 3. Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms:
Depressed affect and at least one of the other eight symptoms of a major
depressive episode associated with clinically significant distress or
impairment that persist for at least 2 weeks in an individual whose
presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar
disorder, does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any
psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for mixed anxiety and
depressive disorder symptoms.

Unspecified Depressive Disorder 311 (F32.9) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the depressive
disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified depressive disorder category
is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the
reason that the criteria are not met for a specific depressive disorder,
and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information
to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

Specifiers for Depressive Disorders Specify if: With anxious distress:
Anxious distress is defined as the presence of at least two of the
following symptoms during the majority of days of a major depressive
episode or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia): 1. Feeling keyed
up or tense. 2. Feeling unusually restless. 3. Difficulty concentrating
because of worry. 4. Fear that something awful may happen. 5. Feeling
that the individual might lose control of himself or herself. Specify
current severity: Mild: Two symptoms. Moderate: Three symptoms.
Moderate-severe: Four or five symptoms. Severe: Four or five symptoms
and with motor agitation. Note: Anxious distress has been noted as a
prominent feature of both bipolar and major depressive disorder in both
primary care and specialty mental health settings1, 2, 3. High levels of
anxiety have been associated

with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater
likelihood of treatment nonresponse. As a result, it is clinically
useful to specify accurately the presence and severity levels of anxious
distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.
With mixed features: a. At least three of the following manic/hypomanic
symptoms are present during the majority of days of a major depressive
episode: 1. Elevated, expansive mood. 2. Inflated self-esteem or
grandiosity. 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5.
Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work
or school, or sexually). 6. Increased or excessive involvement in
activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g.,
engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, foolish
business investments). 7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested
despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia). b.
Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the
person's usual behavior. c. For individuals whose symptoms meet full
criteria for either mania or hypomania, the diagnosis should be bipolar
I or bipolar II disorder. d. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to
the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication or other treatment). Note: Mixed features associated with a
major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor
for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it
is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for
treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment. With
melancholic features:

a. One of the following is present during the most severe period of the
current episode: 1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.
2. Lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much
better, even temporarily, when something good happens). b. Three (or
more) of the following: 1. A distinct quality of depressed mood
characterized by profound despondency, despair, and/or moroseness or by
so-called empty mood. 2. Depression that is regularly worse in the
morning. 3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours before usual
awakening). 4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation. 5.
Significant anorexia or weight loss. 6. Excessive or inappropriate
guilt. Note: The specifier "with melancholic features" is applied if
these features are present at the most severe stage of the episode.
There is a near-complete absence of the capacity for pleasure, not
merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reactivity
of mood is that even highly desired events are not associated with
marked brightening of mood. Either mood does not brighten at all, or it
brightens only partially (e.g., up to 20%--40% of normal for only
minutes at a time). The "distinct quality" of mood that is
characteristic of the "with melancholic features" specifier is
experienced as qualitatively different from that during a nonmelancholic
depressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more
severe, longer lasting, or present without a reason is not considered
distinct in quality. Psychomotor changes are nearly always present and
are observable by others. Melancholic features exhibit only a modest
tendency to repeat across episodes in the same individual. They are more
frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are less likely to
occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and are
more likely to occur in those with psychotic features.

With atypical features: This specifier can be applied when these
features predominate during the majority of days of the current or most
recent major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder. a.
Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential
positive events). b. Two (or more) of the following: 1. Significant
weight gain or increase in appetite. 2. Hypersomnia. 3. Leaden paralysis
(i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs). 4. A long-standing
pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes
of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational
impairment. c. Criteria are not met for "with melancholic features" or
"with catatonia" during the same episode. Note: "Atypical depression"
has historical significance (i.e., atypical in contradistinction to the
more classical agitated, "endogenous" presentations of depression that
were the norm when depression was rarely diagnosed in outpatients and
almost never in adolescents or younger adults) and today does not
connote an uncommon or unusual clinical presentation as the term might
imply. Mood reactivity is the capacity to be cheered up when presented
with positive events (e.g., a visit from children, compliments from
others). Mood may become euthymic (not sad) even for extended periods of
time if the external circumstances remain favorable. Increased appetite
may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by weight
gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime
sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day
(or at least 2 hours more than when not depressed). Leaden paralysis is
defined as feeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms
or legs. This sensation is generally present for at least an hour a day
but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the other atypical
features, pathological sensitivity to perceived interpersonal rejection
is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of adult
life. Rejection

sensitivity occurs both when the person is and is not depressed, though
it may be exacerbated during depressive periods. With psychotic
features: Delusions and/or hallucinations are present. With
mood-congruent psychotic features: The content of all delusions and
hallucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of
personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved
punishment. With mood-incongruent psychotic features: The content of the
delusions or hallucinations does not involve typical depressive themes
of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved
punishment, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and
mood-congruent themes. With catatonia: The catatonia specifier can apply
to an episode of depression if catatonic features are present during
most of the episode. See criteria for catatonia associated with a mental
disorder (for a description of catatonia, see the chapter "Schizophrenia
Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders"). With peripartum onset: This
specifier can be applied to the current or, if full criteria are not
currently met for a major depressive episode, most recent episode of
major depression if onset of mood symptoms occurs during pregnancy or in
the 4 weeks following delivery. Note: Mood episodes can have their onset
either during pregnancy or postpartum. Although the estimates differ
according to the period of follow-up after delivery, between 3% and 6%
of women will experience the onset of a major depressive episode during
pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery4. Fifty percent
of "postpartum" major depressive episodes actually begin prior to
delivery9. Thus, these episodes are referred to collectively as
peripartum episodes. Women with peripartum major depressive episodes
often have severe anxiety and even panic attacks5. Prospective studies
have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy, as
well as the "baby blues," increase the risk for a postpartum major
depressive episode7. Peripartum-onset mood episodes can present either
with or without psychotic features. Infanticide is most often associated
with postpartum psychotic episodes that are characterized by command
hallucinations to kill the infant or delusions that the infant is
possessed, but psychotic

symptoms can also occur in severe postpartum mood episodes without such
specific delusions or hallucinations. Postpartum mood (major depressive
or manic) episodes with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in
500 to 1 in 1,000 deliveries and may be more common in primiparous
women8. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is
particularly increased for women with prior postpartum mood episodes but
is also elevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or
bipolar disorder (especially bipolar I disorder) and those with a family
history of bipolar disorders. Once a woman has had a postpartum episode
with psychotic features, the risk of recurrence with each subsequent
delivery is between 30% and 50%6. Postpartum episodes must be
differentiated from delirium occurring in the postpartum period, which
is distinguished by a fluctuating level of awareness or attention. The
postpartum period is unique with respect to the degree of neuroendocrine
alterations and psychosocial adjustments, the potential impact of
breast-feeding on treatment planning, and the long-term implications of
a history of postpartum mood disorder on subsequent family planning.
With seasonal pattern: This specifier applies to recurrent major
depressive disorder. a. There has been a regular temporal relationship
between the onset of major depressive episodes in major depressive
disorder and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the fall or
winter). Note: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect
of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being
unemployed every winter). b. Full remissions (or a change from major
depression to mania or hypomania) also occur at a characteristic time of
the year (e.g., depression disappears in the spring). c. In the last 2
years, two major depressive episodes have occurred that demonstrate the
temporal seasonal relationships defined above and no nonseasonal major
depressive episodes have occurred during that same period. d. Seasonal
major depressive episodes (as described above) substantially outnumber
the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have

occurred over the individual's lifetime. Note: The specifier "with
seasonal pattern" can be applied to the pattern of major depressive
episodes in major depressive disorder, recurrent. The essential feature
is the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at
characteristic times of the year. In most cases, the episodes begin in
fall or winter and remit in spring. Less commonly, there may be
recurrent summer depressive episodes. This pattern of onset and
remission of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-year
period, without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during this period.
In addition, the seasonal depressive episodes must substantially
outnumber any nonseasonal depressive episodes over the individual's
lifetime. This specifier does not apply to those situations in which the
pattern is better explained by seasonally linked psychosocial stressors
(e.g., seasonal unemployment or school schedule). Major depressive
episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often characterized by
loss of energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for
carbohydrates. It is unclear whether a seasonal pattern is more likely
in recurrent major depressive disorder or in bipolar disorders. However,
within the bipolar disorders group, a seasonal pattern appears to be
more likely in bipolar II disorder than in bipolar I disorder. In some
individuals, the onset of manic or hypomanic episodes may also be linked
to a particular season. The prevalence of winter-type seasonal pattern
appears to vary with latitude, age, and sex. Prevalence increases with
higher latitudes. Age is also a strong predictor of seasonality, with
younger persons at higher risk for winter depressive episodes. Specify
if: In partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous major
depressive episode are present but full criteria are not met, or there
is a period lasting less than 2 months without any significant symptoms
of a major depressive episode following the end of such an episode. In
full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs or
symptoms of the disturbance were present. Specify current severity:
Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of
those symptoms, and the degree of functional disability.

Mild: Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the
diagnosis are present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but
manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or
occupational functioning. Moderate: The number of symptoms, intensity of
symptoms, and/or functional impairment are between those specified for
"mild" and "severe." Severe: The number of symptoms is substantially in
excess of that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the
symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symptoms
markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning.

2001 11691692 1 In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode
(MDE), it is useful to consider that in grief the predominant affect is
feelings of emptiness and loss, while in an MDE it is persistent
depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure.
The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity over days to
weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief. These waves
tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased. The
depressed mood of an MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific
thoughts or preoccupations. The pain of grief may be accompanied by
positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive
unhappiness and misery characteristic of an MDE. The thought content
associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts
and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or
pessimistic ruminations seen in an MDE. In grief, selfesteem is
generally preserved, whereas in an MDE feelings of worthlessness and
self-loathing are common. If self-derogatory ideation is present in
grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased
(e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much
he or she was loved). If a bereaved individual thinks about death and
dying, such thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly
about "joining" the deceased, whereas in an MDE such thoughts are
focused on ending one's own life because of feeling worthless,
undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression.

Anxiety Disorders Anxiety disorders include disorders that share
features of excessive fear and anxiety and related behavioral
disturbances. Fear is the emotional response to real or perceived
imminent threat, whereas anxiety is anticipation of future threat.
Obviously, these two states overlap, but they also differ, with fear
more often associated with surges of autonomic arousal necessary for
fight or flight, thoughts of immediate danger, and escape behaviors, and
anxiety more often associated with muscle tension and vigilance in
preparation for future danger and cautious or avoidant behaviors.
Sometimes the level of fear or anxiety is reduced by pervasive avoidance
behaviors. Panic attacks feature prominently within the anxiety
disorders as a particular type of fear response. Panic attacks are not
limited to anxiety disorders but rather can be seen in other mental
disorders as well. The anxiety disorders differ from one another in the
types of objects or situations that induce fear, anxiety, or avoidance
behavior, and the associated cognitive ideation. Thus, while the anxiety
disorders tend to be highly comorbid with each other, they can be
differentiated by close examination of the types of situations that are
feared or avoided and the content of the associated thoughts or beliefs.
Anxiety disorders differ from developmentally normative fear or anxiety
by being excessive or persisting beyond developmentally appropriate
periods. They differ from transient fear or anxiety, often
stress-induced, by being persistent (e.g., typically lasting 6 months or
more), although the criterion for duration is intended as a general
guide with allowance for some degree of flexibility and is sometimes of
shorter duration in children (as in separation anxiety disorder and
selective mutism). Since individuals with anxiety disorders typically
overestimate the danger in situations they fear or avoid, the primary
determination of whether the fear or anxiety is excessive or out of
proportion is made by the clinician, taking cultural contextual factors
into account. Many of the anxiety disorders develop in childhood and
tend to persist if not treated. Most occur more frequently in females
than in males (approximately 2:1 ratio). Each anxiety disorder is

diagnosed only when the symptoms are not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance/medication or to another medical
condition or are not better explained by another mental disorder. The
chapter is arranged developmentally, with disorders sequenced according
to the typical age at onset. The individual with separation anxiety
disorder is fearful or anxious about separation from attachment figures
to a degree that is developmentally inappropriate. There is persistent
fear or anxiety about harm coming to attachment figures and events that
could lead to loss of or separation from attachment figures and
reluctance to go away from attachment figures, as well as nightmares and
physical symptoms of distress. Although the symptoms often develop in
childhood, they can be expressed throughout adulthood as well. Selective
mutism is characterized by a consistent failure to speak in social
situations in which there is an expectation to speak (e.g., school) even
though the individual speaks in other situations. The failure to speak
has significant consequences on achievement in academic or occupational
settings or otherwise interferes with normal social communication.
Individuals with specific phobia are fearful or anxious about or
avoidant of circumscribed objects or situations. A specific cognitive
ideation is not featured in this disorder, as it is in other anxiety
disorders. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is almost always immediately
induced by the phobic situation, to a degree that is persistent and out
of proportion to the actual risk posed. There are various types of
specific phobias: animal; natural environment; blood-injection-injury;
situational; and other situations. In social anxiety disorder (social
phobia), the individual is fearful or anxious about or avoidant of
social interactions and situations that involve the possibility of being
scrutinized. These include social interactions such as meeting
unfamiliar people, situations in which the individual may be observed
eating or drinking, and situations in which the individual performs in
front of others. The cognitive ideation is of being negatively evaluated
by others, by being embarrassed, humiliated, or rejected, or offending
others. In panic disorder, the individual experiences recurrent
unexpected panic attacks and is persistently concerned or worried about
having more panic attacks or changes his or her behavior in maladaptive
ways because of the panic attacks (e.g., avoidance of exercise or of
unfamiliar locations). Panic attacks are abrupt surges of intense fear
or intense discomfort that reach a peak within minutes, accompanied by
physical and/or cognitive symptoms.

Limited-symptom panic attacks include fewer than four symptoms. Panic
attacks may be expected, such as in response to a typically feared
object or situation, or unexpected, meaning that the panic attack occurs
for no apparent reason. Panic attacks function as a marker and
prognostic factor for severity of diagnosis, course, and comorbidity
across an array of disorders, including, but not limited to, the anxiety
disorders (e.g., substance use, depressive and psychotic disorders).
Panic attack may therefore be used as a descriptive specifier for any
anxiety disorder as well as other mental disorders. Individuals with
agoraphobia are fearful and anxious about two or more of the following
situations: using public transportation; being in open spaces; being in
enclosed places; standing in line or being in a crowd; or being outside
of the home alone in other situations. The individual fears these
situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help
might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or
other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms. These situations almost
always induce fear or anxiety and are often avoided or require the
presence of a companion. The key features of generalized anxiety
disorder are persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about various
domains, including work and school performance, that the individual
finds difficult to control. In addition, the individual experiences
physical symptoms, including restlessness or feeling keyed up or on
edge; being easily fatigued; difficulty concentrating or mind going
blank; irritability; muscle tension; and sleep disturbance.
Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder involves anxiety due to
substance intoxication or withdrawal or to a medication treatment. In
anxiety disorder due to another medical condition, anxiety symptoms are
the physiological consequence of another medical condition.
Disorder-specific scales are available to better characterize the
severity of each anxiety disorder and to capture change in severity over
time. For ease of use, particularly for individuals with more than one
anxiety disorder, these scales have been developed to have the same
format (but different focus) across the anxiety disorders, with ratings
of behavioral symptoms, cognitive ideation symptoms, and physical
symptoms relevant to each disorder.

Separation Anxiety Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

309.21 (F93.0)

a.  Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety
    concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached,
    as evidenced by at least three of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Recurrent excessive distress when anticipating or experiencing
    separation from home or from major attachment figures.
2.  Persistent and excessive worry about losing major attachment figures
    or about possible harm to them, such as illness, injury, disasters,
    or death.
3.  Persistent and excessive worry about experiencing an untoward event
    (e.g., getting lost, being kidnapped, having an accident, becoming
    ill) that causes separation from a major attachment figure.
4.  Persistent reluctance or refusal to go out, away from home, to
    school, to work, or elsewhere because of fear of separation.
5.  Persistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or
    without major attachment figures at home or in other settings.
6.  Persistent reluctance or refusal to sleep away from home or to go to
    sleep without being near a major attachment figure.
7.  Repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation.
8.  Repeated complaints of physical symptoms (e.g., headaches,
    stomachaches, nausea, vomiting) when separation from major
    attachment figures occurs or is anticipated.

<!-- -->

b.  The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4
    weeks in children and adolescents and typically 6 months or more in
    adults.
c.  The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
    in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of
    functioning.

d. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder,
such as refusing to leave home because of excessive resistance to change
in autism spectrum disorder; delusions or hallucinations concerning
separation in psychotic disorders; refusal to go outside without a
trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other harm
befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or
concerns about having an illness in illness anxiety disorder.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of separation anxiety disorder
is excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from home or
attachment figures. The anxiety exceeds what may be expected given the
person's developmental level (Criterion A). Individuals with separation
anxiety disorder have symptoms that meet at least three of the following
criteria: They experience recurrent excessive distress when separation
from home or major attachment figures is anticipated or occurs
(Criterion A1). They worry about the well-being or death of attachment
figures, particularly when separated from them, and they need to know
the whereabouts of their attachment figures and want to stay in touch
with them (Criterion A2). They also worry about untoward events to
themselves, such as getting lost, being kidnapped, or having an
accident, that would keep them from ever being reunited with their major
attachment figure (Criterion A3). Individuals with separation anxiety
disorder are reluctant or refuse to go out by themselves because of
separation fears (Criterion A4). They have persistent and excessive fear
or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment figures at
home or in other settings. Children with separation anxiety disorder may
be unable to stay or go in a room by themselves and may display
"clinging" behavior, staying close to or "shadowing" the parent around
the house, or requiring someone to be with them when going to another
room in the house (Criterion A5). They have persistent reluctance or
refusal to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure or
to sleep away from home (Criterion A6). Children with this disorder
often have difficulty at bedtime and may insist that someone stay with
them until they fall asleep. During the night, they may make their way
to their parents' bed (or that of a significant other, such as a
sibling). Children may be

reluctant or refuse to attend camp, to sleep at friends' homes, or to go
on errands. Adults may be uncomfortable when traveling independently
(e.g., sleeping in a hotel room). There may be repeated nightmares in
which the content expresses the individual's separation anxiety (e.g.,
destruction of the family through fire, murder, or other catastrophe)
(Criterion A7). Physical symptoms (e.g., headaches, abdominal
complaints, nausea, vomiting) are common in children when separation
from major attachment figures occurs or is anticipated (Criterion A8).
Cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and feeling
faint are rare in younger children but may occur in adolescents and
adults. The disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks in
children and adolescents younger than 18 years and is typically 6 months
or longer in adults (Criterion B). However, the duration criterion for
adults should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree
of flexibility. The disturbance must cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning (Criterion C).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis When separated from major
attachment figures, children with separation anxiety disorder may
exhibit social withdrawal, apathy, sadness, or difficulty concentrating
on work or play. Depending on their age, individuals may have fears of
animals, monsters, the dark, muggers, burglars, kidnappers, car
accidents, plane travel, and other situations that are perceived as
presenting danger to the family or themselves. Some individuals become
homesick and uncomfortable to the point of misery when away from home.
Separation anxiety disorder in children may lead to school refusal,
which in turn may lead to academic difficulties and social isolation.
When extremely upset at the prospect of separation, children may show
anger or occasionally aggression toward someone who is forcing
separation. When alone, especially in the evening or the dark, young
children may report unusual perceptual experiences (e.g., seeing people
peering into their room, frightening creatures reaching for them,
feeling eyes staring at them). Children with this disorder may be
described as demanding, intrusive, and in need of constant attention,
and, as adults, may appear dependent and overprotective. The
individual's excessive demands

often become a source of frustration for family members, leading to
resentment and conflict in the family.

Prevalence The 12-month prevalence of separation anxiety disorder among
adults in the United States is 0.9%--1.9%6, 7, 14. In children, 6- to
12-month prevalence is estimated to be approximately 4%4, 11. In
adolescents in the United States, the 12-month prevalence is 1.6%7.
Separation anxiety disorder decreases in prevalence from childhood
through adolescence and adulthood and is the most prevalent anxiety
disorder in children younger than 12 years. In clinical samples of
children, the disorder is equally common in males and females. In the
community, the disorder is more frequent in females.

Development and Course Periods of heightened separation anxiety from
attachment figures are part of normal early development and may indicate
the development of secure attachment relationships (e.g., around 1 year
of age, when infants may suffer from stranger anxiety). Onset of
separation anxiety disorder may be as early as preschool age and may
occur at any time during childhood and more rarely in adolescence.
Typically there are periods of exacerbation and remission. In some
cases, both the anxiety about possible separation and the avoidance of
situations involving separation from the home or nuclear family (e.g.,
going away to college, moving away from attachment figures) may persist
through adulthood. However, the majority of children with separation
anxiety disorder are free of impairing anxiety disorders over their
lifetimes7. Many adults with separation anxiety disorder do not recall a
childhood onset of separation anxiety disorder14, although they may
recall symptoms2. The manifestations of separation anxiety disorder vary
with age. Younger children are more reluctant to go to school or may
avoid school altogether1. Younger children may not express worries or
specific fears of definite threats to parents, home, or themselves, and
the anxiety is manifested only when separation is experienced. As
children age, worries emerge; these are often worries about specific
dangers (e.g., accidents, kidnapping, mugging, death) or vague concerns
about not being reunited with attachment figures.

In adults, separation anxiety disorder may limit their ability to cope
with changes in circumstances (e.g., moving, getting married). Adults
with the disorder are typically overconcerned about their offspring and
spouses and experience marked discomfort when separated from them. They
may also experience significant disruption in work or social experiences
because of needing to continuously check on the whereabouts of a
significant other.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Separation anxiety disorder
often develops after life stress, especially a loss (e.g., the death of
a relative or pet; an illness of the individual or a relative; a change
of schools; parental divorce; a move to a new neighborhood; immigration;
a disaster that involved periods of separation from attachment figures).
In young adults, other examples of life stress include leaving the
parental home, entering into a romantic relationship, and becoming a
parent. Parental overprotection9 and intrusiveness16 may be associated
with separation anxiety disorder. Genetic and physiological. Separation
anxiety disorder in children may be heritable. Heritability was
estimated at 73% in a community sample of 6year-old twins, with higher
rates in girls3. Children with separation anxiety disorder display
particularly enhanced sensitivity to respiratory stimulation using
CO2-enriched air12, 13.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues There are cultural variations in the
degree to which it is considered desirable to tolerate separation, so
that demands and opportunities for separation between parents and
children are avoided in some cultures. For example, there is wide
variation across countries and cultures with respect to the age at which
it is expected that offspring should leave the parental home. It is
important to differentiate separation anxiety disorder from the high
value some cultures place on strong interdependence among family
members.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Girls manifest greater reluctance to
attend or avoidance of school than boys1. Indirect expression of fear of
separation may be more common in

males than in females, for example, by limited independent activity,
reluctance to be away from home alone, or distress when spouse or
offspring do things independently or when contact with spouse or
offspring is not possible.

Suicide Risk Separation anxiety disorder in children may be associated
with an increased risk for suicide. In a community sample, the presence
of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or substance use has been
associated with suicidal ideation and attempts. However, this
association is not specific to separation anxiety disorder and is found
in several anxiety disorders5.

Functional Consequences of Separation Anxiety Disorder Individuals with
separation anxiety disorder often limit independent activities away from
home or attachment figures (e.g., in children, avoiding school, not
going to camp, having difficulty sleeping alone; in adolescents, not
going away to college; in adults, not leaving the parental home, not
traveling, not working outside the home).

Differential Diagnosis Generalized anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety
disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder in that the
anxiety predominantly concerns separation from attachment figures, and
if other worries occur, they do not predominate the clinical picture.
Panic disorder. Threats of separation may lead to extreme anxiety and
even a panic attack. In separation anxiety disorder, in contrast to
panic disorder, the anxiety concerns the possibility of being away from
attachment figures and worry about untoward events befalling them,
rather than being incapacitated by an unexpected panic attack.
Agoraphobia. Unlike individuals with agoraphobia, those with separation
anxiety disorder are not anxious about being trapped or incapacitated in
situations from which escape is perceived as difficult in the event of
paniclike symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms.

Conduct disorder. School avoidance (truancy) is common in conduct
disorder, but anxiety about separation is not responsible for school
absences, and the child or adolescent usually stays away from, rather
than returns to, the home. Social anxiety disorder. School refusal may
be due to social anxiety disorder (social phobia). In such instances,
the school avoidance is due to fear of being judged negatively by others
rather than to worries about being separated from the attachment
figures. Posttraumatic stress disorder. Fear of separation from loved
ones is common after traumatic events such as a disasters, particularly
when periods of separation from loved ones were experienced during the
traumatic event. In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the central
symptoms concern intrusions about, and avoidance of, memories associated
with the traumatic event itself, whereas in separation anxiety disorder,
the worries and avoidance concern the well-being of attachment figures
and separation from them. Illness anxiety disorder. Individuals with
illness anxiety disorder worry about specific illnesses they may have,
but the main concern is about the medical diagnosis itself, not about
being separated from attachment figures. Bereavement. Intense yearning
or longing for the deceased, intense sorrow and emotional pain, and
preoccupation with the deceased or the circumstances of the death are
expected responses occurring in bereavement, whereas fear of separation
from other attachment figures is central in separation anxiety disorder.
Depressive and bipolar disorders. These disorders may be associated with
reluctance to leave home, but the main concern is not worry or fear of
untoward events befalling attachment figures, but rather low motivation
for engaging with the outside world. However, individuals with
separation anxiety disorder may become depressed while being separated
or in anticipation of separation. Oppositional defiant disorder.
Children and adolescents with separation anxiety disorder may be
oppositional in the context of being forced to separate from attachment
figures. Oppositional defiant disorder should be considered only when
there is persistent oppositional behavior unrelated to the anticipation
or occurrence of separation from attachment figures.

Psychotic disorders. Unlike the hallucinations in psychotic disorders,
the unusual perceptual experiences that may occur in separation anxiety
disorder are usually based on a misperception of an actual stimulus,
occur only in certain situations (e.g., nighttime), and are reversed by
the presence of an attachment figure. Personality disorders. Dependent
personality disorder is characterized by an indiscriminate tendency to
rely on others, whereas separation anxiety disorder involves concern
about the proximity and safety of main attachment figures. Borderline
personality disorder is characterized by fear of abandonment by loved
ones, but problems in identity, self-direction, interpersonal
functioning, and impulsivity are additionally central to that disorder,
whereas they are not central to separation anxiety disorder.

Comorbidity In children, separation anxiety disorder is highly comorbid
with generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia15. In adults,
common comorbidities include specific phobia, PTSD, panic disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia,
obsessive-compulsive disorder14, and personality disorders8, 9.
Depressive and bipolar disorders are also comorbid with separation
anxiety disorder in adults14.

Selective Mutism Diagnostic Criteria

313.23 (F94.0)

a.  Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations in which
    there is an expectation for speaking (e.g., at school) despite
    speaking in other situations.
b.  The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational
    achievement or with social communication.
c.  The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to
    the first month of school).
d.  The failure to speak is not attributable to a lack of knowledge of,
    or comfort with, the spoken language required in the social
    situation.
e.  The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder
    (e.g., childhood-onset fluency disorder) and does not occur
    exclusively during the course of autism spectrum disorder,
    schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder.

Diagnostic Features When encountering other individuals in social
interactions, children with selective mutism do not initiate speech or
reciprocally respond when spoken to by others. Lack of speech occurs in
social interactions with children or adults. Children with selective
mutism will speak in their home in the presence of immediate family
members but often not even in front of close friends or second-degree
relatives, such as grandparents or cousins. The disturbance is often
marked by high social anxiety8. Children with selective mutism often
refuse to speak at school, leading to academic or educational
impairment, as teachers often find it difficult to assess skills such as
reading. The lack of speech may interfere with social communication,
although children with this disorder sometimes use nonspoken or
nonverbal means (e.g., grunting, pointing, writing) to communicate and
may be willing or eager to perform or engage in social encounters when
speech is not required (e.g., nonverbal parts in school plays).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Associated features of
selective mutism may include excessive shyness, fear of social
embarrassment, social isolation and withdrawal1, 3, clinging, compulsive
traits, negativism, temper tantrums, or mild oppositional behavior3.
Although children with this disorder generally have normal language
skills, there may occasionally be an associated communication disorder,
although no particular association with a specific communication
disorder has been identified5. Even when these disorders are present,
anxiety is present as well3. In clinical settings, children with
selective mutism are almost always given an additional diagnosis of
another anxiety disorder---most commonly, social anxiety disorder
(social phobia)8.

Prevalence Selective mutism is a relatively rare disorder and has not
been included as a diagnostic category in epidemiological studies of
prevalence of childhood disorders. Point prevalence using various clinic
or school samples ranges between 0.03% and 1% depending on the setting
(e.g., clinic vs. school vs. general population) and ages of the
individuals in the sample1, 8. The prevalence of the disorder does not
seem to vary by sex or race/ethnicity. The disorder is more likely to
manifest in young children than in adolescents and adults.

Development and Course The onset of selective mutism is usually before
age 5 years, but the disturbance may not come to clinical attention
until entry into school, where there is an increase in social
interaction and performance tasks, such as reading aloud8. The
persistence of the disorder is variable. Although clinical reports
suggest that many individuals "outgrow" selective mutism, the
longitudinal course of the disorder is unknown. In some cases,
particularly in individuals with social anxiety disorder, selective
mutism may disappear, but symptoms of social anxiety disorder remain.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Temperamental risk factors
for selective mutism are not well identified. Negative affectivity
(neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition

may play a role, as may parental history of shyness, social isolation,
and social anxiety2, 8. Children with selective mutism may have subtle
receptive language difficulties compared with their peers, although
receptive language is still within the normal range6. Environmental.
Social inhibition on the part of parents may serve as a model for social
reticence and selective mutism in children. Furthermore, parents of
children with selective mutism have been described as overprotective7 or
more controlling than parents of children with other anxiety disorders
or no disorder4. Genetic and physiological factors. Because of the
significant overlap between selective mutism and social anxiety
disorder, there may be shared genetic factors between these conditions.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Children in families who have
immigrated to a country where a different language is spoken may refuse
to speak the new language because of lack of knowledge of the language.
If comprehension of the new language is adequate but refusal to speak
persists, a diagnosis of selective mutism may be warranted.

Functional Consequences of Selective Mutism Selective mutism may result
in social impairment, as children may be too anxious to engage in
reciprocal social interaction with other children. As children with
selective mutism mature, they may face increasing social isolation. In
school settings, these children may suffer academic impairment, because
often they do not communicate with teachers regarding their academic or
personal needs (e.g., not understanding a class assignment, not asking
to use the restroom). Severe impairment in school and social
functioning, including that resulting from teasing by peers, is common.
In certain instances, selective mutism may serve as a compensatory
strategy to decrease anxious arousal in social encounters1, 8.

Differential Diagnosis Communication disorders. Selective mutism should
be distinguished from speech disturbances that are better explained by a
communication

disorder, such as language disorder, speech sound disorder (previously
phonological disorder), childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering),
or pragmatic (social) communication disorder. Unlike selective mutism,
the speech disturbance in these conditions is not restricted to a
specific social situation. Neurodevelopmental disorders and
schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Individuals with an autism
spectrum disorder, schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, or
severe intellectual disability may have problems in social communication
and be unable to speak appropriately in social situations. In contrast,
selective mutism should be diagnosed only when a child has an
established capacity to speak in some social situations (e.g., typically
at home). Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). The social anxiety
and social avoidance in social anxiety disorder may be associated with
selective mutism. In such cases, both diagnoses may be given.

Comorbidity The most common comorbid conditions are other anxiety
disorders, most commonly social anxiety disorder, followed by separation
anxiety disorder and specific phobia8. Oppositional behaviors have been
noted to occur in children with selective mutism, although oppositional
behavior may be limited to situations requiring speech3. Communication
delays or disorders also may appear in some children with selective
mutism5.

Specific Phobia Diagnostic Criteria a. Marked fear or anxiety about a
specific object or situation (e.g., flying, heights, animals, receiving
an injection, seeing blood). Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may
be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging. b. The phobic
object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety.
c. The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with
intense fear or anxiety. d. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to
the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation and to the
sociocultural context. e. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent,
typically lasting for 6 months or more. f. The fear, anxiety, or
avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

g. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another
mental disorder, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations
associated with panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms (as
in agoraphobia); objects or situations related to obsessions (as in
obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of traumatic events (as in
posttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or attachment
figures (as in separation anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in
social anxiety disorder). Specify if: Code based on the phobic stimulus:
300.29 (F40.218) Animal (e.g., spiders, insects, dogs). 300.29 (F40.228)
Natural environment (e.g., heights, storms, water). 300.29 (F40.23x)
Blood-injection-injury (e.g., needles, invasive medical procedures).
Coding note: Select specific ICD-10-CM code as follows: F40.230 fear of
blood; F40.231 fear of injections and transfusions; F40.232 fear of
other medical care; or F40.233 fear of injury. 300.29 (F40.248)
Situational (e.g., airplanes, elevators, enclosed places). 300.29
(F40.298) Other (e.g., situations that may lead to choking or vomiting;
in children, e.g., loud sounds or costumed characters). Coding note:
When more than one phobic stimulus is present, code all ICD-10-CM codes
that apply (e.g., for fear of snakes and flying, F40.218 specific
phobia, animal, and F40.248 specific phobia, situational).

Specifiers It is common for individuals to have multiple specific
phobias. The average individual with specific phobia fears three objects
or situations, and approximately 75% of individuals with specific phobia
fear more than one situation or object19. In such cases, multiple
specific phobia diagnoses, each with its own diagnostic code reflecting
the phobic stimulus, would need to be given. For example, if an
individual fears thunderstorms and flying, then two diagnoses would be
given: specific phobia, natural environment, and specific phobia,
situational.

Diagnostic Features A key feature of this disorder is that the fear or
anxiety is circumscribed to the presence of a particular situation or
object (Criterion A), which may be termed the phobic stimulus. The
categories of feared situations or objects are provided as specifiers.
Many individuals fear objects or situations from more than one category,
or phobic stimulus. For the diagnosis of specific phobia, the response
must differ from normal, transient fears that commonly occur in the
population. To meet the criteria for a diagnosis, the fear or anxiety
must be intense or severe (i.e., "marked") (Criterion A). The amount of
fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared object or
situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of
the object or situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of
a full or limited symptom panic attack (i.e., expected panic attack).
Another characteristic of specific phobias is that fear or anxiety is
evoked nearly every time the individual comes into contact with the
phobic stimulus (Criterion B). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious
only occasionally upon being confronted with the situation or object
(e.g., becomes anxious when flying only on one out of every five
airplane flights) would not be diagnosed with specific phobia. However,
the degree of fear or anxiety expressed may vary (from anticipatory
anxiety to a full panic attack) across different occasions of
encountering the phobic object or situation because of various
contextual factors such as the presence of others, duration of exposure,
and other threatening elements such as turbulence on a flight for
individuals who fear flying. Fear and anxiety are often expressed
differently between children and adults. Also, the fear or anxiety
occurs as soon as the phobic object or situation is encountered (i.e.,
immediately rather than being delayed). The individual actively avoids
the situation, or if he or she either is unable or decides not to avoid
it, the situation or object evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion
C). Active avoidance means the individual intentionally behaves in ways
that are designed to prevent or minimize contact with phobic objects or
situations (e.g., takes tunnels instead of bridges on daily commute to
work for fear of heights; avoids entering a dark room for fear of
spiders; avoids accepting a job in a locale where a phobic stimulus is
more common). Avoidance behaviors are often obvious (e.g., an individual
who fears blood refusing to go to the doctor) but are

sometimes less obvious (e.g., an individual who fears snakes refusing to
look at pictures that resemble the form or shape of snakes). Many
individuals with specific phobias have suffered over many years and have
changed their living circumstances in ways designed to avoid the phobic
object or situation as much as possible (e.g., an individual diagnosed
with specific phobia, animal, who moves to reside in an area devoid of
the particular feared animal). Therefore, they no longer experience fear
or anxiety in their daily life. In such instances, avoidance behaviors
or ongoing refusal to engage in activities that would involve exposure
to the phobic object or situation (e.g., repeated refusal to accept
offers for work-related travel because of fear of flying) may be helpful
in confirming the diagnosis in the absence of overt anxiety or panic.
The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger that the
object or situation poses, or more intense than is deemed necessary
(Criterion D). Although individuals with specific phobia often recognize
their reactions as disproportionate, they tend to overestimate the
danger in their feared situations3, 12, 14, and thus the judgment of
being out of proportion is made by the clinician. The individual's
sociocultural context should also be taken into account. For example,
fears of the dark may be reasonable in a context of ongoing violence,
and fear of insects may be more disproportionate in settings where
insects are consumed in the diet. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is
persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more (Criterion E), which
helps distinguish the disorder from transient fears that are common in
the population, particularly among children. However, the duration
criterion should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some
degree of flexibility. The specific phobia must cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning in order for the disorder to be diagnosed
(Criterion F).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with specific
phobia typically experience an increase in physiological arousal in
anticipation of or during exposure to a phobic object or situation2.
However, the physiological response to the feared situation or object
varies. Whereas individuals with situational, natural environment, and
animal specific phobias are likely to show sympathetic nervous system
arousal, individuals with blood-injection-injury specific

phobia often demonstrate a vasovagal fainting or near-fainting response
that is marked by initial brief acceleration of heart rate and elevation
of blood pressure followed by a deceleration of heart rate and a drop in
blood pressure10. Current neural systems models for specific phobia
emphasize the amygdala and related structures, much as in other anxiety
disorders2.

Prevalence In the United States, the 12-month community prevalence
estimate for specific phobia is approximately 7%--9%5, 7, 19. Prevalence
rates in European countries are largely similar to those in the United
States (e.g., about 6%), but rates are generally lower in Asian,
African, and Latin American countries (2%--4%)11. Prevalence rates are
approximately 5% in children18 and are approximately 16% in 13- to
17-year-olds7. Prevalence rates are lower in older individuals (about
3%--5%), possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical
levels7, 20. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a rate
of approximately 2:1, although rates vary across different phobic
stimuli. That is, animal, natural environment, and situational specific
phobias are predominantly experienced by females, whereas
blood-injection-injury phobia is experienced nearly equally by both
genders10.

Development and Course Specific phobia sometimes develops following a
traumatic event (e.g., being attacked by an animal or stuck in an
elevator), observation of others going through a traumatic event (e.g.,
watching someone drown), an unexpected panic attack in the to be feared
situation (e.g., an unexpected panic attack while on the subway), or
informational transmission (e.g., extensive media coverage of a plane
crash)8. However, many individuals with specific phobia are unable to
recall the specific reason for the onset of their phobias6. Specific
phobia usually develops in early childhood, with the majority of cases
developing prior to age 10 years. The median age at onset is between 7
and 11 years6, 19, with the mean at about 10 years. Situational specific
phobias tend to have a later age at onset than natural environment,
animal, or blood-injection-injury specific phobias. Specific phobias
that develop in childhood and adolescence are likely to wax and wane
during

that period1. However, phobias that do persist into adulthood are
unlikely to remit for the majority of individuals. When specific phobia
is being diagnosed in children, two issues should be considered. First,
young children may express their fear and anxiety by crying, tantrums,
freezing, or clinging. Second, young children typically are not able to
understand the concept of avoidance. Therefore, the clinician should
assemble additional information from parents, teachers, or others who
know the child well. Excessive fears are quite common in young children
but are usually transitory and only mildly impairing and thus considered
developmentally appropriate. In such cases a diagnosis of specific
phobia would not be made. When the diagnosis of specific phobia is being
considered in a child, it is important to assess the degree of
impairment and the duration of the fear, anxiety, or avoidance, and
whether it is typical for the child's particular developmental stage.
Although the prevalence of specific phobia is lower in older
populations, it remains one of the more commonly experienced disorders
in late life. Several issues should be considered when diagnosing
specific phobia in older populations. First, older individuals may be
more likely to endorse natural environment specific phobias, as well as
phobias of falling20. Second, specific phobia (like all anxiety
disorders) tends to co-occur with medical concerns in older individuals,
including coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. Third, older individuals may be more likely to attribute the
symptoms of anxiety to medical conditions15. Fourth, older individuals
may be more likely to manifest anxiety in an atypical manner (e.g.,
involving symptoms of both anxiety and depression) and thus be more
likely to warrant a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder.
Additionally, the presence of specific phobia in older adults is
associated with decreased quality of life and may serve as a risk factor
for major neurocognitive disorder20. Although most specific phobias
develop in childhood and adolescence, it is possible for a specific
phobia to develop at any age, often as the result of experiences that
are traumatic. For example, phobias of choking almost always follow a
near-choking event at any age13.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental. Temperamental risk factors for specific phobia, such as
negative affectivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition, are risk
factors for other anxiety disorders as well1. Environmental.
Environmental risk factors for specific phobias, such as parental
overprotectiveness, parental loss and separation, and physical and
sexual abuse, tend to predict other anxiety disorders as well4, 10. As
noted earlier, negative or traumatic encounters with the feared object
or situation sometimes (but not always) precede the development of
specific phobia. Genetic and physiological. There may be a genetic
susceptibility to a certain category of specific phobia (e.g., an
individual with a first-degree relative with a specific phobia of
animals is significantly more likely to have the same specific phobia
than any other category of phobia)10. Individuals with
blood-injection-injury phobia show a unique propensity to vasovagal
syncope (fainting) in the presence of the phobic stimulus10.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues In the United States, Asians and
Latinos report significantly lower rates of specific phobia than
non-Latino whites, African Americans, and Native Americans19. In
addition to having lower prevalence rates of specific phobia, some
countries outside of the United States, particularly Asian and African
countries, show differing phobia content, age at onset, and gender
ratios17.

Suicide Risk Individuals with specific phobia are up to 60% more likely
to make a suicide attempt than are individuals without the diagnosis.
However, it is likely that these elevated rates are primarily due to
comorbidity with personality disorders and other anxiety disorders16.

Functional Consequences of Specific Phobia Individuals with specific
phobia show similar patterns of impairment in psychosocial functioning
and decreased quality of life as individuals with other anxiety
disorders and alcohol and substance use disorders19, including
impairments in occupational and interpersonal functioning. In older
adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties and volunteer
activities. Also,

fear of falling in older adults can lead to reduced mobility and reduced
physical and social functioning, and may lead to receiving formal or
informal home support. The distress and impairment caused by specific
phobias tend to increase with the number of feared objects and
situations. Thus, an individual who fears four objects or situations is
likely to have more impairment in his or her occupational and social
roles and a lower quality of life than an individual who fears only one
object or situation. Individuals with blood-injection-injury specific
phobia are often reluctant to obtain medical care even when a medical
concern is present. Additionally, fear of vomiting and choking may
substantially reduce dietary intake.

Differential Diagnosis Agoraphobia. Situational specific phobia may
resemble agoraphobia in its clinical presentation, given the overlap in
feared situations (e.g., flying, enclosed places, elevators). If an
individual fears only one of the agoraphobia situations, then specific
phobia, situational, may be diagnosed. If two or more agoraphobic
situations are feared, a diagnosis of agoraphobia is likely warranted.
For example, an individual who fears airplanes and elevators (which
overlap with the "public transportation" agoraphobic situation) but does
not fear other agoraphobic situations would be diagnosed with specific
phobia, situational, whereas an individual who fears airplanes,
elevators, and crowds (which overlap with two agoraphobic situations,
"using public transportation" and "standing in line and or being in a
crowd") would be diagnosed with agoraphobia. Criterion B of agoraphobia
(the situations are feared or avoided "because of thoughts that escape
might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of
developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing
symptoms") can also be useful in differentiating agoraphobia from
specific phobia. If the situations are feared for other reasons, such as
fear of being harmed directly by the object or situations (e.g., fear of
the plane crashing, fear of the animal biting), a specific phobia
diagnosis may be more appropriate. Social anxiety disorder. If the
situations are feared because of negative evaluation, social anxiety
disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia.

Separation anxiety disorder. If the situations are feared because of
separation from a primary caregiver or attachment figure, separation
anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia. Panic
disorder. Individuals with specific phobia may experience panic attacks
when confronted with their feared situation or object. A diagnosis of
specific phobia would be given if the panic attacks only occurred in
response to the specific object or situation, whereas a diagnosis of
panic disorder would be given if the individual also experienced panic
attacks that were unexpected (i.e., not in response to the specific
phobia object or situation). Obsessive-compulsive disorder. If an
individual's primary fear or anxiety is of an object or situation as a
result of obsessions (e.g., fear of blood due to obsessive thoughts
about contamination from blood-borne pathogens \[i.e., HIV\]; fear of
driving due to obsessive images of harming others), and if other
diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder are met, then
obsessive-compulsive disorder should be diagnosed. Trauma- and
stressor-related disorders. If the phobia develops following a traumatic
event, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be considered as a
diagnosis. However, traumatic events can precede the onset of PTSD and
specific phobia. In this case, a diagnosis of specific phobia would be
assigned only if all of the criteria for PTSD are not met. Eating
disorders. A diagnosis of specific phobia is not given if the avoidance
behavior is exclusively limited to avoidance of food and foodrelated
cues, in which case a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa
should be considered. Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders. When the fear and avoidance are due to delusional thinking
(as in schizophrenia or other schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorders), a diagnosis of specific phobia is not warranted.

Comorbidity Specific phobia is rarely seen in medical-clinical settings
in the absence of other psychopathology and is more frequently seen in
nonmedical mental health settings6. Specific phobia is frequently
associated with a range of other disorders, especially depression in
older adults9. Because of early

onset, specific phobia is typically the temporally primary disorder.
Individuals with specific phobia are at increased risk for the
development of other disorders, including other anxiety disorders,
depressive and bipolar disorders, substance-related disorders, somatic
symptom and related disorders, and personality disorders (particularly
dependent personality disorder)19.

Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)

Diagnostic Criteria

300.23 (F40.10)

a.  Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which
    the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples
    include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting
    unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and
    performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In
    children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just
    during interactions with adults.
b.  The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show
    anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be
    humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend
    others).
c.  The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note:
    In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying,
    tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in
    social situations.
d.  The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or
    anxiety.
e.  The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed
    by the social situation and to the sociocultural context.
f.  The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for
    6 months or more.
g.  The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant
    distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
    areas of functioning.
h.  The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the
    physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
    medication) or another medical condition.
i.  The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the
    symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body
    dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.
j.  If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity,
    disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety,
    or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.

Specify if: Performance only: If the fear is restricted to speaking or
performing in public.

Specifiers Individuals with the performance only type of social anxiety
disorder have performance fears that are typically most impairing in
their professional lives (e.g., musicians, dancers, performers,
athletes) or in roles that require regular public speaking. Performance
fears may also manifest in work, school, or academic settings in which
regular public presentations are required. Individuals with performance
only social anxiety disorder do not fear or avoid nonperformance social
situations.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of social anxiety disorder is
a marked, or intense, fear or anxiety of social situations in which the
individual may be scrutinized by others. In children the fear or anxiety
must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults
(Criterion A). When exposed to such social situations, the individual
fears that he or she will be negatively evaluated. The individual is
concerned that he or she will be judged as anxious, weak, crazy, stupid,
boring, intimidating, dirty, or unlikable. The individual fears that he
or she will act or appear in a certain way or show anxiety symptoms,
such as blushing, trembling, sweating, stumbling over one's words, or
staring, that will be negatively evaluated by others (Criterion B). Some
individuals fear offending others or being rejected as a result. Fear of
offending others---for example, by a gaze or by showing anxiety
symptoms---may be the predominant fear in individuals from cultures with
strong collectivistic orientations. An individual with fear of trembling
of the hands may avoid drinking, eating, writing, or pointing in public;
an individual with fear of sweating may avoid shaking hands or eating
spicy foods; and an individual with fear of blushing may avoid public
performance, bright lights, or discussion about intimate topics. Some
individuals fear and avoid urinating in public restrooms when other
individuals are present (i.e., paruresis, or "shy bladder syndrome").
The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety (Criterion
C). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious only occasionally in the
social

situation(s) would not be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder.
However, the degree and type of fear and anxiety may vary (e.g.,
anticipatory anxiety, a panic attack) across different occasions. The
anticipatory anxiety may occur sometimes far in advance of upcoming
situations (e.g., worrying every day for weeks before attending a social
event, repeating a speech for days in advance). In children, the fear or
anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, or
shrinking in social situations. The individual will often avoid the
feared social situations. Alternatively, the situations are endured with
intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Avoidance can be extensive (e.g.,
not going to parties, refusing school) or subtle (e.g., overpreparing
the text of a speech, diverting attention to others, limiting eye
contact). The fear or anxiety is judged to be out of proportion to the
actual risk of being negatively evaluated or to the consequences of such
negative evaluation (Criterion E). Sometimes, the anxiety may not be
judged to be excessive, because it is related to an actual danger (e.g.,
being bullied or tormented by others). However, individuals with social
anxiety disorder often overestimate the negative consequences of social
situations, and thus the judgment of being out of proportion is made by
the clinician. The individual's sociocultural context needs to be taken
into account when this judgment is being made. For example, in certain
cultures, behavior that might otherwise appear socially anxious may be
considered appropriate in social situations (e.g., might be seen as a
sign of respect). The duration of the disturbance is typically at least
6 months (Criterion F). This duration threshold helps distinguish the
disorder from transient social fears that are common, particularly among
children and in the community. However, the duration criterion should be
used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility.
The fear, anxiety, and avoidance must interfere significantly with the
individual's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or
social activities or relationships, or must cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning (Criterion G). For example, an individual who is afraid
to speak in public would not receive a diagnosis of social anxiety
disorder if this activity is not routinely encountered on the job or in
classroom work, and if the individual is not significantly distressed
about it. However, if the individual avoids, or is

passed over for, the job or education he or she really wants because of
social anxiety symptoms, Criterion G is met.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with social anxiety
disorder may be inadequately assertive or excessively submissive or,
less commonly, highly controlling of the conversation. They may show
overly rigid body posture or inadequate eye contact, or speak with an
overly soft voice. These individuals may be shy or withdrawn, and they
may be less open in conversations and disclose little about themselves.
They may seek employment in jobs that do not require social contact,
although this is not the case for individuals with social anxiety
disorder, performance only. They may live at home longer. Men may be
delayed in marrying and having a family, whereas women who would want to
work outside the home may live a life as homemaker and mother6.
Self-medication with substances is common (e.g., drinking before going
to a party). Social anxiety among older adults may also include
exacerbation of symptoms of medical illnesses, such as increased tremor
or tachycardia. Blushing is a hallmark physical response of social
anxiety disorder4.

Prevalence The 12-month prevalence estimate of social anxiety disorder
for the United States is approximately 7%16, 17, 25. Lower 12-month
prevalence estimates are seen in much of the world using the same
diagnostic instrument, clustering around 0.5%--2.0%; median prevalence
in Europe is 2.3%20, 30. The 12-month prevalence rates in children and
adolescents are comparable to those in adults8, 17, 31. Prevalence rates
decrease with age32. The 12month prevalence for older adults ranges from
2% to 5%17, 21, 32. In general, higher rates of social anxiety disorder
are found in females than in males in the general population (with odds
ratios ranging from 1.5 to 2.2)10, and the gender difference in
prevalence is more pronounced in adolescents and young adults31. Gender
rates are equivalent or slightly higher for males in clinical samples,
and it is assumed that gender roles and social expectations play a
significant role in explaining the heightened helpseeking behavior in
male patients. Prevalence in the United States is higher in American
Indians and lower in persons of Asian, Latino, African

American, and Afro-Caribbean descent compared with non-Hispanic
whites20.

Development and Course Median age at onset of social anxiety disorder in
the United States is 13 years, and 75% of individuals have an age at
onset between 8 and 15 years16. The disorder sometimes emerges out of a
childhood history of social inhibition or shyness in U.S. and European
studies9. Onset can also occur in early childhood. Onset of social
anxiety disorder may follow a stressful or humiliating experience (e.g.,
being bullied, vomiting during a public speech)24, or it may be
insidious, developing slowly. First onset in adulthood is relatively
rare13 and is more likely to occur after a stressful or humiliating
event or after life changes that require new social roles (e.g.,
marrying someone from a different social class, receiving a job
promotion). Social anxiety disorder may diminish after an individual
with fear of dating marries and may reemerge after divorce. Among
individuals presenting to clinical care, the disorder tends to be
particularly persistent. Adolescents endorse a broader pattern of fear
and avoidance, including of dating, compared with younger children23.
Older adults express social anxiety at lower levels but across a broader
range of situations, whereas younger adults express higher levels of
social anxiety for specific situations14. In older adults, social
anxiety may concern disability due to declining sensory functioning
(hearing, vision) or embarrassment about one's appearance (e.g., tremor
as a symptom of Parkinson's disease) or functioning due to medical
conditions, incontinence, or cognitive impairment (e.g., forgetting
people's names). In the community approximately 30% of individuals with
social anxiety disorder experience remission of symptoms within 1 year,
and about 50% experience remission within a few years. For approximately
60% of individuals without a specific treatment for social anxiety
disorder, the course takes several years or longer. Detection of social
anxiety disorder in older adults may be challenging because of several
factors, including a focus on somatic symptoms, comorbid medical
illness, limited insight, changes to social environment or roles that
may obscure impairment in social functioning, or reticence about
describing psychological distress21.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Underlying traits that
predispose individuals to social anxiety disorder include behavioral
inhibition and fear of negative evaluation. Environmental. There is no
causative role of increased rates of childhood maltreatment or other
early-onset psychosocial adversity in the development of social anxiety
disorder27. However, childhood maltreatment and adversity are risk
factors for social anxiety disorder. Genetic and physiological. Traits
predisposing individuals to social anxiety disorder, such as behavioral
inhibition, are strongly genetically influenced11. The genetic influence
is subject to gene-environment interaction; that is, children with high
behavioral inhibition are more susceptible to environmental influences,
such as socially anxious modeling by parents1. Also, social anxiety
disorder is heritable (but performance-only anxiety less so)3.
First-degree relatives have a two to six times greater chance of having
social anxiety disorder, and liability to the disorder involves the
interplay of disorder-specific (e.g., fear of negative evaluation) and
nonspecific (e.g., neuroticism) genetic factors.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The syndrome of taijin kyofusho (e.g.,
in Japan and Korea) is often characterized by social-evaluative
concerns, fulfilling criteria for social anxiety disorder, that are
associated with the fear that the individual makes other people
uncomfortable (e.g., "My gaze upsets people so they look away and avoid
me"), a fear that is at times experienced with delusional intensity.
This symptom may also be found in non-Asian settings. Other
presentations of taijin kyofusho may fulfill criteria for body
dysmorphic disorder or delusional disorder7, 19, 20. Immigrant status is
associated with significantly lower rates of social anxiety disorder in
both Latino and nonLatino white groups20. Prevalence rates of social
anxiety disorder may not be in line with self-reported social anxiety
levels in the same culture---that is, societies with strong
collectivistic orientations may report high levels of social anxiety but
low prevalence of social anxiety disorder15.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Females with social anxiety disorder report a greater number of social
fears and comorbid depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders, whereas
males are more likely to fear dating, have oppositional defiant disorder
or conduct disorder, and use alcohol and illicit drugs to relieve
symptoms of the disorder25, 28. Paruresis is more common in males.

Functional Disorder

Consequences

of

Social

Anxiety

Social anxiety disorder is associated with elevated rates of school
dropout and with decreased well-being, employment, workplace
productivity, socioeconomic status, and quality of life22. Social
anxiety disorder is also associated with being single, unmarried, or
divorced and with not having children10, particularly among men. In
older adults, there may be impairment in caregiving duties and volunteer
activities. Social anxiety disorder also impedes leisure activities.
Despite the extent of distress and social impairment associated with
social anxiety disorder, only about half of individuals with the
disorder in Western societies ever seek treatment, and they tend to do
so only after 15--20 years of experiencing symptoms. Not being employed
is a strong predictor for the persistence of social anxiety disorder.

Differential Diagnosis Normative shyness. Shyness (i.e., social
reticence) is a common personality trait and is not by itself
pathological. In some societies, shyness is even evaluated positively.
However, when there is a significant adverse impact on social,
occupational, and other important areas of functioning, a diagnosis of
social anxiety disorder should be considered, and when full diagnostic
criteria for social anxiety disorder are met, the disorder should be
diagnosed. Only a minority (12%) of self-identified shy individuals in
the United States have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for social
anxiety disorder5. Agoraphobia. Individuals with agoraphobia may fear
and avoid social situations (e.g., going to a movie) because escape
might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of
incapacitation or panic-like symptoms, whereas individuals with social
anxiety disorder are most fearful

of scrutiny by others. Moreover, individuals with social anxiety
disorder are likely to be calm when left entirely alone, which is often
not the case in agoraphobia. Panic disorder. Individuals with social
anxiety disorder may have panic attacks, but the concern is about fear
of negative evaluation, whereas in panic disorder the concern is about
the panic attacks themselves. Generalized anxiety disorder. Social
worries are common in generalized anxiety disorder, but the focus is
more on the nature of ongoing relationships rather than on fear of
negative evaluation. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder,
particularly children, may have excessive worries about the quality of
their social performance, but these worries also pertain to nonsocial
performance and when the individual is not being evaluated by others. In
social anxiety disorder, the worries focus on social performance and
others' evaluation. Separation anxiety disorder. Individuals with
separation anxiety disorder may avoid social settings (including school
refusal) because of concerns about being separated from attachment
figures or, in children, about requiring the presence of a parent when
it is not developmentally appropriate. Individuals with separation
anxiety disorder are usually comfortable in social settings when their
attachment figure is present or when they are at home, whereas those
with social anxiety disorder may be uncomfortable when social situations
occur at home or in the presence of attachment figures. Specific
phobias. Individuals with specific phobias may fear embarrassment or
humiliation (e.g., embarrassment about fainting when they have their
blood drawn), but they do not generally fear negative evaluation in
other social situations. Selective mutism. Individuals with selective
mutism may fail to speak because of fear of negative evaluation, but
they do not fear negative evaluation in social situations where no
speaking is required (e.g., nonverbal play). Major depressive disorder.
Individuals with major depressive disorder may be concerned about being
negatively evaluated by others because they feel they are bad or not
worthy of being liked. In contrast, individuals with

social anxiety disorder are worried about being negatively evaluated
because of certain social behaviors or physical symptoms. Body
dysmorphic disorder. Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are
preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their
physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others;
this preoccupation often causes social anxiety and avoidance. If their
social fears and avoidance are caused only by their beliefs about their
appearance, a separate diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is not
warranted. Delusional disorder. Individuals with delusional disorder may
have nonbizarre delusions and/or hallucinations related to the
delusional theme that focus on being rejected by or offending others.
Although extent of insight into beliefs about social situations may
vary, many individuals with social anxiety disorder have good insight
that their beliefs are out of proportion to the actual threat posed by
the social situation. Autism spectrum disorder. Social anxiety and
social communication deficits are hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder.
Individuals with social anxiety disorder typically have adequate
age-appropriate social relationships and social communication capacity,
although they may appear to have impairment in these areas when first
interacting with unfamiliar peers or adults. Personality disorders.
Given its frequent onset in childhood and its persistence into and
through adulthood, social anxiety disorder may resemble a personality
disorder. The most apparent overlap is with avoidant personality
disorder. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder have a broader
avoidance pattern than those with social anxiety disorder. Nonetheless,
social anxiety disorder is typically more comorbid with avoidant
personality disorder than with other personality disorders, and avoidant
personality disorder is more comorbid with social anxiety disorder than
with other anxiety disorders. Other mental disorders. Social fears and
discomfort can occur as part of schizophrenia, but other evidence for
psychotic symptoms is usually present. In individuals with an eating
disorder, it is important to determine that fear of negative evaluation
about eating disorder symptoms or behaviors (e.g., purging and vomiting)
is not the sole source of social anxiety before applying a diagnosis of
social anxiety disorder. Similarly,

obsessive-compulsive disorder may be associated with social anxiety, but
the additional diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is used only when
social fears and avoidance are independent of the foci of the obsessions
and compulsions. Other medical conditions. Medical conditions may
produce symptoms that may be embarrassing (e.g., trembling in
Parkinson's disease). When the fear of negative evaluation due to other
medical conditions is excessive, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder
should be considered. Oppositional defiant disorder. Refusal to speak
due to opposition to authority figures should be differentiated from
failure to speak due to fear of negative evaluation.

Comorbidity Social anxiety disorder is often comorbid with other anxiety
disorders, major depressive disorder, and substance use disorders, and
the onset of social anxiety disorder generally precedes that of the
other disorders, except for specific phobia and separation anxiety
disorder2. Chronic social isolation in the course of a social anxiety
disorder may result in major depressive disorder. Comorbidity with
depression is high also in older adults18. Substances may be used as
self-medication for social fears, but the symptoms of substance
intoxication or withdrawal, such as trembling, may also be a source of
(further) social fear. Social anxiety disorder is frequently comorbid
with bipolar disorder or body dysmorphic disorder; for example, an
individual has body dysmorphic disorder concerning a preoccupation with
a slight irregularity of her nose, as well as social anxiety disorder
because of a severe fear of sounding unintelligent. The more generalized
form of social anxiety disorder, but not social anxiety disorder,
performance only, is often comorbid with avoidant personality disorder.
In children, comorbidities with high-functioning autism29and selective
mutism are common.

Panic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

300.01 (F41.0)

a. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge
of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within
minutes, and during which time four (or more) of the following symptoms
occur: Note: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious
state. 1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate. 2.
Sweating. 3. Trembling or shaking. 4. Sensations of shortness of breath
or smothering. 5. Feelings of choking. 6. Chest pain or discomfort. 7.
Nausea or abdominal distress. 8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed,
or faint. 9. Chills or heat sensations. 10. Paresthesias (numbness or
tingling sensations). 11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or
depersonalization (being detached from oneself). 12. Fear of losing
control or "going crazy." 13. Fear of dying. Note: Culture-specific
symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrollable
screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count as one
of the four required symptoms. b. At least one of the attacks has been
followed by 1 month (or more) of one or both of the following: 1.
Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their
consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, "going
crazy"). 2. A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the
attacks (e.g., behaviors designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as
avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations).

c. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary disorders). d. The
disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g.,
the panic attacks do not occur only in response to feared social
situations, as in social anxiety disorder; in response to circumscribed
phobic objects or situations, as in specific phobia; in response to
obsessions, as in obsessive-compulsive disorder; in response to
reminders of traumatic events, as in posttraumatic stress disorder; or
in response to separation from attachment figures, as in separation
anxiety disorder).

Diagnostic Features Panic disorder refers to recurrent unexpected panic
attacks (Criterion A). A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear
or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during
which time four or more of a list of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms
occur. The term recurrent literally means more than one unexpected panic
attack. The term unexpected refers to a panic attack for which there is
no obvious cue or trigger at the time of occurrence---that is, the
attack appears to occur from out of the blue, such as when the
individual is relaxing or emerging from sleep (nocturnal panic attack).
In contrast, expected panic attacks are attacks for which there is an
obvious cue or trigger, such as a situation in which panic attacks
typically occur. The determination of whether panic attacks are expected
or unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on
a combination of careful questioning as to the sequence of events
preceding or leading up to the attack and the individual's own judgment
of whether or not the attack seemed to occur for no apparent reason.
Cultural interpretations may influence the assignment of panic attacks
as expected or unexpected (see section "Culture-Related Diagnostic
Issues" for this disorder). In the United States and Europe,
approximately one-half of individuals with panic disorder have expected
panic attacks as well as unexpected panic attacks. Thus, the presence of
expected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic
disorder. For more details regarding expected versus unexpected panic
attacks, see the text accompanying panic attacks (pp. 214--217).

The frequency and severity of panic attacks vary widely. In terms of
frequency, there may be moderately frequent attacks (e.g., one per week)
for months at a time, or short bursts of more frequent attacks (e.g.,
daily) separated by weeks or months without any attacks or with less
frequent attacks (e.g., two per month) over many years. Persons who have
infrequent panic attacks resemble persons with more frequent panic
attacks in terms of panic attack symptoms, demographic characteristics,
comorbidity with other disorders, family history, and biological data2.
In terms of severity, individuals with panic disorder may have both
full-symptom (four or more symptoms) and limited-symptom (fewer than
four symptoms) attacks, and the number and type of panic attack symptoms
frequently differ from one panic attack to the next2. However, more than
one unexpected full-symptom panic attack is required for the diagnosis
of panic disorder. The worries about panic attacks or their consequences
usually pertain to physical concerns, such as worry that panic attacks
reflect the presence of life-threatening illnesses (e.g., cardiac
disease, seizure disorder); social concerns, such as embarrassment or
fear of being judged negatively by others because of visible panic
symptoms; and concerns about mental functioning, such as "going crazy"
or losing control (Criterion B). The maladaptive changes in behavior
represent attempts to minimize or avoid panic attacks or their
consequences. Examples include avoiding physical exertion, reorganizing
daily life to ensure that help is available in the event of a panic
attack, restricting usual daily activities, and avoiding
agoraphobia-type situations, such as leaving home, using public
transportation, or shopping. If agoraphobia is present, a separate
diagnosis of agoraphobia is given.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis One type of unexpected panic
attack is a nocturnal panic attack (i.e., waking from sleep in a state
of panic, which differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep).
In the United States, this type of panic attack has been estimated to
occur at least one time in roughly one-quarter to one-third of
individuals with panic disorder, of whom the majority also have daytime
panic attacks1. In addition to worry about panic attacks and their
consequences, many individuals with panic disorder report constant or
intermittent feelings of anxiety that are more broadly related to health
and mental health concerns. For example, individuals with panic disorder
often

anticipate a catastrophic outcome from a mild physical symptom or
medication side effect (e.g., thinking that they may have heart disease
or that a headache means presence of a brain tumor). Such individuals
often are relatively intolerant of medication side effects. In addition,
there may be pervasive concerns about abilities to complete daily tasks
or withstand daily stressors, excessive use of drugs (e.g., alcohol,
prescribed medications or illicit drugs) to control panic attacks, or
extreme behaviors aimed at controlling panic attacks (e.g., severe
restrictions on food intake or avoidance of specific foods or
medications because of concerns about physical symptoms that provoke
panic attacks).

Prevalence In the general population, the 12-month prevalence estimate
for panic disorder across the United States and several European
countries is about 2%--3% in adults and adolescents6, 11, 12. In the
United States, significantly lower rates of panic disorder are reported
among Latinos, African Americans, Caribbean blacks, and Asian Americans,
compared with nonLatino whites; American Indians, by contrast, have
significantly higher rates14. Lower estimates have been reported for
Asian, African, and Latin American countries, ranging from 0.1% to
0.8%14. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a rate of
approximately 2:111. The gender differentiation occurs in adolescence
and is already observable before age 14 years. Although panic attacks
occur in children, the overall prevalence of panic disorder is low
before age 14 years (\<0.4%)2. The rates of panic disorder show a
gradual increase during adolescence, particularly in females, and
possibly following the onset of puberty, and peak during adulthood2. The
prevalence rates decline in older individuals (i.e., 0.7% in adults over
the age of 64)12, possibly reflecting diminishing severity to
subclinical levels17, 22.

Development and Course The median age at onset for panic disorder in the
United States is 20--24 years10. A small number of cases begin in
childhood, and onset after age 45 years is unusual but can occur. The
usual course, if the disorder is untreated, is chronic but waxing and
waning. Some individuals may have episodic outbreaks with years of
remission in between, and others may have

continuous severe symptomatology. Only a minority of individuals have
full remission without subsequent relapse within a few years4, 19. The
course of panic disorder typically is complicated by a range of other
disorders, in particular other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders,
and substance use disorders (see section "Comorbidity" for this
disorder). Although panic disorder is very rare in childhood, first
occurrence of "fearful spells" is often dated retrospectively back to
childhood18. As in adults, panic disorder in adolescents tends to have a
chronic course and is frequently comorbid with other anxiety,
depressive, and bipolar disorders. To date, no differences in the
clinical presentation between adolescents and adults have been found.
However, adolescents may be less worried about additional panic attacks
than are young adults2. Lower prevalence of panic disorder in older
adults appears to be attributable to age-related "dampening" of the
autonomic nervous system response17. Many older individuals with
"panicky feelings" are observed to have a "hybrid" of limited-symptom
panic attacks and generalized anxiety. Also, older adults tend to
attribute their panic attacks to certain stressful situations, such as a
medical procedure or social setting. Older individuals may
retrospectively endorse explanations for the panic attack (which would
preclude the diagnosis of panic disorder), even if an attack might
actually have been unexpected in the moment (and thus qualify as the
basis for a panic disorder diagnosis). This may result in
under-endorsement of unexpected panic attacks in older individuals.
Thus, careful questioning of older adults is required to assess whether
panic attacks were expected before entering the situation, so that
unexpected panic attacks and the diagnosis of panic disorder are not
overlooked. While the low rate of panic disorder in children could
relate to difficulties in symptom reporting, this seems unlikely given
that children are capable of reporting intense fear or panic in relation
to separation and to phobic objects or phobic situations. Adolescents
might be less willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks.
Therefore, clinicians should be aware that unexpected panic attacks do
occur in adolescents, much as they do in adults, and be attuned to this
possibility when encountering adolescents presenting with episodes of
intense fear or distress.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental. Negative affectivity (neuroticism) (i.e., proneness to
experiencing negative emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the
disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are harmful) are risk
factors for the onset of panic attacks and, separately, for worry about
panic, although their risk status for the diagnosis of panic disorder is
unknown15, 20. History of "fearful spells" (i.e., limited-symptom
attacks that do not meet full criteria for a panic attack) may be a risk
factor for later panic attacks and panic disorder. Although separation
anxiety in childhood, especially when severe, may precede the later
development of panic disorder, it is not a consistent risk factor2.
Environmental. Reports of childhood experiences of sexual and physical
abuse are more common in panic disorder than in certain other anxiety
disorders20. Smoking is a risk factor for panic attacks and panic
disorder9. Most individuals report identifiable stressors in the months
before their first panic attack (e.g., interpersonal stressors and
stressors related to physical well-being, such as negative experiences
with illicit or prescription drugs, disease, or death in the family).
Genetic and physiological. It is believed that multiple genes confer
vulnerability to panic disorder. However, the exact genes, gene
products, or functions related to the genetic regions implicated remain
unknown7, 20. Current neural systems models for panic disorder emphasize
the amygdala and related structures, much as in other anxiety
disorders20. There is an increased risk for panic disorder among
offspring of parents with anxiety, depressive, and bipolar disorders.
Respiratory disturbance, such as asthma, is associated with panic
disorder, in terms of past history, comorbidity, and family history13.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The rate of fears about mental and
somatic symptoms of anxiety appears to vary across cultures and may
influence the rate of panic attacks and panic disorder14. Also, cultural
expectations may influence the classification of panic attacks as
expected or unexpected. For example, a Vietnamese individual who has a
panic attack after walking out into a windy environment (trùng gió; "hit
by the wind") may attribute the panic attack to exposure to wind as a
result of the cultural syndrome that links these two experiences,
resulting in classification of the panic attack as expected.

Various other cultural syndromes are associated with panic disorder,
including ataque de nervios ("attack of nerves") among Latin Americans
and khyâl attacks and "soul loss" among Cambodians14. Ataque de nervios
may involve trembling, uncontrollable screaming or crying, aggressive or
suicidal behavior, and depersonalization or derealization, which may be
experienced longer than the few minutes typical of panic attacks14. Some
clinical presentations of ataque de nervios fulfill criteria for
conditions other than panic attack (e.g., other specified dissociative
disorder). These syndromes impact the symptoms and frequency of panic
disorder, including the individual's attribution of unexpectedness, as
cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situations, ranging from
interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios), to types of
exertion (associated with khyâl attacks), to atmospheric wind
(associated with trùng gió attacks). Clarification of the details of
cultural attributions may aid in distinguishing expected and unexpected
panic attacks2. For more information regarding cultural syndromes, refer
to the "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress" in the Appendix. The
specific worries about panic attacks or their consequences are likely to
vary from one culture to another (and across different age groups and
gender). For panic disorder, U.S. community samples of non-Latino whites
have significantly less functional impairment than African Americans14.
There are also higher rates of objectively defined severity in
non-Latino Caribbean blacks with panic disorder, and lower rates of
panic disorder overall in both African American and Afro-Caribbean
groups, suggesting that among individuals of African descent, the
criteria for panic disorder may be met only when there is substantial
severity and impairment.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues The clinical features of panic disorder
do not appear to differ between males and females. There is some
evidence for sexual dimorphism, with an association between panic
disorder and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in females
only3, 8.

Diagnostic Markers Agents with disparate mechanisms of action, such as
sodium lactate, caffeine, isoproterenol, yohimbine, carbon dioxide, and
cholecystokinin,

provoke panic attacks in individuals with panic disorder to a much
greater extent than in healthy control subjects (and in some cases, than
in individuals with other anxiety, depressive, or bipolar disorders
without panic attacks)20. Also, for a proportion of individuals with
panic disorder, panic attacks are related to hypersensitive medullary
carbon dioxide detectors, resulting in hypocapnia and other respiratory
irregularities16. However, none of these laboratory findings are
considered diagnostic of panic disorder.

Suicide Risk Panic attacks and a diagnosis of panic disorder in the past
12 months are related to a higher rate of suicide attempts and suicidal
ideation in the past 12 months even when comorbidity and a history of
childhood abuse and other suicide risk factors are taken into account20.

Functional Consequences of Panic Disorder Panic disorder is associated
with high levels of social, occupational, and physical disability;
considerable economic costs; and the highest number of medical visits
among the anxiety disorders, although the effects are strongest with the
presence of agoraphobia21. Individuals with panic disorder may be
frequently absent from work or school for doctor and emergency room
visits, which can lead to unemployment or dropping out of school. In
older adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties or volunteer
activities. Full-symptom panic attacks typically are associated with
greater morbidity (e.g., greater health care utilization, more
disability, poorer quality of life) than limited-symptom attacks2.

Differential Diagnosis Other specified anxiety disorder or unspecified
anxiety disorder. Panic disorder should not be diagnosed if full-symptom
(unexpected) panic attacks have never been experienced. In the case of
only limited-symptom unexpected panic attacks, an other specified
anxiety disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder diagnosis should be
considered.

Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. Panic disorder is not
diagnosed if the panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological
consequence of another medical condition. Examples of medical conditions
that can cause panic attacks include hyperthyroidism,
hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure
disorders, and cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g., arrhythmias,
supraventricular tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease \[COPD\])5. Appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., serum calcium
levels for hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or
physical examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in
determining the etiological role of another medical condition.
Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Panic disorder is not
diagnosed if the panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological
consequence of a substance. Intoxication with central nervous system
stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine) or cannabis and
withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e.g., alcohol,
barbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack. However, if panic attacks
continue to occur outside of the context of substance use (e.g., long
after the effects of intoxication or withdrawal have ended), a diagnosis
of panic disorder should be considered. In addition, because panic
disorder may precede substance use in some individuals and may be
associated with increased substance use, especially for purposes of
self-medication, a detailed history should be taken to determine if the
individual had panic attacks prior to excessive substance use. If this
is the case, a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered in
addition to a diagnosis of substance use disorder. Features such as
onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a
panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or
bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the possibility that
another medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack
symptoms. Other mental disorders with panic attacks as an associated
feature (e.g., other anxiety disorders and psychotic disorders). Panic
attacks that occur as a symptom of other anxiety disorders are expected
(e.g., triggered by social situations in social anxiety disorder, by
phobic objects or situations in specific phobia or agoraphobia, by worry
in generalized anxiety disorder, by separation from home or attachment
figures in

separation anxiety disorder) and thus would not meet criteria for panic
disorder. (Note: Sometimes an unexpected panic attack is associated with
the onset of another anxiety disorder, but then the attacks become
expected, whereas panic disorder is characterized by recurrent
unexpected panic attacks.) If the panic attacks occur only in response
to specific triggers, then only the relevant anxiety disorder is
assigned. However, if the individual experiences unexpected panic
attacks as well and shows persistent concern and worry or behavioral
change because of the attacks, then an additional diagnosis of panic
disorder should be considered.

Comorbidity Panic disorder infrequently occurs in clinical settings in
the absence of other psychopathology. The prevalence of panic disorder
is elevated in individuals with other disorders, particularly other
anxiety disorders (and especially agoraphobia), major depression,
bipolar disorder, and possibly mild alcohol use disorder11. While panic
disorder often has an earlier age at onset than the comorbid
disorder(s), onset sometimes occurs after the comorbid disorder and may
be seen as a severity marker of the comorbid illness. Reported lifetime
rates of comorbidity between major depressive disorder and panic
disorder vary widely, ranging from 10% to 65% in individuals with panic
disorder. In approximately one-third of individuals with both disorders,
the depression precedes the onset of panic disorder. In the remaining
two-thirds, depression occurs coincident with or following the onset of
panic disorder. A subset of individuals with panic disorder develop a
substance-related disorder, which for some represents an attempt to
treat their anxiety with alcohol or medications23. Comorbidity with
other anxiety disorders and illness anxiety disorder is also common.
Panic disorder is significantly comorbid with numerous general medical
symptoms and conditions, including, but not limited to, dizziness,
cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, asthma, COPD, and irritable bowel
syndrome. However, the nature of the association (e.g., cause and
effect) between panic disorder and these conditions remains unclear.
Although mitral valve prolapse and thyroid disease are more common among
individuals with panic disorder than in the general population, the
differences in prevalence are not consistent.

Panic Attack Specifier

Note: Symptoms are presented for the purpose of identifying a panic
attack; however, panic attack is not a mental disorder and cannot be
coded. Panic attacks can occur in the context of any anxiety disorder as
well as other mental disorders (e.g., depressive disorders,
posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders) and some medical
conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal).
When the presence of a panic attack is identified, it should be noted as
a specifier (e.g., "posttraumatic stress disorder with panic attacks").
For panic disorder, the presence of panic attack is contained within the
criteria for the disorder and panic attack is not used as a specifier.
An abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a
peak within minutes, and during which time four (or more) of the
following symptoms occur: Note: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm
state or an anxious state. 1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or
accelerated heart rate. 2. Sweating. 3. Trembling or shaking. 4.
Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering. 5. Feelings of choking.
6. Chest pain or discomfort. 7. Nausea or abdominal distress. 8. Feeling
dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint. 9. Chills or heat sensations.
10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).

11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being
detached from oneself). 12. Fear of losing control or "going crazy." 13.
Fear of dying. Note: Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck
soreness, headache, uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen.
Such symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms.

Features The essential feature of a panic attack is an abrupt surge of
intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes
and during which time four or more of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms
occur. Eleven of these 13 symptoms are physical (e.g., palpitations,
sweating), while two are cognitive (i.e., fear of losing control or
going crazy, fear of dying). "Fear of going crazy" is a colloquialism
often used by individuals with panic attacks and is not intended as a
pejorative or diagnostic term. The term within minutes means that the
time to peak intensity is literally only a few minutes. A panic attack
can arise from either a calm state or an anxious state, and time to peak
intensity should be assessed independently of any preceding anxiety.
That is, the start of the panic attack is the point at which there is an
abrupt increase in discomfort rather than the point at which anxiety
first developed. Likewise, a panic attack can return to either an
anxious state or a calm state and possibly peak again. A panic attack is
distinguished from ongoing anxiety by its time to peak intensity, which
occurs within minutes; its discrete nature; and its typically greater
severity. Attacks that meet all other criteria but have fewer than four
physical and/or cognitive symptoms are referred to as limited-symptom
attacks. There are two characteristic types of panic attacks: expected
and unexpected. Expected panic attacks are attacks for which there is an
obvious cue or trigger, such as situations in which panic attacks have
typically occurred. Unexpected panic attacks are those for which there
is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of occurrence (e.g., when
relaxing or out of sleep \[nocturnal panic attack\]). The determination
of whether panic attacks are expected or unexpected is made by the
clinician, who makes this

judgment based on a combination of careful questioning as to the
sequence of events preceding or leading up to the attack and the
individual's own judgment of whether or not the attack seemed to occur
for no apparent reason. Cultural interpretations may influence their
determination as expected or unexpected. Culture-specific symptoms
(e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrollable screaming or
crying) may be seen; however, such symptoms should not count as one of
the four required symptoms. Panic attacks can occur in the context of
any mental disorder (e.g., anxiety disorders, depressive disorders,
bipolar disorders, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related
disorders, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, substance use
disorders) and some medical conditions (e.g., cardiac, respiratory,
vestibular, gastrointestinal), with the majority never meeting criteria
for panic disorder4. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks are required for
a diagnosis of panic disorder.

Associated Features One type of unexpected panic attack is a nocturnal
panic attack (i.e., waking from sleep in a state of panic), which
differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep. Panic attacks are
related to a higher rate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation even
when comorbidity and other suicide risk factors are taken into account1.

Prevalence In the general population, 12-month prevalence estimates for
panic attacks in the United States is 11.2% in adults4. Twelve-month
prevalence estimates do not appear to differ significantly among African
Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos5. Lower 12-month prevalence
estimates for European countries appear to range from 2.7% to 3.3%2, 5.
Females are more frequently affected than males, although this gender
difference is more pronounced for panic disorder4. Panic attacks can
occur in children but are relatively rare until the age of puberty, when
the prevalence rates increase1. The prevalence rates decline in older
individuals, possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical
levels4, 8.

Development and Course

The mean age at onset for panic attacks in the United States is
approximately 22--23 years among adults4. However, the course of panic
attacks is likely influenced by the course of any co-occurring mental
disorder(s) and stressful life events. Panic attacks are uncommon, and
unexpected panic attacks are rare, in preadolescent children1.
Adolescents might be less willing than adults to openly discuss panic
attacks, even though they present with episodes of intense fear or
discomfort. Lower prevalence of panic attacks in older individuals may
be related to a weaker autonomic response to emotional states relative
to younger individuals7. Older individuals may be less inclined to use
the word "fear" and more inclined to use the word "discomfort" to
describe panic attacks8. Older individuals with "panicky feelings" may
have a hybrid of limited-symptom attacks and generalized anxiety. In
addition, older individuals tend to attribute panic attacks to certain
situations that are stressful (e.g., medical procedures, social
settings) and may retrospectively endorse explanations for the panic
attack even if it was unexpected in the moment. This may result in
under-endorsement of unexpected panic attacks in older individuals.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Negative affectivity
(neuroticism) (i.e., proneness to experiencing negative emotions) and
anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the disposition to believe that symptoms of
anxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the onset of panic attacks1.
History of "fearful spells" (i.e., limited-symptom attacks that do not
meet full criteria for a panic attack) may be a risk factor for later
panic attacks1. Environmental. Smoking is a risk factor for panic
attacks3. Most individuals report identifiable stressors in the months
before their first panic attack (e.g., interpersonal stressors and
stressors related to physical wellbeing, such as negative experiences
with illicit or prescription drugs, disease, or death in the family).

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Cultural interpretations may influence
the determination of panic attacks as expected or unexpected.
Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, and
uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen;

however, such symptoms should not count as one of the four required
symptoms. Frequency of each of the 13 symptoms varies cross-culturally
(e.g., higher rates of paresthesias in African Americans and of
dizziness in several Asian groups)5. Cultural syndromes also influence
the cross-cultural presentation of panic attacks, resulting in different
symptom profiles across different cultural groups. Examples include
khyâl (wind) attacks, a Cambodian cultural syndrome involving dizziness,
tinnitus, and neck soreness; and trùng gió (wind-related) attacks, a
Vietnamese cultural syndrome associated with headaches. Ataque de
nervios (attack of nerves) is a cultural syndrome among Latin Americans
that may involve trembling, uncontrollable screaming or crying,
aggressive or suicidal behavior, and depersonalization or derealization,
and which may be experienced for longer than only a few minutes5. Some
clinical presentations of ataque de nervios fulfill criteria for
conditions other than panic attack (e.g., other specified dissociative
disorder). Also, cultural expectations may influence the classification
of panic attacks as expected or unexpected, as cultural syndromes may
create fear of certain situations, ranging from interpersonal arguments
(associated with ataque de nervios), to types of exertion (associated
with khyâl attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with trùng gió
attacks). Clarification of the details of cultural attributions may aid
in distinguishing expected and unexpected panic attacks1. For more
information about cultural syndromes, see "Glossary of Cultural Concepts
of Distress" in the Appendix to this manual.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Panic attacks are more common in
females than in males, but clinical features or symptoms of panic
attacks do not differ between males and females.

Diagnostic Markers Physiological recordings of naturally occurring panic
attacks in individuals with panic disorder indicate abrupt surges of
arousal, usually of heart rate, that reach a peak within minutes and
subside within minutes1, and for a proportion of these individuals the
panic attack may be preceded by cardiorespiratory instabilities6.

Functional Consequences of Panic Attacks In the context of co-occurring
mental disorders, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders,
bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, psychotic disorders, and
personality disorders, panic attacks are associated with increased
symptom severity, higher rates of comorbidity and suicidality, and
poorer treatment response. Also, full-symptom panic attacks typically
are associated with greater morbidity (e.g., greater health care
utilization, more disability, poorer quality of life) than
limited-symptom attacks1.

Differential Diagnosis Other paroxysmal episodes (e.g., "anger
attacks"). Panic attacks should not be diagnosed if the episodes do not
involve the essential feature of an abrupt surge of intense fear or
intense discomfort, but rather other emotional states (e.g., anger,
grief). Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. Medical
conditions that can cause or be misdiagnosed as panic attacks include
hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, vestibular
dysfunctions, seizure disorders, and cardiopulmonary conditions (e.g.,
arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease). Appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., serum calcium
levels for hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or
physical examinations (e.g., for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in
determining the etiological role of another medical condition.
Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Intoxication with central
nervous system stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine) or
cannabis and withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e.g.,
alcohol, barbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack. A detailed
history should be taken to determine if the individual had panic attacks
prior to excessive substance use. Features such as onset after age 45
years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e.g.,
vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control,
slurred speech, or amnesia) suggest the possibility that a medical
condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms. Panic
disorder. Repeated unexpected panic attacks are required but are not
sufficient for the diagnosis of panic disorder (i.e., full diagnostic
criteria

for panic disorder must be met).

Comorbidity Panic attacks are associated with increased likelihood of
various comorbid mental disorders, including anxiety disorders,
depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, impulse-control disorders, and
substance use disorders4. Panic attacks are associated with increased
likelihood of later developing anxiety disorders, depressive disorders,
bipolar disorders, and possibly other disorders1.

Agoraphobia Diagnostic Criteria

300.22 (F40.00)

a.  Marked fear or anxiety about two (or more) of the following five
    situations:

<!-- -->

1.  Using public transportation (e.g., automobiles, buses, trains,
    ships, planes).
2.  Being in open spaces (e.g., parking lots, marketplaces, bridges).
3.  Being in enclosed places (e.g., shops, theaters, cinemas).
4.  Standing in line or being in a crowd.
5.  Being outside of the home alone.

<!-- -->

b.  The individual fears or avoids these situations because of thoughts
    that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the
    event of developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or
    embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fear of falling in the elderly; fear of
    incontinence).
c.  The agoraphobic situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.
d.  The agoraphobic situations are actively avoided, require the
    presence of a companion, or are endured with intense fear or
    anxiety.
e.  The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed
    by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context.
f.  The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for
    6 months or more.
g.  The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant
    distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
    areas of functioning.
h.  If another medical condition (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease,
    Parkinson's disease) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is

clearly excessive. i. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better
explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder---for example, the
symptoms are not confined to specific phobia, situational type; do not
involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder); and are
not related exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive
disorder), perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance (as in body
dysmorphic disorder), reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic
stress disorder), or fear of separation (as in separation anxiety
disorder). Note: Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence
of panic disorder. If an individual's presentation meets criteria for
panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses should be assigned.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of agoraphobia is marked, or
intense, fear or anxiety triggered by the real or anticipated exposure
to a wide range of situations (Criterion A). The diagnosis requires
endorsement of symptoms occurring in at least two of the following five
situations: 1) using public transporation, such as automobiles, buses,
trains, ships, or planes; 2) being in open spaces, such as parking lots,
marketplaces, or bridges; 3) being in enclosed spaces, such as shops,
theaters, or cinemas; 4) standing in line or being in a crowd; or 5)
being outside of the home alone. The examples for each situation are not
exhaustive; other situations may be feared22. When experiencing fear and
anxiety cued by such situations, individuals typically experience
thoughts that something terrible might happen (Criterion B). Individuals
frequently believe that escape from such situations might be difficult
(e.g., "can't get out of here") or that help might be unavailable (e.g.,
"there is nobody to help me") when panic-like symptoms or other
incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms occur. "Panic-like symptoms"
refer to any of the 13 symptoms included in the criteria for panic
attack, such as dizziness, faintness, and fear of dying. "Other
incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms" include symptoms such as
vomiting and inflammatory bowel symptoms, as well as, in older adults, a
fear of falling or, in children, a sense of disorientation and getting
lost.

The amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared
situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of
the agoraphobic situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form
of a fullor limited-symptom panic attack (i.e., an expected panic
attack). Fear or anxiety is evoked nearly every time the individual
comes into contact with the feared situation (Criterion C). Thus, an
individual who becomes anxious only occasionally in an agoraphobic
situation (e.g., becomes anxious when standing in line on only one out
of every five occasions) would not be diagnosed with agoraphobia5, 22.
The individual actively avoids the situation or, if he or she either is
unable or decides not to avoid it, the situation evokes intense fear or
anxiety (Criterion D). Active avoidance means the individual is
currently behaving in ways that are intentionally designed to prevent or
minimize contact with agoraphobic situations. Avoidance can be
behavioral (e.g., changing daily routines, choosing a job nearby to
avoid using public transportation, arranging for food delivery to avoid
entering shops and supermarkets) as well as cognitive (e.g., using
distraction to get through agoraphobic situations) in nature. The
avoidance can become so severe that the person is completely homebound.
Often, an individual is better able to confront a feared situation when
accompanied by a companion, such as a partner, friend, or health
professional. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance must be out of proportion
to the actual danger posed by the agoraphobic situations and to the
sociocultural context (Criterion E). Differentiating clinically
significant agoraphobic fears from reasonable fears (e.g., leaving the
house during a bad storm) or from situations that are deemed dangerous
(e.g., walking in a parking lot or using public transportation in a
high-crime area) is important for a number of reasons. First, what
constitutes avoidance may be difficult to judge across cultures and
sociocultural contexts (e.g., it is socioculturally appropriate for
orthodox Muslim women in certain parts of the world to avoid leaving the
house alone, and thus such avoidance would not be considered indicative
of agoraphobia). Second, older adults are likely to overattribute their
fears to age-related constraints and are less likely to judge their
fears as being out of proportion to the actual risk24. Third,
individuals with agoraphobia are likely to overestimate danger in
relation to panic-like or other bodily symptoms4, 18. Agoraphobia should
be diagnosed only if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance persists (Criterion
F) and if it causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of

functioning (Criterion G). The duration of "typically lasting for 6
months or more" is meant to exclude individuals with short-lived,
transient problems. However, the duration criterion should be used as a
general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis In its most severe forms,
agoraphobia can cause individuals to become completely homebound, unable
to leave their home and dependent on others for services or assistance
to provide even for basic needs. Demoralization and depressive symptoms,
as well as abuse of alcohol and sedative medication as inappropriate
self-medication strategies, are common.

Prevalence Every year approximately 1.7% of adolescents and adults have
a diagnosis of agoraphobia15, 23. Females are twice as likely as males
to experience agoraphobia22. Agoraphobia may occur in childhood, but
incidence peaks in late adolescence and early adulthood1, 3.
Twelve-month prevalence in individuals older than 65 years is 0.4%14.
Prevalence rates do not appear to vary systematically across
cultural/racial groups9, 16.

Development and Course The percentage of individuals with agoraphobia
reporting panic attacks or panic disorder preceding the onset of
agoraphobia ranges from 30% in community samples to more than 50% in
clinic samples. The majority of individuals with panic disorder show
signs of anxiety and agoraphobia before the onset of panic disorder7, 8.
In two-thirds of all cases of agoraphobia, initial onset is before age
35 years. There is a substantial incidence risk in late adolescence and
early adulthood, with indications for a second high incidence risk phase
after age 40 years. First onset in childhood is rare. The overall mean
age at onset for agoraphobia is 17 years, although the age at onset
without preceding panic attacks or panic disorder is 25--29 years19, 22.
The course of agoraphobia is typically persistent and chronic. Complete
remission is rare (10%), unless the agoraphobia is treated6. With more
severe agoraphobia, rates of full remission decrease, whereas rates of
relapse and chronicity increase. A range of other disorders, in
particular

other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use disorders,
and personality disorders, may complicate the course of agoraphobia. The
longterm course and outcome of agoraphobia are associated with
substantially elevated risk of secondary major depressive disorder,
persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), and substance use disorders.
The clinical features of agoraphobia are relatively consistent across
the lifespan, although the type of agoraphobic situations triggering
fear, anxiety, or avoidance, as well as the type of cognitions, may
vary. For example, in children, being outside of the home alone is the
most frequent situation feared, whereas in older adults, being in shops,
standing in line, and being in open spaces are most often feared22.
Also, cognitions often pertain to becoming lost (in children), to
experiencing panic-like symptoms (in adults), to falling (in older
adults). The low prevalence of agoraphobia in children could reflect
difficulties in symptom reporting, and thus assessments in young
children may require solicitation of information from multiple sources,
including parents or teachers1. Adolescents, particularly males, may be
less willing than adults to openly discuss agoraphobic fears and
avoidance; however, agoraphobia can occur prior to adulthood and should
be assessed in children and adolescents. In older adults, comorbid
somatic symptom disorders, as well as motor disturbances (e.g., sense of
falling or having medical complications), are frequently mentioned by
individuals as the reason for their fear and avoidance17. In these
instances, care is to be taken in evaluating whether the fear and
avoidance are out of proportion to the real danger involved.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Behavioral inhibition and
neurotic disposition (i.e., negative affectivity \[neuroticism\] and
anxiety sensitivity) are closely associated with agoraphobia but are
relevant to most anxiety disorders (phobic disorders, panic disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder)21, 22. Anxiety sensitivity (the
disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are harmful) is also
characteristic of individuals with agoraphobia10. Environmental.
Negative events in childhood (e.g., separation, death of parent) and
other stressful events, such as being attacked or mugged, are associated
with the onset of agoraphobia. Furthermore, individuals with

agoraphobia describe the family climate and child-rearing behavior as
being characterized by reduced warmth and increased overprotection22.
Genetic and physiological. Heritability for agoraphobia is 61%13. Of the
various phobias, agoraphobia has the strongest and most specific
association with the genetic factor that represents proneness to
phobias11, 12.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Females have different patterns of
comorbid disorders than males. Consistent with gender differences in the
prevalence of mental disorders, males have higher rates of comorbid
substance use disorders.

Functional Consequences of Agoraphobia Agoraphobia is associated with
considerable impairment and disability in terms of role functioning,
work productivity, and disability days. Agoraphobia severity is a strong
determinant of the degree of disability, irrespective of the presence of
comorbid panic disorder, panic attacks, and other comorbid conditions14,
22. More than one-third of individuals with agoraphobia are completely
homebound and unable to work.

Differential Diagnosis When diagnostic criteria for agoraphobia and
another disorder are fully met, both diagnoses should be assigned,
unless the fear, anxiety, or avoidance of agoraphobia is attributable to
the other disorder. Weighting of criteria and clinical judgment may be
helpful in some cases. Specific phobia, situational type.
Differentiating agoraphobia from situational specific phobia can be
challenging in some cases, because these conditions share several
symptom characteristics and criteria. Specific phobia, situational type,
should be diagnosed versus agoraphobia if the fear, anxiety, or
avoidance is limited to one of the agoraphobic situations. Requiring
fears from two or more of the agoraphobic situations is a robust means
for differentiating agoraphobia from specific phobias, particularly the
situational subtype. Additional differentiating features include the
cognitive ideation. Thus, if the situation is feared for reasons other
than panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing
symptoms

(e.g., fears of being directly harmed by the situation itself, such as
fear of the plane crashing for individuals who fear flying), then a
diagnosis of specific phobia may be more appropriate. Separation anxiety
disorder. Separation anxiety disorder can be best differentiated from
agoraphobia by examining cognitive ideation. In separation anxiety
disorder, the thoughts are about detachment from significant others and
the home environment (i.e., parents or other attachment figures),
whereas in agoraphobia the focus is on panic-like symptoms or other
incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms in the feared situations. Social
anxiety disorder (social phobia). Agoraphobia should be differentiated
from social anxiety disorder based primarily on the situational clusters
that trigger fear, anxiety, or avoidance and the cognitive ideation. In
social anxiety disorder, the focus is on fear of being negatively
evaluated. Panic disorder. When criteria for panic disorder are met,
agoraphobia should not be diagnosed if the avoidance behaviors
associated with the panic attacks do not extend to avoidance of two or
more agoraphobic situations. Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic
stress disorder. Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) can be differentiated from agoraphobia by examining whether the
fear, anxiety, or avoidance is related only to situations that remind
the individual of a traumatic event. If the fear, anxiety, or avoidance
is restricted to trauma reminders, and if the avoidance behavior does
not extend to two or more agoraphobic situations, then a diagnosis of
agoraphobia is not warranted. Major depressive disorder. In major
depressive disorder, the individual may avoid leaving home because of
apathy, loss of energy, low self-esteem, and anhedonia. If the avoidance
is unrelated to fears of panic-like or other incapacitating or
embarrassing symptoms, then agoraphobia should not be diagnosed. Other
medical conditions. Agoraphobia is not diagnosed if the avoidance of
situations is judged to be a physiological consequence of a medical
condition. This determination is based on history, laboratory findings,
and a physical examination. Other relevant medical conditions may
include neurodegenerative disorders with associated motor disturbances
(e.g.,

Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis), as well as cardiovascular
disorders. Individuals with certain medical conditions may avoid
situations because of realistic concerns about being incapacitated
(e.g., fainting in an individual with transient ischemic attacks) or
being embarrassed (e.g., diarrhea in an individual with Crohn's
disease). The diagnosis of agoraphobia should be given only when the
fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that usually associated with
these medical conditions.

Comorbidity The majority of individuals with agoraphobia also have other
mental disorders. The most frequent additional diagnoses are other
anxiety disorders (e.g., specific phobias, panic disorder, social
anxiety disorder), depressive disorders (major depressive disorder),
PTSD, and alcohol use disorder. Whereas other anxiety disorders (e.g.,
separation anxiety disorder, specific phobias, panic disorder)
frequently precede onset of agoraphobia, depressive disorders and
substance use disorders typically occur secondary to agoraphobia2, 20.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

300.02 (F41.1)

a.  Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring
    more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events
    or activities (such as work or school performance).
b.  The individual finds it difficult to control the worry.
c.  The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the
    following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been
    present for more days than not for the past 6 months): Note: Only
    one item is required in children.

<!-- -->

1.  Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge.

2. Being easily fatigued. 3. Difficulty concentrating or mind going
blank. 4. Irritability. 5. Muscle tension. 6. Sleep disturbance
(difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep).
d. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning. e. The disturbance is not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). f. The
disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g.,
anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative
evaluation in social anxiety disorder \[social phobia\], contamination
or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from
attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of
traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in
anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder,
perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious
illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional
beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of generalized anxiety
disorder is excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) about
a number of events or activities. The intensity, duration, or frequency
of the anxiety and worry is out of proportion to the actual likelihood
or impact of the anticipated event. The individual finds it difficult to
control the worry and to keep worrisome thoughts from interfering with
attention to tasks at hand. Adults with generalized anxiety disorder
often worry about everyday, routine life circumstances, such as possible
job responsibilities, health and finances, the health of family members,
misfortune to their children, or minor matters

(e.g., doing household chores or being late for appointments). Children
with generalized anxiety disorder tend to worry excessively about their
competence or the quality of their performance. During the course of the
disorder, the focus of worry may shift from one concern to another.
Several features distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from
nonpathological anxiety. First, the worries associated with generalized
anxiety disorder are excessive and typically interfere significantly
with psychosocial functioning, whereas the worries of everyday life are
not excessive and are perceived as more manageable and may be put off
when more pressing matters arise. Second, the worries associated with
generalized anxiety disorder are more pervasive, pronounced, and
distressing; have longer duration; and frequently occur without
precipitants. The greater the range of life circumstances about which a
person worries (e.g., finances, children's safety, job performance), the
more likely his or her symptoms are to meet criteria for generalized
anxiety disorder. Third, everyday worries are much less likely to be
accompanied by physical symptoms (e.g., restlessness or feeling keyed up
or on edge). Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report
subjective distress due to constant worry and related impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The
anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three of the following
additional symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being
easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank,
irritability, muscle tension, and disturbed sleep, although only one
additional symptom is required in children.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Associated with muscle tension,
there may be trembling, twitching, feeling shaky, and muscle aches or
soreness. Many individuals with generalized anxiety disorder also
experience somatic symptoms (e.g., sweating, nausea, diarrhea) and an
exaggerated startle response. Symptoms of autonomic hyperarousal (e.g.,
accelerated heart rate, shortness of breath, dizziness) are less
prominent in generalized anxiety disorder than in other anxiety
disorders, such as panic disorder. Other conditions that may be
associated with stress (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, headaches)
frequently accompany generalized anxiety disorder.

Prevalence The 12-month prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder is
0.9% among adolescents and 2.9% among adults in the general community of
the United States19. The 12-month prevalence for the disorder in other
countries ranges from 0.4% to 3.6%23. The lifetime morbid risk is
9.0%19. Females are twice as likely as males to experience generalized
anxiety disorder28, 29. The prevalence of the diagnosis peaks in middle
age and declines across the later years of life11, 19. Individuals of
European descent tend to experience generalized anxiety disorder more
frequently than do individuals of non-European descent (i.e., Asian,
African, Native American and Pacific Islander)23. Furthermore,
individuals from developed countries are more likely than individuals
from nondeveloped countries to report that they have experienced
symptoms that meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder in their
lifetime21.

Development and Course Many individuals with generalized anxiety
disorder report that they have felt anxious and nervous all of their
lives. The median age at onset for generalized anxiety disorder is 30
years; however, age at onset is spread over a very broad range19. The
median age at onset is later than that for the other anxiety disorders.
The symptoms of excessive worry and anxiety may occur early in life but
are then manifested as an anxious temperament1, 14. Onset of the
disorder rarely occurs prior to adolescence4. The symptoms of
generalized anxiety disorder tend to be chronic and wax and wane across
the lifespan, fluctuating between syndromal and subsyndromal forms of
the disorder2, 3. Rates of full remission are very low6, 31. The
clinical expression of generalized anxiety disorder is relatively
consistent across the lifespan. The primary difference across age groups
is in the content of the individual's worry. Children and adolescents
tend to worry more about school and sporting performance, whereas older
adults report greater concern about the well-being of family or their
own physical heath. Thus, the content of an individual's worry tends to
be age appropriate. Younger adults experience greater severity of
symptoms than do older adults30.

The earlier in life individuals have symptoms that meet criteria for
generalized anxiety disorder, the more comorbidity they tend to have and
the more impaired they are likely to be7, 22. The advent of chronic
physical disease can be a potent issue for excessive worry in the
elderly. In the frail elderly, worries about safety---and especially
about falling---may limit activities. In those with early cognitive
impairment, what appears to be excessive worry about, for example, the
whereabouts of things is probably better regarded as realistic given the
cognitive impairment. In children and adolescents with generalized
anxiety disorder, the anxieties and worries often concern the quality of
their performance or competence at school or in sporting events, even
when their performance is not being evaluated by others. There may be
excessive concerns about punctuality. They may also worry about
catastrophic events, such as earthquakes or nuclear war. Children with
the disorder may be overly conforming, perfectionist, and unsure of
themselves and tend to redo tasks because of excessive dissatisfaction
with less-than-perfect performance. They are typically overzealous in
seeking reassurance and approval and require excessive reassurance about
their performance and other things they are worried about. Generalized
anxiety disorder may be overdiagnosed in children. When this diagnosis
is being considered in children, a thorough evaluation for the presence
of other childhood anxiety disorders and other mental disorders should
be done to determine whether the worries may be better explained by one
of these disorders. Separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder
(social phobia), and obsessive-compulsive disorder are often accompanied
by worries that may mimic those described in generalized anxiety
disorder. For example, a child with social anxiety disorder may be
concerned about school performance because of fear of humiliation.
Worries about illness may also be better explained by separation anxiety
disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Behavioral inhibition,
negative affectivity (neuroticism), and harm avoidance have been
associated with generalized anxiety disorder4, 10, 24, 27.

Environmental. Although childhood adversities and parental
overprotection have been associated with generalized anxiety disorder4,
10, 24, 27, no environmental factors have been identified as specific to
generalized anxiety disorder or necessary or sufficient for making the
diagnosis. Genetic and physiological. One-third of the risk of
experiencing generalized anxiety disorder is genetic, and these genetic
factors overlap with the risk of neuroticism and are shared with other
anxiety and mood disorders, particularly major depressive disorder8, 12.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues There is considerable cultural
variation in the expression of generalized anxiety disorder. For
example, in some cultures, somatic symptoms predominate in the
expression of the disorder, whereas in other cultures cognitive symptoms
tend to predominate. This difference may be more evident on initial
presentation than subsequently, as more symptoms are reported over time.
There is no information as to whether the propensity for excessive
worrying is related to culture, although the topic being worried about
can be culture specific. It is important to consider the social and
cultural context when evaluating whether worries about certain
situations are excessive23.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues In clinical settings, generalized
anxiety disorder is diagnosed somewhat more frequently in females than
in males (about 55%--60% of those presenting with the disorder are
female). In epidemiological studies, approximately two-thirds are
female. Females and males who experience generalized anxiety disorder
appear to have similar symptoms but demonstrate different patterns of
comorbidity consistent with gender differences in the prevalence of
disorders. In females, comorbidity is largely confined to the anxiety
disorders and unipolar depression, whereas in males, comorbidity is more
likely to extend to the substance use disorders as well20, 29.

Functional Consequences of Generalized Anxiety Disorder Excessive
worrying impairs the individual's capacity to do things quickly and
efficiently, whether at home or at work. The worrying takes time and
energy; the associated symptoms of muscle tension and feeling keyed up
or on edge, tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and disturbed sleep
contribute to the impairment. Importantly the excessive worrying may
impair the ability of individuals with generalized anxiety disorder to
encourage confidence in their children. Generalized anxiety disorder is
associated with significant disability and distress that is independent
of comorbid disorders15, 16, and most noninstitutionalized adults with
the disorder are moderately to seriously disabled. Generalized anxiety
disorder accounts for 110 million disability days per annum in the U.S.
population17, 26.

Differential Diagnosis Anxiety disorder due to another medical
condition. The diagnosis of anxiety disorder associated with another
medical condition should be assigned if the individual's anxiety and
worry are judged, based on history, laboratory findings, or physical
examination, to be a physiological effect of another specific medical
condition (e.g., pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism).
Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. A
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from
generalized anxiety disorder by the fact that a substance or medication
(e.g., a drug of abuse, exposure to a toxin) is judged to be
etiologically related to the anxiety. For example, severe anxiety that
occurs only in the context of heavy coffee consumption would be
diagnosed as caffeine-induced anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder.
Individuals with social anxiety disorder often have anticipatory anxiety
that is focused on upcoming social situations in which they must perform
or be evaluated by others, whereas individuals with generalized anxiety
disorder worry, whether or not they are being evaluated.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Several features distinguish the
excessive worry of generalized anxiety disorder from the obsessional
thoughts of obsessive-compulsive disorder. In generalized anxiety
disorder the focus of the worry is about forthcoming problems, and it is
the excessiveness of the worry about future events that is abnormal. In
obsessive-compulsive disorder, the obsessions are inappropriate ideas
that take the form of intrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images.
Posttraumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorders. Anxiety is
invariably present in posttraumatic stress disorder. Generalized anxiety
disorder is not diagnosed if the anxiety and worry are better explained
by symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Anxiety may also be
present in adjustment disorder, but this residual category should be
used only when the criteria are not met for any other disorder
(including generalized anxiety disorder). Moreover, in adjustment
disorders, the anxiety occurs in response to an identifiable stressor
within 3 months of the onset of the stressor and does not persist for
more than 6 months after the termination of the stressor or its
consequences. Depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders. Although
generalized anxiety/worry is a common associated feature of depressive,
bipolar, and psychotic disorders, generalized anxiety disorder may be
diagnosed comorbidly if the anxiety/worry is sufficiently severe to
warrant clinical attention.

Comorbidity Individuals whose presentation meets criteria for
generalized anxiety disorder are likely to have met, or currently meet,
criteria for other anxiety and unipolar depressive disorders5, 9, 13.
The neuroticism or emotional liability that underpins this pattern of
comorbidity is associated with temperamental antecedents and genetic and
environmental risk factors shared between these disorders8, 18, although
independent pathways are also possible4, 25, 27. Comorbidity with
substance use, conduct, psychotic, neurodevelopmental, and
neurocognitive disorders is less common.

Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria a. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the
clinical picture. b. There is evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2): 1. The symptoms
in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or
withdrawal or after exposure to a medication. 2. The involved
substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion
A. c. The disturbance is not better explained by an anxiety disorder
that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an
independent anxiety disorder could include the following: The symptoms
precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist
for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the
cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other
evidence suggesting the existence of an independent
non-substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder (e.g., a history of
recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes). d. The disturbance
does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. e. The
disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Note:
This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance
intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion
A predominate in the clinical picture and they are sufficiently severe
to warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM
codes for the \[specific substance/medication\]-induced anxiety
disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder
present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use
disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced anxiety disorder, the
4th position character is "1," and

the clinician should record "mild \[substance\] use disorder" before the
substance-induced anxiety disorder (e.g., "mild cocaine use disorder
with cocaine-induced anxiety disorder"). If a moderate or severe
substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced anxiety
disorder, the 4th position character is "2," and the clinician should
record "moderate \[substance\] use disorder" or "severe \[substance\]
use disorder," depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use
disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a
one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is
"9," and the clinician should record only the substance-induced anxiety
disorder. ICD-10-CM ICD-9- With use CM disorder, mild

Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter "Substance-Related and Addictive
Disorders" for diagnoses associated with substance class): With onset
during intoxication: This specifier applies if criteria are met for
intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during
intoxication. With onset during withdrawal: This specifier applies if
criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms
develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal. With onset after
medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of medication
or after a modification or change in use.

Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder begins with the specific
substance (e.g., cocaine, salbutamol) that is presumed to be causing the
anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table
included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For
substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., salbutamol),
the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases in which a
substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class
of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance" should be
used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset
during medication use). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM,
which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder
into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for
the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms
occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use
disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89 lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder,
with onset during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of 304.10 severe
lorazepam use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is
judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety
symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.89
methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during
intoxication; 292.89 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset
after medication use).

ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder
begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, salbutamol) that is
presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is
selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on
the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use
disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
salbutamol), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases
in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid
substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word
"with," followed by the name of the substance-induced anxiety disorder,
followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication,
onset during withdrawal, with onset during medication use). For example,
in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man
with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is F13.280 severe
lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with
onset during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe
lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced anxiety
disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a
one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use
disorder is noted (e.g., F16.980 psilocybin-induced anxiety disorder,
with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged
to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symptoms, each
should be listed separately (e.g., F15.280 severe methylphenidate use
disorder with methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset
during intoxication; F19.980 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with
onset after medication use).

Diagnostic Features The essential features of
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder are prominent symptoms of
panic or anxiety (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the effects
of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin
exposure). The panic or anxiety symptoms must have developed during or
soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a
medication, and the substances or medications must be capable of
producing the symptoms (Criterion B2). Substance/medication-induced

anxiety disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or
another medical condition must have its onset while the individual is
receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if a withdrawal is
associated with the medication). Once the treatment is discontinued, the
panic or anxiety symptoms will usually improve or remit within days to
several weeks to a month (depending on the half-life of the
substance/medication and the presence of withdrawal). The diagnosis of
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should not be given if the
onset of the panic or anxiety symptoms precedes the substance/medication
intoxication or withdrawal, or if the symptoms persist for a substantial
period of time (i.e., usually longer than 1 month) from the time of
severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the panic or anxiety symptoms
persist for substantial periods of time, other causes for the symptoms
should be considered. The substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder
diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance
intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion
A are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to
warrant independent clinical attention.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Panic or anxiety can occur in
association with intoxication with the following classes of substances:
alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, phencyclidine, other hallucinogens,
inhalants, stimulants (including cocaine), and other (or unknown)
substances. Panic or anxiety can occur in association with withdrawal
from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives,
hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other
(or unknown) substances. Some medications that evoke anxiety symptoms
include anesthetics and analgesics, sympathomimetics or other
bronchodilators, anticholinergics, insulin, thyroid preparations, oral
contraceptives, antihistamines, antiparkinsonian medications,
corticosteroids, antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications,
anticonvulsants, lithium carbonate, antipsychotic medications, and
antidepressant medications. Heavy metals and toxins (e.g.,
organophosphate insecticide, nerve gases, carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, volatile substances such as gasoline and paint) may also cause
panic or anxiety symptoms.

Prevalence The prevalence of substance/medication-induced anxiety
disorder is not clear. General population data suggest that it may be
rare, with a 12-month prevalence of approximately 0.002%1. However, in
clinical populations, the prevalence is likely to be higher.

Diagnostic Markers Laboratory assessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may
be useful to measure substance intoxication as part of an assessment for
substance/medicationinduced anxiety disorder.

Differential Diagnosis Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal.
Anxiety symptoms commonly occur in substance intoxication and substance
withdrawal. The diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or
substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the
symptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced
anxiety disorder should be made in addition to substance intoxication or
substance withdrawal when the panic or anxiety symptoms are predominant
in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant
independent clinical attention. For example, panic or anxiety symptoms
are characteristic of alcohol withdrawal. Anxiety disorder (i.e., not
induced by a substance/medication). Substance/medication-induced anxiety
disorder is judged to be etiologically related to the
substance/medication. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is
distinguished from a primary anxiety disorder based on the onset,
course, and other factors with respect to substances/medications. For
drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings for use, intoxication, or
withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorders arise only in
association with intoxication or withdrawal states, whereas primary
anxiety disorders may precede the onset of substance/medication use. The
presence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder,
such as atypical age at onset (e.g., onset of panic disorder after age
45 years) or symptoms (e.g., atypical panic attack symptoms such as true
vertigo, loss of balance, loss of consciousness, loss

of bladder control, headaches, slurred speech) may suggest a
substance/medication-induced etiology. A primary anxiety disorder
diagnosis is warranted if the panic or anxiety symptoms persist for a
substantial period of time (about 1 month or longer) after the end of
the substance intoxication or acute withdrawal or there is a history of
an anxiety disorder. Delirium. If panic or anxiety symptoms occur
exclusively during the course of delirium, they are considered to be an
associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately.
Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. If the panic or
anxiety symptoms are attributed to the physiological consequences of
another medical condition (i.e., rather than to the medication taken for
the medical condition), anxiety disorder due to another medical
condition should be diagnosed. The history often provides the basis for
such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other
medical condition (e.g., medication substitution or discontinuation) may
be needed to determine whether the medication is the causative agent (in
which case the symptoms may be better explained by
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder). If the disturbance is
attributable to both another medical condition and substance use, both
diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder) may be given. When there
is insufficient evidence to determine whether the panic or anxiety
symptoms are attributable to a substance/medication or to another
medical condition or are primary (i.e., not attributable to either a
substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified
or unspecified anxiety disorder would be indicated.

Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition

Diagnostic Criteria

293.84 (F06.4)

a.  Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.
b.  There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
    laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct
    pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.
c.  The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.
d.  The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
    delirium.
e.  The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
    in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
    Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition within
    the name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.84 \[F06.4\] anxiety
    disorder due to pheochromocytoma). The other medical condition
    should be coded and listed separately immediately before the anxiety
    disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 227.0 \[D35.00\]
    pheochromocytoma; 293.84 \[F06.4\] anxiety disorder due to
    pheochromocytoma.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of anxiety disorder due to
another medical condition is clinically significant anxiety that is
judged to be best explained as a physiological effect of another medical
condition. Symptoms can include prominent anxiety symptoms or panic
attacks (Criterion A). The judgment that the symptoms are best explained
by the associated physical condition must be based on evidence from the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B).
Additionally, it must be judged that the symptoms are not better
accounted for by another mental disorder, in particular, adjustment
disorder, with anxiety, in which the stressor is the medical condition
(Criterion C). In this case, an individual with adjustment disorder is
especially distressed about the meaning or the consequences of the
associated medical condition. By contrast, there is often a prominent
physical component to the anxiety (e.g., shortness of breath) when the
anxiety is due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is not made
if the anxiety symptoms occur only during the course of a delirium
(Criterion

D). The anxiety symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning (Criterion E). In determining whether the anxiety symptoms
are attributable to another medical condition, the clinician must first
establish the presence of the medical condition. Furthermore, it must be
established that anxiety symptoms can be etiologically related to the
medical condition through a physiological mechanism before making a
judgment that this is the best explanation for the symptoms in a
specific individual. A careful and comprehensive assessment of multiple
factors is necessary to make this judgment. Several aspects of the
clinical presentation should be considered: 1) the presence of a clear
temporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of
the medical condition and the anxiety symptoms; 2) the presence of
features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder (e.g., atypical
age at onset or course); and 3) evidence in the literature that a known
physiological mechanism (e.g., hyperthyroidism) causes anxiety. In
addition, the disturbance must not be better explained by a primary
anxiety disorder, a substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, or
another primary mental disorder (e.g., adjustment disorder).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis A number of medical conditions
are known to include anxiety as a symptomatic manifestation. Examples
include endocrine disease (e.g., hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma,
hypoglycemia, hyperadrenocortisolism), cardiovascular disorders (e.g.,
congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, arrhythmia such as atrial
fibrillation), respiratory illness (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, asthma, pneumonia), metabolic disturbances (e.g., vitamin B12
deficiency, porphyria), and neurological illness (e.g., neoplasms,
vestibular dysfunction, encephalitis, seizure disorders). Anxiety due to
another medical condition is diagnosed when the medical condition is
known to induce anxiety and when the medical condition preceded the
onset of the anxiety.

Prevalence

The prevalence of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is
unclear. There appears to be an elevated prevalence of anxiety disorders
among individuals with a variety of medical conditions, including
asthma, hypertension, ulcers, and arthritis2. However, this increased
prevalence may be due to reasons other than the anxiety disorder
directly causing the medical condition.

Development and Course The development and course of anxiety disorder
due to another medical condition generally follows the course of the
underlying illness. This diagnosis is not meant to include primary
anxiety disorders that arise in the context of chronic medical illness.
This is important to consider with older adults, who may experience
chronic medical illness and then develop independent anxiety disorders
secondary to the chronic medical illness.

Diagnostic Markers Laboratory assessments and/or medical examinations
are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of the associated medical
condition.

Differential Diagnosis Delirium. A separate diagnosis of anxiety
disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the anxiety
disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. However,
a diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition may be
given in addition to a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder
(dementia) if the etiology of anxiety is judged to be a physiological
consequence of the pathological process causing the neurocognitive
disorder and if anxiety is a prominent part of the clinical
presentation. Mixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood and anxiety).
If the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms, the
specific mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on
which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture.
Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. If there is evidence of
recent or prolonged substance use (including medications with
psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a
toxin, a

substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should be considered.
Certain medications are known to increase anxiety (e.g.,
corticosteroids, estrogens, metoclopramide), and when this is the case,
the medication may be the most likely etiology, although it may be
difficult to distinguish whether the anxiety is attributable to the
medications or to the medical illness itself. When a diagnosis of
substance-induced anxiety is being made in relation to recreational or
nonprescribed drugs, it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug
screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation. Symptoms that occur
during or shortly after (i.e., within 4 weeks of) substance intoxication
or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, depending on the type,
duration, or amount of the substance used. If the disturbance is
associated with both another medical condition and substance use, both
diagnoses (i.e., anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and
substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder) can be given. Features
such as onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms
during a panic attack (e.g., vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of
bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the
possibility that another medical condition or a substance may be causing
the panic attack symptoms. Anxiety disorder (not due to a known medical
condition). Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be
distinguished from other anxiety disorders (especially panic disorder
and generalized anxiety disorder). In other anxiety disorders, no
specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with
another medical condition can be demonstrated. Late age at onset,
atypical symptoms, and the absence of a personal or family history of
anxiety disorders suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out
the diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition.
Anxiety disorders can exacerbate or pose increased risk for medical
conditions such as cardiovascular events and myocardial infarction and
should not be diagnosed as anxiety disorder due to another medical
condition in these cases1, 3, 4. Illness anxiety disorder. Anxiety
disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from
illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by
worry about illness, concern about pain, and bodily preoccupations. In
the case of illness anxiety disorder,

individuals may or may not have diagnosed medical conditions. Although
an individual with illness anxiety disorder and a diagnosed medical
condition is likely to experience anxiety about the medical condition,
the medical condition is not physiologically related to the anxiety
symptoms. Adjustment disorders. Anxiety disorder due to another medical
condition should be distinguished from adjustment disorders, with
anxiety, or with anxiety and depressed mood. Adjustment disorder is
warranted when individuals experience a maladaptive response to the
stress of having another medical condition. The reaction to stress
usually concerns the meaning or consequences of the stress, as compared
with the experience of anxiety or mood symptoms that occur as a
physiological consequence of the other medical condition. In adjustment
disorder, the anxiety symptoms are typically related to coping with the
stress of having a general medical condition, whereas in anxiety
disorder due to another medical condition, individuals are more likely
to have prominent physical symptoms and to be focused on issues other
than the stress of the illness itself. Associated feature of another
mental disorder. Anxiety symptoms may be an associated feature of
another mental disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa). Other
specified or unspecified anxiety disorder. This diagnosis is given if it
cannot be determined whether the anxiety symptoms are primary,
substance-induced, or associated with another medical condition.

Other Specified Anxiety Disorder 300.09 (F41.8) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an anxiety disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the anxiety
disorders diagnostic class. The other specified anxiety disorder
category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to
communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for any specific anxiety disorder. This is done by recording
"other specified anxiety disorder" followed by the specific reason
(e.g., "generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not"). Examples
of presentations that can be specified using the "other specified"
designation include the following: 1. Limited-symptom attacks. 2.
Generalized anxiety not occurring more days than not. 3. Khyâl cap (wind
attacks): See "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress" in the
Appendix. 4. Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves): See "Glossary of
Cultural Concepts of Distress" in the Appendix.

Unspecified Anxiety Disorder 300.00 (F41.9) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an anxiety disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate

but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the
anxiety disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified anxiety disorder
category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific anxiety
disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room
settings).

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders Obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders include obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD), body
dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling
disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder,
substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition, and other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
and unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e.g.,
bodyfocused repetitive behavior disorder, obsessional jealousy). OCD is
characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions.
Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that
are experienced as intrusive and unwanted, whereas compulsions are
repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to
perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be
applied rigidly. Some other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
are also characterized by preoccupations and by repetitive behaviors or
mental acts in response to the preoccupations. Other
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are characterized primarily
by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., hair pulling, skin
picking) and repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behaviors. The
inclusion of a chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in
DSM-5 reflects the increasing evidence of these disorders' relatedness
to one another in terms of a range of diagnostic validators as well as
the clinical utility of grouping these disorders in the same chapter.
Clinicians are encouraged to screen for these conditions in individuals
who present with one of them and be aware of overlaps between these
conditions. At the same time, there are important differences in
diagnostic validators and treatment approaches across these disorders.
Moreover, there are close relationships between the anxiety disorders
and some of the obsessivecompulsive and related disorders (e.g., OCD),
which is reflected in the

sequence of DSM-5 chapters, with obsessive-compulsive and related
disorders following anxiety disorders. The obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders differ from developmentally normative preoccupations
and rituals by being excessive or persisting beyond developmentally
appropriate periods. The distinction between the presence of subclinical
symptoms and a clinical disorder requires assessment of a number of
factors, including the individual's level of distress and impairment in
functioning. The chapter begins with OCD. It then covers body dysmorphic
disorder and hoarding disorder, which are characterized by cognitive
symptoms such as perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance or
the perceived need to save possessions, respectively. The chapter then
covers trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation
(skin-picking) disorder, which are characterized by recurrent
body-focused repetitive behaviors. Finally, it covers
substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition, and other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
and unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. While the
specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies among individuals,
certain symptom dimensions are common in OCD, including those of
cleaning (contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry
(symmetry obsessions and repeating, ordering, and counting compulsions);
forbidden or taboo thoughts (e.g., aggressive, sexual, and religious
obsessions and related compulsions); and harm (e.g., fears of harm to
oneself or others and related checking compulsions). The tic-related
specifier of OCD is used when an individual has a current or past
history of a tic disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by
preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical
appearance that are not observable or appear only slight to others, and
by repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin
picking, or reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing one's
appearance with that of other people) in response to the appearance
concerns. The appearance preoccupations are not better explained by
concerns with body fat or weight in an individual with an eating
disorder. Muscle dysmorphia is a form of body dysmorphic disorder that
is characterized by the belief that one's body build is too small or is
insufficiently muscular.

Hoarding disorder is characterized by persistent difficulty discarding
or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value, as a
result of a strong perceived need to save the items and to distress
associated with discarding them. Hoarding disorder differs from normal
collecting. For example, symptoms of hoarding disorder result in the
accumulation of a large number of possessions that congest and clutter
active living areas to the extent that their intended use is
substantially compromised. The excessive acquisition form of hoarding
disorder, which characterizes most but not all individuals with hoarding
disorder, consists of excessive collecting, buying, or stealing of items
that are not needed or for which there is no available space.
Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) is characterized by recurrent
pulling out of one's hair resulting in hair loss, and repeated attempts
to decrease or stop hair pulling. Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder is
characterized by recurrent picking of one's skin resulting in skin
lesions and repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking. The
body-focused repetitive behaviors that characterize these two disorders
are not triggered by obsessions or preoccupations; however, they may be
preceded or accompanied by various emotional states, such as feelings of
anxiety or boredom. They may also be preceded by an increasing sense of
tension or may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief
when the hair is pulled out or the skin is picked. Individuals with
these disorders may have varying degrees of conscious awareness of the
behavior while engaging in it, with some individuals displaying more
focused attention on the behavior (with preceding tension and subsequent
relief) and other individuals displaying more automatic behavior (with
the behaviors seeming to occur without full awareness).
Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
consists of symptoms that are due to substance intoxication or
withdrawal or to a medication. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
due to another medical condition involves symptoms characteristic of
obsessivecompulsive and related disorders that are the direct
pathophysiological consequence of a medical disorder. Other specified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder and unspecified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder consist of symptoms that do
not meet criteria for a specific obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder because of atypical presentation or uncertain etiology; these
categories are also used for other specific

syndromes that are not listed in Section II and when insufficient
information is available to diagnose the presentation as another
obsessivecompulsive and related disorder. Examples of specific syndromes
not listed in Section II, and therefore diagnosed as other specified
obsessivecompulsive and related disorder or as unspecified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder include body-focused
repetitive behavior disorder and obsessional jealousy.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders that have a cognitive
component have insight as the basis for specifiers; in each of these
disorders, insight ranges from "good or fair insight" to "poor insight"
to "absent insight/delusional beliefs" with respect to disorder-related
beliefs. For individuals whose obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
symptoms warrant the "with absent insight/delusional beliefs" specifier,
these symptoms should not be diagnosed as a psychotic disorder.

1.  Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are
    experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and
    unwanted, and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or
    distress.
2.  The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges,
    or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action
    (i.e., by performing a compulsion). Compulsions are defined by (1)
    and (2):
3.  Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or
    mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that
    the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession
    or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.
4.  The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing
    anxiety or distress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation;
    however, these behaviors or mental acts are not

connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize
or prevent, or are clearly excessive. Note: Young children may not be
able to articulate the aims of these behaviors or mental acts. b. The
obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1
hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. c. The
obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological
effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another
medical condition. d. The disturbance is not better explained by the
symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., excessive worries, as in
generalized anxiety disorder; preoccupation with appearance, as in body
dysmorphic disorder; difficulty discarding or parting with possessions,
as in hoarding disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania
\[hair-pulling disorder\]; skin picking, as in excoriation
\[skin-picking\] disorder; stereotypies, as in stereotypic movement
disorder; ritualized eating behavior, as in eating disorders;
preoccupation with substances or gambling, as in substance-related and
addictive disorders; preoccupation with having an illness, as in illness
anxiety disorder; sexual urges or fantasies, as in paraphilic disorders;
impulses, as in disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders;
guilty ruminations, as in major depressive disorder; thought insertion
or delusional preoccupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum and other
psychotic disorders; or repetitive patterns of behavior, as in autism
spectrum disorder). Specify if: With good or fair insight: The
individual recognizes that obsessivecompulsive disorder beliefs are
definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true.
With poor insight: The individual thinks obsessive-compulsive disorder
beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The
individual is completely convinced that obsessive-compulsive disorder
beliefs are true.

Specify if: Tic-related: The individual has a current or past history of
a tic disorder.

Specifiers Many individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
have dysfunctional beliefs. These beliefs can include an inflated sense
of responsibility and the tendency to overestimate threat; perfectionism
and intolerance of uncertainty; and over-importance of thoughts (e.g.,
believing that having a forbidden thought is as bad as acting on it) and
the need to control thoughts18. Individuals with OCD vary in the degree
of insight they have about the accuracy of the beliefs that underlie
their obsessive-compulsive symptoms6, 22. Many individuals have good or
fair insight (e.g., the individual believes that the house definitely
will not, probably will not, or may or may not burn down if the stove is
not checked 30 times). Some have poor insight (e.g., the individual
believes that the house will probably burn down if the stove is not
checked 30 times), and a few (4% or less) have absent insight/delusional
beliefs (e.g., the individual is convinced that the house will burn down
if the stove is not checked 30 times). Insight can vary within an
individual over the course of the illness. Poorer insight has been
linked to worse long-term outcome. Up to 30% of individuals with OCD
have a lifetime tic disorder. This is most common in males with onset of
OCD in childhood. These individuals tend to differ from those without a
history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD symptoms,
comorbidity, course, and pattern of familial transmission12.

Diagnostic Features The characteristic symptoms of OCD are the presence
of obsessions and compulsions (Criterion A). Obsessions are repetitive
and persistent thoughts (e.g., of contamination), images (e.g., of
violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e.g., to stab someone).
Importantly, obsessions are not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary:
they are intrusive and unwanted and cause marked distress or anxiety in
most individuals. The individual attempts to

ignore or suppress these obsessions (e.g., avoiding triggers or using
thought suppression) or to neutralize them with another thought or
action (e.g., performing a compulsion). Compulsions (or rituals) are
repetitive behaviors (e.g., washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g.,
counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to
perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be
applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD have both obsessions and
compulsions6. Compulsions are typically performed in response to an
obsession (e.g., thoughts of contamination leading to washing rituals or
that something is incorrect leading to repeating rituals until it feels
"just right"). The aim is to reduce the distress triggered by obsessions
or to prevent a feared event (e.g., becoming ill). However, these
compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared
event (e.g., arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved
one) or are clearly excessive (e.g., showering for hours each day).
Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some individuals
experience relief from anxiety or distress. Criterion B emphasizes that
obsessions and compulsions must be timeconsuming (e.g., more than 1 hour
per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment to
warrant a diagnosis of OCD. This criterion helps to distinguish the
disorder from the occasional intrusive thoughts or repetitive behaviors
that are common in the general population (e.g., double-checking that a
door is locked). The frequency and severity of obsessions and
compulsions vary across individuals with OCD (e.g., some have mild to
moderate symptoms, spending 1--3 hours per day obsessing or doing
compulsions, whereas others have nearly constant intrusive thoughts or
compulsions that can be incapacitating).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The specific content of
obsessions and compulsions varies between individuals. However, certain
themes, or dimensions, are common, including those of cleaning
(contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry (symmetry
obsessions and repeating, ordering, and counting compulsions); forbidden
or taboo thoughts (e.g., aggressive, sexual, or religious obsessions and
related compulsions); and harm (e.g., fears of harm to oneself or others
and checking compulsions). Some individuals also have difficulties
discarding and accumulate (hoard) objects as a consequence of typical
obsessions and compulsions, such as fears of

harming others16, 21. These themes occur across different cultures, are
relatively consistent over time in adults with the disorder, and may be
associated with different neural substrates12. Importantly, individuals
often have symptoms in more than one dimension. Individuals with OCD
experience a range of affective responses when confronted with
situations that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, many
individuals experience marked anxiety that can include recurrent panic
attacks. Others report strong feelings of disgust. While performing
compulsions, some individuals report a distressing sense of
"incompleteness" or uneasiness until things look, feel, or sound "just
right." It is common for individuals with the disorder to avoid people,
places, and things that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example,
individuals with contamination concerns might avoid public situations
(e.g., restaurants, public restrooms) to reduce exposure to feared
contaminants; individuals with intrusive thoughts about causing harm
might avoid social interactions.

Prevalence The 12-month prevalence of OCD in the United States is
1.2%11, 25, with a similar prevalence internationally (1.1%--1.8%)31.
Females are affected at a slightly higher rate than males in adulthood,
although males are more commonly affected in childhood25, 31.

Development and Course In the United States, the mean age at onset of
OCD is 19.5 years, and 25% of cases start by age 14 years11, 25. Onset
after age 35 years is unusual but does occur. Males have an earlier age
at onset than females: nearly 25% of males have onset before age 10
years25. The onset of symptoms is typically gradual; however, acute
onset has also been reported. If OCD is untreated, the course is usually
chronic, often with waxing and waning symptoms23, 27. Some individuals
have an episodic course, and a minority have a deteriorating course.
Without treatment, remission rates in adults are low (e.g., 20% for
those reevaluated 40 years later)27. Onset in childhood or adolescence
can lead to a lifetime of OCD. However, 40% of individuals with onset of
OCD in childhood or adolescence may experience remission by early
adulthood28. The course of OCD is often complicated by

the co-occurrence of other disorders (see section "Comorbidity" for this
disorder). Compulsions are more easily diagnosed in children than
obsessions are because compulsions are observable. However, most
children have both obsessions and compulsions (as do most adults). The
pattern of symptoms in adults can be stable over time, but it is more
variable in children15, 24, 29. Some differences in the content of
obsessions and compulsions have been reported when children and
adolescent samples have been compared with adult samples7, 9. These
differences likely reflect content appropriate to different
developmental stages (e.g., higher rates of sexual and religious
obsessions in adolescents than in children; higher rates of harm
obsessions \[e.g., fears of catastrophic events, such as death or
illness to self or loved ones\] in children and adolescents than in
adults).

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Greater internalizing
symptoms, higher negative emotionality, and behavioral inhibition in
childhood are possible temperamental risk factors4, 8. Environmental.
Physical and sexual abuse in childhood and other stressful or traumatic
events have been associated with an increased risk for developing OCD8.
Some children may develop the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive
symptoms, which has been associated with different environmental
factors, including various infectious agents and a postinfectious
autoimmune syndrome26, 30. Genetic and physiological. The rate of OCD
among first-degree relatives of adults with OCD is approximately two
times that among first-degree relatives of those without the disorder;
however, among first-degree relatives of individuals with onset of OCD
in childhood or adolescence, the rate is increased 10-fold20. Familial
transmission is due in part to genetic factors (e.g., a concordance rate
of 0.57 for monozygotic vs. 0.22 for dizygotic twins)20. Dysfunction in
the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and striatum have
been most strongly implicated17.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

OCD occurs across the world. There is substantial similarity across
cultures in the gender distribution, age at onset, and comorbidity of
OCD13. Moreover, around the globe, there is a similar symptom structure
involving cleaning, symmetry, hoarding, taboo thoughts, or fear of
harm3. However, regional variation in symptom expression exists, and
cultural factors may shape the content of obsessions and compulsions.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Males have an earlier age at onset of
OCD than females and are more likely to have comorbid tic disorders.
Gender differences in the pattern of symptom dimensions have been
reported, with, for example, females more likely to have symptoms in the
cleaning dimension and males more likely to have symptoms in the
forbidden thoughts and symmetry dimensions. Onset or exacerbation of
OCD, as well as symptoms that can interfere with the mother-infant
relationship (e.g., aggressive obsessions leading to avoidance of the
infant), have been reported in the peripartum period.

Suicide Risk Suicidal thoughts occur at some point in as many as about
half of individuals with OCD. Suicide attempts are also reported in up
to onequarter of individuals with OCD; the presence of comorbid major
depressive disorder increases the risk.

Functional Consequences Compulsive Disorder

of

Obsessive-

OCD is associated with reduced quality of life as well as high levels of
social and occupational impairment. Impairment occurs across many
different domains of life and is associated with symptom severity.
Impairment can be caused by the time spent obsessing and doing
compulsions. Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions or
compulsions can also severely restrict functioning. In addition,
specific symptoms can create specific obstacles. For example, obsessions
about harm can make relationships with family and friends feel
hazardous; the result can be avoidance of these relationships.
Obsessions about symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or
work projects because the project never feels "just right," potentially
resulting in school failure or job

loss. Health consequences can also occur. For example, individuals with
contamination concerns may avoid doctors' offices and hospitals (e.g.,
because of fears of exposure to germs) or develop dermatological
problems (e.g., skin lesions due to excessive washing). Sometimes the
symptoms of the disorder interfere with its own treatment (e.g., when
medications are considered contaminated). When the disorder starts in
childhood or adolescence, individuals may experience developmental
difficulties. For example, adolescents may avoid socializing with peers;
young adults may struggle when they leave home to live independently.
The result can be few significant relationships outside the family and a
lack of autonomy and financial independence from their family of origin.
In addition, some individuals with OCD try to impose rules and
prohibitions on family members because of their disorder (e.g., no one
in the family can have visitors to the house for fear of contamination),
and this can lead to family dysfunction.

Differential Diagnosis Anxiety disorders. Recurrent thoughts, avoidant
behaviors, and repetitive requests for reassurance can also occur in
anxiety disorders. However, the recurrent thoughts that are present in
generalized anxiety disorder (i.e., worries) are usually about real-life
concerns, whereas the obsessions of OCD usually do not involve real-life
concerns and can include content that is odd, irrational, or of a
seemingly magical nature; moreover, compulsions are often present and
usually linked to the obsessions. Like individuals with OCD, individuals
with specific phobia can have a fear reaction to specific objects or
situations; however, in specific phobia the feared object is usually
much more circumscribed, and rituals are not present. In social anxiety
disorder (social phobia), the feared objects or situations are limited
to social interactions, and avoidance or reassurance seeking is focused
on reducing this social fear. Major depressive disorder. OCD can be
distinguished from the rumination of major depressive disorder, in which
thoughts are usually mood-congruent and not necessarily experienced as
intrusive or distressing; moreover, ruminations are not linked to
compulsions, as is typical in OCD. Other obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders. In body dysmorphic disorder, the obsessions and
compulsions are limited to concerns about

physical appearance; and in trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder),
the compulsive behavior is limited to hair pulling in the absence of
obsessions. Hoarding disorder symptoms focus exclusively on the
persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, marked
distress associated with discarding items, and excessive accumulation of
objects. However, if an individual has obsessions that are typical of
OCD (e.g., concerns about incompleteness or harm), and these obsessions
lead to compulsive hoarding behaviors (e.g., acquiring all objects in a
set to attain a sense of completeness or not discarding old newspapers
because they may contain information that could prevent harm), a
diagnosis of OCD should be given instead. Eating disorders. OCD can be
distinguished from anorexia nervosa in that in OCD the obsessions and
compulsions are not limited to concerns about weight and food. Tics (in
tic disorder) and stereotyped movements. A tic is a sudden, rapid,
recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e.g., eye
blinking, throat clearing). A stereotyped movement is a repetitive,
seemingly driven, nonfunctional motor behavior (e.g., head banging, body
rocking, self-biting). Tics and stereotyped movements are typically less
complex than compulsions and are not aimed at neutralizing obsessions.
However, distinguishing between complex tics and compulsions can be
difficult. Whereas compulsions are usually preceded by obsessions, tics
are often preceded by premonitory sensory urges. Some individuals have
symptoms of both OCD and a tic disorder, in which case both diagnoses
may be warranted. Psychotic disorders. Some individuals with OCD have
poor insight or even delusional OCD beliefs. However, they have
obsessions and compulsions (distinguishing their condition from
delusional disorder) and do not have other features of schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder (e.g., hallucinations or formal thought
disorder). Other compulsive-like behaviors. Certain behaviors are
sometimes described as "compulsive," including sexual behavior (in the
case of paraphilias), gambling (i.e., gambling disorder), and substance
use (e.g., alcohol use disorder). However, these behaviors differ from
the compulsions of OCD in that the person usually derives pleasure from
the

activity and may wish to resist it only because of its deleterious
consequences. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Although
obsessivecompulsive personality disorder and OCD have similar names, the
clinical manifestations of these disorders are quite different.
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not characterized by
intrusive thoughts, images, or urges or by repetitive behaviors that are
performed in response to these intrusions; instead, it involves an
enduring and pervasive maladaptive pattern of excessive perfectionism
and rigid control. If an individual manifests symptoms of both OCD and
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, both diagnoses can be given.

Comorbidity Individuals with OCD often have other psychopathology. Many
adults with the disorder have a lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety
disorder (76%; e.g., panic disorder, social anxiety disorder,
generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia) or a depressive or
bipolar disorder (63% for any depressive or bipolar disorder, with the
most common being major depressive disorder \[41%\])25. Onset of OCD is
usually later than for most comorbid anxiety disorders (with the
exception of separation anxiety disorder) and PTSD but often precedes
that of depressive disorders25. Comorbid obsessivecompulsive personality
disorder is also common in individuals with OCD (e.g., ranging from 23%
to 32%)5. Up to 30% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic
disorder. A comorbid tic disorder is most common in males with onset of
OCD in childhood. These individuals tend to differ from those without a
history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD symptoms,
comorbidity, course, and pattern of familial transmission12. A triad of
OCD, tic disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can also
be seen in children. Disorders that occur more frequently in individuals
with OCD than in those without the disorder include several
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders such as body dysmorphic
disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation
(skin-picking) disorder2, 14. Finally, an association between OCD and
some disorders characterized by impulsivity, such as oppositional
defiant disorder, has been reported25.

OCD is also much more common in individuals with certain other disorders
than would be expected based on its prevalence in the general
population; when one of those other disorders is diagnosed, the
individual should be assessed for OCD as well. For example, in
individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the
prevalence of OCD is approximately 12%1. Rates of OCD are also elevated
in bipolar disorder19, eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and
bulimia nervosa10, and Tourette's disorder19.

Body Dysmorphic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

300.7 (F45.22)

a.  Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in
    physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to
    others.
b.  At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has
    performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive
    grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g.,
    comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in response to
    the appearance concerns.
c.  The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or
    impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
    functioning.
d.  The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns
    with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet
    diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. Specify if: With muscle
    dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or
    her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This
    specifier is used even if the individual is preoccupied with other
    body areas, which is often the case. Specify if: Indicate degree of
    insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., "I look
    ugly" or "I look deformed"). With good or fair insight: The
    individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are
    definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true.
    With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic
    disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional
    beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that the body
    dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true.

Diagnostic Features

Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (formerly known as
dysmorphophobia) are preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or
flaws in their physical appearance, which they believe look ugly,
unattractive, abnormal, or deformed (Criterion A). The perceived flaws
are not observable or appear only slight to other individuals. Concerns
range from looking "unattractive" or "not right" to looking "hideous" or
"like a monster." Preoccupations can focus on one or many body areas,
most commonly the skin (e.g., perceived acne, scars, lines, wrinkles,
paleness), hair (e.g., "thinning" hair or "excessive" body or facial
hair), or nose (e.g., size or shape)23. However, any body area can be
the focus of concern (e.g., eyes, teeth, weight, stomach, breasts, legs,
face size or shape, lips, chin, eyebrows, genitals). Some individuals
are concerned about perceived asymmetry of body areas23. The
preoccupations are intrusive, unwanted, time-consuming (occurring, on
average, 3--8 hours per day), and usually difficult to resist or
control23. Excessive repetitive behaviors or mental acts (e.g.,
comparing) are performed in response to the preoccupation (Criterion B).
The individual feels driven to perform these behaviors, which are not
pleasurable and may increase anxiety and dysphoria23, 25, 26. They are
typically time-consuming and difficult to resist or control23. Common
behaviors are comparing one's appearance with that of other individuals;
repeatedly checking perceived defects in mirrors or other reflecting
surfaces or examining them directly; excessively grooming (e.g.,
combing, styling, shaving, plucking, or pulling hair); camouflaging
(e.g., repeatedly applying makeup or covering disliked areas with such
things as a hat, clothing, makeup, or hair); seeking reassurance about
how the perceived flaws look; touching disliked areas to check them;
excessively exercising or weight lifting; and seeking cosmetic
procedures. Some individuals excessively tan (e.g., to darken "pale"
skin or diminish perceived acne), repeatedly change their clothes (e.g.,
to camouflage perceived defects), or compulsively shop (e.g., for beauty
products)23. Compulsive skin picking intended to improve perceived skin
defects is common and can cause skin damage, infections, or ruptured
blood vessels9. The preoccupation must cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning (Criterion C); usually both are present. Body dysmorphic
disorder must be differentiated from an eating disorder.

Muscle dysmorphia, a form of body dysmorphic disorder occurring almost
exclusively in males, consists of preoccupation with the idea that one's
body is too small or insufficiently lean or muscular23. Individuals with
this form of the disorder actually have a normal-looking body or are
even very muscular. They may also be preoccupied with other body areas,
such as skin or hair23. A majority (but not all) diet, exercise, and/or
lift weights excessively, sometimes causing bodily damage23. Some use
potentially dangerous anabolic-androgenic steroids and other substances
to try to make their body bigger and more muscular23. Body dysmorphic
disorder by proxy is a form of body dysmorphic disorder in which
individuals are preoccupied with defects they perceive in another
person's appearance. Insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs
can range from good to absent/delusional (i.e., delusional beliefs
consisting of complete conviction that the individual's view of their
appearance is accurate and undistorted)23. On average, insight is poor;
one-third or more of individuals currently have delusional body
dysmorphic disorder beliefs22. Individuals with delusional body
dysmorphic disorder tend to have greater morbidity in some areas (e.g.,
suicidality), but this appears accounted for by their tendency to have
more severe body dysmorphic disorder symptoms.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Many individuals with body
dysmorphic disorder have ideas or delusions of reference, believing that
other people take special notice of them or mock them because of how
they look21. Body dysmorphic disorder is associated with high levels of
anxiety, social anxiety, social avoidance, depressed mood, neuroticism,
and perfectionism as well as low extroversion and low self-esteem4, 18,
23. Many individuals are ashamed of their appearance and their excessive
focus on how they look, and are reluctant to reveal their concerns to
others5, 13. A majority of individuals receive cosmetic treatment to try
to improve their perceived defects6. Dermatological treatment and
surgery are most common, but any type (e.g., dental, electrolysis) may
be received7, 19. Occasionally, individuals may perform surgery on
themselves6. Body dysmorphic disorder appears to respond poorly to such
treatments and sometimes becomes worse6. Some individuals take legal

action or are violent toward the clinician because they are dissatisfied
with the cosmetic outcome. Body dysmorphic disorder has been associated
with executive dysfunction and visual processing abnormalities, with a
bias for analyzing and encoding details rather than holistic or
configural aspects of visual stimuli10, 11, 12, 14, 22. Individuals with
this disorder tend to have a bias for negative and threatening
interpretations of facial expressions and ambiguous scenarios22.

Prevalence The point prevalence among U.S. adults is 2.4% (2.5% in
females and 2.2% in males)15. Outside the United States (i.e., Germany),
current prevalence is approximately 1.7%--1.8%, with a gender
distribution similar to that in the United States4, 24. The current
prevalence is 9%--15% among dermatology patients, 7%--8% among U.S.
cosmetic surgery patients, 3%--16% among international cosmetic surgery
patients (most studies), 8% among adult orthodontia patients, and 10%
among patients presenting for oral or maxillofacial surgery6.

Development and Course The mean age at disorder onset is 16--17 years,
the median age at onset is 15 years, and the most common age at onset is
12--13 years23. Two-thirds of individuals have disorder onset before age
1823. Subclinical body dysmorphic disorder symptoms begin, on average,
at age 12 or 13 years20. Subclinical concerns usually evolve gradually
to the full disorder, although some individuals experience abrupt onset
of body dysmorphic disorder20. The disorder appears to usually be
chronic, although improvement is likely when evidence-based treatment is
received22. The disorder's clinical features appear largely similar in
children/adolescents and adults23. Body dysmorphic disorder occurs in
the elderly, but little is known about the disorder in this age group23.
Individuals with disorder onset before age 18 years are more likely to
attempt suicide, have more comorbidity, and have gradual (rather than
acute) disorder onset than those with adult-onset body dysmorphic
disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Body dysmorphic disorder has
been associated with high rates of childhood neglect and abuse22.
Genetic and physiological. The prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder is
elevated in first-degree relatives of individuals with
obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD)1, 2.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Body dysmorphic disorder has been
reported internationally. It appears that the disorder may have more
similarities than differences across races and cultures but that
cultural values and preferences may influence symptom content to some
degree23. Taijin kyofusho, included in the traditional Japanese
diagnostic system, has a subtype similar to body dysmorphic disorder:
shubo-kyofu ("the phobia of a deformed body")23.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Females and males appear to have more
similarities than differences in terms of most clinical features---for
example, disliked body areas, types of repetitive behaviors, symptom
severity, suicidality, comorbidity, illness course, and receipt of
cosmetic procedures for body dysmorphic disorder23. However, males are
more likely to have genital preoccupations, and females are more likely
to have a comorbid eating disorder23. Muscle dysmorphia occurs almost
exclusively in males23.

Suicide Risk Rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are high in
both adults and children/adolescents with body dysmorphic disorder4, 17.
Furthermore, risk for suicide appears high in adolescents23. A
substantial proportion of individuals attribute suicidal ideation or
suicide attempts primarily to their appearance concerns4, 17.
Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have many risk factors for
completed suicide, such as high rates of suicidal ideation and suicide
attempts, demographic characteristics associated with suicide, and high
rates of comorbid major depressive disorder17.

Functional Consequences of Body Dysmorphic Disorder Nearly all
individuals with body dysmorphic disorder experience impaired
psychosocial functioning because of their appearance concerns9.
Impairment can range from moderate (e.g., avoidance of some social
situations) to extreme and incapacitating (e.g., being completely
housebound). On average, psychosocial functioning and quality of life
are markedly poor21, 23. More severe body dysmorphic disorder symptoms
are associated with poorer functioning and quality of life23. Most
individuals experience impairment in their job, academic, or role
functioning (e.g., as a parent or caregiver), which is often severe
(e.g., performing poorly, missing school or work, not working)21. About
20% of youths with body dysmorphic disorder report dropping out of
school primarily because of their body dysmorphic disorder symptoms9.
Impairment in social functioning (e.g., social activities,
relationships, intimacy), including avoidance, is common8, 16.
Individuals may be housebound because of their body dysmorphic disorder
symptoms, sometimes for years9. A high proportion of adults and
adolescents have been psychiatrically hospitalized9.

Differential Diagnosis Normal appearance concerns and clearly noticeable
physical defects. Body dysmorphic disorder differs from normal
appearance concerns in being characterized by excessive
appearance-related preoccupations and repetitive behaviors that are
time-consuming, are usually difficult to resist or control, and cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Physical
defects that are clearly noticeable (i.e., not slight) are not diagnosed
as body dysmorphic disorder. However, skin picking as a symptom of body
dysmorphic disorder can cause noticeable skin lesions and scarring9, in
such cases, body dysmorphic disorder should be diagnosed. Eating
disorders. In an individual with an eating disorder, concerns about
being fat are considered a symptom of the eating disorder rather than
body dysmorphic disorder. However, weight concerns may occur in body

dysmorphic disorder. Eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder can
be comorbid, in which case both should be diagnosed. Other
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. The preoccupations and
repetitive behaviors of body dysmorphic disorder differ from obsessions
and compulsions in OCD in that the former focus only on appearance.
These disorders have other differences, such as poorer insight in body
dysmorphic disorder22. When skin picking is intended to improve the
appearance of perceived skin defects, body dysmorphic disorder, rather
than excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, is diagnosed. When hair
removal (plucking, pulling, or other types of removal) is intended to
improve perceived defects in the appearance of facial or body hair, body
dysmorphic disorder is diagnosed rather than trichotillomania
(hair-pulling disorder). Illness anxiety disorder. Individuals with body
dysmorphic disorder are not preoccupied with having or acquiring a
serious illness and do not have particularly elevated levels of
somatization23. Major depressive disorder. The prominent preoccupation
with appearance and excessive repetitive behaviors in body dysmorphic
disorder differentiate it from major depressive disorder. However, major
depressive disorder and depressive symptoms are common in individuals
with body dysmorphic disorder23, often appearing to be secondary to the
distress and impairment that body dysmorphic disorder causes. Body
dysmorphic disorder should be diagnosed in depressed individuals if
diagnostic criteria for body dysmorphic disorder are met. Anxiety
disorders. Social anxiety and avoidance are common in body dysmorphic
disorder22. However, unlike social anxiety disorder (social phobia),
agoraphobia, and avoidant personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder
includes prominent appearance-related preoccupation, which may be
delusional, and repetitive behaviors, and the social anxiety and
avoidance are due to concerns about perceived appearance defects and the
belief or fear that other people will consider these individuals ugly,
ridicule them, or reject them because of their physical features. Unlike
generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety and worry in body dysmorphic
disorder focus on perceived appearance flaws. Psychotic disorders. Many
individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have delusional appearance
beliefs (i.e., complete conviction that their view

of their perceived defects is accurate)23, which is diagnosed as body
dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs, not as
delusional disorder. Appearance-related ideas or delusions of reference
are common in body dysmorphic disorder21, however, unlike schizophrenia
or schizoaffective disorder, body dysmorphic disorder involves prominent
appearance preoccupations and related repetitive behaviors, and
disorganized behavior and other psychotic symptoms are absent (except
for appearance beliefs, which may be delusional). Other disorders and
symptoms. Body dysmorphic disorder should not be diagnosed if the
preoccupation is limited to discomfort with or a desire to be rid of
one's primary and/or secondary sex characteristics in an individual with
gender dysphoria or if the preoccupation focuses on the belief that one
emits a foul or offensive body odor as in olfactory reference syndrome
(which is not a DSM-5 disorder). Body identity integrity disorder
(apotemnophilia) (which is not a DSM-5 disorder) involves a desire to
have a limb amputated to correct an experience of mismatch between a
person's sense of body identity and his or her actual anatomy. However,
the concern does not focus on the limb's appearance, as it would in body
dysmorphic disorder23. Koro, a culturally related disorder that usually
occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, consists of a fear that the
penis (labia, nipples, or breasts in females) is shrinking or retracting
and will disappear into the abdomen, often accompanied by a belief that
death will result. Koro differs from body dysmorphic disorder in several
ways, including a focus on death rather than preoccupation with
perceived ugliness23. Dysmorphic concern (which is not a DSM-5 disorder)
is a much broader construct than, and is not equivalent to, body
dysmorphic disorder. It involves symptoms reflecting an overconcern with
slight or imagined flaws in appearance.

Comorbidity Major depressive disorder is the most common comorbid
disorder, with onset usually after that of body dysmorphic disorder22.
Comorbid social anxiety disorder (social phobia), OCD, and
substance-related disorders are also common21, 22.

Hoarding Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

300.3 (F42)

a.  Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions,
    regardless of their actual value.
b.  This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to
    distress associated with discarding them.
c.  The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of
    possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and
    substantially compromises their intended use. If living areas are
    uncluttered, it is only because of the interventions of third
    parties (e.g., family members, cleaners, authorities).
d.  The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
    social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
    (including maintaining a safe environment for self and others).
e.  The hoarding is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g.,
    brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, Prader-Willi syndrome).
f.  The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of another
    mental disorder (e.g., obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder,
    decreased energy in major depressive disorder, delusions in
    schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, cognitive deficits in
    major neurocognitive disorder, restricted interests in autism
    spectrum disorder). Specify if: With excessive acquisition: If
    difficulty discarding possessions is accompanied by excessive
    acquisition of items that are not needed or for which there is no
    available space. Specify if: With good or fair insight: The
    individual recognizes that hoardingrelated beliefs and behaviors
    (pertaining to difficulty discarding items,

clutter, or excessive acquisition) are problematic. With poor insight:
The individual is mostly convinced that hoardingrelated beliefs and
behaviors (pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or
excessive acquisition) are not problematic despite evidence to the
contrary. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is
completely convinced that hoarding-related beliefs and behaviors
(pertaining to difficulty discarding items, clutter, or excessive
acquisition) are not problematic despite evidence to the contrary.

Specifiers With excessive acquisition. Approximately 80%--90% of
individuals with hoarding disorder display excessive acquisition3. The
most frequent form of acquisition is excessive buying, followed by
acquisition of free items (e.g., leaflets, items discarded by others)3.
Stealing is less common5. Some individuals may deny excessive
acquisition when first assessed, yet it may appear later during the
course of treatment. Individuals with hoarding disorder typically
experience distress if they are unable to or are prevented from
acquiring items.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of hoarding disorder is
persistent difficulties discarding or parting with possessions,
regardless of their actual value (Criterion A). The term persistent
indicates a long-standing difficulty rather than more transient life
circumstances that may lead to excessive clutter, such as inheriting
property. The difficulty in discarding possessions noted in Criterion A
refers to any form of discarding, including throwing away, selling,
giving away, or recycling. The main reasons given for these difficulties
are the perceived utility or aesthetic value of the items or strong
sentimental attachment to the possessions. Some individuals feel
responsible for the fate of their possessions and often go to great
lengths to avoid being wasteful. Fears of losing important information
are also common. The most commonly saved items are newspapers,
magazines, old clothing, bags, books, mail, and paperwork, but virtually
any item can be saved12. The nature of items is not limited to
possessions that most other

people would define as useless or of limited value. Many individuals
collect and save large numbers of valuable things as well, which are
often found in piles mixed with other less valuable items2. Individuals
with hoarding disorder purposefully save possessions and experience
distress when facing the prospect of discarding them (Criterion B). This
criterion emphasizes that the saving of possessions is intentional,
which discriminates hoarding disorder from other forms of
psychopathology that are characterized by the passive accumulation of
items or the absence of distress when possessions are removed.
Individuals accumulate large numbers of items that fill up and clutter
active living areas to the extent that their intended use is no longer
possible (Criterion C). For example, the individual may not be able to
cook in the kitchen, sleep in his or her bed, or sit in a chair. If the
space can be used, it is only with great difficulty. Clutter is defined
as a large group of usually unrelated or marginally related objects
piled together in a disorganized fashion in spaces designed for other
purposes (e.g., tabletops, floor, hallway)18. Criterion C emphasizes the
"active" living areas of the home, rather than more peripheral areas,
such as garages, attics, or basements, that are sometimes cluttered in
homes of individuals without hoarding disorder. However, individuals
with hoarding disorder often have possessions that spill beyond the
active living areas and can occupy and impair the use of other spaces,
such as vehicles, yards, the workplace, and friends' and relatives'
houses. In some cases, living areas may be uncluttered because of the
intervention of third parties (e.g., family members, cleaners, local
authorities). Individuals who have been forced to clear their homes
still have a symptom picture that meets criteria for hoarding disorder
because the lack of clutter is due to a third-party intervention.
Hoarding disorder contrasts with normative collecting behavior, which is
organized and systematic, even if in some cases the actual amount of
possessions may be similar to the amount accumulated by an individual
with hoarding disorder11. Normative collecting does not produce the
clutter, distress, or impairment typical of hoarding disorder. Symptoms
(i.e., difficulties discarding and/or clutter) must cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning, including maintaining a safe environment
for self and others (Criterion D). In some cases, particularly when
there is poor insight, the individual may not report distress, and the
impairment may

be apparent only to those around the individual. However, any attempts
to discard or clear the possessions by third parties result in high
levels of distress.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Other common features of
hoarding disorder include indecisiveness, perfectionism, avoidance,
procrastination, difficulty planning and organizing tasks, and
distractibility2, 5, 18. Some individuals with hoarding disorder live in
unsanitary conditions that may be a logical consequence of severely
cluttered spaces and/or that are related to planning and organizing
difficulties17. Animal hoarding can be defined as the accumulation of a
large number of animals and a failure to provide minimal standards of
nutrition, sanitation, and veterinary care and to act on the
deteriorating condition of the animals (including disease, starvation,
or death) and the environment (e.g., severe overcrowding, extremely
unsanitary conditions)4. Animal hoarding may be a special manifestation
of hoarding disorder. Most individuals who hoard animals also hoard
inanimate objects4. The most prominent differences between animal and
object hoarding are the extent of unsanitary conditions and the poorer
insight in animal hoarding.

Prevalence Nationally representative prevalence studies of hoarding
disorder are not available. Community surveys estimate the point
prevalence of clinically significant hoarding in the United States and
Europe to be approximately 2%--6%13. Hoarding disorder affects both
males and females, but some epidemiological studies have reported a
significantly greater prevalence among males. This contrasts with
clinical samples, which are predominantly female. Hoarding symptoms
appear to be almost three times more prevalent in older adults (ages
55--94 years) compared with younger adults (ages 34--44 years)13.

Development and Course Hoarding appears to begin early in life and spans
well into the late stages. Hoarding symptoms may first emerge around
ages 11--15 years, start interfering with the individual's everyday
functioning by the mid-20s, and cause clinically significant impairment
by the mid-30s6, 8, 20. Participants in

clinical research studies are usually in their 50s5, 12. Thus, the
severity of hoarding increases with each decade of life8. Once symptoms
begin, the course of hoarding is often chronic, with few individuals
reporting a waxing and waning course20. Pathological hoarding in
children appears to be easily distinguished from developmentally
adaptive saving and collecting behaviors14. Because children and
adolescents typically do not control their living environment and
discarding behaviors, the possible intervention of third parties (e.g.,
parents keeping the spaces usable and thus reducing interference) should
be considered when making the diagnosis.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Indecisiveness is a prominent
feature of individuals with hoarding disorder and their first-degree
relatives15. Environmental. Individuals with hoarding disorder often
retrospectively report stressful and traumatic life events preceding the
onset of the disorder or causing an exacerbation6, 8. Genetic and
physiological. Hoarding behavior is familial, with about 50% of
individuals who hoard reporting having a relative who also hoards13.
Twin studies indicate that approximately 50% of the variability in
hoarding behavior is attributable to additive genetic factors7.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues While most of the research has been
done in Western, industrialized countries and urban communities, the
available data from non-Western and developing countries suggest that
hoarding is a universal phenomenon with consistent clinical features9.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues The key features of hoarding disorder
(i.e., difficulties discarding, excessive amount of clutter) are
generally comparable in males and females, but females tend to display
more excessive acquisition, particularly excessive buying, than do
males5.

Functional Consequences of Hoarding Disorder

Clutter impairs basic activities, such as moving through the house,
cooking, cleaning, personal hygiene, and even sleeping. Appliances may
be broken, and utilities such as water and electricity may be
disconnected, as access for repair work may be difficult. Quality of
life is often considerably impaired16. In severe cases, hoarding can put
individuals at risk for fire, falling (especially elderly individuals),
poor sanitation, and other health risks. Hoarding disorder is associated
with occupational impairment, poor physical health, and high social
service utilization. Family relationships are frequently under great
strain. Conflict with neighbors and local authorities is common, and a
substantial proportion of individuals with severe hoarding disorder have
been involved in legal eviction proceedings, and some have a history of
eviction.

Differential Diagnosis Other medical conditions. Hoarding disorder is
not diagnosed if the symptoms are judged to be a direct consequence of
another medical condition (Criterion E), such as traumatic brain injury,
surgical resection for treatment of a tumor or seizure control,
cerebrovascular disease, infections of the central nervous system (e.g.,
herpes simplex encephalitis), or neurogenetic conditions such as
Prader-Willi syndrome9. Damage to the anterior ventromedial prefrontal
and cingulate cortices has been particularly associated with the
excessive accumulation of objects1, 10. In these individuals, the
hoarding behavior is not present prior to the onset of the brain damage
and appears shortly after the brain damage occurs1. Some of these
individuals appear to have little interest in the accumulated items and
are able to discard them easily or do not care if others discard them,
whereas others appear to be very reluctant to discard anything10.
Neurodevelopmental disorders. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the
accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a
neurodevelopmental disorder, such as autism spectrum disorder or
intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).
Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Hoarding disorder
is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct
consequence of delusions or negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum
and other psychotic disorders9, 13.

Major depressive episode. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the
accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of
psychomotor retardation, fatigue, or loss of energy during a major
depressive episode. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Hoarding disorder is
not diagnosed if the symptoms are judged to be a direct consequence of
typical obsessions or compulsions, such as fears of contamination, harm,
or feelings of incompleteness in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Feelings of incompleteness (e.g., losing one's identity, or having to
document and preserve all life experiences) are the most frequent OCD
symptoms associated with this form of hoarding. The accumulation of
objects can also be the result of persistently avoiding onerous rituals
(e.g., not discarding objects in order to avoid endless washing or
checking rituals)9, 13. In OCD, the behavior is generally unwanted and
highly distressing, and the individual experiences no pleasure or reward
from it. Excessive acquisition is usually not present; if excessive
acquisition is present, items are acquired because of a specific
obsession (e.g., the need to buy items that have been accidentally
touched in order to avoid contaminating other people), not because of a
genuine desire to possess the items. Individuals who hoard in the
context of OCD are also more likely to accumulate bizarre items, such as
trash, feces, urine, nails, hair, used diapers, or rotten food12.
Accumulation of such items is very unusual in hoarding disorder. When
severe hoarding appears concurrently with other typical symptoms of OCD
but is judged to be independent from these symptoms, both hoarding
disorder and OCD may be diagnosed9. Neurocognitive disorders. Hoarding
disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be
a direct consequence of a degenerative disorder, such as neurocognitive
disorder associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration or
Alzheimer's disease. Typically, onset of the accumulating behavior is
gradual and follows onset of the neurocognitive disorder. The
accumulating behavior may be accompanied by self-neglect and severe
domestic squalor, alongside other neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as
disinhibition, gambling, rituals/stereotypies, tics, and self-injurious
behaviors17.

Comorbidity

Approximately 75% of individuals with hoarding disorder have a comorbid
mood or anxiety disorder5. The most common comorbid conditions are major
depressive disorder (up to 50% of cases), social anxiety disorder
(social phobia), and generalized anxiety disorder5, 12. Approximately
20% of individuals with hoarding disorder also have symptoms that meet
diagnostic criteria for OCD5. These comorbidities may often be the main
reason for consultation, because individuals are unlikely to
spontaneously report hoarding symptoms, and these symptoms are often not
asked about in routine clinical interviews.

Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder) Diagnostic Criteria

312.39 (F63.3)

a.  Recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss.
b.  Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling.

c. The hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. d. The
hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical
condition (e.g., a dermatological condition). e. The hair pulling is not
better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g.,
attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body
dysmorphic disorder).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of trichotillomania
(hair-pulling disorder) is the recurrent pulling out of one's own hair
(Criterion A). Hair pulling may occur from any region of the body in
which hair grows; the most common sites are the scalp, eyebrows, and
eyelids, while less common sites are axillary, facial, pubic, and
peri-rectal regions4, 20. Hair-pulling sites may vary over time. Hair
pulling may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or
during less frequent but more sustained periods that can continue for
hours, and such hair pulling may endure for months or years4, 20.
Criterion A requires that hair pulling lead to hair loss, although
individuals with this disorder may pull hair in a widely distributed
pattern (i.e., pulling single hairs from all over a site) such that hair
loss may not be clearly visible. Alternatively, individuals may attempt
to conceal or camouflage hair loss (e.g., by using makeup, scarves, or
wigs)4, 20. Individuals with trichotillomania have made repeated
attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling (Criterion B)11. Criterion C
indicates that hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning. The term distress includes negative affects that may be
experienced by individuals with hair pulling, such as feeling a loss of
control, embarrassment, and shame. Significant impairment may occur in
several different areas of functioning (e.g., social, occupational,
academic, and leisure), in part because of avoidance of work, school, or
other public situations4, 20.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Hair pulling may be accompanied
by a range of behaviors or rituals involving hair. Thus, individuals may
search for a particular kind of hair to

pull (e.g., hairs with a specific texture or color), may try to pull out
hair in a specific way (e.g., so that the root comes out intact), or may
visually examine or tactilely or orally manipulate the hair after it has
been pulled (e.g., rolling the hair between the fingers, pulling the
strand between the teeth, biting the hair into pieces, or swallowing the
hair)15. Hair pulling may also be preceded or accompanied by various
emotional states5, 16, it may be triggered by feelings of anxiety or
boredom, may be preceded by an increasing sense of tension (either
immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the
urge to pull), or may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of
relief when the hair is pulled out4, 10. Hair-pulling behavior may
involve varying degrees of conscious awareness, with some individuals
displaying more focused attention on the hair pulling (with preceding
tension and subsequent relief), and other individuals displaying more
automatic behavior (in which the hair pulling seems to occur without
full awareness)6, 7. Many individuals report a mix of both behavioral
styles6, 7. Some individuals experience an "itch-like" or tingling
sensation in the scalp that is alleviated by the act of pulling hair.
Pain does not usually accompany hair pulling. Patterns of hair loss are
highly variable4, 20. Areas of complete alopecia, as well as areas of
thinned hair density, are common. When the scalp is involved, there may
be a predilection for pulling out hair in the crown or parietal regions.
There may be a pattern of nearly complete baldness except for a narrow
perimeter around the outer margins of the scalp, particularly at the
nape of the neck ("tonsure trichotillomania"). Eyebrows and eyelashes
may be completely absent. Hair pulling does not usually occur in the
presence of other individuals, except immediate family members. Some
individuals have urges to pull hair from other individuals and may
sometimes try to find opportunities to do so surreptitiously. Some
individuals may pull hairs from pets, dolls, and other fibrous materials
(e.g., sweaters or carpets). Some individuals may deny their hair
pulling to others. The majority of individuals with trichotillomania
also have one or more other body-focused repetitive behaviors, including
skin picking, nail biting, and lip chewing4, 18.

Prevalence

In the general population, the 12-month prevalence estimate for
trichotillomania in adults and adolescents is 1%--2%15, 19. Females are
more frequently affected than males, at a ratio of approximately 10:115,
19. This estimate likely reflects the true gender ratio of the
condition, although it may also reflect differential treatment seeking
based on gender or cultural attitudes regarding appearance (e.g.,
acceptance of normative hair loss among males). Among children with
trichotillomania, males and females are more equally represented.

Development and Course Hair pulling may be seen in infants, and this
behavior typically resolves during early development15, 19. Onset of
hair pulling in trichotillomania most commonly coincides with, or
follows the onset of, puberty. Sites of hair pulling may vary over time.
The usual course of trichotillomania is chronic, with some waxing and
waning if the disorder is untreated. Symptoms may possibly worsen in
females accompanying hormonal changes (e.g., menstruation,
perimenopause). For some individuals, the disorder may come and go for
weeks, months, or years at a time. A minority of individuals remit
without subsequent relapse within a few years of onset9.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. There is evidence
for a genetic vulnerability to trichotillomania13. The disorder is more
common in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their
first-degree relatives than in the general population2.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Trichotillomania appears to manifest
similarly across cultures, although there is a paucity of data from
non-Western regions.

Diagnostic Markers Most individuals with trichotillomania admit to hair
pulling; thus, dermatopathological diagnosis is rarely required. Skin
biopsy and dermoscopy (or trichoscopy) of trichotillomania are able to
differentiate the

disorder from other causes of alopecia1, 17. In trichotillomania,
dermoscopy shows a range of characteristic features, including decreased
hair density, short vellus hair, and broken hairs with different shaft
lengths1.

Functional Consequences of Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)
Trichotillomania is associated with distress as well as with social and
occupational impairment20. There may be irreversible damage to hair
growth and hair quality. Infrequent medical consequences of
trichotillomania include digit purpura, musculoskeletal injury (e.g.,
carpal tunnel syndrome; back, shoulder and neck pain), blepharitis, and
dental damage (e.g., worn or broken teeth due to hair biting).
Swallowing of hair (trichophagia) may lead to trichobezoars, with
subsequent anemia, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea and vomiting,
bowel obstruction, and even perforation3.

Differential Diagnosis Normative hair removal/manipulation.
Trichotillomania should not be diagnosed when hair removal is performed
solely for cosmetic reasons (i.e., to improve one's physical
appearance). Many individuals twist and play with their hair, but this
behavior does not usually qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania.
Some individuals may bite rather than pull hair; again, this does not
qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania. Other obsessive-compulsive
and related disorders. Individuals with OCD and symmetry concerns may
pull out hairs as part of their symmetry rituals, and individuals with
body dysmorphic disorder may remove body hair that they perceive as
ugly, asymmetrical, or abnormal; in such cases a diagnosis of
trichotillomania is not given. The description of body-focused
repetitive behavior disorder in other specified obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder excludes individuals who meet diagnostic criteria for
trichotillomania. Neurodevelopmental disorders. In neurodevelopmental
disorders, hair pulling may meet the definition of stereotypies (e.g.,
in stereotypic movement disorder). Tics (in tic disorders) rarely lead
to hair pulling.

Psychotic disorder. Individuals with a psychotic disorder may remove
hair in response to a delusion or hallucination. Trichotillomania is not
diagnosed in such cases. Another medical condition. Trichotillomania is
not diagnosed if the hair pulling or hair loss is attributable to
another medical condition (e.g., inflammation of the skin or other
dermatological conditions). Other causes of scarring alopecia (e.g.,
alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium) or nonscarring
alopecia (e.g., chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen
planopilaris, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, pseudopelade,
folliculitis decalvans, dissecting folliculitis, acne keloidalis nuchae)
should be considered in individuals with hair loss who deny hair
pulling14, 17. Skin biopsy or dermoscopy can be used to differentiate
individuals with trichotillomania from those with dermatological
disorders1, 17. Substance-related disorders. Hair-pulling symptoms may
be exacerbated by certain substances---for example, stimulants12---but
it is less likely that substances are the primary cause of persistent
hair pulling.

Comorbidity Trichotillomania is often accompanied by other mental
disorders, most commonly major depressive disorder and excoriation
(skin-picking) disorder18, 20. Repetitive body-focused symptoms other
than hair pulling or skin picking (e.g., nail biting) occur in the
majority of individuals with trichotillomania and may deserve an
additional diagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder (i.e., body-focused repetitive behavior disorder)4, 18.

Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

698.4 (L98.1)

a.  Recurrent skin picking resulting in skin lesions.
b.  Repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking.
c.  The skin picking causes clinically significant distress or
    impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
    functioning.
d.  The skin picking is not attributable to the physiological effects of
    a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g.,
    scabies).
e.  The skin picking is not better explained by symptoms of another
    mental disorder (e.g., delusions or tactile hallucinations in a
    psychotic disorder, attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw
    in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder, stereotypies in
    stereotypic

movement disorder, or intention to harm oneself in nonsuicidal
selfinjury).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of excoriation (skin-picking)
disorder is recurrent picking at one's own skin (Criterion A). The most
commonly picked sites are the face, arms, and hands, but many
individuals pick from multiple body sites. Individuals may pick at
healthy skin, at minor skin irregularities, at lesions such as pimples
or calluses, or at scabs from previous picking. Most individuals pick
with their fingernails, although many use tweezers, pins, or other
objects3, 12. In addition to skin picking, there may be skin rubbing,
squeezing, lancing, and biting12. Individuals with excoriation disorder
often spend significant amounts of time on their picking behavior,
sometimes several hours per day, and such skin picking may endure for
months or years3. Criterion A requires that skin picking lead to skin
lesions, although individuals with this disorder often attempt to
conceal or camouflage such lesions (e.g., with makeup or clothing).
Individuals with excoriation disorder have made repeated attempts to
decrease or stop skin picking (Criterion B)6. Criterion C indicates that
skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The term
distress includes negative affects that may be experienced by
individuals with skin picking, such as feeling a loss of control,
embarrassment, and shame. Significant impairment may occur in several
different areas of functioning (e.g., social, occupational, academic,
and leisure), in part because of avoidance of social situations3, 12.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Skin picking may be accompanied
by a range of behaviors or rituals involving skin or scabs3. Thus,
individuals may search for a particular kind of scab to pull, and they
may examine, play with, or mouth or swallow the skin after it has been
pulled. Skin picking may also be preceded or accompanied by various
emotional states9, 10. Skin picking may be triggered by feelings of
anxiety or boredom, may be preceded by an increasing sense of tension
(either immediately before picking the skin or

when attempting to resist the urge to pick), and may lead to
gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the skin or scab has
been picked1, 16. Some individuals report picking in response to a minor
skin irregularity or to relieve an uncomfortable bodily sensation. Pain
is not routinely reported to accompany skin picking3, 17. Some
individuals engage in skin picking that is more focused (i.e., with
preceding tension and subsequent relief), whereas others engage in more
automatic picking (i.e., when skin picking occurs without preceding
tension and without full awareness), and many have a mix of both
behavioral styles15. Skin picking does not usually occur in the presence
of other individuals, except immediate family members. Some individuals
report picking the skin of others.

Prevalence In the general population, the lifetime prevalence for
excoriation disorder in adults is 1.4%5 or somewhat higher4, 11.
Three-quarters or more of individuals with the disorder are female3, 9.
This likely reflects the true gender ratio of the condition, although it
may also reflect differential treatment seeking based on gender or
cultural attitudes regarding appearance.

Development and Course Although individuals with excoriation disorder
may present at various ages, the skin picking most often has onset
during adolescence, commonly coinciding with or following the onset of
puberty. The disorder frequently begins with a dermatological condition,
such as acne3, 14. Sites of skin picking may vary over time. The usual
course is chronic, with some waxing and waning if untreated. For some
individuals, the disorder may come and go for weeks, months, or years at
a time.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Excoriation
disorder is more common in individuals with obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) and their firstdegree family members than in the general
population2.

Diagnostic Markers

Most individuals with excoriation disorder admit to skin picking;
therefore, dermatopathological diagnosis is rarely required. However,
the disorder may have characteristic features on histopathology13.

Functional Consequences of Excoriation (SkinPicking) Disorder
Excoriation disorder is associated with distress as well as with social
and occupational impairment3, 12. The majority of individuals with this
condition spend at least 1 hour per day picking, thinking about picking,
and resisting urges to pick. Many individuals report avoiding social or
entertainment events as well as going out in public. A majority of
individuals with the disorder also report experiencing work interference
from skin picking on at least a daily or weekly basis. A significant
proportion of students with excoriation disorder report having missed
school, having experienced difficulties managing responsibilities at
school, or having had difficulties studying because of skin picking.
Medical complications of skin picking include tissue damage, scarring,
and infection and can be life-threatening7. Rarely, synovitis of the
wrists due to chronic picking has been reported9. Skin picking often
results in significant tissue damage and scarring. It frequently
requires antibiotic treatment for infection, and on occasion it may
require surgery7.

Differential Diagnosis Psychotic disorder. Skin picking may occur in
response to a delusion (i.e., parasitosis) or tactile hallucination
(i.e., formication) in a psychotic disorder. In such cases, excoriation
disorder should not be diagnosed. Other obsessive-compulsive and related
disorders. Excessive washing compulsions in response to contamination
obsessions in individuals with OCD may lead to skin lesions, and skin
picking may occur in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder who pick
their skin solely because of appearance concerns; in such cases,
excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed. The description of
body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in other specified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder excludes individuals whose
symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for excoriation disorder.

Neurodevelopmental disorders. While stereotypic movement disorder may be
characterized by repetitive self-injurious behavior, onset is in the
early developmental period. For example, individuals with the
neurogenetic condition Prader-Willi syndrome may have early onset of
skin picking, and their symptoms may meet criteria for stereotypic
movement disorder. While tics in individuals with Tourette's disorder
may lead to self-injury, the behavior is not tic-like in excoriation
disorder. Somatic symptom and related disorders. Excoriation disorder is
not diagnosed if the skin lesion is primarily attributable to deceptive
behaviors in factitious disorder. Other disorders. Excoriation disorder
is not diagnosed if the skin picking is primarily attributable to the
intention to harm oneself that is characteristic of nonsuicidal
self-injury. Other medical conditions. Excoriation disorder is not
diagnosed if the skin picking is primarily attributable to another
medical condition. For example, scabies is a dermatological condition
invariably associated with severe itching and scratching. However,
excoriation disorder may be precipitated or exacerbated by an underlying
dermatological condition. For example, acne may lead to some scratching
and picking, which may also be associated with comorbid excoriation
disorder. The differentiation between these two clinical situations
(acne with some scratching and picking vs. acne with comorbid
excoriation disorder) requires an assessment of the extent to which the
individual's skin picking has become independent of the underlying
dermatological condition. Substance/medication-induced disorders.
Skin-picking symptoms may also be induced by certain substances (e.g.,
cocaine), in which case excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed. If
such skin picking is clinically significant, then a diagnosis of
substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
should be considered.

Comorbidity Excoriation disorder is often accompanied by other mental
disorders3, 11. Such disorders include OCD and trichotillomania
(hair-pulling disorder), as well as major depressive disorder7, 16.
Repetitive body-focused symptoms other than skin picking and hair
pulling (e.g., nail biting) occur in many

individuals with excoriation disorder and may deserve an additional
diagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
(i.e., body-focused repetitive behavior disorder)7.

Substance/Medication-Induced ObsessiveCompulsive and Related Disorder
Diagnostic Criteria a. Obsessions, compulsions, skin picking, hair
pulling, other bodyfocused repetitive behaviors, or other symptoms
characteristic of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders
predominate in the clinical picture. b. There is evidence from the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and
(2): 1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the
symptoms in Criterion A.

c. The disturbance is not better explained by an obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such
evidence of an independent obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
could include the following: The symptoms precede the onset of the
substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period
of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or
severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence
of an independent non-substance/medication-induced obsessivecompulsive
and related disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent
nonsubstance/medication-related episodes). d. The disturbance does not
occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. e. The disturbance
causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Note: This
diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of substance
intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion
A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to
warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM
codes for the \[specific substance/medication\]-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders are indicated in the table
below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a
comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance.
If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is
"1," and the clinician should record "mild \[substance\] use disorder"
before the substance-induced obsessivecompulsive and related disorder
(e.g., "mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder"). If a moderate or severe
substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, the 4th position character is
"2," and the clinician should record "moderate \[substance\] use
disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use disorder," depending on the
severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid
substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the

substance), then the 4th position character is "9," and the clinician
should record only the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder. ICD-10-CM ICD-9- With use CM disorder, mild

(see Table 1 in the chapter "Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders"
for diagnoses associated with substance class): With onset during
intoxication: If the criteria are met for intoxication with the
substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication. With onset
during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance
and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal. With
onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at initiation of
medication or after a modification or change in use.

Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the
substance/medication-induced obsessivecompulsive and related disorder
begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine) that is presumed to
be causing the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms. The diagnostic
code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is
based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the
classes, the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases in
which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor

but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown
substance" should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the
specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during
withdrawal, with onset after medication use). Unlike the recording
procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder
and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate
diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in
the case of repetitive behaviors occurring during intoxication in a man
with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.89
cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset
during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine
use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to
play a significant role in the development of the obsessivecompulsive
and related disorder, each should be listed separately. ICD-10-CM. The
name of the substance/medication-induced obsessivecompulsive and related
disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine) that is
presumed to be causing the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms.
The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria
set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a
comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any
of the classes, the code for "other substance" with no comorbid
substance use should be used; and in cases in which a substance is
judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance
is unknown, the category "unknown substance" with no comorbid substance
use should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the
comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by
the word "with," followed by the name of the substance-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, followed by the specification
of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with
onset after medication use). For example, in the case of repetitive
behaviors occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine
use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.288 severe cocaine use disorder with
cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset
during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine
use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced obsessivecompulsive
and related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder
(e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no

accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F15.988
amphetamineinduced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset
during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of the obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder, each should be listed separately.

Diagnostic Features The essential features of
substance/medication-induced obsessivecompulsive and related disorder
are prominent symptoms of an obsessivecompulsive and related disorder
(Criterion A) that are judged to be attributable to the effects of a
substance (e.g., drug of abuse, medication). The obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder symptoms must have developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication
or toxin, and the substance/medication must be capable of producing the
symptoms (Criterion B). Substance/medicationinduced obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder
or general medical condition must have its onset while the individual is
receiving the medication. Once the treatment is discontinued, the
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms will usually improve
or remit within days to several weeks to 1 month (depending on the
half-life of the substance/medication). The diagnosis of
substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
should not be given if onset of the obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder symptoms precedes the substance intoxication or medication use,
or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time, usually
longer than 1 month, from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal.
If the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms persist for a
substantial period of time, other causes for the symptoms should be
considered. The substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of
substance intoxication only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate
in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant
independent clinical attention

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Obsessions, compulsions, hair
pulling, skin picking, or other body-focused repetitive behaviors can
occur in association with intoxication with the

following classes of substances: stimulants (including cocaine) and
other (or unknown) substances. Heavy metals and toxins may also cause
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms. Laboratory
assessments (e.g., urine toxicology) may be useful to measure substance
intoxication as part of an assessment for obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders.

Prevalence In the general population, the very limited data that are
available indicate that substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder is very rare1.

Differential Diagnosis Substance intoxication. Obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder symptoms may occur in substance intoxication. The
diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication will usually suffice to
categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of an
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be made in addition to
substance intoxication when the symptoms are judged to be in excess of
those usually associated with intoxication and are sufficiently severe
to warrant independent clinical attention. Obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder (i.e., not induced by a substance).
Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
is judged to be etiologically related to the substance/medication.
Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
is distinguished from a primary obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors with
respect to substances/medications. For drugs of abuse, there must be
evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings
for use or intoxication. Substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder arises only in association
with intoxication, whereas a primary obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder may precede the onset of substance/medication use. The presence
of features that are atypical of a primary obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder, such as atypical age at onset of symptoms, may suggest
a substance-induced etiology. A primary obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder diagnosis is warranted if the

symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (about 1 month or
longer) after the end of the substance intoxication or the individual
has a history of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.
Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition. If the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms are
attributable to another medical condition (i.e., rather than to the
medication taken for the other medical condition), obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder due to another medical condition should be
diagnosed. The history often provides the basis for judgment. At times,
a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e.g.,
medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine
whether or not the medication is the causative agent (in which case the
symptoms may be better explained by substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder). If the disturbance is
attributable to both another medical condition and substance use, both
diagnoses (i.e., obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to
another medical condition and substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder) may be given. When there is
insufficient evidence to determine whether the symptoms are attributable
to either a substance/medication or another medical condition or are
primary (i.e., attributable to neither a substance/medication nor
another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified or
unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder would be
indicated. Delirium. If obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
symptoms occur exclusively during the course of delirium, they are
considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not
diagnosed separately.

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical
Condition

Diagnostic Criteria

294.8 (F06.8)

a.  Obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance, hoarding,
    skin picking, hair pulling, other body-focused repetitive behaviors,
    or other symptoms characteristic of obsessive-compulsive and related
    disorder predominate in the clinical picture.
b.  There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
    laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct
    pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.
c.  The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder.
d.  The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
    delirium.
e.  The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
    in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
    Specify if: With obsessive-compulsive disorder--like symptoms: If
    obsessivecompulsive disorder--like symptoms predominate in the
    clinical presentation. With appearance preoccupations: If
    preoccupation with perceived appearance defects or flaws
    predominates in the clinical presentation. With hoarding symptoms:
    If hoarding predominates in the clinical presentation. With
    hair-pulling symptoms: If hair pulling predominates in the clinical
    presentation. With skin-picking symptoms: If skin picking
    predominates in the clinical presentation. Coding note: Include the
    name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental
    disorder (e.g., 294.8 \[F06.8\] obsessive-compulsive and related
    disorder due to cerebral infarction). The other medical condition
    should be coded and listed separately immediately before the
    obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to the medical
    condition (e.g., 438.89 \[I69.398\] cerebral infarction; 294.8
    \[F06.8\] obsessivecompulsive and related disorder due to cerebral
    infarction).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder due to another medical condition is clinically
significant obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms that are judged to
be best explained as the direct pathophysiological consequence of
another medical condition. Symptoms can include prominent obsessions,
compulsions, preoccupations with appearance, hoarding, hair pulling,
skin picking, or other body-focused repetitive behaviors (Criterion A).
The judgment that the symptoms are best explained by the associated
medical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B). Additionally, it must
be judged that the symptoms are not better explained by another mental
disorder (Criterion C). The diagnosis is not made if the
obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms occur only during the course
of a delirium (Criterion D). The obsessive-compulsive and related
symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion
E). In determining whether the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms
are attributable to another medical condition, a relevant medical
condition must be present. Furthermore, it must be established that
obsessivecompulsive and related symptoms can be etiologically related to
the medical condition through a pathophysiological mechanism and that
this best explains the symptoms in the individual. Although there are no
infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between
the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms and the medical condition
is etiological, considerations that may provide some guidance in making
this diagnosis include the presence of a clear temporal association
between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition
and the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms; the presence of
features that are atypical of a primary obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder (e.g., atypical age at onset or course); and evidence in the
literature that a known physiological mechanism (e.g., striatal damage)
causes obsessivecompulsive and related symptoms. In addition, the
disturbance cannot be better explained by a primary obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder, a substance/medication-induced
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, or another mental disorder.

There is some controversy about whether obsessive-compulsive and related
disorders can be attributed to Group A streptococcal infection.
Sydenham's chorea is the neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever,
which is in turn due to Group A streptococcal infection. Sydenham's
chorea is characterized by a combination of motor and nonmotor features.
Nonmotor features include obsessions, compulsions, attention deficit,
and emotional lability1, 3. Although individuals with Sydenham's chorea
may present with non-neuropsychiatric features of acute rheumatic fever,
such as carditis and arthritis, they may present with
obsessive-compulsive disorder-- like symptoms; such individuals should
be diagnosed with obsessivecompulsive and related disorder due to
another medical condition. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric
disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) has been
identified as another postinfectious autoimmune disorder characterized
by the sudden onset of obsessions, compulsions, and/or tics accompanied
by a variety of acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in the absence of
chorea, carditis, or arthritis, after Group A streptococcal infection4.
Although there is a body of evidence that supports the existence of
PANDAS, it remains a controversial diagnosis. Given this ongoing
controversy, the description of PANDAS has been modified to eliminate
etiological factors and to designate an expanded clinical entity:
pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) or idiopathic
childhood acute neuropsychiatric symptoms (CANS), which deserves further
study2, 5.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis A number of other medical
disorders are known to include obsessivecompulsive and related symptoms
as a manifestation. Examples include disorders leading to striatal
damage, such as cerebral infarction.

Development and Course The development and course of
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition generally follows the course of the underlying illness.

Diagnostic Markers

Laboratory assessments and/or medical examinations are necessary to
confirm the diagnosis of another medical condition.

Differential Diagnosis Delirium. A separate diagnosis of
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the
course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder due to another medical condition may be given in
addition to a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) if
the etiology of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms is judged to be a
physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the
dementia and if obsessive-compulsive symptoms are a prominent part of
the clinical presentation. Mixed presentation of symptoms (e.g., mood
and obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms). If the
presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms, the specific
mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on which
symptoms predominate in the clinical picture.
Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.
If there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including
medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or
exposure to a toxin, a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder should be considered. When a
substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder
is being diagnosed in relation to drugs of abuse, it may be useful to
obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory
evaluation. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i.e., within 4
weeks of) substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use
may be especially indicative of a substance/medication-induced
obsessivecompulsive and related disorder, depending on the type,
duration, or amount of the substance used. Obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders (primary). Obsessivecompulsive and related disorder
due to another medical condition should be distinguished from a primary
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. In primary mental disorders,
no specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated
with a medical condition can be demonstrated. Late

age at onset or atypical symptoms suggest the need for a thorough
assessment to rule out the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder due to another medical condition. Illness anxiety disorder.
Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by a preoccupation with having
or acquiring a serious illness. In the case of illness anxiety disorder,
individuals may or may not have diagnosed medical conditions. Associated
feature of another mental disorder. Obsessive-compulsive and related
symptoms may be an associated feature of another mental disorder (e.g.,
schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa). Other specified obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder or unspecified obsessive-compulsive and related
disorder. These diagnoses are given if it is unclear whether the
obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are primary,
substance-induced, or due to another medical condition.

Other Specified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder 300.3 (F42)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder category is used in situations
in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that
the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. This is done by recording
"other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder" followed by
the specific reason (e.g., "body-focused repetitive behavior disorder").
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following: 1. Body dysmorphic--like
disorder with actual flaws: This is similar to body dysmorphic disorder
except that the defects or flaws in physical appearance are clearly
observable by others (i.e., they are more noticeable than "slight"). In
such cases, the preoccupation with these flaws is clearly excessive and
causes significant impairment or distress. 2. Body dysmorphic--like
disorder without repetitive behaviors: Presentations that meet body
dysmorphic disorder except that the individual has not performed
repetitive behaviors or mental acts in response to the appearance
concerns. 3. Body-focused repetitive behavior disorder: This is
characterized by recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors (e.g., nail
biting, lip biting, cheek chewing) and repeated attempts to decrease or
stop the behaviors. These symptoms cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning and are not better explained by trichotillomania (hair-

pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, stereotypic
movement disorder, or nonsuicidal self-injury. 4. Obsessional jealousy:
This is characterized by nondelusional preoccupation with a partner's
perceived infidelity. The preoccupations may lead to repetitive
behaviors or mental acts in response to the infidelity concerns; they
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning; and they are not
better explained by another mental disorder such as delusional disorder,
jealous type, or paranoid personality disorder. 5. Shubo-kyofu: A
variant of taijin kyofusho (see "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of
Distress" in the Appendix) that is similar to body dysmorphic disorder
and is characterized by excessive fear of having a bodily deformity. 6.
Koro: Related to dhat syndrome (see "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of
Distress" in the Appendix), an episode of sudden and intense anxiety
that the penis (or the vulva and nipples in females) will recede into
the body, possibly leading to death. 7. Jikoshu-kyofu: A variant of
taijin kyofusho (see "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress" in the
Appendix) characterized by fear of having an offensive body odor (also
termed olfactory reference syndrome).

Unspecified Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder 300.3 (F42) This
category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any of the disorders in the obsessive-compulsive and
related disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason

that the criteria are not met for a specific obsessive-compulsive and
related disorder, and includes presentations in which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).

Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders Trauma- and stressor-related
disorders include disorders in which exposure to a traumatic or
stressful event is listed explicitly as a diagnostic criterion. These
include reactive attachment disorder, disinhibited social engagement
disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder,
and adjustment disorders. Placement of this chapter reflects the close
relationship between these diagnoses and disorders in the surrounding
chapters on anxiety disorders, obsessivecompulsive and related
disorders, and dissociative disorders. Psychological distress following
exposure to a traumatic or stressful event is quite variable. In some
cases, symptoms can be well understood within an anxiety- or fear-based
context. It is clear, however, that many individuals who have been
exposed to a traumatic or stressful event exhibit a phenotype in which,
rather than anxiety- or fear-based symptoms, the most prominent clinical
characteristics are anhedonic and dysphoric symptoms, externalizing
angry and aggressive symptoms, or dissociative symptoms. Because of
these variable expressions of clinical distress following exposure to
catastrophic or aversive events, the aforementioned disorders have been
grouped under a separate category: trauma- and stressor-related
disorders. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for the clinical picture to
include some combination of the above symptoms (with or without anxiety-
or fear-based symptoms). Such a heterogeneous picture has long been
recognized in adjustment disorders, as well. Social neglect--- that is,
the absence of adequate caregiving during childhood---is a diagnostic
requirement of both reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social
engagement disorder. Although the two disorders share a common etiology,
the former is expressed as an internalizing disorder with depressive
symptoms and withdrawn behavior, while the latter is marked by
disinhibition and externalizing behavior.

Reactive Attachment Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

313.89 (F94.1)

a.  A consistent pattern of inhibited, emotionally withdrawn behavior
    toward adult caregivers, manifested by both of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  The child rarely or minimally seeks comfort when distressed.
2.  The child rarely or minimally responds to comfort when distressed.

<!-- -->

b.  A persistent social and emotional disturbance characterized by at
    least two of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Minimal social and emotional responsiveness to others.
2.  Limited positive affect.
3.  Episodes of unexplained irritability, sadness, or fearfulness that
    are evident even during nonthreatening interactions with adult
    caregivers.

<!-- -->

c.  The child has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care
    as evidenced by at least one of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of
    having basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and affection
    met by caregiving adults.
2.  Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit opportunities to
    form stable attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care).
3.  Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to
    form selective attachments (e.g., institutions with high
    child-tocaregiver ratios).

<!-- -->

d.  The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the
    disturbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in
    Criterion A began following the lack of adequate care in Criterion
    C).
e.  The criteria are not met for autism spectrum disorder.
f.  The disturbance is evident before age 5 years.

g. The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months. Specify if:
Persistent: The disorder has been present for more than 12 months.
Specify current severity: Reactive attachment disorder is specified as
severe when a child exhibits all symptoms of the disorder, with each
symptom manifesting at relatively high levels.

Diagnostic Features Reactive attachment disorder is characterized by a
pattern of markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate
attachment behaviors, in which a child rarely or minimally turns
preferentially to an attachment figure for comfort, support, protection,
and nurturance. The essential feature is absent or grossly
underdeveloped attachment between the child and putative caregiving
adults. Children with reactive attachment disorder are believed to have
the capacity to form selective attachments. However, because of limited
opportunities during early development, they fail to show the behavioral
manifestations of selective attachments. That is, when distressed, they
show no consistent effort to obtain comfort, support, nurturance, or
protection from caregivers. Furthermore, when distressed, children with
this disorder do not respond more than minimally to comforting efforts
of caregivers. Thus, the disorder is associated with the absence of
expected comfort seeking and response to comforting behaviors. As such,
children with reactive attachment disorder show diminished or absent
expression of positive emotions during routine interactions with
caregivers. In addition, their emotion regulation capacity is
compromised, and they display episodes of negative emotions of fear,
sadness, or irritability that are not readily explained. A diagnosis of
reactive attachment disorder should not be made in children who are
developmentally unable to form selective attachments. For this reason,
the child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Because of the shared
etiological association with social neglect, reactive attachment
disorder often co-occurs with developmental delays, especially

in delays in cognition and language. Other associated features include
stereotypies and other signs of severe neglect (e.g., malnutrition or
signs of poor care)3, 7.

Prevalence The prevalence of reactive attachment disorder is unknown,
but the disorder is seen relatively rarely in clinical settings. The
disorder has been found in young children exposed to severe neglect
before being placed in foster care or raised in institutions. However,
even in populations of severely neglected children, the disorder is
uncommon, occurring in less than 10% of such children1.

Development and Course Conditions of social neglect are often present in
the first months of life in children diagnosed with reactive attachment
disorder, even before the disorder is diagnosed. The clinical features
of the disorder manifest in a similar fashion between the ages of 9
months and 5 years1, 2, 5, 6. That is, signs of absent-to-minimal
attachment behaviors and associated emotionally aberrant behaviors are
evident in children throughout this age range, although differing
cognitive and motor abilities may affect how these behaviors are
expressed. Without remediation and recovery through normative caregiving
environments, it appears that signs of the disorder may persist, at
least for several years1. It is unclear whether reactive attachment
disorder occurs in older children and, if so, how it differs from its
presentation in young children. Because of this, the diagnosis should be
made with caution in children older than 5 years.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Serious social neglect is a
diagnostic requirement for reactive attachment disorder and is also the
only known risk factor for the disorder. However, the majority of
severely neglected children do not develop the disorder. Prognosis
appears to depend on the quality of the caregiving environment following
serious neglect1, 4.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Similar attachment behaviors have been described in young children in
many different cultures around the world. However, caution should be
exercised in making the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder in
cultures in which attachment has not been studied.

Functional Consequences of Reactive Attachment Disorder Reactive
attachment disorder significantly impairs young children's abilities to
relate interpersonally to adults or peers and is associated with
functional impairment across many domains of early childhood1.

Differential Diagnosis Autism spectrum disorder. Aberrant social
behaviors manifest in young children with reactive attachment disorder,
but they also are key features of autism spectrum disorder.
Specifically, young children with either condition can manifest dampened
expression of positive emotions, cognitive and language delays, and
impairments in social reciprocity. As a result, reactive attachment
disorder must be differentiated from autism spectrum disorder. These two
disorders can be distinguished based on differential histories of
neglect and on the presence of restricted interests or ritualized
behaviors, specific deficit in social communication, and selective
attachment behaviors. Children with reactive attachment disorder have
experienced a history of severe social neglect, although it is not
always possible to obtain detailed histories about the precise nature of
their experiences, especially in initial evaluations. Children with
autistic spectrum disorder will only rarely have a history of social
neglect. The restricted interests and repetitive behaviors
characteristic of autism spectrum disorder are not a feature of reactive
attachment disorder. These clinical features manifest as excessive
adherence to rituals and routines; restricted, fixated interests; and
unusual sensory reactions. However, it is important to note that
children with either condition can exhibit stereotypic behaviors such as
rocking or flapping. Children with either disorder also may exhibit a
range of intellectual functioning, but only children with autistic
spectrum disorder exhibit selective impairments in social communicative
behaviors, such as intentional communication (i.e., impairment in
communication that is deliberate, goal-directed, and aimed at
influencing the behavior of the

recipient). Children with reactive attachment disorder show social
communicative functioning comparable to their overall level of
intellectual functioning. Finally, children with autistic spectrum
disorder regularly show attachment behavior typical for their
developmental level. In contrast, children with reactive attachment
disorder do so only rarely or inconsistently, if at all. Intellectual
disability (intellectual developmental disorder). Developmental delays
often accompany reactive attachment disorder, but they should not be
confused with the disorder. Children with intellectual disability should
exhibit social and emotional skills comparable to their cognitive skills
and do not demonstrate the profound reduction in positive affect and
emotion regulation difficulties evident in children with reactive
attachment disorder. In addition, developmentally delayed children who
have reached a cognitive age of 7--9 months should demonstrate selective
attachments regardless of their chronological age. In contrast, children
with reactive attachment disorder show lack of preferred attachment
despite having attained a developmental age of at least 9 months.
Depressive disorders. Depression in young children is also associated
with reductions in positive affect. There is limited evidence, however,
to suggest that children with depressive disorders have impairments in
attachment. That is, young children who have been diagnosed with
depressive disorders still should seek and respond to comforting efforts
by caregivers.

Comorbidity Conditions associated with neglect, including cognitive
delays, language delays, and stereotypies, often co-occur with reactive
attachment disorder. Medical conditions, such as severe malnutrition,
may accompany signs of the disorder. Depressive symptoms also may
co-occur with reactive attachment disorder.

Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

313.89 (F94.2)

a.  A pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and
    interacts with unfamiliar adults and exhibits at least two of the
    following:

<!-- -->

1.  Reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with
    unfamiliar adults.
2.  Overly familiar verbal or physical behavior (that is not consistent
    with culturally sanctioned and with age-appropriate social
    boundaries).
3.  Diminished or absent checking back with adult caregiver after
    venturing away, even in unfamiliar settings.

4. Willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with minimal or no
hesitation. b. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to
impulsivity (as in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) but include
socially disinhibited behavior. c. The child has experienced a pattern
of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced by at least one of the
following: 1. Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent
lack of having basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation, and
affection met by caregiving adults. 2. Repeated changes of primary
caregivers that limit opportunities to form stable attachments (e.g.,
frequent changes in foster care). 3. Rearing in unusual settings that
severely limit opportunities to form selective attachments (e.g.,
institutions with high child-tocaregiver ratios). d. The care in
Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in
Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the
pathogenic care in Criterion C). e. The child has a developmental age of
at least 9 months. Specify if: Persistent: The disorder has been present
for more than 12 months. Specify current severity: Disinhibited social
engagement disorder is specified as severe when the child exhibits all
symptoms of the disorder, with each symptom manifesting at relatively
high levels.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of disinhibited social
engagement disorder is a pattern of behavior that involves culturally
inappropriate, overly familiar behavior with relative strangers
(Criterion A). This overly familiar behavior violates the social
boundaries of the culture. A diagnosis of disinhibited social

engagement disorder should not be made before children are
developmentally able to form selective attachments. For this reason, the
child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Because of the shared
etiological association with social neglect, disinhibited social
engagement disorder may co-occur with developmental delays, especially
cognitive and language delays, stereotypies, and other signs of severe
neglect, such as malnutrition or poor care. However, signs of the
disorder often persist even after these other signs of neglect are no
longer present2, 6. Therefore, it is not uncommon for children with the
disorder to present with no current signs of neglect1, 9. Moreover, the
condition can present in children who show no signs of disordered
attachment4, 7. Thus, disinhibited social engagement disorder may be
seen in children with a history of neglect who lack attachments or whose
attachments to their caregivers range from disturbed to secure.

Prevalence The prevalence of disinhibited social attachment disorder is
unknown. Nevertheless, the disorder appears to be rare, occurring in a
minority of children, even those who have been severely neglected and
subsequently placed in foster care or raised in institutions. In such
high-risk populations, the condition occurs in only about 20% of
children4. The condition is seen rarely in other clinical settings.

Development and Course Conditions of social neglect are often present in
the first months of life in children diagnosed with disinhibited social
engagement disorder, even before the disorder is diagnosed16. However,
there is no evidence that neglect beginning after age 2 years is
associated with manifestations of the disorder14. If neglect occurs
early and signs of the disorder appear, clinical features of the
disorder are moderately stable over time, particularly if conditions of
neglect persist4. Indiscriminate social behavior and lack of reticence
with unfamiliar adults in toddlerhood are accompanied by
attention-seeking behaviors in preschoolers11, 12, 16. When the disorder
persists into middle childhood, clinical features manifest as verbal and

physical overfamiliarity as well as inauthentic expression of emotions4,
9. These signs appear particularly apparent when the child interacts
with adults. Peer relationships are most affected in adolescence, with
both indiscriminate behavior and conflicts apparent5. The disorder has
not been described in adults. Disinhibited social engagement disorder
has been described from the second year of life through adolescence.
There are some differences in manifestations of the disorder from early
childhood through adolescence. At the youngest ages, across many
cultures, children show reticence when interacting with strangers13.
Young children with the disorder fail to show reticence to approach,
engage with, and even accompany adults. In preschool children, verbal
and social intrusiveness appear most prominent, often accompanied by
attention-seeking behavior12, 15, 16. Verbal and physical
overfamiliarity continue through middle childhood, accompanied by
inauthentic expressions of emotion. In adolescence, indiscriminate
behavior extends to peers. Relative to healthy adolescents, adolescents
with the disorder have more "superficial" peer relationships and more
peer conflicts. Adult manifestations of the disorder are unknown.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Serious social neglect is a
diagnostic requirement for disinhibited social engagement disorder and
is also the only known risk factor for the disorder. However, the
majority of severely neglected children do not develop the disorder.
Neurobiological vulnerability may differentiate neglected children who
do and do not develop the disorder3. However, no clear link with any
specific neurobiological factors has been established. The disorder has
not been identified in children who experience social neglect only after
age 2 years. Prognosis is only modestly associated with quality of the
caregiving environment following serious neglect4, 10. In many cases,
the disorder persists, even in children whose caregiving environment
becomes markedly improved. Course modifiers. Caregiving quality seems to
moderate the course of disinhibited social engagement disorder.
Nevertheless, even after placement in normative caregiving environments,
some children show persistent signs of the disorder, at least through
adolescence5, 8.

Functional Consequences of Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder
Disinhibited social engagement disorder significantly impairs young
children's abilities to relate interpersonally to adults and peers4, 5.

Differential Diagnosis Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Because
of social impulsivity that sometimes accompanies
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), it is necessary to
differentiate the two disorders. Children with disinhibited social
engagement disorder may be distinguished from those with ADHD because
the former do not show difficulties with attention or hyperactivity.

Comorbidity Limited research has examined the issue of disorders
comorbid with disinhibited social engagement disorder. Conditions
associated with neglect, including cognitive delays, language delays,
and stereotypies, may co-occur with disinhibited social engagement
disorder. In addition, children may be diagnosed with ADHD and
disinhibited social engagement disorder concurrently.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

309.81 (F43.10)

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Note: The following criteria apply to
adults, adolescents, and children older than 6 years. For children 6
years and younger, see corresponding criteria below. a. Exposure to
actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one
(or more) of the following ways: 1. Directly experiencing the traumatic
event(s). 2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to
others. 3. Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close
family member or close friend. In cases of actual or threatened death of
a family member or friend, the event(s) must have been violent or
accidental. 4. Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive
details of the traumatic event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting
human remains; police officers repeatedly exposed to details of child
abuse). Note: Criterion A4 does not apply to exposure through electronic
media, television, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work
related. b. Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion
symptoms associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the
traumatic event(s) occurred:

1. Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the
traumatic event(s). Note: In children older than 6 years, repetitive
play may occur in which themes or aspects of the traumatic event(s) are
expressed. 2. Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or
affect of the dream are related to the traumatic event(s). Note: In
children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable content.
3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual
feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such
reactions may occur on a continuum, with the most extreme expression
being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.) Note: In
children, trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play. 4. Intense or
prolonged psychological distress at exposure to internal or external
cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s). 5.
Marked physiological reactions to internal or external cues that
symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s). c. Persistent
avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning
after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by one or both of
the following: 1. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid distressing memories,
thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic
event(s). 2. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid external reminders
(people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that
arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely
associated with the traumatic event(s). d. Negative alterations in
cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning or
worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two (or
more) of the following:

1. Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s)
(typically due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as
head injury, alcohol, or drugs). 2. Persistent and exaggerated negative
beliefs or expectations about oneself, others, or the world (e.g., "I am
bad," "No one can be trusted," "The world is completely dangerous," "My
whole nervous system is permanently ruined"). 3. Persistent, distorted
cognitions about the cause or consequences of the traumatic event(s)
that lead the individual to blame himself/herself or others. 4.
Persistent negative emotional state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt,
or shame). 5. Markedly diminished interest or participation in
significant activities. 6. Feelings of detachment or estrangement from
others. 7. Persistent inability to experience positive emotions (e.g.,
inability to experience happiness, satisfaction, or loving feelings). e.
Marked alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with the
traumatic event(s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s)
occurred, as evidenced by two (or more) of the following: 1. Irritable
behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation) typically
expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects. 2.
Reckless or self-destructive behavior. 3. Hypervigilance. 4. Exaggerated
startle response. 5. Problems with concentration. 6. Sleep disturbance
(e.g., difficulty falling or staying asleep or restless sleep).
f. Duration of the disturbance (Criteria B, C, D, and E) is more than 1
month.

g. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. h. The
disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., medication, alcohol) or another medical condition.
Specify whether: With dissociative symptoms: The individual's symptoms
meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder, and in addition, in
response to the stressor, the individual experiences persistent or
recurrent symptoms of either of the following: 1. Depersonalization:
Persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached from, and as if
one were an outside observer of, one's mental processes or body (e.g.,
feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality of
self or body or of time moving slowly). 2. Derealization: Persistent or
recurrent experiences of unreality of surroundings (e.g., the world
around the individual is experienced as unreal, dreamlike, distant, or
distorted). Note: To use this subtype, the dissociative symptoms must
not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
blackouts, behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical
condition (e.g., complex partial seizures). Specify if: With delayed
expression: If the full diagnostic criteria are not met until at least 6
months after the event (although the onset and expression of some
symptoms may be immediate).

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder for Children 6 Years and Younger a. In
children 6 years and younger, exposure to actual or threatened death,
serious injury, or sexual violence in one (or more) of the following
ways: 1. Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).

2. Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others,
especially primary caregivers. Note: Witnessing does not include events
that are witnessed only in electronic media, television, movies, or
pictures. 3. Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a parent
or caregiving figure. b. Presence of one (or more) of the following
intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning
after the traumatic event(s) occurred: 1. Recurrent, involuntary, and
intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s). Note:
Spontaneous and intrusive memories may not necessarily appear
distressing and may be expressed as play reenactment. 2. Recurrent
distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of the dream are
related to the traumatic event(s). Note: It may not be possible to
ascertain that the frightening content is related to the traumatic
event. 3. Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the child
feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such
reactions may occur on a continuum, with the most extreme expression
being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.) Such
trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play. 4. Intense or prolonged
psychological distress at exposure to internal or external cues that
symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s). 5. Marked
physiological reactions to reminders of the traumatic event(s). c. One
(or more) of the following symptoms, representing either persistent
avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event(s) or negative
alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic
event(s), must be present, beginning after the event(s) or worsening
after the event(s):

Persistent Avoidance of Stimuli 1. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid
activities, places, or physical reminders that arouse recollections of
the traumatic event(s). 2. Avoidance of or efforts to avoid people,
conversations, or interpersonal situations that arouse recollections of
the traumatic event(s). Negative Alterations in Cognitions 3.
Substantially increased frequency of negative emotional states (e.g.,
fear, guilt, sadness, shame, confusion). 4. Markedly diminished interest
or participation in significant activities, including constriction of
play. 5. Socially withdrawn behavior. 6. Persistent reduction in
expression of positive emotions. d. Alterations in arousal and
reactivity associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning or
worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by two (or
more) of the following: 1. Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with
little or no provocation) typically expressed as verbal or physical
aggression toward people or objects (including extreme temper tantrums).
2. Hypervigilance. 3. Exaggerated startle response. 4. Problems with
concentration. 5. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or staying
asleep or restless sleep). e. The duration of the disturbance is more
than 1 month. f. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress
or impairment in relationships with parents, siblings, peers, or other
caregivers or with school behavior. g. The disturbance is not
attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
medication or alcohol) or another medical condition.

Specify whether: With dissociative symptoms: The individual's symptoms
meet the criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder, and the individual
experiences persistent or recurrent symptoms of either of the
following: 1. Depersonalization: Persistent or recurrent experiences of
feeling detached from, and as if one were an outside observer of, one's
mental processes or body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream;
feeling a sense of unreality of self or body or of time moving slowly).
2. Derealization: Persistent or recurrent experiences of unreality of
surroundings (e.g., the world around the individual is experienced as
unreal, dreamlike, distant, or distorted). Note: To use this subtype,
the dissociative symptoms must not be attributable to the physiological
effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts) or another medical condition
(e.g., complex partial seizures). Specify if: With delayed expression:
If the full diagnostic criteria are not met until at least 6 months
after the event (although the onset and expression of some symptoms may
be immediate).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) is the development of characteristic symptoms following
exposure to one or more traumatic events. Emotional reactions to the
traumatic event (e.g., fear, helplessness, horror) are no longer a part
of Criterion A. The clinical presentation of PTSD varies. In some
individuals, fear-based reexperiencing, emotional, and behavioral
symptoms may predominate. In others, anhedonic or dysphoric mood states
and negative cognitions may be most distressing. In some other
individuals, arousal and reactiveexternalizing symptoms are prominent,
while in others, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some
individuals exhibit combinations of these symptom patterns.

The directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A include, but
are not limited to, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian,
threatened or actual physical assault (e.g., physical attack, robbery,
mugging, childhood physical abuse), threatened or actual sexual violence
(e.g., forced sexual penetration, alcohol/drug-facilitated sexual
penetration, abusive sexual contact, noncontact sexual abuse, sexual
trafficking)4, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack,
torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or human-made
disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents. For children, sexually
violent events may include developmentally inappropriate sexual
experiences without physical violence or injury. A lifethreatening
illness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered
a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events
involve sudden, catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery,
anaphylactic shock). Witnessed events include, but are not limited to,
observing threatened or serious injury, unnatural death, physical or
sexual abuse of another person due to violent assault, domestic
violence, accident, war or disaster, or a medical catastrophe in one's
child (e.g., a lifethreatening hemorrhage). Indirect exposure through
learning about an event is limited to experiences affecting close
relatives or friends and experiences that are violent or accidental
(e.g., death due to natural causes does not qualify). Such events
include violent personal assault, suicide, serious accident, and serious
injury. The disorder may be especially severe or longlasting when the
stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e.g., torture, sexual
violence). The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways.
Commonly, the individual has recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive
recollections of the event (Criterion B1). Intrusive recollections in
PTSD are distinguished from depressive rumination in that they apply
only to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories. The emphasis is
on recurrent memories of the event that usually include sensory,
emotional, or physiological behavioral components. A common
reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams that replay the event
itself or that are representative or thematically related to the major
threats involved in the traumatic event (Criterion B2). The individual
may experience dissociative states that last from a few seconds to
several hours or even days, during which components of the event are
relived and the individual behaves as if the event were occurring at
that moment (Criterion B3). Such events occur on a continuum from brief
visual

or other sensory intrusions about part of the traumatic event without
loss of reality orientation, to complete loss of awareness of present
surroundings. These episodes, often referred to as "flashbacks," are
typically brief but can be associated with prolonged distress and
heightened arousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to
trauma may appear in play or in dissociative states. Intense
psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological reactivity
(Criterion B5) often occurs when the individual is exposed to triggering
events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event
(e.g., windy days after a hurricane; seeing someone who resembles one's
perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g.,
dizziness for survivors of head trauma; rapid heartbeat for a previously
traumatized child), particularly for individuals with highly somatic
presentations13. Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently
(e.g., always or almost always) avoided. The individual commonly makes
deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, memories, feelings, or talking
about the traumatic event (e.g., utilizing distraction techniques to
avoid internal reminders) (Criterion C1) and to avoid activities,
objects, situations, or people who arouse recollections of it (Criterion
C2). Negative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the
event begin or worsen after exposure to the event. These negative
alterations can take various forms, including an inability to remember
an important aspect of the traumatic event; such amnesia is typically
due to dissociative amnesia and is not due to head injury, alcohol, or
drugs (Criterion D1). Another form is persistent (i.e., always or almost
always) and exaggerated negative expectations regarding important
aspects of life applied to oneself, others, or the future (e.g., "I have
always had bad judgment"; "People in authority can't be trusted") that
may manifest as a negative change in perceived identity since the trauma
(e.g., "I can't trust anyone ever again"; Criterion D2). Individuals
with PTSD may have persistent erroneous cognitions about the causes of
the traumatic event that lead them to blame themselves or others (e.g.,
"It's all my fault that my uncle abused me") (Criterion D3). A
persistent negative mood state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame)
either began or worsened after exposure to the event (Criterion D4). The
individual may experience markedly diminished interest or participation
in previously enjoyed activities (Criterion D5), feeling detached or
estranged from other people (Criterion D6), or a persistent inability to
feel positive

emotions (especially happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions
associated with intimacy, tenderness, and sexuality) (Criterion D7)13.
Individuals with PTSD may be quick tempered and may even engage in
aggressive verbal and/or physical behavior with little or no provocation
(e.g., yelling at people, getting into fights, destroying objects)
(Criterion E1). They may also engage in reckless or self-destructive
behavior such as dangerous driving, excessive alcohol or drug use, or
self-injurious or suicidal behavior (Criterion E2). PTSD is often
characterized by a heightened sensitivity to potential threats,
including those that are related to the traumatic experience (e.g.,
following a motor vehicle accident, being especially sensitive to the
threat potentially caused by cars or trucks) and those not related to
the traumatic event (e.g., being fearful of suffering a heart attack)
(Criterion E3)34, 40. Individuals with PTSD may be very reactive to
unexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response, or
jumpiness, to loud noises or unexpected movements (e.g., jumping
markedly in response to a telephone ringing) (Criterion E4).
Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily
events (e.g., forgetting one's telephone number) or attending to focused
tasks (e.g., following a conversation for a sustained period of time),
are commonly reported (Criterion E5). Problems with sleep onset and
maintenance are common and may be associated with nightmares and safety
concerns or with generalized elevated arousal that interferes with
adequate sleep (Criterion E6). Some individuals also experience
persistent dissociative symptoms of detachment from their bodies
(depersonalization) or the world around them (derealization); this is
reflected in the "with dissociative symptoms" specifier13.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Developmental regression, such
as loss of language in young children, may occur. Auditory
pseudo-hallucinations, such as having the sensory experience of hearing
one's thoughts spoken in one or more different voices9, as well as
paranoid ideation, can be present. Following prolonged, repeated, and
severe traumatic events (e.g., childhood abuse, torture), the individual
may additionally experience difficulties in regulating emotions or
maintaining stable interpersonal relationships, or dissociative
symptoms.

When the traumatic event produces violent death, symptoms of both
problematic bereavement and PTSD may be present.

Prevalence In the United States, projected lifetime risk for PTSD using
DSM-IV criteria at age 75 years is 8.7%17. Twelve-month prevalence among
U.S. adults is about 3.5%18. Lower estimates are seen in Europe and most
Asian, African, and Latin American countries, clustering around
0.5%--1.0%14. Although different groups have different levels of
exposure to traumatic events7, the conditional probability of developing
PTSD following a similar level of exposure may also vary across cultural
groups14. Rates of PTSD are higher among veterans and others whose
vocation increases the risk of traumatic exposure (e.g., police,
firefighters, emergency medical personnel). Highest rates (ranging from
one-third to more than one-half of those exposed) are found among
survivors of rape, military combat and captivity, and ethnically or
politically motivated internment and genocide. The prevalence of PTSD
may vary across development; children and adolescents, including
preschool children, generally have displayed lower prevalence following
exposure to serious traumatic events; however, this may be because
previous criteria were insufficiently developmentally informed31. The
prevalence of full-threshold PTSD also appears to be lower among older
adults compared with the general population; there is evidence that
subthreshold presentations are more common than full PTSD in later life
and that these symptoms are associated with substantial clinical
impairment38. Compared with U.S. non-Latino whites, higher rates of PTSD
have been reported among U.S. Latinos, African Americans, and American
Indians, and lower rates have been reported among Asian Americans, after
adjustment for traumatic exposure and demographic variables5, 14, 23.

Development and Course PTSD can occur at any age, beginning after the
first year of life. Symptoms usually begin within the first 3 months
after the trauma, although there may be a delay of months, or even
years, before criteria for the diagnosis are met. There is abundant
evidence for what DSM-IV called "delayed onset" but is now called
"delayed expression," with the recognition that some

symptoms typically appear immediately and that the delay is in meeting
full criteria2. Frequently, an individual's reaction to a trauma
initially meets criteria for acute stress disorder in the immediate
aftermath of the trauma. The symptoms of PTSD and the relative
predominance of different symptoms may vary over time. Duration of the
symptoms also varies, with complete recovery within 3 months occurring
in approximately one-half of adults, while some individuals remain
symptomatic for longer than 12 months11 and sometimes for more than 50
years. Symptom recurrence and intensification may occur in response to
reminders of the original trauma, ongoing life stressors, or newly
experienced traumatic events. For older individuals, declining health,
worsening cognitive functioning, and social isolation may exacerbate
PTSD symptoms38. The clinical expression of reexperiencing can vary
across development. Young children may report new onset of frightening
dreams without content specific to the traumatic event. Before age 6
years (see criteria for preschool subtype), young children are more
likely to express reexperiencing symptoms through play that refers
directly or symbolically to the trauma. They may not manifest fearful
reactions at the time of the exposure or during reexperiencing. Parents
may report a wide range of emotional or behavioral changes in young
children. Children may focus on imagined interventions in their play or
storytelling. In addition to avoidance, children may become preoccupied
with reminders. Because of young children's limitations in expressing
thoughts or labeling emotions, negative alterations in mood or cognition
tend to involve primarily mood changes. Children may experience
co-occurring traumas (e.g., physical abuse, witnessing domestic
violence) and in chronic circumstances may not be able to identify onset
of symptomatology29, 30. Avoidant behavior may be associated with
restricted play or exploratory behavior in young children; reduced
participation in new activities in school-age children; or reluctance to
pursue developmental opportunities in adolescents (e.g., dating,
driving). Older children and adolescents may judge themselves as
cowardly. Adolescents may harbor beliefs of being changed in ways that
make them socially undesirable and estrange them from peers (e.g., "Now
I'll never fit in") and lose aspirations for the future. Irritable or
aggressive behavior in children and adolescents can interfere with peer
relationships and school behavior. Reckless behavior may lead to
accidental injury to self or others,

thrill-seeking, or high-risk behaviors24. Individuals who continue to
experience PTSD into older adulthood may express fewer symptoms of
hyperarousal, avoidance, and negative cognitions and mood compared with
younger adults with PTSD, although adults exposed to traumatic events
during later life may display more avoidance, hyperarousal, sleep
problems, and crying spells than do younger adults exposed to the same
traumatic events38. In older individuals, the disorder is associated
with negative health perceptions, primary care utilization, and suicidal
ideation25.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Risk (and protective) factors are generally
divided into pretraumatic, peritraumatic, and posttraumatic factors.

Pretraumatic factors Temperamental. These include childhood emotional
problems by age 6 years (e.g., prior traumatic exposure, externalizing
or anxiety problems) and prior mental disorders (e.g., panic disorder,
depressive disorder, PTSD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder \[OCD\]).
Environmental. These include lower socioeconomic status; lower
education; exposure to prior trauma (especially during childhood)6, 12,
35, childhood adversity (e.g., economic deprivation, family dysfunction,
parental separation or death); cultural characteristics (e.g.,
fatalistic or selfblaming coping strategies); lower intelligence;
minority racial/ethnic status; and a family psychiatric history. Social
support prior to event exposure is protective. Genetic and
physiological.. These include female gender and younger age at the time
of trauma exposure (for adults). Certain genotypes may either be
protective or increase risk of PTSD after exposure to traumatic events.

Peritraumatic factors Environmental. These include severity (dose) of
the trauma (the greater the magnitude of trauma, the greater the
likelihood of PTSD), perceived life threat, personal injury,
interpersonal violence (particularly trauma perpetrated by a caregiver
or involving a witnessed threat to a caregiver in

children)30, and, for military personnel, being a perpetrator,
witnessing atrocities, or killing the enemy. Finally, dissociation that
occurs during the trauma and persists afterward is a risk factor.

Posttraumatic factors Temperamental. These include negative appraisals,
inappropriate coping strategies, and development of acute stress
disorder. Environmental. These include subsequent exposure to repeated
upsetting reminders, subsequent adverse life events, and financial or
other traumarelated losses. Social support (including family stability,
for children) is a protective factor that moderates outcome after
trauma8, 39.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The risk of onset and severity of PTSD
may differ across cultural groups as a result of variation in the type
of traumatic exposure (e.g., genocide), the impact on disorder severity
of the meaning attributed to the traumatic event (e.g., inability to
perform funerary rites after a mass killing), the ongoing sociocultural
context (e.g., residing among unpunished perpetrators in postconflict
settings), and other cultural factors (e.g., acculturative stress in
immigrants)14. The relative risk for PTSD of particular exposures (e.g.,
religious persecution) may vary across cultural groups. The clinical
expression of the symptoms or symptom clusters of PTSD may vary
culturally, particularly with respect to avoidance and numbing symptoms,
distressing dreams, and somatic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, shortness of
breath, heat sensations). Cultural syndromes and idioms of distress
influence the expression of PTSD and the range of comorbid disorders in
different cultures by providing behavioral and cognitive templates that
link traumatic exposures to specific symptoms. For example, panic attack
symptoms may be salient in PTSD among Cambodians and Latin Americans
because of the association of traumatic exposure with panic-like khyâl
attacks and ataque de nervios14. Comprehensive evaluation of local
expressions of PTSD should include assessment of cultural concepts of
distress (see the chapter "Cultural Formulation" in Section III).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

PTSD is more prevalent among females than among males across the
lifespan. Females in the general population experience PTSD for a longer
duration than do males18. At least some of the increased risk for PTSD
in females appears to be attributable to a greater likelihood of
exposure to traumatic events, such as rape, and other forms of
interpersonal violence16. Within populations exposed specifically to
such stressors, gender differences in risk for PTSD are attenuated or
nonsignificant.

Suicide Risk Traumatic events such as childhood abuse increase a
person's suicide risk1. PTSD is associated with suicidal ideation and
suicide attempts26, 27, and presence of the disorder may indicate which
individuals with ideation eventually make a suicide plan or actually
attempt suicide21.

Functional Consequences of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is
associated with high levels of social, occupational, and physical
disability, as well as considerable economic costs and high levels of
medical utilization3, 15, 17. Impaired functioning is exhibited across
social, interpersonal, developmental, educational, physical health, and
occupational domains. In community and veteran samples, PTSD is
associated with poor social and family relationships, absenteeism from
work, lower income, and lower educational and occupational success22,
28, 33.

Differential Diagnosis Adjustment disorders. In adjustment disorders,
the stressor can be of any severity or type rather than that required by
PTSD Criterion A. The diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is used when
the response to a stressor that meets PTSD Criterion A does not meet all
other PTSD criteria (or criteria for another mental disorder). An
adjustment disorder is also diagnosed when the symptom pattern of PTSD
occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet PTSD Criterion A
(e.g., spouse leaving, being fired)37.

Other posttraumatic disorders and conditions. Not all psychopathology
that occurs in individuals exposed to an extreme stressor should
necessarily be attributed to PTSD. The diagnosis requires that trauma
exposure precede the onset or exacerbation of pertinent symptoms.
Moreover, if the symptom response pattern to the extreme stressor meets
criteria for another mental disorder, these diagnoses should be given
instead of, or in addition to, PTSD. Other diagnoses and conditions are
excluded if they are better explained by PTSD (e.g., symptoms of panic
disorder that occur only after exposure to traumatic reminders). If
severe, symptom response patterns to the extreme stressor may warrant a
separate diagnosis (e.g., dissociative amnesia). Acute stress disorder.
Acute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the symptom
pattern in acute stress disorder is restricted to a duration of 3 days
to 1 month following exposure to the traumatic event. Anxiety disorders
and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In OCD, there are recurrent intrusive
thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition,
the intrusive thoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic
event, compulsions are usually present, and other symptoms of PTSD or
acute stress disorder are typically absent. Neither the arousal and
dissociative symptoms of panic disorder nor the avoidance, irritability,
and anxiety of generalized anxiety disorder are associated with a
specific traumatic event. The symptoms of separation anxiety disorder
are clearly related to separation from home or family, rather than to a
traumatic event. Major depressive disorder. Major depression may or may
not be preceded by a traumatic event and should be diagnosed if other
PTSD symptoms are absent. Specifically, major depressive disorder does
not include any PTSD Criterion B or C symptoms. Nor does it include a
number of symptoms from PTSD Criterion D or E. Personality disorders.
Interpersonal difficulties that had their onset, or were greatly
exacerbated, after exposure to a traumatic event may be an indication of
PTSD, rather than a personality disorder, in which such difficulties
would be expected independently of any traumatic exposure. Dissociative
disorders. Dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, and
depersonalization-derealization disorder may or may not be

preceded by exposure to a traumatic event or may or may not have
cooccurring PTSD symptoms. When full PTSD criteria are also met,
however, the PTSD "with dissociative symptoms" subtype should be
considered. Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom
disorder). New onset of somatic symptoms within the context of
posttraumatic distress might be an indication of PTSD rather than
conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder).
Psychotic disorders. Flashbacks in PTSD must be distinguished from
illusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may
occur in schizophrenia, brief psychotic disorder, and other psychotic
disorders; depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic features;
delirium; substance/medication-induced disorders; and psychotic
disorders due to another medical condition. Traumatic brain injury. When
a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g.,
traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma),
symptoms of PTSD may appear. An event causing head trauma may also
constitute a psychological traumatic event, and tramautic brain injury
(TBI)--related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive and
may occur concurrently36. Symptoms previously termed postconcussive
(e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound,
irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain-injured and
non-brain-injured populations, including individuals with PTSD20.
Because symptoms of PTSD and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can
overlap, a differential diagnosis between PTSD and neurocognitive
disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible based on the
presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas
reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of PTSD and not the
effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are more
specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to PTSD.

Comorbidity Individuals with PTSD are 80% more likely than those without
PTSD to have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for at least one
other mental disorder (e.g., depressive, bipolar, anxiety, or substance
use disorders)19. Comorbid substance use disorder and conduct disorder16
are more common among males than among females. Among U.S. military
personnel and

combat veterans who have been deployed to recent wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq, co-occurrence of PTSD and mild TBI is 48%32. Although most young
children with PTSD also have at least one other diagnosis, the patterns
of comorbidity are different than in adults, with oppositional defiant
disorder and separation anxiety disorder predominating29, 30. Finally,
there is considerable comorbidity between PTSD and major neurocognitive
disorder and some overlapping symptoms between these disorders41.

Acute Stress Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

308.3 (F43.0)

a.  Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual
    violation in one (or more) of the following ways:

<!-- -->

1.  Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).
2.  Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others.
3.  Learning that the event(s) occurred to a close family member or
    close friend. Note: In cases of actual or threatened death of a
    family member or friend, the event(s) must have been violent or
    accidental.
4.  Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the
    traumatic event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains,
    police officers repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse). Note:
    This does not apply to exposure through electronic media,
    television, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work
    related.

<!-- -->

b.  Presence of nine (or more) of the following symptoms from any of the
    five categories of intrusion, negative mood, dissociation,
    avoidance, and arousal, beginning or worsening after the traumatic
    event(s) occurred: Intrusion Symptoms

<!-- -->

1.  Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the
    traumatic event(s). Note: In children, repetitive play may occur in
    which themes or aspects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed.
2.  Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or affect of
    the dream are related to the event(s). Note: In children, there may
    be frightening dreams without recognizable content.
3.  Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual
    feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such
    reactions may occur on a continuum, with the most extreme

expression being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.)
Note: In children, trauma-specific reenactment may occur in play. 4.
Intense or prolonged psychological distress or marked physiological
reactions in response to internal or external cues that symbolize or
resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s). Negative Mood 5.
Persistent inability to experience positive emotions (e.g., inability to
experience happiness, satisfaction, or loving feelings). Dissociative
Symptoms 6. An altered sense of the reality of one's surroundings or
oneself (e.g., seeing oneself from another's perspective, being in a
daze, time slowing). 7. Inability to remember an important aspect of the
traumatic event(s) (typically due to dissociative amnesia and not to
other factors such as head injury, alcohol, or drugs). Avoidance
Symptoms 8. Efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings
about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s). 9. Efforts to
avoid external reminders (people, places, conversations, activities,
objects, situations) that arouse distressing memories, thoughts, or
feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).
Arousal Symptoms 10. Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling or
staying asleep, restless sleep). 11. Irritable behavior and angry
outbursts (with little or no provocation), typically expressed as verbal
or physical aggression toward people or objects. 12. Hypervigilance. 13.
Problems with concentration. 14. Exaggerated startle response.

c. Duration of the disturbance (symptoms in Criterion B) is 3 days to 1
month after trauma exposure. Note: Symptoms typically begin immediately
after the trauma, but persistence for at least 3 days and up to a month
is needed to meet disorder criteria. d. The disturbance causes
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning. e. The disturbance is not
attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g.,
medication or alcohol) or another medical condition (e.g., mild
traumatic brain injury) and is not better explained by brief psychotic
disorder.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of acute stress disorder is
the development of characteristic symptoms lasting from 3 days to 1
month following exposure to one or more traumatic events9. Traumatic
events that are experienced directly include, but are not limited to,
exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual violent
personal assault (e.g., sexual violence, physical attack, active combat,
mugging, childhood physical and/or sexual violence, being kidnapped,
being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture), natural or humanmade
disasters (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, airplane crash), and severe
accident (e.g., severe motor vehicle, industrial accident). For
children, sexually traumatic events may include inappropriate sexual
experiences without violence or injury. A life-threatening illness or
debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic
event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve
sudden, catastrophic events (e.g., waking during surgery, anaphylactic
shock). Stressful events that do not possess the severe and traumatic
components of events encompassed by Criterion A may lead to an
adjustment disorder but not to acute stress disorder. The clinical
presentation of acute stress disorder may vary by individual but
typically involves an anxiety response that includes some form of
reexperiencing of or reactivity to the traumatic event5. In some
individuals, a dissociative or detached presentation can predominate,
although these individuals typically will also display strong emotional
or physiological

reactivity in response to trauma reminders. In other individuals, there
can be a strong anger response in which reactivity is characterized by
irritable or possibly aggressive responses. The full symptom picture
must be present for at least 3 days after the traumatic event and can be
diagnosed only up to 1 month after the event. Symptoms that occur
immediately after the event but resolve in less than 3 days would not
meet criteria for acute stress disorder. Witnessed events include, but
are not limited to, observing threatened or serious injury, unnatural
death, physical or sexual violence inflicted on another individual as a
result of violent assault, severe domestic violence, severe accident,
war, and disaster; it may also include witnessing a medical catastrophe
(e.g., a life-threatening hemorrhage) involving one's child. Events
experienced indirectly through learning about the event are limited to
close relatives or close friends. Such events must have been violent or
accidental---death due to natural causes does not qualify---and include
violent personal assault, suicide, serious accident, or serious injury9.
The disorder may be especially severe when the stressor is interpersonal
and intentional (e.g., torture, rape). The likelihood of developing this
disorder may increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the
stressor increase10, 14. The traumatic event can be reexperienced in
various ways. Commonly, the individual has recurrent and intrusive
recollections of the event (Criterion B1). The recollections are
spontaneous or triggered recurrent memories of the event that usually
occur in response to a stimulus that is reminiscent of the traumatic
experience (e.g., the sound of a backfiring car triggering memories of
gunshots). These intrusive memories often include sensory (e.g., sensing
the intense heat that was perceived in a house fire), emotional (e.g.,
experiencing the fear of believing that one was about to be stabbed), or
physiological (e.g., experiencing the shortness of breath that one
suffered during a near-drowning) components. Distressing dreams may
contain themes that are representative of or thematically related to the
major threats involved in the traumatic event. (For example, in the case
of a motor vehicle accident survivor, the distressing dreams may involve
crashing cars generally; in the case of a combat soldier, the
distressing dreams may involve being harmed in ways other than combat.)

Dissociative states may last from a few seconds to several hours, or
even days, during which components of the event are relived and the
individual behaves as though experiencing the event at that moment.
While dissociative responses are common during a traumatic event, only
dissociative responses that persist beyond 3 days after trauma exposure
are considered for the diagnosis of acute stress disorder. For young
children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play and
may include dissociative moments (e.g., a child who survives a motor
vehicle accident may repeatedly crash toy cars during play in a focused
and distressing manner). These episodes, often referred to as
flashbacks, are typically brief but involve a sense that the traumatic
event is occurring in the present rather than being remembered in the
past and are associated with significant distress. Some individuals with
the disorder do not have intrusive memories of the event itself, but
instead experience intense psychological distress or physiological
reactivity when they are exposed to triggering events that resemble or
symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., windy days for
children after a hurricane, entering an elevator for a male or female
who was raped in an elevator, seeing someone who resembles one's
perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e.g., a
sense of heat for a burn victim, dizziness for survivors of head
trauma), particularly for individuals with highly somatic presentations.
The individual may have a persistent inability to feel positive emotions
(e.g., happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with
intimacy, tenderness, or sexuality) but can experience negative emotions
such as fear, sadness, anger, guilt, or shame. Alterations in awareness
can include depersonalization, a detached sense of oneself (e.g., seeing
oneself from the other side of the room), or derealization, having a
distorted view of one's surroundings (e.g., perceiving that things are
moving in slow motion, seeing things in a daze, not being aware of
events that one would normally encode). Some individuals also report an
inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event that
was presumably encoded. This symptom is attributable to dissociative
amnesia and is not attributable to head injury, alcohol, or drugs.
Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided. The
individual may refuse to discuss the traumatic experience or may engage
in

avoidance strategies to minimize awareness of emotional reactions (e.g.,
excessive alcohol use when reminded of the experience). This behavioral
avoidance may include avoiding watching news coverage of the traumatic
experience, refusing to return to a workplace where the trauma occurred,
or avoiding interacting with others who shared the same traumatic
experience. It is very common for individuals with acute stress disorder
to experience problems with sleep onset and maintenance, which may be
associated with nightmares or with generalized elevated arousal that
prevents adequate sleep. Individuals with acute stress disorder may be
quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or physical
behavior with little provocation. Acute stress disorder is often
characterized by a heightened sensitivity to potential threats,
including those that are related to the traumatic experience (e.g., a
motor vehicle accident victim may be especially sensitive to the threat
potentially caused by any cars or trucks) or those not related to the
traumatic event (e.g., fear of having a heart attack)26, 30.
Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily
events (e.g., forgetting one's telephone number) or attending to focused
tasks (e.g., following a conversation for a sustained period of time),
are commonly reported. Individuals with acute stress disorder may be
very reactive to unexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle
response or jumpiness to loud noises or unexpected movements (e.g., the
individual may jump markedly in the response to a telephone ringing).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with acute stress
disorder commonly engage in catastrophic or extremely negative thoughts
about their role in the traumatic event, their response to the traumatic
experience, or the likelihood of future harm. For example, an individual
with acute stress disorder may feel excessively guilty about not having
prevented the traumatic event or about not adapting to the experience
more successfully13, 30. Individuals with acute stress disorder may also
interpret their symptoms in a catastrophic manner, such that flashback
memories or emotional numbing may be interpreted as a sign of diminished
mental capacity12, 26. It is common for individuals with acute stress
disorder to experience panic attacks in the initial month after trauma
exposure that may be triggered by trauma reminders or may apparently
occur spontaneously7, 25. Additionally, individuals with acute stress

disorder may display chaotic or impulsive behavior. For example,
individuals may drive recklessly, make irrational decisions, or gamble
excessively. In children, there may be significant separation anxiety,
possibly manifested by excessive needs for attention from caregivers. In
the case of bereavement following a death that occurred in traumatic
circumstances, the symptoms of acute stress disorder can involve acute
grief reactions. In such cases, reexperiencing, dissociative, and
arousal symptoms may involve reactions to the loss, such as intrusive
memories of the circumstances of the individual's death, disbelief that
the individual has died, and anger about the death. Postconcussive
symptoms (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound,
irritability, concentration deficits), which occur frequently following
mild traumatic brain injury, are also frequently seen in individuals
with acute stress disorder4. Postconcussive symptoms are equally common
in brain-injured and non--brain-injured populations, and the frequent
occurrence of postconcussive symptoms could be attributable to acute
stress disorder symptoms24.

Prevalence The prevalence of acute stress disorder in recently
trauma-exposed populations (i.e., within 1 month of trauma exposure)
varies according to the nature of the event and the context in which it
is assessed. In both U.S. and non-U.S. populations, acute stress
disorder tends to be identified in less than 20% of cases following
traumatic events that do not involve interpersonal assault; 13%--21% of
motor vehicle accidents18, 22, 14% of mild traumatic brain injury16, 19%
of assault3, 10% of severe burns19, and 6%--12% of industrial
accidents11, 19. Higher rates (i.e., 20%--50%) are reported following
interpersonal traumatic events, including assault, rape, and witnessing
a mass shooting10, 14.

Development and Course Acute stress disorder cannot be diagnosed until 3
days after a traumatic event. Although acute stress disorder may
progress to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after 1 month, it may
also be a transient stress response that remits within 1 month of trauma
exposure and does not result in PTSD9. Approximately half of individuals
who eventually develop PTSD initially present with acute stress
disorder5. Symptom worsening during the

initial month can occur, often as a result of ongoing life stressors or
further traumatic events6, 27. The forms of reexperiencing can vary
across development. Unlike adults or adolescents, young children may
report frightening dreams without content that clearly reflects aspects
of the trauma (e.g., waking in fright in the aftermath of the trauma but
being unable to relate the content of the dream to the traumatic event).
Children age 6 years and younger are more likely than older children to
express reexperiencing symptoms through play that refers directly or
symbolically to the trauma. For example, a very young child who survived
a fire may draw pictures of flames. Young children also do not
necessarily manifest fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or
even during reexperiencing. Parents typically report a range of
emotional expressions, such as anger, shame, or withdrawal, and even
excessively bright positive affect, in young children who are
traumatized. Although children may avoid reminders of the trauma, they
sometimes become preoccupied with reminders (e.g., a young child bitten
by a dog may talk about dogs constantly yet avoid going outside because
of fear of coming into contact with a dog).

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Risk factors include prior
mental disorder, high levels of negative affectivity (neuroticism),
greater perceived severity of the traumatic event, and an avoidant
coping style2, 17, 20. Catastrophic appraisals of the traumatic
experience, often characterized by exaggerated appraisals of future
harm, guilt, or hopelessness, are strongly predictive of acute stress
disorder26, 30. Environmental. First and foremost, an individual must be
exposed to a traumatic event to be at risk for acute stress disorder.
Risk factors for the disorder include a history of prior trauma2, 17,
20. Genetic and physiological. Females are at greater risk for
developing acute stress disorder2, 17, 20. Elevated reactivity, as
reflected by acoustic startle response, prior to trauma exposure
increases the risk for developing acute stress disorder15.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The profile of symptoms of acute stress disorder may vary
cross-culturally, particularly with respect to dissociative symptoms,
nightmares, avoidance, and somatic symptoms (e.g., dizziness, shortness
of breath, heat sensations). Cultural syndromes and idioms of distress
shape the local symptom profiles of acute stress disorder. Some cultural
groups may display variants of dissociative responses, such as
possession or trancelike behaviors in the initial month after trauma
exposure23. Panic symptoms may be salient in acute stress disorder among
Cambodians because of the association of traumatic exposure with
panic-like khyâl attacks, and ataque de nervios among Latin Americans
may also follow a traumatic exposure21.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Acute stress disorder is more prevalent
among females than among males. Sex-linked neurobiological differences
in stress response may contribute to females' increased risk for acute
stress disorder1, 8. The increased risk for the disorder in females may
be attributable in part to a greater likelihood of exposure to the types
of traumatic events with a high conditional risk for acute stress
disorder, such as rape and other interpersonal violence.

Functional Consequences of Acute Stress Disorder Impaired functioning in
social, interpersonal, or occupational domains has been shown across
survivors of accidents, assault, and rape who develop acute stress
disorder. The extreme levels of anxiety that may be associated with
acute stress disorder may interfere with sleep, energy levels, and
capacity to attend to tasks. Avoidance in acute stress disorder can
result in generalized withdrawal from many situations that are perceived
as potentially threatening, which can lead to nonattendance of medical
appointments, avoidance of driving to important appointments, and
absenteeism from work.

Differential Diagnosis Adjustment disorders. In adjustment disorders,
the stressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type
required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder. The diagnosis of an
adjustment disorder is used when the response to a Criterion A event
does not meet the criteria for acute stress disorder (or another
specific mental disorder) and when the symptom

pattern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that
does not meet Criterion A for exposure to actual or threatened death,
serious injury, or sexual violence (e.g., spouse leaving, being
fired)29. For example, severe stress reactions to life-threatening
illnesses that may include some acute stress disorder symptoms may be
more appropriately described as an adjustment disorder. Some forms of
acute stress response do not include acute stress disorder symptoms and
may be characterized by anger, depression, or guilt. These responses are
more appropriately described as primarily an adjustment disorder.
Depressive or anger responses in an adjustment disorder may involve
rumination about the traumatic event, as opposed to involuntary and
intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder. Panic disorder.
Spontaneous panic attacks are very common in acute stress disorder7, 25.
However, panic disorder is diagnosed only if panic attacks are
unexpected and there is anxiety about future attacks or maladaptive
changes in behavior associated with fear of dire consequences of the
attacks. Dissociative disorders. Severe dissociative responses (in the
absence of characteristic acute stress disorder symptoms) may be
diagnosed as derealization/depersonalization disorder. If severe amnesia
of the trauma persists in the absence of characteristic acute stress
disorder symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative amnesia may be
indicated. Posttraumatic stress disorder. Acute stress disorder is
distinguished from PTSD because the symptom pattern in acute stress
disorder must occur within 1 month of the traumatic event and resolve
within that 1-month period. If the symptoms persist for more than 1
month and meet criteria for PTSD, the diagnosis is changed from acute
stress disorder to PTSD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. In
obsessive-compulsive disorder, there are recurrent intrusive thoughts,
but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the
intrusive thoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event,
compulsions are usually present, and other symptoms of acute stress
disorder are typically absent. Psychotic disorders. Flashbacks in acute
stress disorder must be distinguished from illusions, hallucinations,
and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, other
psychotic disorders,

depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, a delirium,
substance/medication-induced disorders, and psychotic disorders due to
another medical condition. Acute stress disorder flashbacks are
distinguished from these other perceptual disturbances by being directly
related to the traumatic experience and by occurring in the absence of
other psychotic or substance-induced features. Traumatic brain injury.
When a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e.g.,
traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma),
symptoms of acute stress disorder may appear. An event causing head
trauma may also constitute a psychological traumatic event, and
tramautic brain injury (TBI)--related neurocognitive symptoms are not
mutually exclusive and may occur concurrently28. Symptoms previously
termed postconcussive (e.g., headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light
or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in
brain-injured and non--brain injured populations, including individuals
with acute stress disorder24. Because symptoms of acute stress disorder
and TBIrelated neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential
diagnosis between acute stress disorder and neurocognitive disorder
symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible based on the presence of
symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas
reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of acute stress disorder
and not the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are
more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to acute stress
disorder. Furthermore, differential is aided by the fact that symptoms
of acute stress disorder persist for up to only 1 month following trauma
exposure.

Adjustment Disorders Diagnostic Criteria a. The development of emotional
or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor(s)
occurring within 3 months of the onset of the stressor(s). b. These
symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evidenced by one or
both of the following: 1. Marked distress that is out of proportion to
the severity or intensity of the stressor, taking into account the
external context and the cultural factors that might influence symptom
severity and presentation. 2. Significant impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning. c. The
stress-related disturbance does not meet the criteria for another mental
disorder and is not merely an exacerbation of a preexisting mental
disorder. d. The symptoms do not represent normal bereavement. e. Once
the stressor or its consequences have terminated, the symptoms do not
persist for more than an additional 6 months. Specify whether: 309.0
(F43.21) With depressed mood: Low mood, tearfulness, or feelings of
hopelessness are predominant. 309.24 (F43.22) With anxiety: Nervousness,
worry, jitteriness, or separation anxiety is predominant. 309.28
(F43.23) With mixed anxiety and depressed mood: A combination of
depression and anxiety is predominant.

309.3 (F43.24) With disturbance of conduct: Disturbance of conduct is
predominant. 309.4 (F43.25) With mixed disturbance of emotions and
conduct: Both emotional symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) and a
disturbance of conduct are predominant. 309.9 (F43.20) Unspecified: For
maladaptive reactions that are not classifiable as one of the specific
subtypes of adjustment disorder. Specify if: Acute: If the disturbance
lasts less than 6 months. Persistent (chronic): If the disturbance lasts
for 6 months or longer.

Diagnostic Features The presence of emotional or behavioral symptoms in
response to an identifiable stressor is the essential feature of
adjustment disorders (Criterion A). The stressor may be a single event
(e.g., a termination of a romantic relationship), or there may be
multiple stressors (e.g., marked business difficulties and marital
problems). Stressors may be recurrent (e.g., associated with seasonal
business crises, unfulfilling sexual relationships) or continuous (e.g.,
a persistent painful illness with increasing disability, living in a
crime-ridden neighborhood). Stressors may affect a single individual, an
entire family, or a larger group or community (e.g., a natural
disaster). Some stressors may accompany specific developmental events
(e.g., going to school, leaving a parental home, reentering a parental
home, getting married, becoming a parent, failing to attain occupational
goals, retirement)11. Adjustment disorders may be diagnosed following
the death of a loved one when the intensity, quality, or persistence of
grief reactions exceeds what normally might be expected, when cultural,
religious, or ageappropriate norms are taken into account6, 9, 13. A
more specific set of bereavement-related symptoms has been designated
persistent complex bereavement disorder. Adjustment disorders are
associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts and completed
suicide8, 10.

Prevalence

Adjustment disorders are common, although prevalence may vary widely as
a function of the population studied and the assessment methods used2.
The percentage of individuals in outpatient mental health treatment with
a principal diagnosis of an adjustment disorder ranges from
approximately 5% to 20%3. In a hospital psychiatric consultation
setting, it is often the most common diagnosis, frequently reaching
50%4, 7, 12.

Development and Course By definition, the disturbance in adjustment
disorders begins within 3 months of onset of a stressor and lasts no
longer than 6 months after the stressor or its consequences have ceased.
If the stressor is an acute event (e.g., being fired from a job), the
onset of the disturbance is usually immediate (i.e., within a few days)
and the duration is relatively brief (i.e., no more than a few months).
If the stressor or its consequences persist, the adjustment disorder may
also continue to be present and become the persistent form.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Individuals from
disadvantaged life circumstances experience a high rate of stressors and
may be at increased risk for adjustment disorders.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The context of the individual's
cultural setting should be taken into account in making the clinical
judgment of whether the individual's response to the stressor is
maladaptive or whether the associated distress is in excess of what
would be expected. The nature, meaning, and experience of the stressors
and the evaluation of the response to the stressors may vary across
cultures.

Functional Disorders

Consequences

of

Adjustment

The subjective distress or impairment in functioning associated with
adjustment disorders is frequently manifested as decreased performance
at work or school and temporary changes in social relationships. An
adjustment disorder may complicate the course of illness in individuals
who

have a general medical condition (e.g., decreased compliance with the
recommended medical regimen; increased length of hospital stay).

Differential Diagnosis Major depressive disorder. If an individual has
symptoms that meet criteria for a major depressive disorder in response
to a stressor, the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is not
applicable. The symptom profile of major depressive disorder
differentiates it from adjustment disorders. Posttraumatic stress
disorder and acute stress disorder. In adjustment disorders, the
stressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type
required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder and posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD)11. In distinguishing adjustment disorders from
these two posttraumatic diagnoses, there are both timing and symptom
profile considerations. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed
immediately and persist up to 6 months after exposure to the traumatic
event, whereas acute stress disorder can only occur between 3 days and 1
month of exposure to the stressor1, and PTSD cannot be diagnosed until
at least 1 month has passed since the occurrence of the traumatic
stressor5. The required symptom profile for PTSD and acute stress
disorder differentiates them from the adjustment disorders. With regard
to symptom profiles, an adjustment disorder may be diagnosed following a
traumatic event when an individual exhibits symptoms of either acute
stress disorder or PTSD that do not meet or exceed the diagnostic
threshold for either disorder. An adjustment disorder should also be
diagnosed for individuals who have not been exposed to a traumatic event
but who otherwise exhibit the full symptom profile of either acute
stress disorder or PTSD. Personality disorders. With regard to
personality disorders, some personality features may be associated with
a vulnerability to situational distress that may resemble an adjustment
disorder. The lifetime history of personality functioning will help
inform the interpretation of distressed behaviors to aid in
distinguishing a long-standing personality disorder from an adjustment
disorder. In addition to some personality disorders incurring
vulnerability to distress, stressors may also exacerbate personality
disorder symptoms. In the presence of a personality disorder, if the
symptom criteria for an adjustment disorder are met, and the
stress-related disturbance exceeds what may be attributable to
maladaptive personality disorder

symptoms (i.e., Criterion C is met), then the diagnosis of an adjustment
disorder should be made. Psychological factors affecting other medical
conditions. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions,
specific psychological entities (e.g., psychological symptoms,
behaviors, other factors) exacerbate a medical condition. These
psychological factors can precipitate, exacerbate, or put an individual
at risk for medical illness, or they can worsen an existing condition.
In contrast, an adjustment disorder is a reaction to the stressor (e.g.,
having a medical illness). Normative stress reactions. When bad things
happen, most people get upset. This is not an adjustment disorder. The
diagnosis should only be made when the magnitude of the distress (e.g.,
alterations in mood, anxiety, or conduct) exceeds what would normally be
expected (which may vary in different cultures) or when the adverse
event precipitates functional impairment.

Comorbidity Adjustment disorders can accompany most mental disorders and
any medical disorder. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed in addition
to another mental disorder only if the latter does not explain the
particular symptoms that occur in reaction to the stressor. For example,
an individual may develop an adjustment disorder, with depressed mood,
after losing a job and at the same time have a diagnosis of
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Or, an individual may have a depressive
or bipolar disorder and an adjustment disorder as long as the criteria
for both are met. Adjustment disorders are common accompaniments of
medical illness and may be the major psychological response to a medical
disorder.

Other Specified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder

309.89 (F43.8) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of a trauma- and stressor-related disorder that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any of the disorders in the trauma- and
stressor-related disorders diagnostic class. The other specified trauma-
and stressor-related disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific trauma- and
stressor-related disorder. This is done by recording "other specified
traumaand stressor-related disorder" followed by the specific reason
(e.g., "persistent complex bereavement disorder"). Examples of
presentations that can be specified using the "other specified"
designation include the following: 1. Adjustment-like disorders with
delayed onset of symptoms that occur more than 3 months after the
stressor. 2. Adjustment-like disorders with prolonged duration of more
than 6 months without prolonged duration of stressor. 3. Ataque de
nervios: See "Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress" in the
Appendix. 4. Other cultural syndromes: See "Glossary of Cultural
Concepts of Distress" in the Appendix. 5. Persistent complex bereavement
disorder: This disorder is characterized by severe and persistent grief
and mourning reactions (see the chapter "Conditions for Further Study").

Unspecified Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorder 309.9 (F43.9) This
category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
trauma- and stressor-related disorder that cause clinically significant

distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the trauma- and stressor-related disorders diagnostic
class. The unspecified trauma- and stressor-related disorder category is
used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the
reason that the criteria are not met for a specific trauma- and
stressor-related disorder, and includes presentations in which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).

Dissociative Disorders Dissociative disorders are characterized by a
disruption of and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of
consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body
representation, motor control, and behavior. Dissociative symptoms can
potentially disrupt every area of psychological functioning. This
chapter includes dissociative identity disorder, dissociative amnesia,
depersonalization/derealization disorder, other specified dissociative
disorder, and unspecified dissociative disorder. Dissociative symptoms
are experienced as a) unbidden intrusions into awareness and behavior,
with accompanying losses of continuity in subjective experience (i.e.,
''positive'' dissociative symptoms such as fragmentation of identity,
depersonalization, and derealization) and/or b) inability to access
information or to control mental functions that normally are readily
amenable to access or control (i.e., "negative'' dissociative symptoms
such as amnesia). The dissociative disorders are frequently found in the
aftermath of trauma, and many of the symptoms, including embarrassment
and confusion about the symptoms or a desire to hide them, are
influenced by the proximity to trauma. In DSM-5, the dissociative
disorders are placed next to, but are not part of, the trauma- and
stressor-related disorders, reflecting the close relationship between
these diagnostic classes. Both acute stress disorder and posttraumatic
stress disorder contain dissociative symptoms, such as amnesia,
flashbacks, numbing, and depersonalization/derealization.
Depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by clinically
significant persistent or recurrent depersonalization (i.e., experiences
of unreality or detachment from one's mind, self, or body) and/or
derealization (i.e., experiences of unreality or detachment from one's
surroundings). These alterations of experience are accompanied by intact
reality testing. There is no evidence of any distinction between
individuals with predominantly depersonalization versus derealization
symptoms. Therefore,

individuals with this disorder can have depersonalization,
derealization, or both. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by an
inability to recall autobiographical information. This amnesia may be
localized (i.e., an event or period of time), selective (i.e., a
specific aspect of an event), or generalized (i.e., identity and life
history). Dissociative amnesia is fundamentally an inability to recall
autobiographical information that is inconsistent with normal
forgetting. It may or may not involve purposeful travel or bewildered
wandering (i.e., fugue). Although some individuals with amnesia promptly
notice that they have "lost time" or that they have a gap in their
memory, most individuals with dissociative disorders are initially
unaware of their amnesias. For them, awareness of amnesia occurs only
when personal identity is lost or when circumstances make these
individuals aware that autobiographical information is missing (e.g.,
when they discover evidence of events they cannot recall or when others
tell them or ask them about events they cannot recall). Until and unless
this happens, these individuals have "amnesia for their amnesia."
Amnesia is experienced as an essential feature of dissociative amnesia;
individuals may experience localized or selective amnesia most commonly,
or generalized amnesia rarely. Dissociative fugue is rare in persons
with dissociative amnesia but common in dissociative identity disorder.
Dissociative identity disorder is characterized by a) the presence of
two or more distinct personality states or an experience of possession
and b) recurrent episodes of amnesia. The fragmentation of identity may
vary with culture (e.g., possession-form presentations) and
circumstance. Thus, individuals may experience discontinuities in
identity and memory that may not be immediately evident to others or are
obscured by attempts to hide dysfunction. Individuals with dissociative
identity disorder experience a) recurrent, inexplicable intrusions into
their conscious functioning and sense of self (e.g., voices; dissociated
actions and speech; intrusive thoughts, emotions, and impulses), b)
alterations of sense of self (e.g., attitudes, preferences, and feeling
like one's body or actions are not one's own), c) odd changes of
perception (e.g., depersonalization or derealization, such as feeling
detached from one's body while cutting), and d) intermittent functional
neurological symptoms. Stress often produces transient exacerbation of
dissociative symptoms that makes them more evident.

The residual category of other specified dissociative disorder has seven
examples: chronic or recurrent mixed dissociative symptoms that
approach, but fall short of, the diagnostic criteria for dissociative
identity disorder; dissociative states secondary to brainwashing or
thought reform; two acute presentations, of less than 1 month's
duration, of mixed dissociative symptoms, one of which is also marked by
the presence of psychotic symptoms; and three single-symptom
dissociative presentations--- dissociative trance, dissociative stupor
or coma, and Ganser's syndrome (the giving of approximate and vague
answers).

Dissociative Identity Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

300.14 (F44.81)

a.  Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct
    personality states, which may be described in some cultures as an
    experience of possession. The disruption in identity involves marked
    discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency, accompanied by
    related alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory,
    perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs
    and symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the
    individual.
b.  Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal
    information, and/or traumatic events that are inconsistent with
    ordinary forgetting.
c.  The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
    social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
d.  The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural
    or religious practice. Note: In children, the symptoms are not
    better explained by imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.
e.  The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a
    substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol
    intoxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial
    seizures).

Diagnostic Features The defining feature of dissociative identity
disorder is the presence of two or more distinct personality states or
an experience of possession (Criterion A). The overtness or covertness
of these personality states, however, varies as a function of
psychological motivation, current level of stress, culture, internal
conflicts and dynamics, and emotional resilience16. Sustained periods of
identity disruption may occur when psychosocial pressures are severe
and/or prolonged. In many possession-form cases of dissociative identity
disorder, and in a small proportion of non-possession-form cases,
manifestations of alternate identities are highly overt16, 32. Most
individuals with non-possession-form dissociative identity disorder do
not overtly display their discontinuity of identity for long periods of
time; only a small minority present to clinical attention with
observable alternation of identities7, 16, 32. When alternate
personality states are not directly observed, the disorder can be
identified by two clusters of symptoms: 1) sudden alterations or
discontinuities in sense of self and sense of agency (Criterion A), and
2) recurrent dissociative amnesias (Criterion B). Criterion A symptoms
are related to discontinuities of experience that can affect any aspect
of an individual's functioning. Individuals with dissociative identity
disorder may report the feeling that they have suddenly become
depersonalized observers of their "own" speech and actions, which they
may feel powerless to stop (sense of self)6, 32. Such individuals may
also report perceptions of voices (e.g., a child's voice; crying; the
voice of a spiritual being). In some cases, voices are experienced as
multiple, perplexing, independent thought streams over which the
individual experiences no control. Strong emotions, impulses, and even
speech or other actions may suddenly emerge, without a sense of personal
ownership or control (sense of agency). These emotions and impulses are
frequently reported as ego-dystonic and puzzling. Attitudes, outlooks,
and personal preferences (e.g., about food, activities, dress) may
suddenly shift and then shift back. Individuals may report that their
bodies feel different (e.g., like a small child, like the opposite
gender, huge and muscular). Alterations in sense of self and loss of
personal agency may be accompanied by a feeling that these attitudes,
emotions, and behaviors---even one's body---are "not mine" and/or are
"not under my control." Although most Criterion A symptoms are
subjective, many of these sudden discontinuities in speech,

affect, and behavior can be witnessed by family, friends, or the
clinician. Non-epileptic seizures and other conversion symptoms are
prominent in some presentations of dissociative identity disorder,
especially in some nonWestern settings28, 29, 33. The dissociative
amnesia of individuals with dissociative identity disorder manifests in
three primary ways: as 1) gaps in remote memory of personal life events
(e.g., periods of childhood or adolescence; some important life events,
such as the death of a grandparent, getting married, giving birth); 2)
lapses in dependable memory (e.g., of what happened today, of
well-learned skills such as how to do their job, use a computer, read,
drive); and 3) discovery of evidence of their everyday actions and tasks
that they do not recollect doing (e.g., finding unexplained objects in
their shopping bags or among their possessions; finding perplexing
writings or drawings that they must have created; discovering injuries;
"coming to" in the midst of doing something)6, 32. Dissociative fugues,
wherein the person discovers dissociated travel, are common6, 32. Thus,
individuals with dissociative identity disorder may report that they
have suddenly found themselves at the beach, at work, in a nightclub, or
somewhere at home (e.g., in the closet, on a bed or sofa, in the corner)
with no memory of how they came to be there. Amnesia in individuals with
dissociative identity disorder is not limited to stressful or traumatic
events; these individuals often cannot recall everyday events as well.
Individuals with dissociative identity disorder vary in their awareness
and attitude toward their amnesias. It is common for these individuals
to minimize their amnestic symptoms. Some of their amnestic behaviors
may be apparent to others---as when these persons do not recall
something they were witnessed to have done or said, when they cannot
remember their own name, or when they do not recognize their spouse,
children, or close friends. Possession-form identities in dissociative
identity disorder typically manifest as behaviors that appear as if a
"spirit," supernatural being, or outside person has taken control, such
that the individual begins speaking or acting in a distinctly different
manner. For example, an individual's behavior may give the appearance
that her identity has been replaced by the "ghost" of a girl who
committed suicide in the same community years before, speaking and
acting as though she were still alive. Or an individual may be "taken
over" by a demon or deity, resulting in profound impairment,

and demanding that the individual or a relative be punished for a past
act, followed by more subtle periods of identity alteration. However,
the majority of possession states around the world are normal, usually
part of spiritual practice, and do not meet criteria for dissociative
identity disorder. The identities that arise during possession-form
dissociative identity disorder present recurrently, are unwanted and
involuntary, cause clinically significant distress or impairment
(Criterion C), and are not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural
or religious practice (Criterion D)32.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with dissociative
identity disorder typically present with comorbid depression, anxiety,
substance abuse, self-injury, non-epileptic seizures, or another common
symptom. They often conceal, or are not fully aware of, disruptions in
consciousness, amnesia, or other dissociative symptoms7, 16, 32. Many
individuals with dissociative identity disorder report dissociative
flashbacks during which they undergo a sensory reliving of a previous
event as though it were occurring in the present, often with a change of
identity, a partial or complete loss of contact with or disorientation
to current reality during the flashback, and a subsequent amnesia for
the content of the flashback. Individuals with the disorder typically
report multiple types of interpersonal maltreatment during childhood and
adulthood. Nonmaltreatment forms of overwhelming early life events, such
as multiple long, painful, early-life medical procedures, also may be
reported24, 27, 32. Self-mutilation and suicidal behavior are
frequent12, 24. On standardized measures, these individuals report
higher levels of hypnotizability and dissociativity compared with other
clinical groups and healthy control subjects4, 32. Some individuals
experience transient psychotic phenomena or episodes32. Several brain
regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of dissociative
identity disorder, including the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus,
parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala10, 32, 34.

Prevalence The 12-month prevalence of dissociative identity disorder
among adults in a small U.S. community study was 1.5%14. The prevalence
across genders in that study was 1.6% for males and 1.4% for females.

Development and Course Dissociative identity disorder is associated with
overwhelming experiences, traumatic events, and/or abuse occurring in
childhood15, 5, 30. The full disorder may first manifest at almost any
age (from earliest childhood to late life). Dissociation in children may
generate problems with memory, concentration, attachment, and traumatic
play30. Nevertheless, children usually do not present with identity
changes; instead they present primarily with overlap and interference
among mental states (Criterion A phenomena), with symptoms related to
discontinuities of experience23. Sudden changes in identity during
adolescence may appear to be just adolescent turmoil or the early stages
of another mental disorder15. Older individuals may present to treatment
with what appear to be late-life mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, paranoia, psychotic mood disorders, or even cognitive
disorders due to dissociative amnesia16. In some cases, disruptive
affects and memories may increasingly intrude into awareness with
advancing age. Psychological decompensation and overt changes in
identity may be triggered by 1) removal from the traumatizing situation
(e.g., through leaving home); 2) the individual's children reaching the
same age at which the individual was originally abused or traumatized;
3) later traumatic experiences, even seemingly inconsequential ones,
like a minor motor vehicle accident; or 4) the death of, or the onset of
a fatal illness in, their abuser(s).

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Interpersonal physical and
sexual abuse is associated with an increased risk of dissociative
identity disorder32. Prevalence of childhood abuse and neglect in the
United States, Canada, and Europe among those with the disorder is about
90%. Other forms of traumatizing experiences, including childhood
medical and surgical procedures, war, childhood prostitution, and
terrorism, have been reported. Course modifiers. Ongoing abuse,
later-life retraumatization, comorbidity with mental disorders, severe
medical illness, and delay in appropriate treatment are associated with
poorer prognosis.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Many features of dissociative identity
disorder can be influenced by the individual's cultural background.
Individuals with this disorder may present with prominent medically
unexplained neurological symptoms, such as non-epileptic seizures,
paralyses, or sensory loss, in cultural settings where such symptoms are
common29, 33. Similarly, in settings where normative possession is
common (e.g., rural areas in the developing world, among certain
religious groups in the United States and Europe), the fragmented
identities may take the form of possessing spirits, deities, demons,
animals, or mythical figures32. Acculturation or prolonged intercultural
contact may shape the characteristics of the other identities (e.g.,
identities in India may speak English exclusively and wear Western
clothes). Possession-form dissociative identity disorder can be
distinguished from culturally accepted possession states in that the
former is involuntary, distressing, uncontrollable, and often recurrent
or persistent; involves conflict between the individual and his or her
surrounding family, social, or work milieu; and is manifested at times
and in places that violate the norms of the culture or religion32.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Females with dissociative identity
disorder predominate in adult clinical settings but not in child
clinical settings15. Adult males with dissociative identity disorder may
deny their symptoms and trauma histories, and this can lead to elevated
rates of false negative diagnosis15. Females with dissociative identity
disorder present more frequently with acute dissociative states (e.g.,
flashbacks, amnesia, fugue, functional neurological \[conversion\]
symptoms, hallucinations, self-mutilation)25. Males commonly exhibit
more criminal or violent behavior than females; among males, common
triggers of acute dissociative states include combat, prison conditions,
and physical or sexual assaults18, 22.

Suicide Risk Over 70% of outpatients with dissociative identity disorder
have attempted suicide; multiple attempts are common, and other
self-injurious behavior is frequent12, 24. Assessment of suicide risk
may be complicated when there is

amnesia for past suicidal behavior or when the presenting identity does
not feel suicidal and is unaware that other dissociated identities do.

Functional Consequences of Dissociative Identity Disorder Impairment
varies widely, from apparently minimal (e.g., in highfunctioning
professionals) to profound. Regardless of level of disability,
individuals with dissociative identity disorder commonly minimize the
impact of their dissociative and posttraumatic symptoms. The symptoms of
higher-functioning individuals may impair their relational, marital,
family, and parenting functions more than their occupational and
professional life (although the latter also may be affected). With
appropriate treatment, many impaired individuals show marked improvement
in occupational and personal functioning. However, some remain highly
impaired in most activities of living. These individuals may only
respond to treatment very slowly, with gradual reduction in or improved
tolerance of their dissociative and posttraumatic symptoms. Long-term
supportive treatment may slowly increase these individuals' ability to
manage their symptoms and decrease use of more restrictive levels of
care19.

Differential Diagnosis Other specified dissociative disorder. The core
of dissociative identity disorder is the division of identity, with
recurrent disruption of conscious functioning and sense of self. This
central feature is shared with one form of other specified dissociative
disorder, which may be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder
by the presence of chronic or recurrent mixed dissociative symptoms that
do not meet Criterion A for dissociative identity disorder or are not
accompanied by recurrent amnesia. Major depressive disorder. Individuals
with dissociative identity disorder are often depressed, and their
symptoms may appear to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.
Rigorous assessment indicates that this depression in some cases does
not meet full criteria for major depressive disorder. Other specified
depressive disorder in individuals with dissociative identity disorder
often has an important feature: the depressed mood and cognitions
fluctuate because they are experienced in some identity states but not
others.

Bipolar disorders. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder are
often misdiagnosed with a bipolar disorder, most often bipolar II
disorder. The relatively rapid shifts in mood in individuals with this
disorder--- typically within minutes or hours, in contrast to the slower
mood changes typically seen in individuals with bipolar disorders---are
due to the rapid, subjective shifts in mood commonly reported across
dissociative states, sometimes accompanied by fluctuation in levels of
activation. Furthermore, in dissociative identity disorder, elevated or
depressed mood may be displayed in conjunction with overt identities, so
one or the other mood may predominate for a relatively long period of
time (often for days) or may shift within minutes. Posttraumatic stress
disorder. Some traumatized individuals have both posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and dissociative identity disorder. Accordingly, it is
crucial to distinguish between individuals with PTSD only and
individuals who have both PTSD and dissociative identity disorder. This
differential diagnosis requires that the clinician establish the
presence or absence of dissociative symptoms that are not characteristic
of acute stress disorder or PTSD. Some individuals with PTSD manifest
dissociative symptoms that also occur in dissociative identity
disorder: 1) amnesia for some aspects of trauma, 2) dissociative
flashbacks (i.e., reliving of the trauma, with reduced awareness of
one's current orientation), and 3) symptoms of intrusion and avoidance,
negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal that are
focused around the traumatic event. On the other hand, individuals with
dissociative identity disorder manifest dissociative symptoms that are
not a manifestation of PTSD: 1) amnesias for many everyday (i.e.,
nontraumatic) events, 2) dissociative flashbacks that may be followed by
amnesia for the content of the flashback, 3) disruptive intrusions
(unrelated to traumatic material) by dissociated identity states into
the individual's sense of self and agency, and 4) infrequent, full-blown
changes among different identity states. Psychotic disorders.
Dissociative identity disorder may be confused with schizophrenia or
other psychotic disorders. The personified, internally communicative
inner voices of dissociative identity disorder, especially of a child
(e.g., "I hear a little girl crying in a closet and an angry man yelling
at her"), may be mistaken for psychotic hallucinations8, 17.
Dissociative experiences of identity fragmentation or possession, and of
perceived loss

of control over thoughts, feelings, impulses, and acts, may be confused
with signs of formal thought disorder, such as thought insertion or
withdrawal15, 27. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may
also report visual, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, and somatic
hallucinations, which are usually related to posttraumatic and
dissociative factors, such as partial flashbacks. Individuals with
dissociative identity disorder experience these symptoms as caused by
alternate identities, do not have delusional explanations for the
phenomena, and often describe the symptoms in a personified way (e.g.,
"I feel like someone else wants to cry with my eyes")32. Persecutory and
derogatory internal voices in dissociative identity disorder associated
with depressive symptoms may be misdiagnosed as major depression with
psychotic features. Chaotic identity change and acute intrusions that
disrupt thought processes may be distinguished from brief psychotic
disorder by the predominance of dissociative symptoms and amnesia for
the episode, and diagnostic evaluation after cessation of the crisis can
help confirm the diagnosis. Substance/medication-induced disorders.
Symptoms associated with the physiological effects of a substance can be
distinguished from dissociative identity disorder if the substance in
question is judged to be etiologically related to the disturbance.
Personality disorders. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder
often present identities that appear to encapsulate a variety of severe
personality disorder features, suggesting a differential diagnosis of
personality disorder, especially of the borderline type. Importantly,
however, the individual's longitudinal variability in personality style
(due to inconsistency among identities) differs from the pervasive and
persistent dysfunction in affect management and interpersonal
relationships typical of those with personality disorders. Conversion
disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). This disorder may
be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the absence of
an identity disruption characterized by two or more distinct personality
states or an experience of possession. Dissociative amnesia in
conversion disorder is more limited and circumscribed (e.g., amnesia for
a non-epileptic seizure). Seizure disorders. Individuals with
dissociative identity disorder may present with seizurelike symptoms and
behaviors that resemble complex

partial seizures with temporal lobe foci. These include déjà vu, jamais
vu, depersonalization, derealization, out-of-body experiences, amnesia,
disruptions of consciousness, hallucinations, and other intrusion
phenomena of sensation, affect, and thought. Normal
electroencephalographic findings, including telemetry, differentiate
non-epileptic seizures from the seizurelike symptoms of dissociative
identity disorder. Also, individuals with dissociative identity disorder
obtain very high dissociation scores, whereas individuals with complex
partial seizures do not20, 26. Factitious disorder and malingering.
Individuals who feign dissociative identity disorder do not report the
subtle symptoms of intrusion characteristic of the disorder; instead
they tend to overreport wellpublicized symptoms of the disorder, such as
dissociative amnesia, while underreporting less-publicized comorbid
symptoms, such as depression2, 9. Individuals who feign dissociative
identity disorder tend to be relatively undisturbed by or may even seem
to enjoy "having" the disorder. In contrast, individuals with genuine
dissociative identity disorder tend to be ashamed of and overwhelmed by
their symptoms and to underreport their symptoms or deny their
condition9. Sequential observation, corroborating history, and intensive
psychometric and psychological assessment may be helpful in
assessment13, 2. Individuals who malinger dissociative identity disorder
usually create limited, stereotyped alternate identities, with feigned
amnesia, related to the events for which gain is sought. For example,
they may present an "allgood" identity and an "all-bad" identity in
hopes of gaining exculpation for a crime21, 31.

Comorbidity Many individuals with dissociative identity disorder present
with a comorbid disorder. If not assessed and treated specifically for
the dissociative disorder, these individuals often receive prolonged
treatment for the comorbid diagnosis only, with limited overall
treatment response and resultant demoralization, and disability3, 19.
Individuals with dissociative identity disorder usually exhibit a large
number of comorbid disorders11, 24. In particular, most develop PTSD11,
32, 34. Other disorders that are highly comorbid with dissociative
identity disorder include depressive disorders, trauma- and
stressor-related

disorders, personality disorders (especially avoidant and borderline
personality disorders), conversion disorder (functional neurological
symptom disorder), somatic symptom disorder, eating disorders,
substancerelated disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and sleep
disorders. Dissociative alterations in identity, memory, and
consciousness may affect the symptom presentation of comorbid disorders.

Dissociative Amnesia Diagnostic Criteria

300.12 (F44.0)

a.  An inability to recall important autobiographical information,
    usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is inconsistent
    with ordinary forgetting. Note: Dissociative amnesia most often
    consists of localized or selective amnesia for a specific event or
    events; or generalized amnesia for identity and life history.
b.  The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
    social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
c.  The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
    a substance (e.g., alcohol or other drug of abuse, a medication) or
    a neurological or other medical condition (e.g., partial complex
    seizures, transient global amnesia, sequelae of a closed head
    injury/traumatic brain injury, other neurological condition).
d.  The disturbance is not better explained by dissociative identity
    disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder,
    somatic symptom disorder, or major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
    Coding note: The code for dissociative amnesia without dissociative
    fugue is 300.12 (F44.0). The code for dissociative amnesia with
    dissociative fugue is 300.13 (F44.1). Specify if: 300.13 (F44.1)
    With dissociative fugue: Apparently purposeful travel or bewildered
    wandering that is associated with amnesia for identity or for other
    important autobiographical information.

Diagnostic Features The defining characteristic of dissociative amnesia
is an inability to recall important autobiographical information that 1)
should be successfully stored in memory and 2) ordinarily would be
readily remembered (Criterion A). Dissociative amnesia differs from the
permanent amnesias due to

neurobiological damage or toxicity that prevent memory storage or
retrieval in that it is always potentially reversible because the memory
has been successfully stored30. Localized amnesia, a failure to recall
events during a circumscribed period of time, is the most common form of
dissociative amnesia30. Localized amnesia may be broader than amnesia
for a single traumatic event (e.g., months or years associated with
child abuse or intense combat)9. In selective amnesia, the individual
can recall some, but not all, of the events during a circumscribed
period of time. Thus, the individual may remember part of a traumatic
event but not other parts. Some individuals report both localized and
selective amnesias. Generalized amnesia, a complete loss of memory for
one's life history, is rare. Individuals with generalized amnesia may
forget personal identity20. Some lose previous knowledge about the world
(i.e., semantic knowledge) and can no longer access well-learned skills
(i.e., procedural knowledge). Generalized amnesia has an acute onset;
the perplexity, disorientation, and purposeless wandering of individuals
with generalized amnesia usually bring them to the attention of the
police or psychiatric emergency services. Generalized amnesia may be
more common among combat veterans, sexual assault victims, and
individuals experiencing extreme emotional stress or conflict13, 27, 34.
Individuals with dissociative amnesia are frequently unaware (or only
partially aware) of their memory problems. Many, especially those with
localized amnesia, minimize the importance of their memory loss and may
become uncomfortable when prompted to address it21. In systematized
amnesia, the individual loses memory for a specific category of
information (e.g., all memories relating to one's family, a particular
person, or childhood sexual abuse). In continuous amnesia, an individual
forgets each new event as it occurs.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Many individuals with
dissociative amnesia are chronically impaired in their ability to form
and sustain satisfactory relationships. Histories of trauma, child
abuse, and victimization are common. Some individuals with dissociative
amnesia report dissociative flashbacks (i.e., behavioral reexperiencing
of traumatic events)19. Many have a history of self-

mutilation, suicide attempts, and other high-risk behaviors. Depressive
and functional neurological symptoms are common, as are
depersonalization, auto-hypnotic symptoms, and high hypnotizability.
Sexual dysfunctions are common. Mild traumatic brain injury may precede
dissociative amnesia16.

Prevalence The 12-month prevalence for dissociative amnesia among adults
in a small U.S. community study was 1.8% (1.0% for males; 2.6% for
females)12.

Development and Course Onset of generalized amnesia is usually sudden.
Less is known about the onset of localized and selective amnesias
because these amnesias are seldom evident, even to the individual.
Although overwhelming or intolerable events typically precede localized
amnesia, its onset may be delayed for hours, days, or longer19.
Individuals may report multiple episodes of dissociative amnesia. A
single episode may predispose to future episodes. In between episodes of
amnesia, the individual may or may not appear to be acutely symptomatic.
The duration of the forgotten events can range from minutes to decades.
Some episodes of dissociative amnesia resolve rapidly (e.g., when the
person is removed from combat or some other stressful situation),
whereas other episodes persist for long periods of time. Some
individuals may gradually recall the dissociated memories years later.
Dissociative capacities may decline with age, but not always19. As the
amnesia remits, there may be considerable distress, suicidal behavior,
and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Dissociative
amnesia has been observed in young children, adolescents, and adults24.
Children may be the most difficult to evaluate because they often have
difficulty understanding questions about amnesia, and interviewers may
find it difficult to formulate child-friendly questions about memory and
amnesia. Observations of apparent dissociative amnesia are often
difficult to differentiate from inattention, absorption, anxiety,
oppositional behavior, and learning disorders. Reports from several
different sources (e.g., teacher, therapist, case worker) may be needed
to diagnose amnesia in children24.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Single or repeated traumatic
experiences (e.g., war, childhood maltreatment, natural disaster,
internment in concentration camps, genocide) are common antecedents7, 8.
Dissociative amnesia is more likely to occur with 1) a greater number of
adverse childhood experiences, particularly physical and/or sexual
abuse9, 2) interpersonal violence19, 20, 21, and 3) increased severity,
frequency, and violence of the trauma9, 19, 20, 21. Genetic and
physiological. There are no genetic studies of dissociative amnesia.
Studies of dissociation report significant genetic and environmental
factors in both clinical and nonclinical samples1, 11, 18, 23, 28.
Course modifiers. Removal from the traumatic circumstances underlying
the dissociative amnesia (e.g., combat) may bring about a rapid return
of memory32. The memory loss of individuals with dissociative fugue may
be particularly refractory. Onset of PTSD symptoms may decrease
localized, selective, or systematized amnesia. The returning memory,
however, may be experienced as flashbacks that alternate with amnesia
for the content of the flashbacks33.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues In Asia, the Middle East, and Latin
America, non-epileptic seizures and other functional neurological
symptoms may accompany dissociative amnesia. In cultures with highly
restrictive social traditions, the precipitants of dissociative amnesia
often do not involve frank trauma. Instead, the amnesia is preceded by
severe psychological stresses or conflicts (e.g., marital conflict,
other family disturbances, attachment problems, conflicts due to
restriction or oppression).

Suicide Risk Suicidal and other self-destructive behaviors are common in
individuals with dissociative amnesia. Suicidal behavior may be a
particular risk when the amnesia remits suddenly and overwhelms the
individual with intolerable memories5, 10, 31.

Functional Consequences of Dissociative Amnesia

The impairment of individuals with localized, selective, or systematized
dissociative amnesia ranges from limited to severe. Individuals with
chronic generalized dissociative amnesia usually have impairment in all
aspects of functioning. Even when these individuals "re-learn" aspects
of their life history, autobiographical memory remains very impaired.
Most become vocationally and interpersonally disabled14, 20.

Differential Diagnosis Dissociative identity disorder. Individuals with
dissociative amnesia may report depersonalization and auto-hypnotic
symptoms. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder report
pervasive discontinuities in sense of self and agency, accompanied by
many other dissociative symptoms. The amnesias of individuals with
localized, selective, and/or systematized dissociative amnesias are
relatively stable2, 25. Amnesias in dissociative identity disorder
include amnesia for everyday events, finding of unexplained possessions,
sudden fluctuations in skills and knowledge, major gaps in recall of
life history, and brief amnesic gaps in interpersonal interactions2, 25.
Posttraumatic stress disorder. Some individuals with PTSD cannot recall
part or all of a specific traumatic event (e.g., a rape victim with
depersonalization and/or derealization symptoms who cannot recall most
events for the entire day of the rape). When that amnesia extends beyond
the immediate time of the trauma, a comorbid diagnosis of dissociative
amnesia is warranted17. Neurocognitive disorders. In neurocognitive
disorders, memory loss for personal information is usually embedded in
cognitive, linguistic, affective, attentional, and behavioral
disturbances. In dissociative amnesia, memory deficits are primarily for
autobiographical information; intellectual and cognitive abilities are
preserved19, 20, 21. Substance-related disorders. In the context of
repeated intoxication with alcohol or other substances/medications,
there may be episodes of "black outs" or periods for which the
individual has no memory. To aid in distinguishing these episodes from
dissociative amnesia, a longitudinal history noting that the amnestic
episodes occur only in the context of intoxication and do not occur in
other situations would help identify the

source as substance-induced; however the distinction may be difficult
when the individual with dissociative amnesia may also misuse alcohol or
other substances in the context of stressful situations that may also
exacerbate dissociative symptoms. Some individuals with comorbid
dissociative amnesia and substance use disorders will attribute their
memory problems solely to the substance use21. Prolonged use of alcohol
or other substances may result in a substance-induced neurocognitive
disorder that may be associated with impaired cognitive function, but in
this context the protracted history of substance use and the persistent
deficits associated with the neurocognitive disorder would serve to
distinguish it from dissociative amnesia, where there is typically no
evidence of persistent impairment in intellectual functioning.
Posttraumatic amnesia due to brain injury. Amnesia may occur in the
context of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) when there has been an impact
to the head or other mechanisms of rapid movement or displacement of the
brain within the skull TBI. Other characteristics of TBI include loss of
consciousness, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases,
neurological signs (e.g., abnormalities on neuroimaging, a new onset of
seizures or a marked worsening of a preexisting seizure disorder, visual
field cuts, anosmia). A neurocognitive disorder attributable to TBI must
present either immediately after brain injury occurs or immediately
after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury, and
persist past the acute post-injury period. The cognitive presentation of
a neurocognitive disorder following TBI is variable and includes
difficulties in the domains of complex attention, executive function,
learning and memory as well as slowed speed of information processing
and disturbances in social cognition. These additional features help
distinguish it from dissociative amnesia. Seizure disorders. Individuals
with seizure disorders may exhibit complex behavior during seizures or
post-ictally with subsequent amnesia. Some individuals with a seizure
disorder engage in nonpurposive wandering that is limited to the period
of seizure activity. Conversely, behavior during a dissociative fugue is
usually purposeful, complex, and goal-directed and may last for days,
weeks, or longer19. Occasionally, individuals with a seizure disorder
will report that earlier autobiographical memories have been "wiped out"
as the seizure disorder progresses. Such

memory loss is not associated with traumatic circumstances and appears
to occur randomly. Serial electroencephalograms usually show
abnormalities. Telemetric electroencephalographic monitoring usually
shows an association between the episodes of amnesia and seizure
activity. Dissociative and epileptic amnesias may coexist. Catatonic
stupor. Mutism in catatonic stupor may suggest dissociative amnesia, but
failure of recall is absent. Other catatonic symptoms (e.g., rigidity,
posturing, negativism) are usually present. Factitious disorder and
malingering. There is no test, battery of tests, or set of procedures
that invariably distinguishes dissociative amnesia from feigned
amnesia3, 4, 29. Individuals with factitious disorder or malingering
have been noted to continue their deception even during hypnotic or
barbiturate-facilitated interviews26. Feigned amnesia is more common in
individuals with 1) acute, florid dissociative amnesia; 2) financial,
sexual, or legal problems; or 3) a wish to escape stressful
circumstances. True amnesia can be associated with those same
circumstances. Many individuals who malinger confess spontaneously or
when confronted15, 22, 29. Normal and age-related changes in memory.
Memory decrements in major and mild neurocognitive disorders differ from
those of dissociative amnesia, which are usually associated with
stressful events and are more specific, extensive, and/or complex.

Comorbidity As dissociative amnesia begins to remit, a wide variety of
affective phenomena may surface: dysphoria, grief, rage, shame, guilt,
psychological conflict and turmoil, and suicidal and homicidal ideation,
impulses, and acts. These individuals may have symptoms that then meet
diagnostic criteria for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia);
major depressive disorder; other specified or unspecified depressive
disorder; adjustment disorder, with depressed mood; or adjustment
disorder, with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct. Many
individuals with dissociative amnesia develop PTSD at some point during
their life, especially when the traumatic antecedents of their amnesia
are brought into conscious awareness.

Many individuals with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet
diagnostic criteria for a comorbid somatic symptom or related disorder
(and vice versa), including somatic symptom disorder and conversion
disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). Many individuals
with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria
for a personality disorder, especially dependent, avoidant, and
borderline5.

Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

300.6 (F48.1)

a.  The presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of
    depersonalization, derealization, or both:

<!-- -->

1.  Depersonalization: Experiences of unreality, detachment, or being an
    outside observer with respect to one's thoughts, feelings,
    sensations, body, or actions (e.g., perceptual alterations,
    distorted sense of time, unreal or absent self, emotional and/or
    physical numbing).
2.  Derealization: Experiences of unreality or detachment with respect
    to surroundings (e.g., individuals or objects are experienced as
    unreal, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, or visually distorted).

<!-- -->

b.  During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality
    testing remains intact.
c.  The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
    social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
d.  The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of
    a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, medication) or another medical
    condition (e.g., seizures).
e.  The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder,
    such as schizophrenia, panic disorder, major depressive disorder,
    acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or another
    dissociative disorder.

Diagnostic Features The essential features of
depersonalization/derealization disorder are persistent or recurrent
episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both17. Episodes of
depersonalization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or
detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, one's whole self or from aspects
of the self (Criterion A1). The individual may feel detached from his or
her entire being (e.g., "I am no one," "I have no self"). He or she may
also feel subjectively detached from aspects of the self, including
feelings (e.g., hypoemotionality: "I know I have feelings but I don't
feel

them"), thoughts (e.g., "My thoughts don't feel like my own," "head
filled with cotton"), whole body or body parts, or sensations (e.g.,
touch, proprioception, hunger, thirst, libido). There may also be a
diminished sense of agency (e.g., feeling robotic, like an automaton;
lacking control of one's speech or movements). The depersonalization
experience can sometimes be one of a split self, with one part observing
and one participating, known as an "out-of-body experience" in its most
extreme form. The unitary symptom of "depersonalization" consists of
several symptom factors9, 15: anomalous body experiences (i.e.,
unreality of the self and perceptual alterations); emotional or physical
numbing; and temporal distortions with anomalous subjective recall.
Episodes of derealization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or
detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals,
inanimate objects, or all surroundings (Criterion A2). The individual
may feel as if he or she were in a fog, dream, or bubble, or as if there
were a veil or a glass wall between the individual and world around.
Surroundings may be experienced as artificial, colorless, or lifeless.
Derealization is commonly accompanied by subjective visual distortions,
such as blurriness, heightened acuity, widened or narrowed visual field,
two-dimensionality or flatness, exaggerated three-dimensionality, or
altered distance or size of objects (i.e., macropsia or micropsia).
Auditory distortions can also occur, whereby voices or sounds are muted
or heightened. In addition, Criterion C requires the presence of
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning, and Criteria D and E describe
exclusionary diagnoses.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with
depersonalization/derealization disorder may have difficulty describing
their symptoms and may think they are "crazy" or "going crazy" 2, 13.
Another common experience is the fear of irreversible brain damage16. A
commonly associated symptom is a subjectively altered sense of time
(i.e., too fast or too slow), as well as a subjective difficulty in
vividly recalling past memories and owning them as personal and
emotional12, 13. Vague somatic symptoms, such as head fullness,
tingling, or lightheadedness, are not uncommon. Individuals may suffer
extreme rumination or obsessional preoccupation (e.g., constantly
obsessing about

whether they really exist, or checking their perceptions to determine
whether they appear real). Varying degrees of anxiety and depression are
also common associated features. Individuals with the disorder have been
found to have physiological hyporeactivity to emotional stimuli8. Neural
substrates of interest include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical
axis, inferior parietal lobule, and prefrontal cortical-limbic
circuits5, 7, 1014.

Prevalence Transient depersonalization/derealization symptoms lasting
hours to days are common in the general population. The 12-month
prevalence of depersonalization/derealization disorder is thought to be
markedly less than for transient symptoms, although precise estimates
for the disorder are unavailable1. In general, approximately one-half of
all adults have experienced at least one lifetime episode of
depersonalization/derealization. However, symptomatology that meets full
criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder is markedly less
common than transient symptoms. Lifetime prevalence in U.S. and non-U.S.
countries is approximately 2% (range of 0.8% to 2.8%)3. The gender ratio
for the disorder is 1:1.

Development and Course The mean age at onset of
depersonalization/derealization disorder is 16 years, although the
disorder can start in early or middle childhood; a minority cannot
recall ever not having had the symptoms. Less than 20% of individuals
experience onset after age 20 years and only 5% after age 25 years.
Onset in the fourth decade of life or later is highly unusual. Onset can
range from extremely sudden to gradual. Duration of
depersonalization/derealization disorder episodes can vary greatly, from
brief (hours or days) to prolonged (weeks, months, or years). Given the
rarity of disorder onset after age 40 years, in such cases the
individual should be examined more closely for underlying medical
conditions (e.g., brain lesions, seizure disorders, sleep apnea). The
course of the disorder is often persistent. About one-third of cases
involve discrete episodes; another third, continuous symptoms from the
start; and still another third, an initially episodic course that
eventually becomes continuous.

While in some individuals the intensity of symptoms can wax and wane
considerably, others report an unwavering level of intensity that in
extreme cases can be constantly present for years or decades. Internal
and external factors that affect symptom intensity vary between
individuals, yet some typical patterns are reported. Exacerbations can
be triggered by stress, worsening mood or anxiety symptoms, novel or
overstimulating settings, and physical factors such as lighting or lack
of sleep.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Individuals with
depersonalization/derealization disorder are characterized by
harm-avoidant temperament, immature defenses, and both disconnection and
overconnection schemata12. Immature defenses such as
idealization/devaluation, projection and acting out result in denial of
reality and poor adaptation. Cognitive disconnection schemata reflect
defectiveness and emotional inhibition and subsume themes of abuse,
neglect, and deprivation. Overconnection schemata involve impaired
autonomy with themes of dependency, vulnerability, and incompetence.
Environmental. There is a clear association between the disorder and
childhood interpersonal traumas in a substantial portion of
individuals17, although this association is not as prevalent or as
extreme in the nature of the traumas as in other dissociative disorders,
such as dissociative identity disorder. In particular, emotional abuse
and emotional neglect have been most strongly and consistently
associated with the disorder11, 14. Other stressors can include physical
abuse; witnessing domestic violence; growing up with a seriously
impaired, mentally ill parent; or unexpected death or suicide of a
family member or close friend. Sexual abuse is a much less common
antecedent but can be encountered. The most common proximal precipitants
of the disorder are severe stress (interpersonal, financial,
occupational), depression, anxiety (particularly panic attacks), and
illicit drug use13, 16. Symptoms may be specifically induced by
substances such as tetrahydrocannabinol, hallucinogens, ketamine, MDMA
(3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; "ecstasy") and salvia6, 16.
Marijuana use may precipitate new-onset panic attacks and
depersonalization/derealization symptoms simultaneously.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Volitionally induced experiences of depersonalization/derealization can
be a part of meditative practices that are prevalent in many religions
and cultures and should not be diagnosed as a disorder. However, there
are individuals who initially induce these states intentionally but over
time lose control over them and may develop a fear and aversion for
related practices.

Functional Consequences Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

of

Symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder are highly
distressing and are associated with major morbidity2, 13. The
affectively flattened and robotic demeanor that these individuals often
demonstrate may appear incongruent with the extreme emotional pain
reported by those with the disorder. Impairment is often experienced in
both interpersonal and occupational spheres, largely due to the
hypoemotionality with others, subjective difficulty in focusing and
retaining information, and a general sense of disconnectedness from
life.

Differential Diagnosis Illness anxiety disorder. Although individuals
with depersonalization/derealization disorder can present with vague
somatic complaints as well as fears of permanent brain damage, the
diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized
by the presence of a constellation of typical
depersonalization/derealization symptoms and the absence of other
manifestations of illness anxiety disorder. Major depressive disorder.
Feelings of numbness, deadness, apathy, and being in a dream are not
uncommon in major depressive episodes. However, in
depersonalization/derealization disorder, such symptoms are associated
with further symptoms of the disorder. If the
depersonalization/derealization clearly precedes the onset of a major
depressive episode or clearly continues after its resolution, the
diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder applies.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some individuals with
depersonalization/derealization disorder can become obsessively
preoccupied with their subjective experience or develop rituals checking
on the status of their symptoms. However, other symptoms of obsessive-

compulsive disorder unrelated to depersonalization/derealization are not
present. Other dissociative disorders. In order to diagnose
depersonalization/derealization disorder, the symptoms should not occur
in the context of another dissociative disorder, such as dissociative
identity disorder. Differentiation from dissociative amnesia and
conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) is
simpler, as the symptoms of these disorders do not overlap with those of
depersonalization/derealization disorder17. Anxiety disorders.
Depersonalization/derealization is one of the symptoms of panic attacks,
increasingly common as panic attack severity increases. Therefore,
depersonalization/derealization disorder should not be diagnosed when
the symptoms occur only during panic attacks that are part of panic
disorder, social anxiety disorder, or specific phobia. In addition, it
is not uncommon for depersonalization/derealization symptoms to first
begin in the context of new-onset panic attacks or as panic disorder
progresses and worsens. In such presentations, the diagnosis of
depersonalization/derealization disorder can be made if 1) the
depersonalization/derealization component of the presentation is very
prominent from the start, clearly exceeding in duration and intensity
the occurrence of actual panic attacks; or 2) the
depersonalization/derealization continues after panic disorder has
remitted or has been successfully treated. Psychotic disorders. The
presence of intact reality testing specifically regarding the
depersonalization/derealization symptoms is essential to differentiating
depersonalization/derealization disorder from psychotic disorders.
Rarely, positive-symptom schizophrenia can pose a diagnostic challenge
when nihilistic delusions are present. For example, an individual may
complain that he or she is dead or the world is not real; this could be
either a subjective experience that the individual knows is not true or
a delusional conviction. Substance/medication-induced disorders.
Depersonalization/derealization associated with the physiological
effects of substances during acute intoxication or withdrawal is not
diagnosed as depersonalization/derealization disorder. The most common
precipitating substances are the illicit drugs marijuana, hallucinogens,
ketamine, ecstasy, and salvia16. In about 15% of all cases of

depersonalization/derealization disorder, the symptoms are precipitated
by ingestion of such substances. If the symptoms persist for some time
in the absence of any further substance or medication use, the diagnosis
of depersonalization/derealization disorder applies. This diagnosis is
usually easy to establish since the vast majority of individuals with
this presentation become highly phobic and aversive to the triggering
substance and do not use it again16. Mental disorders due to another
medical condition. Features such as onset after age 40 years or the
presence of atypical symptoms and course in any individual suggest the
possibility of an underlying medical condition. In such cases, it is
essential to conduct a thorough medical and neurological evaluation,
which may include standard laboratory studies, viral titers, an
electroencephalogram, vestibular testing, visual testing, sleep studies,
and/or brain imaging. When the suspicion of an underlying seizure
disorder proves difficult to confirm, an ambulatory electroencephalogram
may be indicated; although temporal lobe epilepsy is most commonly
implicated, parietal and frontal lobe epilepsy may also be associated4.

Comorbidity In a convenience sample of adults recruited for a number of
depersonalization research studies, lifetime comorbidities were high for
unipolar depressive disorder and for any anxiety disorder, with a
significant proportion of the sample having both disorders. Comorbidity
with posttraumatic stress disorder was low. The three most commonly
cooccurring personality disorders were avoidant, borderline, and
obsessivecompulsive13.

Other Specified Dissociative Disorder 300.15 (F44.89) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific dissociative
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified dissociative
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "dissociative trance").
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following: 1. Chronic and recurrent
syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms: This category includes
identity disturbance associated with less-than-marked discontinuities in
sense of self and agency, or alterations of identity or episodes of
possession in an individual who reports no dissociative amnesia. 2.
Identity disturbance due to prolonged and intense coercive persuasion:
Individuals who have been subjected to intense coercive persuasion
(e.g., brainwashing, thought reform, indoctrination while captive,
torture, long-term political imprisonment, recruitment by

sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with prolonged
changes in, or conscious questioning of, their identity. 3. Acute
dissociative reactions to stressful events: This category is for acute,
transient conditions that typically last less than 1 month, and
sometimes only a few hours or days. These conditions are characterized
by constriction of consciousness; depersonalization; derealization;
perceptual disturbances (e.g., time slowing, macropsia); micro-amnesias;
transient stupor; and/or alterations in sensory-motor functioning (e.g.,
analgesia, paralysis). 4. Dissociative trance: This condition is
characterized by an acute narrowing or complete loss of awareness of
immediate surroundings that manifests as profound unresponsiveness or
insensitivity to environmental stimuli. The unresponsiveness may be
accompanied by minor stereotyped behaviors (e.g., finger movements) of
which the individual is unaware and/or that he or she cannot control, as
well as transient paralysis or loss of consciousness. The dissociative
trance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or
religious practice.

Unspecified Dissociative Disorder 300.15 (F44.9) This category applies
to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissociative
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders
in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a specific dissociative disorder, and includes presentations for
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings).

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders Somatic symptom disorder and other
disorders with prominent somatic symptoms constitute a new category in
DSM-5 called somatic symptom and related disorders. This chapter
includes the diagnoses of somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety
disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom
disorder), psychological factors affecting other medical conditions,
factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and related
disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. All of
the disorders in this chapter share a common feature: the prominence of
somatic symptoms associated with significant distress and impairment.
Individuals with disorders with prominent somatic symptoms are commonly
encountered in primary care and other medical settings but are less
commonly encountered in psychiatric and other mental health settings.
These reconceptualized diagnoses, based on a reorganization of DSM-IV
somatoform disorder diagnoses, are more useful for primary care and
other medical (nonpsychiatric) clinicians. The major diagnosis in this
diagnostic class, somatic symptom disorder, emphasizes diagnosis made on
the basis of positive symptoms and signs (distressing somatic symptoms
plus abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in response to these
symptoms) rather than the absence of a medical explanation for somatic
symptoms. A distinctive characteristic of many individuals with somatic
symptom disorder is not the somatic symptoms per se, but instead the way
they present and interpret them. Incorporating affective, cognitive, and
behavioral components into the criteria for somatic symptom disorder
provides a more comprehensive and accurate reflection of the true
clinical picture than can be achieved by assessing the somatic
complaints alone. The principles behind the changes in the somatic
symptom and related diagnoses from DSM-IV are crucial in understanding
the DSM-5 diagnoses. The DSM-IV term somatoform disorders was confusing
and is replaced by

somatic symptom and related disorders. In DSM-IV there was a great deal
of overlap across the somatoform disorders and a lack of clarity about
the boundaries of diagnoses. Although individuals with these disorders
primarily present in medical rather than mental health settings,
nonpsychiatric physicians found the DSM-IV somatoform diagnoses
difficult to understand and use. The current DSM-5 classification
recognizes this overlap by reducing the total number of disorders as
well as their subcategories. The previous criteria overemphasized the
centrality of medically unexplained symptoms. Such symptoms are present
to various degrees, particularly in conversion disorder, but somatic
symptom disorders can also accompany diagnosed medical disorders. The
reliability of determining that a somatic symptom is medically
unexplained is limited, and grounding a diagnosis on the absence of an
explanation is problematic and reinforces mind-body dualism. It is not
appropriate to give an individual a mental disorder diagnosis solely
because a medical cause cannot be demonstrated. Furthermore, the
presence of a medical diagnosis does not exclude the possibility of a
comorbid mental disorder, including a somatic symptom and related
disorder. Perhaps because of the predominant focus on lack of medical
explanation, individuals regarded these diagnoses as pejorative and
demeaning, implying that their physical symptoms were not "real." The
new classification defines the major diagnosis, somatic symptom
disorder, on the basis of positive symptoms (distressing somatic
symptoms plus abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in response to
these symptoms). However, medically unexplained symptoms remain a key
feature in conversion disorder and pseudocyesis (other specified somatic
symptom and related disorder) because it is possible to demonstrate
definitively in such disorders that the symptoms are not consistent with
medical pathophysiology. It is important to note that some other mental
disorders may initially manifest with primarily somatic symptoms (e.g.,
major depressive disorder, panic disorder). Such diagnoses may account
for the somatic symptoms, or they may occur alongside one of the somatic
symptom and related disorders in this chapter. There is also
considerable medical comorbidity among somatizing individuals. Although
somatic symptoms are frequently associated with psychological distress
and psychopathology, some somatic symptom and related disorders can
arise spontaneously, and their causes can

remain obscure. Anxiety disorders and depressive disorders may accompany
somatic symptom and related disorders. The somatic component adds
severity and complexity to depressive and anxiety disorders and results
in higher severity, functional impairment, and even refractoriness to
traditional treatments. In rare instances, the degree of preoccupation
may be so severe as to warrant consideration of a delusional disorder
diagnosis. A number of factors may contribute to somatic symptom and
related disorders. These include genetic and biological vulnerability
(e.g., increased sensitivity to pain), early traumatic experiences
(e.g., violence, abuse, deprivation), and learning (e.g., attention
obtained from illness, lack of reinforcement of nonsomatic expressions
of distress), as well as cultural/social norms that devalue and
stigmatize psychological suffering as compared with physical suffering.
Differences in medical care across cultures affect the presentation,
recognition, and management of these somatic presentations. Variations
in symptom presentation are likely the result of the interaction of
multiple factors within cultural contexts that affect how individuals
identify and classify bodily sensations, perceive illness, and seek
medical attention for them. Thus, somatic presentations can be viewed as
expressions of personal suffering inserted in a cultural and social
context. All of these disorders are characterized by the prominent focus
on somatic concerns and their initial presentation mainly in medical
rather than mental health care settings. Somatic symptom disorder offers
a more clinically useful method of characterizing individuals who may
have been considered in the past for a diagnosis of somatization
disorder. Furthermore, approximately 75% of individuals previously
diagnosed with hypochondriasis are subsumed under the diagnosis of
somatic symptom disorder. However, about 25% of individuals with
hypochondriasis have high health anxiety in the absence of somatic
symptoms, and many such individuals' symptoms would not qualify for an
anxiety disorder diagnosis. The DSM-5 diagnosis of illness anxiety
disorder is for this latter group of individuals. Illness anxiety
disorder can be considered either in this diagnostic section or as an
anxiety disorder. Because of the strong focus on somatic concerns, and
because illness anxiety disorder is most often encountered in medical
settings, for utility it is listed with the somatic symptom and related
disorders. In conversion disorder, the essential feature

is neurological symptoms that are found, after appropriate neurological
assessment, to be incompatible with neurological pathophysiology.
Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is also
included in this chapter. Its essential feature is the presence of one
or more clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors that
adversely affect a medical condition by increasing the risk for
suffering, death, or disability. Like the other somatic symptom and
related disorders, factitious disorder embodies persistent problems
related to illness perception and identity. In the great majority of
reported cases of factitious disorder, both imposed on self and imposed
on another, individuals present with somatic symptoms and medical
disease conviction. Consequently, DSM-5 factitious disorder is included
among the somatic symptom and related disorders. Other specified somatic
symptom and related disorder and unspecified somatic symptom and related
disorder include conditions for which some, but not all, of the criteria
for somatic symptom disorder or illness anxiety disorder are met, as
well as pseudocyesis.

Somatic Symptom Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

300.82 (F45.1)

a.  One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in
    significant disruption of daily life.
b.  Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic
    symptoms or associated health concerns as manifested by at least one
    of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of
    one's symptoms.
2.  Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms.
3.  Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health
    concerns.

<!-- -->

c.  Although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present,
    the state of being symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6
    months). Specify if:

With predominant pain (previously pain disorder): This specifier is for
individuals whose somatic symptoms predominantly involve pain. Specify
if: Persistent: A persistent course is characterized by severe symptoms,
marked impairment, and long duration (more than 6 months). Specify
current severity: Mild: Only one of the symptoms specified in Criterion
B is fulfilled. Moderate: Two or more of the symptoms specified in
Criterion B are fulfilled. Severe: Two or more of the symptoms specified
in Criterion B are fulfilled, plus there are multiple somatic complaints
(or one very severe somatic symptom).

Diagnostic Features Individuals with somatic symptom disorder typically
have multiple, current, somatic symptoms that are distressing or result
in significant disruption of daily life (Criterion A), although
sometimes only one severe symptom, most commonly pain, is present.
Symptoms may be specific (e.g., localized pain) or relatively
nonspecific (e.g., fatigue). The symptoms sometimes represent normal
bodily sensations or discomfort that does not generally signify serious
disease. Somatic symptoms without an evident medical explanation are not
sufficient to make this diagnosis. The individual's suffering is
authentic, whether or not it is medically explained. The symptoms may or
may not be associated with another medical condition. The diagnoses of
somatic symptom disorder and a concurrent medical illness are not
mutually exclusive, and these frequently occur together. For example, an
individual may become seriously disabled by symptoms of somatic symptom
disorder after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction even if the
myocardial infarction itself did not result in any disability. If
another medical condition or high risk for developing one is present
(e.g., strong family history), the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
associated with this condition are excessive (Criterion B). Individuals
with somatic symptom disorder tend to have very high levels of worry
about illness (Criterion B). They appraise their bodily symptoms as
unduly threatening, harmful, or troublesome and often think the worst

about their health. Even when there is evidence to the contrary, some
patients still fear the medical seriousness of their symptoms. In severe
somatic symptom disorder, health concerns may assume a central role in
the individual's life, becoming a feature of his or her identity and
dominating interpersonal relationships. Individuals typically experience
distress that is principally focused on somatic symptoms and their
significance. When asked directly about their distress, some individuals
describe it in relation to other aspects of their lives, while others
deny any source of distress other than the somatic symptoms.
Health-related quality of life is often impaired, both physically and
mentally. In severe somatic symptom disorder, the impairment is marked,
and when persistent, the disorder can lead to invalidism. There is often
a high level of medical care utilization, which rarely alleviates the
individual's concerns. Consequently, the patient may seek care from
multiple doctors for the same symptoms. These individuals often seem
unresponsive to medical interventions, and new interventions may only
exacerbate the presenting symptoms. Some individuals with the disorder
seem unusually sensitive to medication side effects. Some feel that
their medical assessment and treatment have been inadequate.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Cognitive features include
attention focused on somatic symptoms, attribution of normal bodily
sensations to physical illness (possibly with catastrophic
interpretations), worry about illness, and fear that any physical
activity may damage the body. The relevant associated behavioral
features may include repeated bodily checking for abnormalities,
repeated seeking of medical help and reassurance, and avoidance of
physical activity17. These behavioral features are most pronounced in
severe, persistent somatic symptom disorder. These features are usually
associated with frequent requests for medical help for different somatic
symptoms. This may lead to medical consultations in which individuals
are so focused on their concerns about somatic symptom(s) that they
cannot be redirected to other matters. Any reassurance by the doctor
that the symptoms are not indicative of serious physical illness tends
to be short-lived and/or is experienced by the individuals as the doctor
not taking their symptoms with due seriousness. As the focus on somatic
symptoms is a primary feature of the disorder, individuals with somatic
symptom disorder typically present to general

medical health services rather than mental health services. The
suggestion of referral to a mental health specialist may be met with
surprise or even frank refusal by individuals with somatic symptom
disorder. Since somatic symptom disorder is associated with depressive
disorders, there is an increased suicide risk. It is not known whether
somatic symptom disorder is associated with suicide risk independent of
its association with depressive disorders.

Prevalence The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is not known.
However, the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is expected to be
higher than that of the more restrictive DSM-IV somatization disorder
(\<1%) but lower than that of undifferentiated somatoform disorder
(approximately 19%)2, 7. The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder in
the general adult population may be around 5%--7%14. Females tend to
report more somatic symptoms than do males, and the prevalence of
somatic symptom disorder is consequently likely to be higher in
females2, 6.

Development and Course In older individuals, somatic symptoms and
concurrent medical illnesses are common, and a focus on Criterion B is
crucial for making the diagnosis. Somatic symptom disorder may be
underdiagnosed in older adults either because certain somatic symptoms
(e.g., pain, fatigue) are considered part of normal aging or because
illness worry is considered "understandable" in older adults who have
more general medical illnesses and medications than do younger people.
Concurrent depressive disorder is common in older people who present
with numerous somatic symptoms19. In children, the most common symptoms
are recurrent abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, and nausea5, 18. A
single prominent symptom is more common in children than in adults.
While young children may have somatic complaints, they rarely worry
about "illness" per se prior to adolescence. The parents' response to
the symptom is important, as this may determine the level of associated
distress. It is the parent who may determine the interpretation of
symptoms and the associated time off school and medical help seeking.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. The personality trait of
negative affectivity (neuroticism) has been identified as an independent
correlate/risk factor of a high number of somatic symptoms3. Comorbid
anxiety or depression is common and may exacerbate symptoms and
impairment. Environmental. Somatic symptom disorder is more frequent in
individuals with few years of education and low socioeconomic status,
and in those who have recently experienced stressful life events2, 3, 4.
Course modifiers. Persistent somatic symptoms are associated with
demographic features (female sex, older age, fewer years of education,
lower socioeconomic status, unemployment), a reported history of sexual
abuse or other childhood adversity, concurrent chronic physical illness
or psychiatric disorder (depression, anxiety, persistent depressive
disorder \[dysthymia\], panic), social stress, and reinforcing social
factors such as illness benefits4. Cognitive factors that affect
clinical course include sensitization to pain, heightened attention to
bodily sensations, and attribution of bodily symptoms to a possible
medical illness rather than recognizing them as a normal phenomenon or
psychological stress4, 11, 13.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Somatic symptoms are prominent in
various "culture-bound syndromes." High numbers of somatic symptoms are
found in population-based and primary care studies around the world,
with a similar pattern of the most commonly reported somatic symptoms,
impairment, and treatment seeking6, 7, 16. The relationship between
number of somatic symptoms and illness worry is similar in different
cultures, and marked illness worry is associated with impairment and
greater treatment seeking across cultures9, 12. The relationship between
numerous somatic symptoms and depression appears to be very similar
around the world and between different cultures within one country.
Despite these similarities, there are differences in somatic symptoms
among cultures and ethnic groups. The description of somatic symptoms
varies with linguistic and other local cultural factors. These somatic
presentations have been described as "idioms of distress" because
somatic symptoms may have special meanings and shape patient-clinician

interactions in the particular cultural contexts. "Burnout," the
sensation of heaviness or the complaints of "gas"; too much heat in the
body; or burning in the head are examples of symptoms that are common in
some cultures or ethnic groups but rare in others8. Explanatory models
also vary, and somatic symptoms may be attributed variously to
particular family, work, or environmental stresses; general medical
illness; the suppression of feelings of anger and resentment; or certain
culture-specific phenomena, such as semen loss6, 15, 16. There may also
be differences in medical treatment seeking among cultural groups, in
addition to differences due to variable access to medical care services.
Seeking treatment for multiple somatic symptoms in general medical
clinics is a worldwide phenomenon and occurs at similar rates among
ethnic groups in the same country1.

Functional Consequences of Somatic Symptom Disorder The disorder is
associated with marked impairment of health status. Many individuals
with severe somatic symptom disorder are likely to have impaired health
status scores more than 2 standard deviations below population norms1,
2.

Differential Diagnosis If the somatic symptoms are consistent with
another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder), and the diagnostic
criteria for that disorder are fulfilled, then that mental disorder
should be considered as an alternative or additional diagnosis. If, as
commonly occurs, the criteria for both somatic symptom disorder and
another mental disorder diagnosis are fulfilled, then both should be
coded, as both may require treatment. Other medical conditions. The
presence of somatic symptoms of unclear etiology is not in itself
sufficient to make the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder. The
symptoms of many individuals with disorders like irritable bowel
syndrome or fibromyalgia would not satisfy the criterion necessary to
diagnose somatic symptom disorder (Criterion B). Conversely, the
presence of somatic symptoms of an established medical disorder (e.g.,
diabetes or heart disease) does not exclude the diagnosis of somatic
symptom disorder if the criteria are otherwise met.

Panic disorder. In panic disorder, somatic symptoms and anxiety about
health tend to occur in acute episodes, whereas in somatic symptom
disorder, anxiety and somatic symptoms are more persistent. Generalized
anxiety disorder. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry
about multiple events, situations, or activities, only one of which may
involve their health. The main focus is not usually somatic symptoms or
fear of illness as it is in somatic symptom disorder. Depressive
disorders. Depressive disorders are commonly accompanied by somatic
symptoms. However, depressive disorders are differentiated from somatic
symptom disorder by the core depressive symptoms of low (dysphoric) mood
and anhedonia. Illness anxiety disorder. If the individual has extensive
worries about health but no or minimal somatic symptoms, it may be more
appropriate to consider illness anxiety disorder. Conversion disorder
(functional neurological symptom disorder). In conversion disorder, the
presenting symptom is loss of function (e.g., of a limb), whereas in
somatic symptom disorder, the focus is on the distress that particular
symptoms cause. The features listed under Criterion B of somatic symptom
disorder may be helpful in differentiating the two disorders. Delusional
disorder. In somatic symptom disorder, the individual's beliefs that
somatic symptoms might reflect serious underlying physical illness are
not held with delusional intensity. Nonetheless, the individual's
beliefs concerning the somatic symptoms can be firmly held. In contrast,
in delusional disorder, somatic subtype, the somatic symptom beliefs and
behavior are stronger than those found in somatic symptom disorder. Body
dysmorphic disorder. In body dysmorphic disorder, the individual is
excessively concerned about, and preoccupied by, a perceived defect in
his or her physical features. In contrast, in somatic symptom disorder,
the concern about somatic symptoms reflects fear of underlying illness,
not of a defect in appearance. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. In somatic
symptom disorder, the recurrent ideas about somatic symptoms or illness
are less intrusive, and individuals with this disorder do not exhibit
the associated repetitive

behaviors aimed at reducing anxiety that occur in obsessive-compulsive
disorder.

Comorbidity Somatic symptom disorder is associated with high rates of
comorbidity with medical disorders as well as anxiety and depressive
disorders. When a concurrent medical illness is present, the degree of
impairment is more marked than would be expected from the physical
illness alone. When an individual's symptoms meet diagnostic criteria
for somatic symptom disorder, the disorder should be diagnosed; however,
in view of the frequent comorbidity, especially with anxiety and
depressive disorders, evidence for these concurrent diagnoses should be
sought.

Illness Anxiety Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

300.7 (F45.21)

a.  Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness.
b.  Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in
    intensity. If another medical condition is present or there is a
    high risk for developing a medical condition (e.g., strong family
    history is present), the preoccupation is clearly excessive or
    disproportionate.
c.  There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is
    easily alarmed about personal health status.
d.  The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g.,
    repeatedly checks his or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits
    maladaptive avoidance (e.g., avoids doctor appointments and
    hospitals).
e.  Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months, but
    the specific illness that is feared may change over that period of
    time.
f.  The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another
    mental disorder, such as somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder,
    generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder,
    obsessivecompulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, somatic type.
    Specify whether: Care-seeking type: Medical care, including
    physician visits or undergoing tests and procedures, is frequently
    used. Care-avoidant type: Medical care is rarely used.

Diagnostic Features

Most individuals with hypochondriasis are now classified as having
somatic symptom disorder; however, in a minority of cases, the diagnosis
of illness anxiety disorder applies instead. Illness anxiety disorder
entails a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious, undiagnosed
medical illness (Criterion A). Somatic symptoms are not present or, if
present, are only mild in intensity (Criterion B). A thorough evaluation
fails to identify a serious medical condition that accounts for the
individual's concerns. While the concern may be derived from a
nonpathological physical sign or sensation, the individual's distress
emanates not primarily from the physical complaint itself but rather
from his or her anxiety about the meaning, significance, or cause of the
complaint (i.e., the suspected medical diagnosis). If a physical sign or
symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological sensation (e.g.,
orthostatic dizziness), a benign and selflimited dysfunction (e.g.,
transient tinnitus), or a bodily discomfort not generally considered
indicative of disease (e.g., belching). If a diagnosable medical
condition is present, the individual's anxiety and preoccupation are
clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the condition
(Criterion B). Empirical evidence and existing literature pertain to
previously defined DSM hypochondriasis, and it is unclear to what extent
and how precisely they apply to the description of this new diagnosis.
The preoccupation with the idea that one is sick is accompanied by
substantial anxiety about health and disease (Criterion C). Individuals
with illness anxiety disorder are easily alarmed about illness, such as
by hearing about someone else falling ill or reading a health-related
news story. Their concerns about undiagnosed disease do not respond to
appropriate medical reassurance, negative diagnostic tests, or benign
course. The physician's attempts at reassurance and symptom palliation
generally do not alleviate the individual's concerns and may heighten
them. Illness concerns assume a prominent place in the individual's
life, affecting daily activities, and may even result in invalidism.
Illness becomes a central feature of the individual's identity and
self-image, a frequent topic of social discourse, and a characteristic
response to stressful life events. Individuals with the disorder often
examine themselves repeatedly (e.g., examining one's throat in the
mirror) (Criterion D). They research their suspected disease excessively
(e.g., on the Internet) and repeatedly seek reassurance from family,
friends, or physicians. This incessant worrying often becomes
frustrating for others and may result in considerable strain within the

family. In some cases, the anxiety leads to maladaptive avoidance of
situations (e.g., visiting sick family members) or activities (e.g.,
exercise) that these individuals fear might jeopardize their health.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Because they believe they are
medically ill, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered
far more frequently in medical than in mental health settings. The
majority of individuals with illness anxiety disorder have extensive yet
unsatisfactory medical care, though some may be too anxious to seek
medical attention. They generally have elevated rates of medical
utilization but do not utilize mental health services more than the
general population6, 8. They often consult multiple physicians for the
same problem and obtain repeatedly negative diagnostic test results. At
times, medical attention leads to a paradoxical exacerbation of anxiety
or to iatrogenic complications from diagnostic tests and procedures.
Individuals with the disorder are generally dissatisfied with their
medical care and find it unhelpful, often feeling they are not being
taken seriously by physicians2. At times, these concerns may be
justified, since physicians sometimes are dismissive or respond with
frustration or hostility. This response can occasionally result in a
failure to diagnose a medical condition that is present.

Prevalence Prevalence estimates of illness anxiety disorder are based on
estimates of the DSM-III and DSM-IV diagnosis hypochondriasis. The 1- to
2-year prevalence of health anxiety and/or disease conviction in
community surveys and population-based samples ranges from 1.3% to
10%15, 16. In ambulatory medical populations, the 6-month/1-year
prevalence rates are between 3% and 8%1, 10. The prevalence of the
disorder is similar in males and females9, 16.

Development and Course The development and course of illness anxiety
disorder are unclear. Illness anxiety disorder is generally thought to
be a chronic and relapsing condition with an age at onset in early and
middle adulthood. In population-based samples, health-related anxiety
increases with age16, but the ages of

individuals with high health anxiety in medical settings do not appear
to differ from those of other patients in those settings1, 10. In older
individuals, health-related anxiety often focuses on memory loss; the
disorder is thought to be rare in children.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Illness anxiety disorder may
sometimes be precipitated by a major life stress or a serious but
ultimately benign threat to the individual's health. A history of
childhood abuse or of a serious childhood illness may predispose to
development of the disorder in adulthood14. Course modifiers.
Approximately one-third to one-half of individuals with illness anxiety
disorder have a transient form12, which is associated with less
psychiatric comorbidity, more medical comorbidity, and less severe
illness anxiety disorder5, 13.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The diagnosis should be made with
caution in individuals whose ideas about disease are congruent with
widely held, culturally sanctioned beliefs. Little is known about the
phenomenology of the disorder across cultures, although the prevalence
appears to be similar across different countries with diverse
cultures10.

Functional Disorder

Consequences

of

Illness

Anxiety

Illness anxiety disorder causes substantial role impairment and
decrements in physical function and health-related quality of life9, 10,
12. Health concerns often interfere with interpersonal relationships,
disrupt family life, and damage occupational performance.

Differential Diagnosis Other medical conditions. The first differential
diagnostic consideration is an underlying medical condition, including
neurological or endocrine conditions, occult malignancies, and other
diseases that affect multiple body systems. The presence of a medical
condition does not rule out the possibility of coexisting illness
anxiety disorder. If a medical condition is

present, the health-related anxiety and disease concerns are clearly
disproportionate to its seriousness. Transient preoccupations related to
a medical condition do not constitute illness anxiety disorder.
Adjustment disorders. Health-related anxiety is a normal response to
serious illness and is not a mental disorder. Such nonpathological
health anxiety is clearly related to the medical condition and is
typically timelimited. If the health anxiety is severe enough, an
adjustment disorder may be diagnosed. However, only when the health
anxiety is of sufficient duration, severity, and distress can illness
anxiety disorder be diagnosed. Thus, the diagnosis requires the
continuous persistence of disproportionate health-related anxiety for at
least 6 months. Somatic symptom disorder. Somatic symptom disorder is
diagnosed when significant somatic symptoms are present. In contrast,
individuals with illness anxiety disorder have minimal somatic symptoms
and are primarily concerned with the idea they are ill. Anxiety
disorders. In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals worry about
multiple events, situations, or activities, only one of which may
involve health. In panic disorder, the individual may be concerned that
the panic attacks reflect the presence of a medical illness; however,
although these individuals may have health anxiety, their anxiety is
typically very acute and episodic. In illness anxiety disorder, the
health anxiety and fears are more persistent and enduring. Individuals
with illness anxiety disorder may experience panic attacks that are
triggered by their illness concerns. Obsessive-compulsive and related
disorders. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may have intrusive
thoughts about having a disease and also may have associated compulsive
behaviors (e.g., seeking reassurance). However, in illness anxiety
disorder, the preoccupations are usually focused on having a disease,
whereas in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the thoughts are
intrusive and are usually focused on fears of getting a disease in the
future. Most individuals with OCD have obsessions or compulsions
involving other concerns in addition to fears about contracting disease.
In body dysmorphic disorder, concerns are limited to the individual's
physical appearance, which is viewed as defective or flawed. Major
depressive disorder. Some individuals with a major depressive episode
ruminate about their health and worry excessively about illness. A

separate diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder is not made if these
concerns occur only during major depressive episodes. However, if
excessive illness worry persists after remission of an episode of major
depressive disorder, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder should be
considered. Psychotic disorders. Individuals with illness anxiety
disorder are not delusional and can acknowledge the possibility that the
feared disease is not present. Their ideas do not attain the rigidity
and intensity seen in the somatic delusions occurring in psychotic
disorders (e.g., schizophrenia; delusional disorder, somatic type; major
depressive disorder, with psychotic features). True somatic delusions
are generally more bizarre (e.g., that an organ is rotting or dead) than
the concerns seen in illness anxiety disorder. The concerns seen in
illness anxiety disorder, though not founded in reality, are plausible.

Comorbidity Because illness anxiety disorder is a new disorder, exact
comorbidities are unknown. Hypochondriasis co-occurs with anxiety
disorders (in particular, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder,
and OCD) and depressive disorders4, 17. Approximately two-thirds of
individuals with illness anxiety disorder are likely to have at least
one other comorbid major mental disorder4, 13. Individuals with illness
anxiety disorder may have an elevated risk for somatic symptom disorder
and personality disorders4, 7, 11.

Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)
Diagnostic Criteria a. One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor
or sensory function. b. Clinical findings provide evidence of
incompatibility between the symptom and recognized neurological or
medical conditions. c. The symptom or deficit is not better explained by
another medical or mental disorder. d. The symptom or deficit causes
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning or warrants medical evaluation.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for conversion disorder is 300.11, which
is assigned regardless of the symptom type. The ICD-10-CM code depends
on the symptom type (see below). Specify symptom type: (F44.4) With
weakness or paralysis (F44.4) With abnormal movement (e.g., tremor,
dystonic movement, myoclonus, gait disorder) (F44.4) With swallowing
symptoms (F44.4) With speech symptom (e.g., dysphonia, slurred speech)
(F44.5) With attacks or seizures (F44.6) With anesthesia or sensory loss
(F44.6) With special sensory symptom (e.g., visual, olfactory, or
hearing disturbance) (F44.7) With mixed symptoms Specify if: Acute
episode: Symptoms present for less than 6 months.

Persistent: Symptoms occurring for 6 months or more. Specify if: With
psychological stressor (specify stressor) Without psychological stressor

Diagnostic Features Many clinicians use the alternative names of
"functional" (referring to abnormal central nervous system functioning)
or "psychogenic" (referring to an assumed etiology) to describe the
symptoms of conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom
disorder)10. In conversion disorder, there may be one or more symptoms
of various types. Motor symptoms include weakness or paralysis; abnormal
movements, such as tremor or dystonic movements; gait abnormalities; and
abnormal limb posturing. Sensory symptoms include altered, reduced, or
absent skin sensation, vision, or hearing. Episodes of abnormal
generalized limb shaking with apparent impaired or loss of consciousness
may resemble epileptic seizures (also called psychogenic or
non-epileptic seizures). There may be episodes of unresponsiveness
resembling syncope or coma. Other symptoms include reduced or absent
speech volume (dysphonia/aphonia), altered articulation (dysarthria), a
sensation of a lump in the throat (globus), and diplopia. Although the
diagnosis requires that the symptom is not explained by neurological
disease, it should not be made simply because results from
investigations are normal or because the symptom is "bizarre." There
must be clinical findings that show clear evidence of incompatibility
with neurological disease. Internal inconsistency at examination is one
way to demonstrate incompatibility (i.e., demonstrating that physical
signs elicited through one examination method are no longer positive
when tested a different way). Examples of such examination findings
include Hoover's sign, in which weakness of hip extension returns to
normal strength with contralateral hip flexion against resistance10.
Marked weakness of ankle plantar-flexion when tested on the bed in an
individual who is able to walk on tiptoes; Positive findings on the
tremor entrainment test. On this test, a unilateral tremor may be
identified as functional if the tremor changes

when the individual is distracted away from it. This may be observed if
the individual is asked to copy the examiner in making a rhythmical
movement with their unaffected hand and this causes the functional
tremor to change such that it copies or "entrains" to the rhythm of the
unaffected hand or the functional tremor is suppressed, or no longer
makes a simple rhythmical movement5. In attacks resembling epilepsy or
syncope ("psychogenic" nonepileptic attacks), the occurrence of closed
eyes with resistance to opening1 or a normal simultaneous
electroencephalogram (although this alone does not exclude all forms of
epilepsy or syncope). For visual symptoms, a tubular visual field (i.e.,
tunnel vision)3. It is important to note that the diagnosis of
conversion disorder should be based on the overall clinical picture and
not on a single clinical finding.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis A number of associated features
can support the diagnosis of conversion disorder. There may be a history
of multiple similar somatic symptoms. Onset may be associated with
stress or trauma, either psychological or physical in nature. The
potential etiological relevance of this stress or trauma may be
suggested by a close temporal relationship. However, while assessment
for stress and trauma is important, the diagnosis should not be withheld
if none is found10. Conversion disorder is often associated with
dissociative symptoms, such as depersonalization, derealization, and
dissociative amnesia, particularly at symptom onset or during attacks.
The diagnosis of conversion disorder does not require the judgment that
the symptoms are not intentionally produced (i.e., not feigned), as the
definite absence of feigning may not be reliably discerned. The
phenomenon of la belle indifférence (i.e., lack of concern about the
nature or implications of the symptom) has been associated with
conversion disorder but it is not specific for conversion disorder and
should not be used to make the diagnosis. Similarly the concept of
secondary gain (i.e., when individuals derive external benefits such as
money or release from responsibilities) is also not specific to
conversion disorder and particularly in the context of definite evidence
for feigning, the diagnoses that should be

considered instead would include factitious disorder or malingering (see
the section "Differential Diagnosis" for this disorder).

Prevalence Transient conversion symptoms are common, but the precise
prevalence of the disorder is unknown. This is partly because the
diagnosis usually requires assessment in secondary care, where it is
found in approximately 5% of referrals to neurology clinics. The
incidence of individual persistent conversion symptoms is estimated to
be 2--5/100,000 per year7, 9.

Development and Course Onset has been reported throughout the life
course. The onset of nonepileptic attacks peaks in the third decade, and
motor symptoms have their peak onset in the fourth decade. The symptoms
can be transient or persistent. The prognosis may be better in younger
children than in adolescents and adults6.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Maladaptive personality
traits are commonly associated with conversion disorder. Environmental.
There may be a history of childhood abuse and neglect. Stressful life
events are often, but not always, present7. Genetic and physiological.
The presence of neurological disease that causes similar symptoms is a
risk factor (e.g., non-epileptic seizures are more common in patients
who also have epilepsy)4.

Course modifiers Short duration of symptoms and acceptance of the
diagnosis are positive prognostic factors. Maladaptive personality
traits, the presence of comorbid physical disease, and the receipt of
disability benefits may be negative prognostic factors4, 7.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Changes resembling conversion (and
dissociative) symptoms are common in certain culturally sanctioned
rituals2. If the symptoms are fully explained

within the particular cultural context and do not result in clinically
significant distress or disability, then the diagnosis of conversion
disorder is not made.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Conversion disorder is two to three
times more common in females.

Functional Consequences of Conversion Disorder Individuals with
conversion symptoms may have substantial disability. The severity of
disability can be similar to that experienced by individuals with
comparable medical diseases.

Differential Diagnosis If another mental disorder better explains the
symptoms, that diagnosis should be made. However the diagnosis of
conversion disorder may be made in the presence of another mental
disorder. Neurological disease. The main differential diagnosis is
neurological disease that might better explain the symptoms. After a
thorough neurological assessment, an unexpected neurological disease
cause for the symptoms is rarely found at follow up8. However,
reassessment may be required if the symptoms appear to be progressive.
Conversion disorder may coexist with neurological disease. Somatic
symptom disorder. Conversion disorder may be diagnosed in addition to
somatic symptom disorder. Most of the somatic symptoms encountered in
somatic symptom disorder cannot be demonstrated to be clearly
incompatible with pathophysiology (e.g., pain, fatigue), whereas in
conversion disorder, such incompatibility is required for the diagnosis.
The excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors characterizing somatic
symptom disorder are often absent in conversion disorder. Factitious
disorder and malingering. The diagnosis of conversion disorder does not
require the judgment that the symptoms are not intentionally produced
(i.e., not feigned), because assessment of conscious intention is
unreliable. However definite evidence of feigning (e.g., clear evidence
that loss of function is present during the examination but not at home)
would suggest a diagnosis of factitious disorder if the individual's

apparent aim is to assume the sick role or malingering if the aim is to
obtain an incentive such as money. Dissociative disorders. Dissociative
symptoms are common in individuals with conversion disorder. If both
conversion disorder and a dissociative disorder are present, both
diagnoses should be made. Body dysmorphic disorder. Individuals with
body dysmorphic disorder are excessively concerned about a perceived
defect in their physical features but do not complain of symptoms of
sensory or motor functioning in the affected body part. Depressive
disorders. In depressive disorders, individuals may report general
heaviness of their limbs, whereas the weakness of conversion disorder is
more focal and prominent. Depressive disorders are also differentiated
by the presence of core depressive symptoms. Panic disorder. Episodic
neurological symptoms (e.g., tremors and paresthesias) can occur in both
conversion disorder and panic attacks. In panic attacks, the
neurological symptoms are typically transient and acutely episodic with
characteristic cardiorespiratory symptoms. Loss of awareness with
amnesia for the attack and violent limb movements occur in nonepileptic
attacks, but not in panic attacks.

Comorbidity Anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder, and depressive
disorders commonly co-occur with conversion disorder7, 9. Somatic
symptom disorder may co-occur as well. Psychosis, substance use
disorder, and alcohol misuse are uncommon. Personality disorders are
more common in individuals with conversion disorder than in the general
population. Neurological or other medical conditions commonly coexist
with conversion disorder as well.

Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions Diagnostic
Criteria

316 (F54)

a.  A medical symptom or condition (other than a mental disorder) is
    present.
b.  Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical
    condition in one of the following ways:

<!-- -->

1.  The factors have influenced the course of the medical condition as
    shown by a close temporal association between the

psychological factors and the development or exacerbation of, or delayed
recovery from, the medical condition. 2. The factors interfere with the
treatment of the medical condition (e.g., poor adherence). 3. The
factors constitute additional well-established health risks for the
individual. 4. The factors influence the underlying pathophysiology,
precipitating or exacerbating symptoms or necessitating medical
attention. c. The psychological and behavioral factors in Criterion B
are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., panic
disorder, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder).
Specify current severity: Mild: Increases medical risk (e.g.,
inconsistent adherence with antihypertension treatment). Moderate:
Aggravates underlying medical condition (e.g., anxiety aggravating
asthma). Severe: Results in medical hospitalization or emergency room
visit. Extreme: Results in severe, life-threatening risk (e.g., ignoring
heart attack symptoms).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of psychological factors
affecting other medical conditions is the presence of one or more
clinically significant psychological or behavioral factors that
adversely affect a medical condition by increasing the risk for
suffering, death, or disability (Criterion B). These factors can
adversely affect the medical condition by influencing its course or
treatment, by constituting an additional well-established health risk
factor, or by influencing the underlying pathophysiology to precipitate
or exacerbate symptoms or to necessitate medical attention.
Psychological or behavioral factors include psychological distress,
patterns of interpersonal interaction, coping styles, and maladaptive
health behaviors, such as denial of symptoms or poor adherence to
medical recommendations. Common clinical examples are
anxiety-exacerbating

asthma, denial of need for treatment for acute chest pain, and
manipulation of insulin by an individual with diabetes wishing to lose
weight. Many different psychological factors have been demonstrated to
adversely influence medical conditions---for example, symptoms of
depression or anxiety, stressful life events, relationship style,
personality traits, and coping styles2, 3, 4, 5. The adverse effects can
range from acute, with immediate medical consequences (e.g., Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy)1 to chronic, occurring over a long period of time (e.g.,
chronic occupational stress increasing risk for hypertension)8. Affected
medical conditions can be those with clear pathophysiology (e.g.,
diabetes, cancer, coronary disease), functional syndromes (e.g.,
migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia), or idiopathic medical
symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, dizziness)6, 9. This diagnosis should be
reserved for situations in which the effect of the psychological factor
on the medical condition is evident and the psychological factor has
clinically significant effects on the course or outcome of the medical
condition. Abnormal psychological or behavioral symptoms that develop in
response to a medical condition are more properly coded as an adjustment
disorder (a clinically significant psychological response to an
identifiable stressor). There must be reasonable evidence to suggest an
association between the psychological factors and the medical condition,
although it may often not be possible to demonstrate direct causality or
the mechanisms underlying the relationship.

Prevalence The prevalence of psychological factors affecting other
medical conditions is unclear. In U.S. private insurance billing data,
it is a more common diagnosis than somatic symptom disorders7.

Development and Course Psychological factors affecting other medical
conditions can occur across the lifespan. Particularly with young
children, corroborative history from parents or school can assist the
diagnostic evaluation. Some conditions are characteristic of particular
life stages (e.g., in older individuals, the stress associated with
acting as a caregiver for an ill spouse or partner).

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Many differences between cultures may
influence psychological factors and their effects on medical conditions,
such as those in language and communication style, explanatory models of
illness, patterns of seeking health care, service availability and
organization, doctor-patient relationships and other healing practices,
family and gender roles, and attitudes toward pain and death10.
Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions must be
differentiated from culturally specific behaviors such as using faith or
spiritual healers or other variations in illness management that are
acceptable within a culture and represent an attempt to help the medical
condition rather than interfere with it. These local practices may
complement rather than obstruct evidence-based interventions. If they do
not adversely affect outcomes, they should not be pathologized as
psychological factors affecting other medical conditions.

Functional Consequences of Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical
Conditions Psychological and behavioral factors have been demonstrated
to affect the course of many medical diseases6.

Differential Diagnosis Mental disorder due to another medical condition.
A temporal association between symptoms of a mental disorder and those
of a medical condition is also characteristic of a mental disorder due
to another medical condition, but the presumed causality is in the
opposite direction. In a mental disorder due to another medical
condition, the medical condition is judged to be causing the mental
disorder through a direct physiological mechanism. In psychological
factors affecting other medical conditions, the psychological or
behavioral factors are judged to affect the course of the medical
condition. Adjustment disorders. Abnormal psychological or behavioral
symptoms that develop in response to a medical condition are more
properly coded as an adjustment disorder (a clinically significant
psychological response to an identifiable stressor). For example, an
individual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes enraged
would be diagnosed as having

psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, whereas an
individual with angina who developed maladaptive anticipatory anxiety
would be diagnosed as having an adjustment disorder with anxiety. In
clinical practice, however, psychological factors and a medical
condition are often mutually exacerbating (e.g., anxiety as both a
precipitant and a consequence of angina), in which case the distinction
is arbitrary. Other mental disorders frequently result in medical
complications, most notably substance use disorders (e.g., alcohol use
disorder, tobacco use disorder). If an individual has a coexisting major
mental disorder that adversely affects or causes another medical
condition, diagnoses of the mental disorder and the medical condition
are usually sufficient. Psychological factors affecting other medical
conditions is diagnosed when the psychological traits or behaviors do
not meet criteria for a mental diagnosis. Somatic symptom disorder.
Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by a combination of
distressing somatic symptoms and excessive or maladaptive thoughts,
feelings, and behavior in response to these symptoms or associated
health concerns. The individual may or may not have a diagnosable
medical condition. In contrast, in psychological factors affecting other
medical conditions, the psychological factors adversely affect a medical
condition; the individual's thoughts, feelings, and behavior are not
necessarily excessive. The difference is one of emphasis, rather than a
clear-cut distinction. In psychological factors affecting other medical
conditions, the emphasis is on the exacerbation of the medical condition
(e.g., an individual with angina that is precipitated whenever he
becomes anxious). In somatic symptom disorder, the emphasis is on
maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behavior (e.g., an individual with
angina who worries constantly that she will have a heart attack, takes
her blood pressure multiple times per day, and restricts her
activities). Illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is
characterized by high illness anxiety that is distressing and/or
disruptive to daily life with minimal somatic symptoms. The focus of
clinical concern is the individual's worry about having a disease; in
most cases, no serious disease is present. In psychological factors
affecting other medical conditions, anxiety may be a relevant
psychological factor affecting a medical condition, but the clinical
concern is the adverse effects on the medical condition.

Comorbidity By definition, the diagnosis of psychological factors
affecting other medical conditions entails a relevant psychological or
behavioral syndrome or trait and a comorbid medical condition.

Factitious Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

300.19 (F68.10)

Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self a. Falsification of physical or
psychological signs or symptoms, or induction of injury or disease,
associated with identified deception. b. The individual presents himself
or herself to others as ill, impaired, or injured. c. The deceptive
behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious external rewards.
d. The behavior is not better explained by another mental disorder, such
as delusional disorder or another psychotic disorder. Specify: Single
episode Recurrent episodes (two or more events of falsification of
illness and/or induction of injury)

Factitious Disorder Imposed on Another (Previously Factitious Disorder
by Proxy) a. Falsification of physical or psychological signs or
symptoms, or induction of injury or disease, in another, associated with
identified deception. b. The individual presents another individual
(victim) to others as ill, impaired, or injured. c. The deceptive
behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious external rewards.
d. The behavior is not better explained by another mental disorder, such
as delusional disorder or another psychotic disorder. Note: The
perpetrator, not the victim, receives this diagnosis. Specify: Single
episode Recurrent episodes (two or more events of falsification of
illness and/or induction of injury)

Recording Procedures

When an individual falsifies illness in another (e.g., children, adults,
pets), the diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on another. The
perpetrator, not the victim, is given the diagnosis. The victim may be
given an abuse diagnosis (e.g., 995.54 \[T74.12X\]; see the chapter
"Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention").

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of factitious disorder is the
falsification of medical or psychological signs and symptoms in oneself
or others that are associated with the identified deception6.
Individuals with factitious disorder can also seek treatment for
themselves or another following induction of injury or disease. The
diagnosis requires demonstrating that the individual is taking
surreptitious actions to misrepresent, simulate, or cause signs or
symptoms of illness or injury in the absence of obvious external
rewards. Methods of illness falsification can include exaggeration,
fabrication, simulation, and induction. While a preexisting medical
condition may be present, the deceptive behavior or induction of injury
associated with deception causes others to view such individuals (or
another) as more ill or impaired, and this can lead to excessive
clinical intervention. Individuals with factitious disorder might, for
example, report feelings of depression and suicidality following the
death of a spouse despite the death not being true or the individual's
not having a spouse; deceptively report episodes of neurological
symptoms (e.g., seizures, dizziness, or blacking out); manipulate a
laboratory test (e.g., by adding blood to urine) to falsely indicate an
abnormality; falsify medical records to indicate an illness; ingest a
substance (e.g., insulin or warfarin) to induce an abnormal laboratory
result or illness; or physically injure themselves or induce illness in
themselves or another (e.g., by injecting fecal material to produce an
abscess or to induce sepsis).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with factitious
disorder imposed on self or factitious disorder imposed on another are
at risk for experiencing great psychological distress or functional
impairment by causing harm to themselves and others. Family, friends,
and health care professionals are also often adversely affected by their
behavior. Factitious disorders have similarities to substance use
disorders, eating disorders, impulse-control disorders, pedophilic
disorder,

and some other established disorders related to both the persistence of
the behavior and the intentional efforts to conceal the disordered
behavior through deception. Whereas some aspects of factitious disorders
might represent criminal behavior (e.g., factitious disorder imposed on
another, in which the parent's actions represent abuse and maltreatment
of a child), such criminal behavior and mental illness are not mutually
exclusive. The diagnosis of factitious disorder emphasizes the objective
identification of falsification of signs and symptoms of illness, rather
than an inference about intent or possible underlying motivation.
Moreover, such behaviors, including the induction of injury or disease,
are associated with deception.

Prevalence The prevalence of factitious disorder is unknown, likely
because of the role of deception in this population. Among patients in
hospital settings, it is estimated that about 1% of individuals have
presentations that meet the criteria for factitious disorder4, 5.

Development and Course The course of factitious disorder is usually one
of intermittent episodes. Single episodes and episodes that are
characterized as persistent and unremitting are both less common. Onset
is usually in early adulthood, often after hospitalization for a medical
condition or a mental disorder. When imposed on another, the disorder
may begin after hospitalization of the individual's child or other
dependent. In individuals with recurrent episodes of falsification of
signs and symptoms of illness and/or induction of injury, this pattern
of successive deceptive contact with medical personnel, including
hospitalizations, may become lifelong.

Differential Diagnosis Caregivers who lie about abuse injuries in
dependents solely to protect themselves from liability are not diagnosed
with factitious disorder imposed on another because protection from
liability is an external reward (Criterion C, the deceptive behavior is
evident even in the absence of obvious external rewards). Such
caregivers who, upon observation, analysis of medical records, and/or
interviews with others, are found to lie more extensively

than needed for immediate self-protection are diagnosed with factitious
disorder imposed on another. Somatic symptom disorder. In somatic
symptom disorder, there may be excessive attention and treatment seeking
for perceived medical concerns, but there is no evidence that the
individual is providing false information or behaving deceptively1, 3.
Malingering. Malingering is differentiated from factitious disorder by
the intentional reporting of symptoms for personal gain (e.g., money,
time off work). In contrast, the diagnosis of factitious disorder
requires the absence of obvious rewards2. Conversion disorder
(functional neurological symptom disorder). Conversion disorder is
characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with
neurological pathophysiology. Factitious disorder with neurological
symptoms is distinguished from conversion disorder by evidence of
deceptive falsification of symptoms. Borderline personality disorder.
Deliberate physical self-harm in the absence of suicidal intent can also
occur in association with other mental disorders such as borderline
personality disorder. Factitious disorder requires that the induction of
injury occur in association with deception. Medical condition or mental
disorder not associated with intentional symptom falsification.
Presentation of signs and symptoms of illness that do not conform to an
identifiable medical condition or mental disorder increases the
likelihood of the presence of a factitious disorder. However, the
diagnosis of factitious disorder does not exclude the presence of true
medical condition or mental disorder, as comorbid illness often occurs
in the individual along with factitious disorder. For example,
individuals who might manipulate blood sugar levels to produce symptoms
may also have diabetes.

Other Specified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder 300.89 (F45.8) This
category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
somatic symptom and related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the somatic symptom and related disorders diagnostic
class. Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following: 1. Brief somatic symptom
disorder: Duration of symptoms is less than 6 months. 2. Brief illness
anxiety disorder: Duration of symptoms is less than 6 months. 3. Illness
anxiety disorder without excessive health-related behaviors: Criterion D
for illness anxiety disorder is not met. 4. Pseudocyesis: A false belief
of being pregnant that is associated with objective signs and reported
symptoms of pregnancy.

Unspecified Somatic Symptom and Related Disorder 300.82 (F45.9) This
category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
somatic symptom and related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of
the disorders in the somatic symptom and related disorders diagnostic
class. The unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder category
should not be used unless there are decidedly unusual situations where
there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Feeding and Eating Disorders Feeding and eating disorders are
characterized by a persistent disturbance of eating or eating-related
behavior that results in the altered consumption or absorption of food
and that significantly impairs physical health or psychosocial
functioning. Diagnostic criteria are provided for pica, rumination
disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. The diagnostic criteria for
rumination disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder result in a
classification scheme that is mutually exclusive, so that during a
single episode, only one of these diagnoses can be assigned. The
rationale for this approach is that, despite a number of common
psychological and behavioral features, the disorders differ
substantially in clinical course, outcome, and treatment needs. A
diagnosis of pica, however, may be assigned in the presence of any other
feeding and eating disorder. Some individuals with disorders described
in this chapter report eatingrelated symptoms resembling those typically
endorsed by individuals with substance use disorders, such as craving
and patterns of compulsive use. This resemblance may reflect the
involvement of the same neural systems, including those implicated in
regulatory self-control and reward, in both groups of disorders.
However, the relative contributions of shared and distinct factors in
the development and perpetuation of eating and substance use disorders
remain insufficiently understood. Finally, obesity is not included in
DSM-5 as a mental disorder. Obesity (excess body fat) results from the
long-term excess of energy intake relative to energy expenditure. A
range of genetic, physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors
that vary across individuals contributes to the development of obesity;
thus, obesity is not considered a mental disorder. However, there are
robust associations between obesity and a number of mental disorders
(e.g., binge-eating disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders,
schizophrenia). The side effects of some psychotropic

medications contribute importantly to the development of obesity, and
obesity may be a risk factor for the development of some mental
disorders (e.g., depressive disorders).

Pica Diagnostic Criteria a. Persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood
substances over a period of at least 1 month. b. The eating of
nonnutritive, nonfood substances is inappropriate to the developmental
level of the individual. c. The eating behavior is not part of a
culturally supported or socially normative practice. d. If the eating
behavior occurs in the context of another mental disorder (e.g.,
intellectual disability \[intellectual developmental disorder\], autism
spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) or medical condition (including
pregnancy), it is sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical
attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for pica is 307.52 and is used
for children or adults. The ICD-10-CM codes for pica are (F98.3) in
children and (F50.8) in adults. Specify if: In remission: After full
criteria for pica were previously met, the criteria have not been met
for a sustained period of time.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of pica is the eating of one
or more nonnutritive, nonfood substances on a persistent basis over a
period of at least 1 month (Criterion A) that is severe enough to
warrant clinical attention. Typical substances ingested tend to vary
with age and availability and might include paper, soap, cloth, hair,
string, wool, soil, chalk, talcum powder, paint, gum, metal, pebbles,
charcoal or coal, ash, clay, starch, or ice. The term nonfood is
included because the diagnosis of pica does not apply to ingestion of
diet products that have minimal nutritional content. There is typically
no

aversion to food in general. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood
substances must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B) and not
part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice (Criterion
C). A minimum age of 2 years is suggested for a pica diagnosis to
exclude developmentally normal mouthing of objects by infants that
results in ingestion. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances can
be an associated feature of other mental disorders (e.g., intellectual
disability \[intellectual developmental disorder\], autism spectrum
disorder, schizophrenia). If the eating behavior occurs exclusively in
the context of another mental disorder, a separate diagnosis of pica
should be made only if the eating behavior is sufficiently severe to
warrant additional clinical attention (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Although deficiencies in
vitamins or minerals (e.g., zinc, iron) have been reported in some
instances1, often no specific biological abnormalities are found. In
some cases, pica comes to clinical attention only following general
medical complications (e.g., mechanical bowel problems; intestinal
obstruction, such as that resulting from a bezoar; intestinal
perforation; infections such as toxoplasmosis and toxocariasis as a
result of ingesting feces or dirt; poisoning, such as by ingestion of
lead-based paint).

Prevalence The prevalence of pica is unclear. Among individuals with
intellectual disability, the prevalence of pica appears to increase with
the severity of the condition.

Development and Course Onset of pica can occur in childhood,
adolescence, or adulthood, although childhood onset is most commonly
reported. Pica can occur in otherwise normally developing children,
whereas in adults, it appears more likely to occur in the context of
intellectual disability or other mental disorders. The eating of
nonnutritive, nonfood substances may also manifest in pregnancy, when
specific cravings (e.g., chalk or ice) might occur. The diagnosis of
pica during pregnancy is only appropriate if such cravings lead to the
ingestion of nonnutritive, nonfood substances to the extent that the
eating of

these substances poses potential medical risks. The course of the
disorder can be protracted and can result in medical emergencies (e.g.,
intestinal obstruction, acute weight loss, poisoning). The disorder can
potentially be fatal depending on substances ingested.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Neglect, lack of supervision,
and developmental delay can increase the risk for this condition2.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues In some populations, the eating of
earth or other seemingly nonnutritive substances is believed to be of
spiritual, medicinal, or other social value, or may be a culturally
supported or socially normative practice. Such behavior does not warrant
a diagnosis of pica (Criterion C).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Pica occurs in both males and females.
It can occur in females during pregnancy; however, little is known about
the course of pica in the postpartum period.

Diagnostic Markers Abdominal flat plate radiography, ultrasound, and
other scanning methods may reveal obstructions related to pica. Blood
tests and other laboratory tests can be used to ascertain levels of
poisoning or the nature of infection.

Functional Consequences of Pica Pica can significantly impair physical
functioning, but it is rarely the sole cause of impairment in social
functioning. Pica often occurs with other disorders associated with
impaired social functioning.

Differential Diagnosis Eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may
occur during the course of other mental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum
disorder, schizophrenia) and in Kleine-Levin syndrome. In any such
instance, an additional diagnosis of

pica should be given only if the eating behavior is sufficiently
persistent and severe to warrant additional clinical attention. Anorexia
nervosa. Pica can usually be distinguished from the other feeding and
eating disorders by the consumption of nonnutritive, nonfood substances.
It is important to note, however, that some presentations of anorexia
nervosa include ingestion of nonnutritive, nonfood substances, such as
paper tissues, as a means of attempting to control appetite. In such
cases, when the eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is primarily
used as a means of weight control, anorexia nervosa should be the
primary diagnosis. Factitious disorder. Some individuals with factitious
disorder may intentionally ingest foreign objects as part of the pattern
of falsification of physical symptoms. In such instances, there is an
element of deception that is consistent with deliberate induction of
injury or disease. Nonsuicidal self-injury and nonsuicidal self-injury
behaviors in personality disorders. Some individuals may swallow
potentially harmful items (e.g., pins, needles, knives) in the context
of maladaptive behavior patterns associated with personality disorders
or nonsuicidal self-injury.

Comorbidity Disorders most commonly comorbid with pica are autism
spectrum disorder and intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder)3, 6, and, to a lesser degree, schizophrenia and
obsessive-compulsive disorder4. Pica can be associated with
trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking)
disorder. In comorbid presentations, the hair or skin is typically
ingested5. Pica can also be associated with avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder, particularly in individuals with a strong sensory
component to their presentation. When an individual is known to have
pica, assessment should include consideration of the possibility of
gastrointestinal complications, poisoning, infection, and nutritional
deficiency.

Rumination Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

307.53 (F98.21)

a.  Repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at least 1 month.
    Regurgitated food may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out.
b.  The repeated regurgitation is not attributable to an associated
    gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e.g., gastroesophageal
    reflux, pyloric stenosis).
c.  The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course
    of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or
    avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.
d.  If the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder
    (e.g., intellectual disability \[intellectual developmental
    disorder\] or another neurodevelopmental disorder), they are
    sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention.
    Specify if: In remission: After full criteria for rumination
    disorder were previously met, the criteria have not been met for a
    sustained period of time.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of rumination disorder is the
repeated regurgitation of food occurring after feeding or eating over a
period of at least 1 month (Criterion A). Previously swallowed food that
may be partially digested is brought up into the mouth without apparent
nausea, involuntary retching, or disgust. The food may be re-chewed and
then ejected from the mouth or reswallowed. Regurgitation in rumination
disorder should be frequent, occurring at least several times per week,
typically daily. The behavior is not better explained by an associated
gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e.g., gastroesophageal
reflux, pyloric stenosis) (Criterion B) and does not occur exclusively
during the course of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating
disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (Criterion C). If
the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder (e.g.,
intellectual disability \[intellectual developmental disorder\],
neurodevelopmental disorder), they must be sufficiently severe to
warrant additional clinical attention (Criterion D) and should represent
a primary aspect of the individual's presentation requiring
intervention. The disorder may be diagnosed across the life span,
particularly in individuals who also have intellectual disability1. Many
individuals with rumination disorder can be directly observed engaging
in the behavior by the clinician. In other instances diagnosis can be
made on the basis of self-report or corroborative information from
parents or caregivers. Individuals may describe the behavior as habitual
or outside of their control.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Infants with rumination
disorder display a characteristic position of straining and arching the
back with the head held back, making sucking movements with their
tongue. They may give the impression of gaining satisfaction from the
activity. They may be irritable and hungry between episodes of
regurgitation. Weight loss and failure to make expected weight gains are
common features in infants with rumination disorder. Malnutrition may
occur despite the infant's apparent hunger and the ingestion of
relatively large amounts of food, particularly in severe cases, when
regurgitation immediately follows each feeding episode and regurgitated
food is expelled. Malnutrition might also occur in older children and
adults, particularly when the regurgitation is accompanied by
restriction of intake.

Adolescents and adults may attempt to disguise the regurgitation
behavior by placing a hand over the mouth or coughing. Some will avoid
eating with others because of the acknowledged social undesirability of
the behavior. This may extend to an avoidance of eating prior to social
situations, such as work or school (e.g., avoiding breakfast because it
may be followed by regurgitation)2.

Prevalence Prevalence data for rumination disorder are inconclusive, but
the disorder is commonly reported to be higher in certain groups, such
as individuals with intellectual disability4.

Development and Course Onset of rumination disorder can occur in
infancy, childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. The age at onset in
infants is usually between ages 3 and 12 months. In infants, the
disorder frequently remits spontaneously, but its course can be
protracted and can result in medical emergencies (e.g., severe
malnutrition). It can potentially be fatal, particularly in infancy.
Rumination disorder can have an episodic course or occur continuously
until treated. In infants, as well as in older individuals with
intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or other
neurodevelopmental disorders, the regurgitation and rumination behavior
appears to have a selfsoothing or self-stimulating function, similar to
that of other repetitive motor behaviors such as head banging.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Psychosocial problems such as
lack of stimulation, neglect, stressful life situations, and problems in
the parent-child relationship may be predisposing factors in infants and
young children.

Functional Consequences of Rumination Disorder Malnutrition secondary to
repeated regurgitation may be associated with growth delay and have a
negative effect on development and learning potential. Some older
individuals with rumination disorder deliberately restrict their food
intake because of the social undesirability of regurgitation. They may
therefore present with weight loss or low weight3.

In older children, adolescents, and adults, social functioning is more
likely to be adversely affected.

Differential Diagnosis Gastrointestinal conditions. It is important to
differentiate regurgitation in rumination disorder from other conditions
characterized by gastroesophageal reflux or vomiting. Conditions such as
gastroparesis, pyloric stenosis, hiatal hernia, and Sandifer syndrome in
infants should be ruled out by appropriate physical examinations and
laboratory tests.

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa Individuals with anorexia nervosa
and bulimia nervosa may also engage in regurgitation with subsequent
spitting out of food as a means of disposing of ingested calories
because of concerns about weight gain.

Comorbidity Regurgitation with associated rumination can occur in the
context of a concurrent medical condition or another mental disorder
(e.g., generalized anxiety disorder). When the regurgitation occurs in
this context, a diagnosis of rumination disorder is appropriate only
when the severity of the disturbance exceeds that routinely associated
with such conditions or disorders and warrants additional clinical
attention.

Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

307.59 (F50.8)

a.  An eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in
    eating or food; avoidance based on the sensory characteristics of
    food; concern about aversive consequences of eating) as manifested
    by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy
    needs associated with one (or more) of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain
    or faltering growth in children).
2.  Significant nutritional deficiency.
3.  Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements.
4.  Marked interference with psychosocial functioning.

<!-- -->

b.  The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food or
    by an associated culturally sanctioned practice.
c.  The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course
    of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of
    a disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is
    experienced.
d.  The eating disturbance is not attributable to a concurrent medical
    condition or not better explained by another mental disorder. When
    the eating disturbance occurs in the context of another condition or
    disorder, the severity of the eating disturbance exceeds that
    routinely associated with the condition or disorder and warrants
    additional clinical attention. Specify if: In remission: After full
    criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder were
    previously met, the criteria have not been met for a sustained
    period of time.

Diagnostic Features

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces and extends the
DSM-IV diagnosis of feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood. The
main diagnostic feature of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is
avoidance or restriction of food intake (Criterion A) manifested by
clinically significant failure to meet requirements for nutrition or
insufficient energy intake through oral intake of food. One or more of
the following key features must be present: significant weight loss,
significant nutritional deficiency (or related health impact),
dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements, or marked
interference with psychosocial functioning. The determination of whether
weight loss is significant (Criterion A1) is a clinical judgment;
instead of losing weight, children and adolescents who have not
completed growth may not maintain weight or height increases along their
developmental trajectory8. Determination of significant nutritional
deficiency (Criterion A2) is also based on clinical assessment (e.g.,
assessment of dietary intake, physical examination, and laboratory
testing), and related impact on physical health can be of a similar
severity to that seen in anorexia nervosa (e.g., hypothermia,
bradycardia, anemia). In severe cases, particularly in infants,
malnutrition can be life threatening. "Dependence" on enteral feeding or
oral nutritional supplements (Criterion A3) means that supplementary
feeding is required to sustain adequate intake. Examples of individuals
requiring supplementary feeding include infants with failure to thrive
who require nasogastric tube feeding, children with neurodevelopmental
disorders who are dependent on nutritionally complete supplements, and
individuals who rely on gastrostomy tube feeding or complete oral
nutrition supplements in the absence of an underlying medical condition.
Inability to participate in normal social activities, such as eating
with others, or to sustain relationships as a result of the disturbance
would indicate marked interference with psychosocial functioning
(Criterion A4). Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder does not
include avoidance or restriction of food intake related to lack of
availability of food or to cultural practices (e.g., religious fasting
or normal dieting) (Criterion B), nor does it include developmentally
normal behaviors (e.g., picky eating in toddlers, reduced intake in
older adults). The disturbance is not better explained by excessive
concern about body weight or shape (Criterion C) or by concurrent
medical factors or mental disorders (Criterion D).

In some individuals, food avoidance or restriction may be based on the
sensory characteristics of qualities of food, such as extreme
sensitivity to appearance, color, smell, texture, temperature, or
taste11. Such behavior has been described as "restrictive eating,"
"selective eating," "choosy eating," "perseverant eating," "chronic food
refusal," and "food neophobia" and may manifest as refusal to eat
particular brands of foods or to tolerate the smell of food being eaten
by others2. Individuals with heightened sensory sensitivities associated
with autism may show similar behaviors. Food avoidance or restriction
may also represent a conditioned negative response associated with food
intake following, or in anticipation of, an aversive experience, such as
choking; a traumatic investigation, usually involving the
gastrointestinal tract (e.g., esophagoscopy); or repeated vomiting. The
terms functional dysphagia and globus hystericus have also been used for
such conditions2.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Several features may be
associated with food avoidance or reduced food intake, including a lack
of interest in eating or food, leading to weight loss or faltering
growth. Very young infants may present as being too sleepy, distressed,
or agitated to feed11. Infants and young children may not engage with
the primary caregiver during feeding or communicate hunger in favor of
other activities11. In older children and adolescents, food avoidance or
restriction may be associated with more generalized emotional
difficulties that do not meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety,
depressive, or bipolar disorder, sometimes called "food avoidance
emotional disorder." 5

Development and Course Food avoidance or restriction associated with
insufficient intake or lack of interest in eating most commonly develops
in infancy or early childhood and may persist in adulthood. Likewise,
avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food tends to arise in the
first decade of life but may persist into adulthood10. Avoidance related
to aversive consequences can arise at any age. The scant literature
regarding long-term outcomes suggests that food avoidance or restriction
based on sensory aspects is relatively stable and long-standing6, but
when persisting into adulthood, such avoidance/restriction can be
associated with relatively normal functioning.

There is currently insufficient evidence directly linking
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and subsequent onset of an
eating disorder. Infants with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
may be irritable and difficult to console during feeding, or may appear
apathetic and withdrawn. In some instances, parent-child interaction may
contribute to the infant's feeding problem (e.g., presenting food
inappropriately, or interpreting the infant's behavior as an act of
aggression or rejection). Inadequate nutritional intake may exacerbate
the associated features (e.g., irritability, developmental lags) and
further contribute to feeding difficulties. Associated factors include
infant temperament or developmental impairments that reduce an infant's
responsiveness to feeding. Coexisting parental psychopathology, or child
abuse or neglect, is suggested if feeding and weight improve in response
to changing caregivers. In infants, children, and prepubertal
adolescents, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder may be associated
with growth delay, and the resulting malnutrition negatively affects
development and learning potential. In older children, adolescents, and
adults, social functioning tends to be adversely affected. Regardless of
the age, family function may be affected, with heightened stress at
mealtimes and in other feeding or eating contexts involving friends and
relatives. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder manifests more
commonly in children than in adults, and there may be a long delay
between onset and clinical presentation. Triggers for presentation vary
considerably and include physical, social, and emotional difficulties.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Anxiety disorders, autism
spectrum disorder, obsessivecompulsive disorder, and
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may increase risk for avoidant
or restrictive feeding or eating behavior characteristic of the
disorder9. Environmental. Environmental risk factors for
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder include familial anxiety.
Higher rates of feeding disturbances may occur in children of mothers
with eating disorders4. Genetic and physiological. History of
gastrointestinal conditions, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting,
and a range of other medical

problems has been associated with feeding and eating behaviors
characteristic of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder3.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Presentations similar to
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder occur in various populations,
including in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe7.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should not be diagnosed when
avoidance of food intake is solely related to specific religious or
cultural practices.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Avoidant/restrictive food intake
disorder is equally common in males and females in infancy and early
childhood, but avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder comorbid with
autism spectrum disorder has a male predominance. Food avoidance or
restriction related to altered sensory sensitivities can occur in some
physiological conditions, most notably pregnancy, but is not usually
extreme and does not meet full criteria for the disorder.

Diagnostic Markers Diagnostic markers include malnutrition, low weight,
growth delay, and the need for artificial nutrition in the absence of
any clear medical condition other than poor intake.

Functional Consequences of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder
Associated developmental and functional limitations include impairment
of physical development and social difficulties that can have a
significant negative impact on family function.

Differential Diagnosis Appetite loss preceding restricted intake is a
nonspecific symptom that can accompany a number of mental diagnoses.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed concurrently
with the disorders below if all criteria are met, and the eating
disturbance requires specific clinical attention.

Other medical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, food allergies
and intolerances, occult malignancies). Restriction of food intake may
occur in other medical conditions, especially those with ongoing
symptoms such as vomiting, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, or
diarrhea. A diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
requires that the disturbance of intake is beyond that directly
accounted for by physical symptoms consistent with a medical condition;
the eating disturbance may also persist after being triggered by a
medical condition and following resolution of the medical condition.
Underlying medical or comorbid mental conditions may complicate feeding
and eating. Because older individuals, postsurgical patients, and
individuals receiving chemotherapy often lose their appetite, an
additional diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder
requires that the eating disturbance is a primary focus for
intervention. Specific neurological/neuromuscular, structural, or
congenital disorders and conditions associated with feeding
difficulties. Feeding difficulties are common in a number of congenital
and neurological conditions often related to problems with
oral/esophageal/pharyngeal structure and function, such as hypotonia of
musculature, tongue protrusion, and unsafe swallowing.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed in
individuals with such presentations as long as all diagnostic criteria
are met. Reactive attachment disorder. Some degree of withdrawal is
characteristic of reactive attachment disorder and can lead to a
disturbance in the caregiver-child relationship that can affect feeding
and the child's intake. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should
be diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both
disorders and the feeding disturbance is a primary focus for
intervention. Autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with autism spectrum
disorder often present with rigid eating behaviors and heightened
sensory sensitivities. However, these features do not always result in
the level of impairment that would be required for a diagnosis of
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder should be diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria
are met for both disorders and when the eating disturbance requires
specific treatment.

Specific phobia, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and other
anxiety disorders. Specific phobia, other type, specifies "situations
that may lead to choking or vomiting" and can represent the primary
trigger for the fear, anxiety, or avoidance required for diagnosis.
Distinguishing specific phobia from avoidant/restrictive food intake
disorder can be difficult when a fear of choking or vomiting has
resulted in food avoidance. Although avoidance or restriction of food
intake secondary to a pronounced fear of choking or vomiting can be
conceptualized as specific phobia, in situations when the eating problem
becomes the primary focus of clinical attention, avoidant/restrictive
food intake disorder becomes the appropriate diagnosis. In social
anxiety disorder, the individual may present with a fear of being
observed by others while eating, which can also occur in
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Anorexia nervosa. Restriction
of energy intake relative to requirements leading to significantly low
body weight is a core feature of anorexia nervosa. However, individuals
with anorexia nervosa also display a fear of gaining weight or of
becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain,
as well as specific disturbances in relation to perception and
experience of their own body weight and shape. These features are not
present in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and the two
disorders should not be diagnosed concurrently. Differential diagnosis
between avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and anorexia nervosa
may be difficult, especially in late childhood and early adolescence,
because these disorders may share a number of common symptoms (e.g.,
food avoidance, low weight). Differential diagnosis is also potentially
difficult in individuals with anorexia nervosa who deny any fear of
fatness but nonetheless engage in persistent behaviors that prevent
weight gain and who do not recognize the medical seriousness of their
low weight---a presentation sometimes termed "non-fat phobic anorexia
nervosa." 1 Full consideration of symptoms, course, and family history
is advised, and diagnosis may be best made in the context of a clinical
relationship over time. In some individuals, avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder might precede the onset of anorexia nervosa.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive
disorder may present with avoidance or restriction of intake in relation
to preoccupations with food or ritualized eating behavior.
Avoidant/restrictive

food intake disorder should be diagnosed concurrently only if all
criteria are met for both disorders and when the aberrant eating is a
major aspect of the clinical presentation requiring specific
intervention. Major depressive disorder. In major depressive disorder,
appetite might be affected to such an extent that individuals present
with significantly restricted food intake, usually in relation to
overall energy intake and often associated with weight loss. Usually
appetite loss and related reduction of intake abate with resolution of
mood problems. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should only be
used concurrently if full criteria are met for both disorders and when
the eating disturbance requires specific treatment. Schizophrenia
spectrum disorders. Individuals with schizophrenia, delusional disorder,
or other psychotic disorders may exhibit odd eating behaviors, avoidance
of specific foods because of delusional beliefs, or other manifestations
of avoidant or restrictive intake. In some cases, delusional beliefs may
contribute to a concern about negative consequences of ingesting certain
foods. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be used
concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when
the eating disturbance requires specific treatment. Factitious disorder
or factitious disorder imposed on another. Avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder should be differentiated from factitious disorder or
factitious disorder imposed on another. In order to assume the sick
role, some individuals with factitious disorder may intentionally
describe diets that are much more restrictive than those they are
actually able to consume, as well as complications of such behavior,
such as a need for enteral feedings or nutritional supplements, an
inability to tolerate a normal range of foods, and/or an inability to
participate normally in age-appropriate situations involving food. The
presentation may be impressively dramatic and engaging, and the symptoms
reported inconsistently. In factitious disorder imposed on another, the
caregiver describes symptoms consistent with avoidant/restrictive food
intake disorder and may induce physical symptoms such as failure to gain
weight. As with any diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on another,
the caregiver receives the diagnosis rather than the affected
individual, and diagnosis should be made only on the basis of a careful,
comprehensive assessment of the affected individual, the caregiver, and
their interaction.

Comorbidity The most commonly observed disorders comorbid with
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder are anxiety disorders,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorders
(specifically autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, and intellectual disability \[intellectual developmental
disorder\]).

Anorexia Nervosa Diagnostic Criteria a. Restriction of energy intake
relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in
the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health.
Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than
minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that
minimally expected. b. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming
fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even
though at a significantly low weight. c. Disturbance in the way in which
one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body
weight or shape on selfevaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of
the seriousness of the current low body weight. Coding note: The
ICD-9-CM code for anorexia nervosa is 307.1, which is assigned
regardless of the subtype. The ICD-10-CM code depends on the subtype
(see below). Specify whether: (F50.01) Restricting type: During the last
3 months, the individual has not engaged in recurrent episodes of binge
eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of
laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). This subtype describes presentations
in which weight loss is accomplished primarily through dieting, fasting,
and/or excessive exercise. (F50.02) Binge-eating/purging type: During
the last 3 months, the individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of
binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the
misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). Specify if:

In partial remission: After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were
previously met, Criterion A (low body weight) has not been met for a
sustained period, but either Criterion B (intense fear of gaining weight
or becoming fat or behavior that interferes with weight gain) or
Criterion C (disturbances in self-perception of weight and shape) is
still met. In full remission: After full criteria for anorexia nervosa
were previously met, none of the criteria have been met for a sustained
period of time. Specify current severity: The minimum level of severity
is based, for adults, on current body mass index (BMI) (see below) or,
for children and adolescents, on BMI percentile. The ranges below are
derived from World Health Organization categories for thinness in
adults; for children and adolescents, corresponding BMI percentiles
should be used. The level of severity may be increased to reflect
clinical symptoms, the degree of functional disability, and the need for
supervision. Mild: BMI ≥ 17 kg/m2 Moderate: BMI 16--16.99 kg/m2 Severe:
BMI 15--15.99 kg/m2 Extreme: BMI \< 15 kg/m2

Subtypes Most individuals with the binge-eating/purging type of anorexia
nervosa who binge eat also purge through self-induced vomiting or the
misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas. Some individuals with this
subtype of anorexia nervosa do not binge eat but do regularly purge
after the consumption of small amounts of food. Crossover between the
subtypes over the course of the disorder is not uncommon; therefore,
subtype description should be used to describe current symptoms rather
than longitudinal course.

Diagnostic Features There are three essential features of anorexia
nervosa: persistent energy intake restriction; intense fear of gaining
weight or of becoming fat, or

persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain; and a disturbance
in self-perceived weight or shape. The individual maintains a body
weight that is below a minimally normal level for age, sex,
developmental trajectory, and physical health (Criterion A).
Individuals' body weights frequently meet this criterion following a
significant weight loss, but among children and adolescents, there may
alternatively be failure to make expected weight gain or to maintain a
normal developmental trajectory (i.e., while growing in height) instead
of weight loss21. Criterion A requires that the individual's weight be
significantly low (i.e., less than minimally normal or, for children and
adolescents, less than that minimally expected). Weight assessment can
be challenging because normal weight range differs among individuals,
and different thresholds have been published defining thinness or
underweight status23. Body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in
kilograms/height in meters2) is a useful measure to assess body weight
for height. For adults, a BMI of 18.5 kg/m2 has been employed by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)5 and the World Health
Organization (WHO)27 as the lower limit of normal body weight.
Therefore, most adults with a BMI greater than or equal to 18.5 kg/m2
would not be considered to have a significantly low body weight. On the
other hand, a BMI of lower than 17.0 kg/m2 has been considered by the
WHO to indicate moderate or severe thinness27, therefore, an individual
with a BMI less than 17.0 kg/m2 would likely be considered to have a
significantly low weight. An adult with a BMI between 17.0 and 18.5
kg/m2, or even above 18.5 kg/m2, might be considered to have a
significantly low weight if clinical history or other physiological
information supports this judgment. For children and adolescents,
determining a BMI-for-age percentile is useful (see, e.g., the CDC BMI
percentile calculator for children and
teenagershttp://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/. As for adults, it is not
possible to provide definitive standards for judging whether a child's
or an adolescent's weight is significantly low, and variations in
developmental trajectories among youth limit the utility of simple
numerical guidelines. The CDC has used a BMI-for-age below the 5th
percentile as suggesting underweight; however, children and adolescents
with a BMI above this benchmark may be judged to be significantly
underweight in light of failure to maintain their expected growth
trajectory. In summary, in determining

whether Criterion A is met, the clinician should consider available
numerical guidelines, as well as the individual's body build, weight
history, and any physiological disturbances. Individuals with this
disorder typically display an intense fear of gaining weight or of
becoming fat (Criterion B)28. This intense fear of becoming fat is
usually not alleviated by weight loss. In fact, concern about weight
gain may increase even as weight falls. Younger individuals with
anorexia nervosa, as well as some adults, may not recognize or
acknowledge a fear of weight gain4. In the absence of another
explanation for the significantly low weight, clinician inference drawn
from collateral history, observational data, physical and laboratory
findings, or longitudinal course either indicating a fear of weight gain
or supporting persistent behaviors that prevent it may be used to
establish Criterion B. The experience and significance of body weight
and shape are distorted in these individuals (Criterion C)3, 28. Some
individuals feel globally overweight. Others realize that they are thin
but are still concerned that certain body parts, particularly the
abdomen, buttocks, and thighs, are "too fat." They may employ a variety
of techniques to evaluate their body size or weight, including frequent
weighing, obsessive measuring of body parts, and persistent use of a
mirror to check for perceived areas of "fat." The selfesteem of
individuals with anorexia nervosa is highly dependent on their
perceptions of body shape and weight. Weight loss is often viewed as an
impressive achievement and a sign of extraordinary self-discipline,
whereas weight gain is perceived as an unacceptable failure of
self-control. Although some individuals with this disorder may
acknowledge being thin, they often do not recognize the serious medical
implications of their malnourished state. Often, the individual is
brought to professional attention by family members after marked weight
loss (or failure to make expected weight gains) has occurred. If
individuals seek help on their own, it is usually because of distress
over the somatic and psychological sequelae of starvation. It is rare
for an individual with anorexia nervosa to complain of weight loss per
se. In fact, individuals with anorexia nervosa frequently either lack
insight into or deny the problem. It is therefore often important to
obtain information from family members or other sources to evaluate the
history of weight loss and other features of the illness.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The semi-starvation of anorexia
nervosa, and the purging behaviors sometimes associated with it, can
result in significant and potentially lifethreatening medical
conditions. The nutritional compromise associated with this disorder
affects most major organ systems and can produce a variety of
disturbances. Physiological disturbances, including amenorrhea and vital
sign abnormalities, are common. While most of the physiological
disturbances associated with malnutrition are reversible with
nutritional rehabilitation, some, including loss of bone mineral
density, are often not completely reversible. Behaviors such as
self-induced vomiting and misuse of laxatives, diuretics, and enemas may
cause a number of disturbances that lead to abnormal laboratory
findings; however, some individuals with anorexia nervosa exhibit no
laboratory abnormalities17. When seriously underweight, many individuals
with anorexia nervosa have depressive signs and symptoms such as
depressed mood, social withdrawal, irritability, insomnia, and
diminished interest in sex3, 28. Because these features are also
observed in individuals without anorexia nervosa who are significantly
undernourished, many of the depressive features may be secondary to the
physiological sequelae of semistarvation12, although they may also be
sufficiently severe to warrant an additional diagnosis of major
depressive disorder. Obsessive-compulsive features, both related and
unrelated to food, are often prominent. Most individuals with anorexia
nervosa are preoccupied with thoughts of food. Some collect recipes or
hoard food. Observations of behaviors associated with other forms of
starvation suggest that obsessions and compulsions related to food may
be exacerbated by undernutrition. When individuals with anorexia nervosa
exhibit obsessions and compulsions that are not related to food, body
shape, or weight, an additional diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) may be warranted. Other features sometimes associated
with anorexia nervosa include concerns about eating in public, feelings
of ineffectiveness, a strong desire to control one's environment,
inflexible thinking, limited social spontaneity, and overly restrained
emotional expression. Compared with individuals with anorexia nervosa,
restricting type, those with binge-eating/purging

type have higher rates of impulsivity and are more likely to abuse
alcohol and other drugs28. A subgroup of individuals with anorexia
nervosa show excessive levels of physical activity13. Increases in
physical activity often precede onset of the disorder, and over the
course of the disorder increased activity accelerates weight loss.
During treatment, excessive activity may be difficult to control,
thereby jeopardizing weight recovery. Individuals with anorexia nervosa
may misuse medications, such as by manipulating dosage, in order to
achieve weight loss or avoid weight gain. Individuals with diabetes
mellitus may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to minimize
carbohydrate metabolism.

Prevalence The 12-month prevalence of anorexia nervosa among young
females is approximately 0.4%8. Less is known about prevalence among
males, but anorexia nervosa is far less common in males than in females,
with clinical populations generally reflecting approximately a 10:1
female-to-male ratio7, 9, 14.

Development and Course Anorexia nervosa commonly begins during
adolescence or young adulthood3. It rarely begins before puberty or
after age 40, but cases of both early and late onset have been
described. The onset of this disorder is often associated with a
stressful life event, such as leaving home for college. The course and
outcome of anorexia nervosa are highly variable. Younger individuals may
manifest atypical features, including denying "fear of fat." Older
individuals more likely have a longer duration of illness, and their
clinical presentation may include more signs and symptoms of
longstanding disorder. Clinicians should not exclude anorexia nervosa
from the differential diagnosis solely on the basis of older age. Many
individuals have a period of changed eating behavior prior to full
criteria for the disorder being met. Some individuals with anorexia
nervosa recover fully after a single episode, with some exhibiting a
fluctuating pattern of weight gain followed by relapse, and others
experiencing a chronic course over many years. Hospitalization may be
required to restore weight and to address medical complications. Most
individuals with

anorexia nervosa experience remission within 5 years of presentation.
Among individuals admitted to hospitals, overall remission rates may be
lower. The crude mortality rate (CMR) for anorexia nervosa is
approximately 5% per decade1, 22. Death most commonly results from
medical complications associated with the disorder itself or from
suicide1, 8.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Individuals who develop
anxiety disorders or display obsessional traits in childhood are at
increased risk of developing anorexia nervosa25. Environmental.
Historical and cross-cultural variability in the prevalence of anorexia
nervosa supports its association with cultures and settings in which
thinness is valued. Occupations and avocations that encourage thinness,
such as modeling and elite athletics, are also associated with increased
risk. Genetic and physiological. There is an increased risk of anorexia
nervosa and bulimia nervosa among first-degree biological relatives of
individuals with the disorder. An increased risk of bipolar and
depressive disorders has also been found among first-degree relatives of
individuals with anorexia nervosa, particularly relatives of individuals
with the binge-eating/purging type. Concordance rates for anorexia
nervosa in monozygotic twins are significantly higher than those for
dizygotic twins19. A range of brain abnormalities has been described in
anorexia nervosa using functional imaging technologies (functional
magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography). The degree to
which these findings reflect changes associated with malnutrition versus
primary abnormalities associated with the disorder is unclear24.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Anorexia nervosa occurs across
culturally and socially diverse populations, although available evidence
suggests cross-cultural variation in its occurrence and presentation10,
11. Anorexia nervosa is probably most prevalent in post-industrialized,
high-income countries such as in the United States, many European
countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, but its incidence in most
low- and middle-income countries is

uncertain. Whereas the prevalence of anorexia nervosa appears
comparatively low among Latinos, African Americans, and Asians in the
United States, clinicians should be aware that mental health service
utilization among individuals with an eating disorder is significantly
lower in these ethnic groups and that the low rates may reflect an
ascertainment bias15. The presentation of weight concerns among
individuals with eating and feeding disorders varies substantially
across cultural contexts. The absence of an expressed intense fear of
weight gain, sometimes referred to as "fat phobia," appears to be
relatively more common in populations in Asia, where the rationale for
dietary restriction is commonly related to a more culturally sanctioned
complaint such as gastrointestinal discomfort4. Within the United
States, presentations without a stated intense fear of weight gain may
be comparatively more common among Latino groups.

Diagnostic Markers The following laboratory abnormalities may be
observed in anorexia nervosa; their presence may serve to increase
diagnostic confidence. Hematology. Leukopenia is common, with the loss
of all cell types but usually with apparent lymphocytosis. Mild anemia
can occur, as well as thrombocytopenia and, rarely, bleeding problems.
Serum chemistry. Dehydration may be reflected by an elevated blood urea
nitrogen level. Hypercholesterolemia is common. Hepatic enzyme levels
may be elevated. Hypomagnesemia, hypozincemia, hypophosphatemia, and
hyperamylasemia are occasionally observed. Selfinduced vomiting may lead
to metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbonate), hypochloremia, and
hypokalemia; laxative abuse may cause a mild metabolic acidosis.
Endocrine. Serum thyroxine (T4) levels are usually in the low-normal
range; triiodothyronine (T3) levels are decreased, while reverse T3
levels are elevated. Females have low serum estrogen levels26, whereas
males have low levels of serum testosterone. Electrocardiography. Sinus
bradycardia is common, and, rarely, arrhythmias are noted. Significant
prolongation of the QTc interval is observed in some individuals17.

Bone mass. Low bone mineral density, with specific areas of osteopenia
or osteoporosis, is often seen. The risk of fracture is significantly
elevated16. Electroencephalography. Diffuse abnormalities, reflecting a
metabolic encephalopathy, may result from significant fluid and
electrolyte disturbances. Resting energy expenditure. resting energy
expenditure.

There is often a significant reduction in

Physical signs and symptoms. Many of the physical signs and symptoms of
anorexia nervosa are attributable to starvation. Amenorrhea is commonly
present and appears to be an indicator of physiological dysfunction. If
present, amenorrhea is usually a consequence of the weight loss, but in
a minority of individuals it may actually precede the weight loss. In
prepubertal females, menarche may be delayed2, 6, 18. In addition to
amenorrhea, there may be complaints of constipation, abdominal pain,
cold intolerance, lethargy, and excess energy. The most remarkable
finding on physical examination is emaciation. Commonly, there is also
significant hypotension, hypothermia, and bradycardia. Some individuals
develop lanugo, a fine downy body hair. Some develop peripheral edema,
especially during weight restoration or upon cessation of laxative and
diuretic abuse. Rarely, petechiae or ecchymoses, usually on the
extremities, may indicate a bleeding diathesis. Some individuals
evidence a yellowing of the skin associated with hypercarotenemia. As
may be seen in individuals with bulimia nervosa, individuals with
anorexia nervosa who self-induce vomiting may have hypertrophy of the
salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands, as well as dental
enamel erosion. Some individuals may have scars or calluses on the
dorsal surface of the hand from repeated contact with the teeth while
inducing vomiting17.

Suicide Risk Suicide risk is elevated in anorexia nervosa, with rates
reported as 12 per 100,000 per year20. Comprehensive evaluation of
individuals with anorexia nervosa should include assessment of
suicide-related ideation and behaviors

as well as other risk factors for suicide, including a history of
suicide attempt(s).

Functional Consequences of Anorexia Nervosa Individuals with anorexia
nervosa may exhibit a range of functional limitations associated with
the disorder. While some individuals remain active in social and
professional functioning, others demonstrate significant social
isolation and/or failure to fulfill academic or career potential.

Differential Diagnosis Other possible causes of either significantly low
body weight or significant weight loss should be considered in the
differential diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, especially when the
presenting features are atypical (e.g., onset after age 40 years)3.
Medical conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal disease, hyperthyroidism,
occult malignancies, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \[AIDS\]).
Serious weight loss may occur in medical conditions, but individuals
with these disorders usually do not also manifest a disturbance in the
way their body weight or shape is experienced or an intense fear of
weight gain or persist in behaviors that interfere with appropriate
weight gain. Acute weight loss associated with a medical condition can
occasionally be followed by the onset or recurrence of anorexia nervosa,
which can initially be masked by the comorbid medical condition. Rarely,
anorexia nervosa develops after bariatric surgery for obesity. Major
depressive disorder. In major depressive disorder, severe weight loss
may occur, but most individuals with major depressive disorder do not
have either a desire for excessive weight loss or an intense fear of
gaining weight. Schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia may
exhibit odd eating behavior and occasionally experience significant
weight loss, but they rarely show the fear of gaining weight and the
body image disturbance required for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.
Substance use disorders. Individuals with substance use disorders may
experience low weight due to poor nutritional intake but generally do
not fear gaining weight and do not manifest body image disturbance.

Individuals who abuse substances that reduce appetite (e.g., cocaine,
stimulants) and who also endorse fear of weight gain should be carefully
evaluated for the possibility of comorbid anorexia nervosa, given that
the substance use may represent a persistent behavior that interferes
with weight gain (Criterion B). Social anxiety disorder (social phobia),
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder. Some of the
features of anorexia nervosa overlap with the criteria for social
phobia, OCD, and body dysmorphic disorder. Specifically, individuals may
feel humiliated or embarrassed to be seen eating in public, as in social
phobia; may exhibit obsessions and compulsions related to food, as in
OCD; or may be preoccupied with an imagined defect in bodily appearance,
as in body dysmorphic disorder. If the individual with anorexia nervosa
has social fears that are limited to eating behavior alone, the
diagnosis of social phobia should not be made, but social fears
unrelated to eating behavior (e.g., excessive fear of speaking in
public) may warrant an additional diagnosis of social phobia. Similarly,
an additional diagnosis of OCD should be considered only if the
individual exhibits obsessions and compulsions unrelated to food (e.g.,
an excessive fear of contamination), and an additional diagnosis of body
dysmorphic disorder should be considered only if the distortion is
unrelated to body shape and size (e.g., preoccupation that one's nose is
too big). Bulimia nervosa. Individuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit
recurrent episodes of binge eating, engage in inappropriate behavior to
avoid weight gain (e.g., self-induced vomiting), and are overly
concerned with body shape and weight. However, unlike individuals with
anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type, individuals with bulimia
nervosa maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal level.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Individuals with this
disorder may exhibit significant weight loss or significant nutritional
deficiency, but they do not have a fear of gaining weight or of becoming
fat, nor do they have a disturbance in the way they experience their
body shape and weight.

Comorbidity Bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders commonly co-occur
with anorexia nervosa. Many individuals with anorexia nervosa report the
presence of either an anxiety disorder or symptoms prior to onset of
their

eating disorder. OCD is described in some individuals with anorexia
nervosa, especially those with the restricting type. Alcohol use
disorder and other substance use disorders may also be comorbid with
anorexia nervosa, especially among those with the binge-eating/purging
type.

Bulimia Nervosa Diagnostic Criteria

307.51 (F50.2)

a.  Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is
    characterized by both of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour
    period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most
    individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar
    circumstances.
2.  A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a
    feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one
    is eating).

<!-- -->

b.  Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent
    weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives,
    diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.

c. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur,
on average, at least once a week for 3 months. d. Self-evaluation is
unduly influenced by body shape and weight. e. The disturbance does not
occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa. Specify if: In
partial remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were
previously met, some, but not all, of the criteria have been met for a
sustained period of time. In full remission: After full criteria for
bulimia nervosa were previously met, none of the criteria have been met
for a sustained period of time. Specify current severity: The minimum
level of severity is based on the frequency of inappropriate
compensatory behaviors (see below). The level of severity may be
increased to reflect other symptoms and the degree of functional
disability. Mild: An average of 1--3 episodes of inappropriate
compensatory behaviors per week. Moderate: An average of 4--7 episodes
of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week. Severe: An average of
8--13 episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week.
Extreme: An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate compensatory
behaviors per week.

Diagnostic Features There are three essential features of bulimia
nervosa: recurrent episodes of binge eating (Criterion A), recurrent
inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain (Criterion
B), and self-evaluation that is unduly influenced by body shape and
weight (Criterion D). To qualify for the diagnosis, the binge eating and
inappropriate compensatory behaviors must occur, on average, at least
once per week for 3 months (Criterion C).

An "episode of binge eating" is defined as eating, in a discrete period
of time, an amount of food that is definitely larger than most
individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar
circumstances (Criterion A1). The context in which the eating occurs may
affect the clinician's estimation of whether the intake is excessive.
For example, a quantity of food that might be regarded as excessive for
a typical meal might be considered normal during a celebration or
holiday meal. A "discrete period of time" refers to a limited period,
usually less than 2 hours. A single episode of binge eating need not be
restricted to one setting. For example, an individual may begin a binge
in a restaurant and then continue to eat on returning home. Continual
snacking on small amounts of food throughout the day would not be
considered an eating binge. An occurrence of excessive food consumption
must be accompanied by a sense of lack of control (Criterion A2) to be
considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss of control
is the inability to refrain from eating or to stop eating once started.
Some individuals describe a dissociative quality during, or following,
the binge-eating episodes. The impairment in control associated with
binge eating may not be absolute; for example, an individual may
continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a
roommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room. Some individuals report
that their binge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute
feeling of loss of control but rather by a more generalized pattern of
uncontrolled eating. If individuals report that they have abandoned
efforts to control their eating, loss of control should be considered as
present. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances. The type of
food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a
given individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an
abnormality in the amount of food consumed than by a craving for a
specific nutrient. However, during binges, individuals tend to eat foods
they would otherwise avoid. Individuals with bulimia nervosa are
typically ashamed of their eating problems and attempt to conceal their
symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as inconspicuously
as possible. The binge eating often continues until the individual is
uncomfortably, or even painfully, full. The most common antecedent of
binge eating is negative affect. Other triggers include interpersonal
stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related to body weight,
body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may

minimize or mitigate factors that precipitated the episode in the
short-term, but negative self-evaluation and dysphoria often are the
delayed consequences. Another essential feature of bulimia nervosa is
the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent
weight gain, collectively referred to as purge behaviors or purging
(Criterion B). Many individuals with bulimia nervosa employ several
methods to compensate for binge eating. Vomiting is the most common
inappropriate compensatory behavior. The immediate effects of vomiting
include relief from physical discomfort and reduction of fear of gaining
weight. In some cases, vomiting becomes a goal in itself, and the
individual will binge eat in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a
small amount of food. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may use a variety
of methods to induce vomiting, including the use of fingers or
instruments to stimulate the gag reflex. Individuals generally become
adept at inducing vomiting and are eventually able to vomit at will.
Rarely, individuals consume syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. Other
purging behaviors include the misuse of laxatives and diuretics12. A
number of other compensatory methods may also be used in rare cases.
Individuals with bulimia nervosa may misuse enemas following episodes of
binge eating, but this is seldom the sole compensatory method employed.
Individuals with this disorder may take thyroid hormone in an attempt to
avoid weight gain. Individuals with diabetes mellitus and bulimia
nervosa may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to reduce the
metabolism of food consumed during eating binges. Individuals with
bulimia nervosa may fast for a day or more or exercise excessively in an
attempt to prevent weight gain. Exercise may be considered excessive
when it significantly interferes with important activities, when it
occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings, or when the
individual continues to exercise despite injury or other medical
complications. Individuals with bulimia nervosa place an excessive
emphasis on body shape or weight in their self-evaluation, and these
factors are typically extremely important in determining self-esteem
(Criterion D). Individuals with this disorder may closely resemble those
with anorexia nervosa in their fear of gaining weight, in their desire
to lose weight, and in the level of dissatisfaction with their bodies.
However, a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should not be given when the
disturbance occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa (Criterion
E).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with bulimia
nervosa typically are within the normal weight or overweight range (body
mass index \[BMI\] ≥ 18.5 and \< 30 in adults). The disorder occurs but
is uncommon among obese individuals. Between eating binges, individuals
with bulimia nervosa typically restrict their total caloric consumption
and preferentially select low-calorie ("diet") foods while avoiding
foods that they perceive to be fattening or likely to trigger a binge.
Menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea often occurs among females with
bulimia nervosa; it is uncertain whether such disturbances are related
to weight fluctuations, to nutritional deficiencies, or to emotional
distress. The fluid and electrolyte disturbances resulting from the
purging behavior are sometimes sufficiently severe to constitute
medically serious problems. Rare but potentially fatal complications
include esophageal tears, gastric rupture, and cardiac arrhythmias.
Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported among
individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce
vomiting. Individuals who chronically abuse laxatives may become
dependent on their use to stimulate bowel movements. Gastrointestinal
symptoms are commonly associated with bulimia nervosa, and rectal
prolapse has also been reported among individuals with this disorder12.

Prevalence Twelve-month prevalence of bulimia nervosa among young
females is 1%-- 1.5%5, 13. Point prevalence is highest among young
adults since the disorder peaks in older adolescence and young
adulthood. Less is known about the point prevalence of bulimia nervosa
in males, but bulimia nervosa is far less common in males than it is in
females, with an approximately 10:1 female-to-male ratio10, 11, 18.

Development and Course Bulimia nervosa commonly begins in adolescence or
young adulthood6, 7, 17. Onset before puberty or after age 40 is
uncommon. The binge eating frequently begins during or after an episode
of dieting to lose weight. Experiencing multiple stressful life events
also can precipitate onset of bulimia nervosa.

Disturbed eating behavior persists for at least several years in a high
percentage of clinic samples. The course may be chronic or intermittent,
with periods of remission alternating with recurrences of binge eating.
However, over longer-term follow-up, the symptoms of many individuals
appear to diminish with or without treatment, although treatment clearly
impacts outcome. Periods of remission longer than 1 year are associated
with better long-term outcome. Significantly elevated risk for mortality
(all-cause and suicide) has been reported for individuals with bulimia
nervosa9, 14, 19. The CMR (crude mortality rate) for bulimia nervosa is
nearly 2% per decade1, 13. Diagnostic cross-over from initial bulimia
nervosa to anorexia nervosa occurs in a minority of cases (10%--15%).
Individuals who do experience cross-over to anorexia nervosa commonly
will revert back to bulimia nervosa or have multiple occurrences of
cross-overs between these disorders. A subset of individuals with
bulimia nervosa continue to binge eat but no longer engage in
inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and therefore their symptoms meet
criteria for binge-eating disorder or other specified eating disorder.
Diagnosis should be based on the current (i.e., past 3 months) clinical
presentation.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Weight concerns, low
self-esteem, depressive symptoms, social anxiety disorder, and
overanxious disorder of childhood are associated with increased risk for
the development of bulimia nervosa. Environmental. Internalization of a
thin body ideal has been found to increase risk for developing weight
concerns, which in turn increase risk for the development of bulimia
nervosa. Individuals who experienced childhood sexual or physical abuse
are at increased risk for developing bulimia nervosa. Genetic and
physiological. Childhood obesity and early pubertal maturation increase
risk for bulimia nervosa. Familial transmission of bulimia nervosa may
be present, as well as genetic vulnerabilities for the disorder8, 16.

Course modifiers

Severity of psychiatric comorbidity predicts worse long-term outcome of
bulimia nervosa9.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Bulimia nervosa has been reported to
occur with roughly similar frequencies in most industrialized countries,
including the United States, Canada, many European countries, Australia,
Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. In clinical studies of bulimia
nervosa in the United States, individuals presenting with this disorder
are primarily white. However, the disorder also occurs in other ethnic
groups and with prevalence comparable to estimated prevalences observed
in white samples11.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Bulimia nervosa is far more common in
females than in males. Males are especially underrepresented in
treatment-seeking samples, for reasons that have not yet been
systematically examined15.

Diagnostic Markers No specific diagnostic test for bulimia nervosa
currently exists15. However, several laboratory abnormalities may occur
as a consequence of purging and may increase diagnostic certainty. These
include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia (which
can provoke cardiac arrhythmias), hypochloremia, and hyponatremia. The
loss of gastric acid through vomiting may produce a metabolic alkalosis
(elevated serum bicarbonate), and the frequent induction of diarrhea or
dehydration through laxative and diuretic abuse can cause metabolic
acidosis. Some individuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit mildly elevated
levels of serum amylase, probably reflecting an increase in the salivary
isoenzyme. Physical examination usually yields no physical findings.
However, inspection of the mouth may reveal significant and permanent
loss of dental enamel, especially from lingual surfaces of the front
teeth due to recurrent vomiting. These teeth may become chipped and
appear ragged and "motheaten." There may also be an increased frequency
of dental caries. In some individuals, the salivary glands, particularly
the parotid glands, may become notably enlarged. Individuals who induce
vomiting by manually stimulating the gag reflex may develop calluses or
scars on the dorsal

surface of the hand from repeated contact with the teeth. Serious
cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported among individuals
following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting.

Suicide Risk Suicide risk is elevated in bulimia nervosa. Comprehensive
evaluation of individuals with this disorder should include assessment
of suicide-related ideation and behaviors as well as other risk factors
for suicide, including a history of suicide attempts2, 3.

Functional Consequences of Bulimia Nervosa Individuals with bulimia
nervosa may exhibit a range of functional limitations associated with
the disorder. A minority of individuals report severe role impairment,
with the social-life domain most likely to be adversely affected by
bulimia nervosa.

Differential Diagnosis Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type.
Individuals whose bingeeating behavior occurs only during episodes of
anorexia nervosa are given the diagnosis anorexia nervosa,
binge-eating/purging type, and should not be given the additional
diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. For individuals with an initial diagnosis
of anorexia nervosa who binge and purge but whose presentation no longer
meets the full criteria for anorexia nervosa, bingeeating/purging type
(e.g., when weight is normal), a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should be
given only when all criteria for bulimia nervosa have been met for at
least 3 months. Binge-eating disorder. Some individuals binge eat but do
not engage in regular inappropriate compensatory behaviors. In these
cases, the diagnosis of binge-eating disorder should be considered.
Kleine-Levin syndrome. In certain neurological or other medical
conditions, such as Kleine-Levin syndrome, there is disturbed eating
behavior, but the characteristic psychological features of bulimia
nervosa, such as overconcern with body shape and weight, are not
present. Major depressive disorder, with atypical features. Overeating
is common in major depressive disorder, with atypical features, but

individuals with this disorder do not engage in inappropriate
compensatory behaviors and do not exhibit the excessive concern with
body shape and weight characteristic of bulimia nervosa. If criteria for
both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given. Borderline
personality disorder. Binge-eating behavior is included in the impulsive
behavior criterion that is part of the definition of borderline
personality disorder. If the criteria for both borderline personality
disorder and bulimia nervosa are met, both diagnoses should be given.

Comorbidity Comorbidity with mental disorders is common in individuals
with bulimia nervosa, with most experiencing at least one other mental
disorder and many experiencing multiple comorbidities. Comorbidity is
not limited to any particular subset but rather occurs across a wide
range of mental disorders. There is an increased frequency of depressive
symptoms (e.g., low self-esteem) and bipolar and depressive disorders
(particularly depressive disorders) in individuals with bulimia nervosa.
In many individuals, the mood disturbance begins at the same time as or
following the development of bulimia nervosa, and individuals often
ascribe their mood disturbances to the bulimia nervosa. However, in some
individuals, the mood disturbance clearly precedes the development of
bulimia nervosa. There may also be an increased frequency of anxiety
symptoms (e.g., fear of social situations) or anxiety disorders. These
mood and anxiety disturbances frequently remit following effective
treatment of the bulimia nervosa. The lifetime prevalence of substance
use, particularly alcohol or stimulant use, is at least 30% among
individuals with bulimia nervosa. Stimulant use often begins in an
attempt to control appetite and weight. A substantial percentage of
individuals with bulimia nervosa also have personality features that
meet criteria for one or more personality disorders, most frequently
borderline personality disorder4, 11, 18, 20.

Binge-Eating Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

307.51 (F50.8)

a.  Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is
    characterized by both of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour
    period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most
    people would eat in a similar period of time under similar
    circumstances.
2.  A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a
    feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much

one is eating). b. The binge-eating episodes are associated with three
(or more) of the following: 1. Eating much more rapidly than normal. 2.
Eating until feeling uncomfortably full. 3. Eating large amounts of food
when not feeling physically hungry. 4. Eating alone because of feeling
embarrassed by how much one is eating. 5. Feeling disgusted with
oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward. c. Marked distress
regarding binge eating is present. d. The binge eating occurs, on
average, at least once a week for 3 months. e. The binge eating is not
associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behavior
as in bulimia nervosa and does not occur exclusively during the course
of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa. Specify if: In partial
remission: After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously
met, binge eating occurs at an average frequency of less than one
episode per week for a sustained period of time. In full remission:
After full criteria for binge-eating disorder were previously met, none
of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time. Specify
current severity: The minimum level of severity is based on the
frequency of episodes of binge eating (see below). The level of severity
may be increased to reflect other symptoms and the degree of functional
disability. Mild: 1--3 binge-eating episodes per week. Moderate: 4--7
binge-eating episodes per week. Severe: 8--13 binge-eating episodes per
week.

Extreme: 14 or more binge-eating episodes per week.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of binge-eating disorder is
recurrent episodes of binge eating that must occur, on average, at least
once per week for 3 months (Criterion D). An "episode of binge eating"
is defined as eating, in a discrete period of time, an amount of food
that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period
of time under similar circumstances (Criterion A1). The context in which
the eating occurs may affect the clinician's estimation of whether the
intake is excessive. For example, a quantity of food that might be
regarded as excessive for a typical meal might be considered normal
during a celebration or holiday meal. A "discrete period of time" refers
to a limited period, usually less than 2 hours. A single episode of
binge eating need not be restricted to one setting. For example, an
individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and then continue to eat on
returning home. Continual snacking on small amounts of food throughout
the day would not be considered an eating binge. An occurrence of
excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a sense of lack of
control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An
indicator of loss of control is the inability to refrain from eating or
to stop eating once started. Some individuals describe a dissociative
quality during, or following, the binge-eating episodes. The impairment
in control associated with binge eating may not be absolute; for
example, an individual may continue binge eating while the telephone is
ringing but will cease if a roommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the
room. Some individuals report that their binge-eating episodes are no
longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but rather
by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled eating. If individuals
report that they have abandoned efforts to control their eating, loss of
control may still be considered as present. Binge eating can also be
planned in some instances. The type of food consumed during binges
varies both across individuals and for a given individual. Binge eating
appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the amount of food
consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient. Binge eating must be
characterized by marked distress (Criterion C) and at least three of the
following features: eating much more rapidly than

normal; eating until feeling uncomfortably full; eating large amounts of
food when not feeling physically hungry; eating alone because of feeling
embarrassed by how much one is eating; and feeling disgusted with
oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward (Criterion B). Individuals
with binge-eating disorder are typically ashamed of their eating
problems and attempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually
occurs in secrecy or as inconspicuously as possible. The most common
antecedent of binge eating is negative affect. Other triggers include
interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related to
body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may
minimize or mitigate factors that precipitated the episode in the
short-term, but negative self-evaluation and dysphoria often are the
delayed consequences.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Binge-eating disorder occurs in
normal-weight/overweight and obese individuals8. It is reliably
associated with overweight and obesity in treatment-seeking individuals.
Nevertheless, binge-eating disorder is distinct from obesity. Most obese
individuals do not engage in recurrent binge eating. In addition,
compared with weight-matched obese individuals without binge-eating
disorder, those with the disorder consume more calories in laboratory
studies of eating behavior and have greater functional impairment, lower
quality of life, more subjective distress, and greater psychiatric
comorbidity13.

Prevalence Twelve-month prevalence of binge-eating disorder among U.S.
adult (age 18 or older) females and males is 1.6% and 0.8%,
respectively3. The gender ratio is far less skewed in binge-eating
disorder than in bulimia nervosa. Binge-eating disorder is as prevalent
among females from racial or ethnic minority groups as has been reported
for white females. The disorder is more prevalent among individuals
seeking weight-loss treatment than in the general population.

Development and Course

Little is known about the development of binge-eating disorder. Both
binge eating and loss-of-control eating without objectively excessive
consumption occur in children and are associated with increased body
fat, weight gain, and increases in psychological symptoms9. Binge eating
is common in adolescent and college-age samples. Loss-of-control eating
or episodic binge eating may represent a prodromal phase of eating
disorders for some individuals. Dieting follows the development of binge
eating in many individuals with binge-eating disorder. (This is in
contrast to bulimia nervosa, in which dysfunctional dieting usually
precedes the onset of binge eating.) Bingeeating disorder typically
begins in adolescence or young adulthood but can begin in later
adulthood. Individuals with binge-eating disorder who seek treatment
usually are older than individuals with either bulimia nervosa or
anorexia nervosa who seek treatment. Remission rates in both natural
course and treatment outcome studies are higher for binge-eating
disorder than for bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa. Binge-eating
disorder appears to be relatively persistent6, and the course is
comparable to that of bulimia nervosa in terms of severity and duration.
Crossover from binge-eating disorder to other eating disorders is
uncommon1.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Binge-eating
disorder appears to run in families, which may reflect additive genetic
influences.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Binge-eating disorder occurs with
roughly similar frequencies in most industrialized countries, including
the United States, Canada, many European countries, Australia, and New
Zealand7. In the United States, the prevalence of binge-eating disorder
appears comparable among non-Latino whites, Latinos, Asians, and African
Americans5.

Functional Disorder

Consequences

of

Binge-Eating

Binge-eating disorder is associated with a range of functional
consequences, including social role adjustment problems, impaired
healthrelated quality of life and life satisfaction, increased medical
morbidity and mortality, and associated increased health care
utilization compared with body mass index (BMI)--matched control
subjects4, 13. It may also be associated with an increased risk for
weight gain and the development of obesity2, 4, 8.

Differential Diagnosis Bulimia nervosa. Binge-eating disorder has
recurrent binge eating in common with bulimia nervosa but differs from
the latter disorder in some fundamental respects. In terms of clinical
presentation, the recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior (e.g.,
purging, driven exercise) seen in bulimia nervosa is absent in
binge-eating disorder. Unlike individuals with bulimia nervosa,
individuals with binge-eating disorder typically do not show marked or
sustained dietary restriction designed to influence body weight and
shape between binge-eating episodes. They may, however, report frequent
attempts at dieting. Binge-eating disorder also differs from bulimia
nervosa in terms of response to treatment. Rates of improvement are
consistently higher among individuals with binge-eating disorder than
among those with bulimia nervosa11. Obesity. Binge-eating disorder is
associated with overweight and obesity but has several key features that
are distinct from obesity. First, levels of overvaluation of body weight
and shape are higher in obese individuals with the disorder than in
those without the disorder. Second, rates of psychiatric comorbidity are
significantly higher among obese individuals with the disorder compared
with those without the disorder. Third, the longterm successful outcome
of evidence-based psychological treatments for binge-eating disorder can
be contrasted with the absence of effective longterm treatments for
obesity10, 12. Bipolar and depressive disorders. Increases in appetite
and weight gain are included in the criteria for major depressive
episode and in the atypical features specifiers for depressive and
bipolar disorders. Increased eating in the context of a major depressive
episode may or may not be associated with loss of control. If the full
criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given. Binge
eating and other symptoms of disordered

eating are seen in association with bipolar disorder. If the full
criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given.
Borderline personality disorder. Binge eating is included in the
impulsive behavior criterion that is part of the definition of
borderline personality disorder. If the full criteria for both disorders
are met, both diagnoses should be given.

Comorbidity Binge-eating disorder is associated with significant
psychiatric comorbidity that is comparable to that of bulimia nervosa
and anorexia nervosa. The most common comorbid disorders are bipolar
disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and, to a lesser
degree, substance use disorders. The psychiatric comorbidity is linked
to the severity of binge eating and not to the degree of obesity8, 13.

Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder 307.59 (F50.8) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a feeding
and eating disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class. The
other specified feeding or eating disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific
reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific
feeding and eating disorder. This is done by recording "other specified
feeding or eating disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g.,
"bulimia nervosa of low frequency"). Examples of presentations that can
be specified using the "other specified" designation include the
following:

1. Atypical anorexia nervosa: All of the criteria for anorexia nervosa
are met, except that despite significant weight loss, the individual's
weight is within or above the normal range. 2. Bulimia nervosa (of low
frequency and/or limited duration): All of the criteria for bulimia
nervosa are met, except that the binge eating and inappropriate
compensatory behaviors occur, on average, less than once a week and/or
for less than 3 months. 3. Binge-eating disorder (of low frequency
and/or limited duration): All of the criteria for binge-eating disorder
are met, except that the binge eating occurs, on average, less than once
a week and/or for less than 3 months. 4. Purging disorder: Recurrent
purging behavior to influence weight or shape (e.g., self-induced
vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications) in the
absence of binge eating. 5. Night eating syndrome: Recurrent episodes of
night eating, as manifested by eating after awakening from sleep or by
excessive food consumption after the evening meal. There is awareness
and recall of the eating. The night eating is not better explained by
external influences such as changes in the individual's sleep-wake cycle
or by local social norms. The night eating causes significant distress
and/or impairment in functioning. The disordered pattern of eating is
not better explained by binge-eating disorder or another mental
disorder, including substance use, and is not attributable to another
medical disorder or to an effect of medication.

Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder 307.50 (F50.9) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a feeding
and eating disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class. The
unspecified feeding or eating disorder category is used in situations in
which the clinician chooses

not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific
feeding and eating disorder, and includes presentations in which there
is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).

Elimination Disorders Elimination disorders all involve the
inappropriate elimination of urine or feces and are usually first
diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. This group of disorders includes
enuresis, the repeated voiding of urine into inappropriate places, and
encopresis, the repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places.
Subtypes are provided to differentiate nocturnal from diurnal (i.e.,
during waking hours) voiding for enuresis and the presence or absence of
constipation and overflow incontinence for encopresis. Although there
are minimum age requirements for diagnosis of both disorders, these are
based on developmental age and not solely on chronological age. Both
disorders may be voluntary or involuntary. Although these disorders
typically occur separately, co-occurrence may also be observed.

Enuresis Diagnostic Criteria

307.6 (F98.0)

a.  Repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes, whether involuntary
    or intentional.
b.  The behavior is clinically significant as manifested by either a
    frequency of at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months
    or the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment in
    social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of
    functioning.
c.  Chronological age is at least 5 years (or equivalent developmental
    level).
d.  The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
    substance (e.g., a diuretic, an antipsychotic medication) or another
    medical condition (e.g., diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure
    disorder). Specify whether: Nocturnal only: Passage of urine only
    during nighttime sleep.

Diurnal only: Passage of urine during waking hours. Nocturnal and
diurnal: A combination of the two subtypes above.

Subtypes The nocturnal-only subtype of enuresis, sometimes referred to
as monosymptomatic enuresis, is the most common subtype and involves
incontinence only during nighttime sleep, typically during the first
one-third of the night. The diurnal-only subtype occurs in the absence
of nocturnal enuresis and may be referred to simply as urinary
incontinence. Individuals with this subtype can be divided into two
groups. Individuals with "urge incontinence" have sudden urge symptoms
and detrusor instability, whereas individuals with "voiding
postponement" consciously defer micturition urges until incontinence
results. The nocturnal-and-diurnal subtype is also known as
nonmonosymptomatic enuresis.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of enuresis is repeated
voiding of urine during the day or at night into bed or clothes
(Criterion A). Most often the voiding is involuntary, but occasionally
it may be intentional. To qualify for a diagnosis of enuresis, the
voiding of urine must occur at least twice a week for at least 3
consecutive months or must cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas
of functioning (Criterion B). The individual must have reached an age at
which continence is expected (i.e., a chronological age of at least 5
years or, for children with developmental delays, a mental age of at
least 5 years) (Criterion C). The urinary incontinence is not
attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a
diuretic, an antipsychotic medication) or another medical condition
(e.g., diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure disorder) (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis During nocturnal enuresis,
occasionally the voiding takes place during rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep, and the child may recall a dream that involved the act of
urinating. During daytime (diurnal) enuresis, the child defers voiding
until incontinence occurs, sometimes because of a reluctance to use the
toilet as a result of social anxiety or a preoccupation with school or
play

activity. The enuretic event most commonly occurs in the early afternoon
on school days and may be associated with symptoms of disruptive
behavior. The enuresis commonly persists after appropriate treatment of
an associated infection.

Prevalence The prevalence of enuresis is 5%--10% among 5-year-olds,
3%--5% among 10-year-olds, and around 1% among individuals 15 years or
older.

Development and Course Two types of course of enuresis have been
described: a "primary" type, in which the individual has never
established urinary continence, and a "secondary" type, in which the
disturbance develops after a period of established urinary continence.
There are no differences in prevalence of comorbid mental disorders
between the two types. By definition, primary enuresis begins at age 5
years. The most common time for the onset of secondary enuresis is
between ages 5 and 8 years, but it may occur at any time. After age 5
years, the rate of spontaneous remission is 5%--10% per year. Most
children with the disorder become continent by adolescence, but in
approximately 1% of cases the disorder continues into adulthood. Diurnal
enuresis is uncommon after age 9 years. While occasional diurnal
incontinence is not uncommon in middle childhood, it is substantially
more common in those who also have persistent nocturnal enuresis. When
enuresis persists into late childhood or adolescence, the frequency of
incontinence may increase, whereas continence in early childhood is
usually associated with a declining frequency of wet nights.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. A number of predisposing
factors for enuresis have been suggested, including delayed or lax
toilet training and psychosocial stress. Genetic and physiological.
Enuresis has been associated with delays in the development of normal
circadian rhythms of urine production, with resulting nocturnal polyuria
or abnormalities of central vasopressin receptor sensitivity, and
reduced functional bladder capacities with bladder hyperreactivity
(unstable bladder syndrome). Nocturnal enuresis is a genetically
heterogeneous disorder. Heritability has been shown in family,

twin, and segregation analyses1. Risk for childhood nocturnal enuresis
is approximately 3.6 times higher in offspring of enuretic mothers and
10.1 times higher in the presence of paternal urinary incontinence. The
risk magnitudes for nocturnal enuresis and diurnal incontinence are
similar.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Enuresis has been reported in a
variety of European, African, and Asian countries as well as in the
United States. At a national level, prevalence rates are remarkably
similar, and there is great similarity in the developmental trajectories
found in different countries. There are very high rates of enuresis in
orphanages and other residential institutions, likely related to the
mode and environment in which toilet training occurs.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Nocturnal enuresis is more common in
males. Diurnal incontinence is more common in females. The relative risk
of having a child who develops enuresis is greater for previously
enuretic fathers than for previously enuretic mothers.

Functional Consequences of Enuresis The amount of impairment associated
with enuresis is a function of the limitation on the child's social
activities (e.g., ineligibility for sleep-away camp) or its effect on
the child's self-esteem, the degree of social ostracism by peers, and
the anger, punishment, and rejection on the part of caregivers.

Differential Diagnosis Neurogenic bladder or another medical condition.
The diagnosis of enuresis is not made in the presence of a neurogenic
bladder or another medical condition that causes polyuria or urgency
(e.g., untreated diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus) or during an
acute urinary tract infection. However, a diagnosis is compatible with
such conditions if urinary incontinence was regularly present prior to
the development of another medical condition or if it persists after the
institution of appropriate treatment of the medical condition.
Medication side effects. Enuresis may occur during treatment with
antipsychotic medications, diuretics, or other medications that may
induce

incontinence. In this case, the diagnosis should not be made in
isolation but may be noted as a medication side effect. However, a
diagnosis of enuresis may be made if urinary incontinence was regularly
present prior to treatment with the medication.

Comorbidity Although most children with enuresis do not have a comorbid
mental disorder, the prevalence of comorbid behavioral symptoms is
higher in children with enuresis than in children without enuresis.
Developmental delays, including speech, language, learning, and motor
skills delays, are also present in a portion of children with enuresis.
Encopresis, sleepwalking, and sleep terror disorder may be present.
Urinary tract infections are more common in children with enuresis,
especially the diurnal subtype, than in those who are continent.

Encopresis Diagnostic Criteria

307.7 (F98.1)

a.  Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., clothing,
    floor), whether involuntary or intentional.
b.  At least one such event occurs each month for at least 3 months.
c.  Chronological age is at least 4 years (or equivalent developmental
    level).
d.  The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
    substance (e.g., laxatives) or another medical condition except
    through a mechanism involving constipation. Specify whether: With
    constipation and overflow incontinence: There is evidence of
    constipation on physical examination or by history.

Without constipation and overflow incontinence: There is no evidence of
constipation on physical examination or by history.

Subtypes Feces in the with constipation and overflow incontinence
subtype are characteristically (but not invariably) poorly formed, and
leakage can be infrequent to continuous, occurring mostly during the day
and rarely during sleep. Only part of the feces is passed during
toileting, and the incontinence resolves after treatment of the
constipation. In the without constipation and overflow incontinence
subtype, feces are likely to be of normal form and consistency, and
soiling is intermittent. Feces may be deposited in a prominent location.
This is usually associated with the presence of oppositional defiant
disorder or conduct disorder or may be the consequence of anal
masturbation. Soiling without constipation appears to be less common
than soiling with constipation.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of encopresis is repeated
passage of feces into inappropriate places (e.g., clothing or floor)
(Criterion A). Most often the passage is involuntary but occasionally
may be intentional. The event must occur at least once a month for at
least 3 months (Criterion B), and the chronological age of the child
must be at least 4 years (or for children with developmental delays, the
mental age must be at least 4 years) (Criterion C). The fecal
incontinence must not be exclusively attributable to the physiological
effects of a substance (e.g., laxatives) or another medical condition
except through a mechanism involving constipation (Criterion D). When
the passage of feces is involuntary rather than intentional, it is often
related to constipation, impaction, and retention with subsequent
overflow. The constipation may develop for psychological reasons (e.g.,
anxiety about defecating in a particular place, a more general pattern
of anxious or oppositional behavior), leading to avoidance of
defecation. Physiological predispositions to constipation include
ineffectual straining or paradoxical defecation dynamics, with
contraction rather than relaxation of the external sphincter or pelvic
floor during straining for defecation. Dehydration associated with a
febrile illness, hypothyroidism, or a medication side effect can also
induce constipation. Once constipation has

developed, it may be complicated by an anal fissure, painful defecation,
and further fecal retention. The consistency of the stool may vary. In
some individuals the stool may be of normal or near-normal consistency.
In other individuals---such as those with overflow incontinence
secondary to fecal retention---it may be liquid.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The child with encopresis often
feels ashamed and may wish to avoid situations (e.g., camp, school) that
might lead to embarrassment. The amount of impairment is a function of
the effect on the child's self-esteem, the degree of social ostracism by
peers, and the anger, punishment, and rejection on the part of
caregivers. Smearing feces may be deliberate or accidental, resulting
from the child's attempt to clean or hide feces that were passed
involuntarily. When the incontinence is clearly deliberate, features of
oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder may also be present.
Many children with encopresis and chronic constipation also have
enuresis symptoms and may have associated urinary reflux in the bladder
or ureters that may lead to chronic urinary infections, the symptoms of
which may remit with treatment of the constipation.

Prevalence It is estimated that approximately 1% of 5-year-olds have
encopresis, and the disorder is more common in males than in females.

Development and Course Encopresis is not diagnosed until a child has
reached a chronological age of at least 4 years (or for children with
developmental delays, a mental age of at least 4 years). Inadequate,
inconsistent toilet training and psychosocial stress (e.g., entering
school, the birth of a sibling) may be predisposing factors. Two types
of course have been described: a "primary" type, in which the individual
has never established fecal continence, and a "secondary" type, in which
the disturbance develops after a period of established fecal continence.
Encopresis can persist, with intermittent exacerbations, for years.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological. Painful defecation can lead to constipation
and a cycle of withholding behaviors that make encopresis more likely1.
Use of some medications (e.g., anticonvulsants, cough suppressants) may
increase constipation and make encopresis more likely1.

Diagnostic Markers In addition to physical examination, gastrointestinal
imaging (e.g., abdominal radiograph) may be informative to assess
retained stool and gas in the colon. Additional tests, such as barium
enema and anorectal manography, may be used to help exclude other
medical conditions, such as Hirschsprung's disease.

Differential Diagnosis A diagnosis of encopresis in the presence of
another medical condition is appropriate only if the mechanism involves
constipation that cannot be explained by other medical conditions. Fecal
incontinence related to other medical conditions (e.g., chronic
diarrhea, spina bifida, anal stenosis) would not warrant a DSM-5
diagnosis of encopresis.

Comorbidity Urinary tract infections can be comorbid with encopresis and
are more common in females1.

Other Specified Elimination Disorder

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an elimination disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified elimination

disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses
to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet
the criteria for any specific elimination disorder. This is done by
recording "other specified elimination disorder" followed by the
specific reason (e.g., "low-frequency enuresis"). Coding note: Code
788.39 (N39.498) for other specified elimination disorder with urinary
symptoms; 787.60 (R15.9) for other specified elimination disorder with
fecal symptoms.

Unspecified Elimination Disorder

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of an elimination disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
elimination disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not
met for a specific elimination disorder, and includes presentations in
which there is insufficient information to make a more specific
diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings). Coding note: Code 788.30
(R32) for unspecified elimination disorder with urinary symptoms; 787.60
(R15.9) for unspecified elimination disorder with fecal symptoms.

Sleep-Wake Disorders The DSM-5 classification of sleep-wake disorders is
intended for use by general mental health and medical clinicians (those
caring for adult, geriatric, and pediatric patients). Sleep-wake
disorders encompass 10 disorders or disorder groups: insomnia disorder,
hypersomnolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders,
circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, non--rapid eye movement (NREM)
sleep arousal disorders, nightmare disorder, rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and
substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Individuals with these
disorders typically present with sleep-wake complaints of
dissatisfaction regarding the quality, timing, and amount of sleep.
Resulting daytime distress and impairment are core features shared by
all of these sleep-wake disorders. The organization of this chapter is
designed to facilitate differential diagnosis of sleep-wake complaints
and to clarify when referral to a sleep specialist is appropriate for
further assessment and treatment planning. The DSM-5 sleep disorders
nosology uses a simple, clinically useful approach, while also
reflecting scientific advances in epidemiology, genetics,
pathophysiology, assessment, and interventions research since DSM-IV. In
some cases (e.g., insomnia disorder), a "lumping" approach has been
adopted, whereas in others (e.g., narcolepsy), a "splitting" approach
has been taken, reflecting the availability of validators derived from
epidemiological, neurobiological, and interventions research. Sleep
disorders are often accompanied by depression, anxiety, and cognitive
changes that must be addressed in treatment planning and management.
Furthermore, persistent sleep disturbances (both insomnia and excessive
sleepiness) are established risk factors for the subsequent development
of mental illnesses and substance use disorders. They may also represent
a prodromal expression of an episode of mental illness, allowing the
possibility of early intervention to preempt or to attenuate a
full-blown episode.

The differential diagnosis of sleep-wake complaints necessitates a
multidimensional approach, with consideration of possibly coexisting
medical and neurological conditions. Coexisting clinical conditions are
the rule, not the exception. Sleep disturbances furnish a clinically
useful indicator of medical and neurological conditions that often
coexist with depression and other common mental disorders. Prominent
among these comorbidities are breathing-related sleep disorders,
disorders of the heart and lungs (e.g., congestive heart failure,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), neurodegenerative disorders
(e.g., Alzheimer's disease), and disorders of the musculoskeletal system
(e.g., osteoarthritis). These disorders not only may disturb sleep but
also may themselves be worsened during sleep (e.g., prolonged apneas or
electrocardiographic arrhythmias during REM sleep; confusional arousals
in patients with dementing illness; seizures in persons with complex
partial seizures). REM sleep behavior disorder is often an early
indicator of neurodegenerative disorders (alpha synucleinopathies) like
Parkinson's disease. For all of these reasons--- related to differential
diagnosis, clinical comorbidity, and facilitation of treatment
planning---sleep disorders are included in DSM-5. The approach taken to
the classification of sleep-wake disorders in DSM5 can be understood
within the context of "lumping versus splitting." DSMIV represented an
effort to simplify sleep-wake disorders classification and thus
aggregated diagnoses under broader, less differentiated labels. At the
other pole, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd
Edition (ICSD-2) elaborated numerous diagnostic subtypes. DSM-IV was
prepared for use by mental health and general medical clinicians who are
not experts in sleep medicine. ICSD-2 reflected the science and opinions
of the sleep specialist community and was prepared for use by
specialists. The weight of available evidence supports the superior
performance characteristics (interrater reliability, as well as
convergent, discriminant, and face validity) of simpler,
less-differentiated approaches to diagnosis of sleep-wake disorders. The
text accompanying each set of diagnostic criteria provides linkages to
the corresponding disorders included in ICSD-2. The DSM-5 sleep-wake
disorders classification also specifies corresponding nonpsychiatric
listings (e.g., neurology codes) from the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD). The field of sleep disorders medicine has progressed
in this direction since the publication of DSM-IV. The use of biological
validators is now

embodied in the DSM-5 classification of sleep-wake disorders,
particularly for disorders of excessive sleepiness, such as narcolepsy;
for breathingrelated sleep disorders, for which formal sleep studies
(i.e., polysomnography) are indicated; and for restless legs syndrome,
which can often coexist with periodic limb movements during sleep,
detectable via polysomnography.

Insomnia Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

307.42 (F51.01)

a.  A predominant complaint of dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or
    quality, associated with one (or more) of the following symptoms:

<!-- -->

1.  Difficulty initiating sleep. (In children, this may manifest as
    difficulty initiating sleep without caregiver intervention.)
2.  Difficulty maintaining sleep, characterized by frequent awakenings
    or problems returning to sleep after awakenings. (In children, this
    may manifest as difficulty returning to sleep without caregiver
    intervention.)
3.  Early-morning awakening with inability to return to sleep.

<!-- -->

b.  The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or
    impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic,
    behavioral, or other important areas of functioning.
c.  The sleep difficulty occurs at least 3 nights per week.
d.  The sleep difficulty is present for at least 3 months.
e.  The sleep difficulty occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep.
f.  The insomnia is not better explained by and does not occur
    exclusively during the course of another sleep-wake disorder (e.g.,
    narcolepsy, a breathing-related sleep disorder, a circadian rhythm
    sleep-wake disorder, a parasomnia).
g.  The insomnia is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
    substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).
h.  Coexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately
    explain the predominant complaint of insomnia.

Specify if: With non--sleep disorder mental comorbidity, including
substance use disorders With other medical comorbidity With other sleep
disorder Coding note: The code 307.42 (F51.01) applies to all three
specifiers. Code also the relevant associated mental disorder, medical
condition, or other sleep disorder immediately after the code for
insomnia disorder in order to indicate the association. Specify if:
Episodic: Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.
Persistent: Symptoms last 3 months or longer. Recurrent: Two (or more)
episodes within the space of 1 year. Note: Acute and short-term insomnia
(i.e., symptoms lasting less than 3 months but otherwise meeting all
criteria with regard to frequency, intensity, distress, and/or
impairment) should be coded as an other specified insomnia disorder.
Note. The diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given whether it occurs as
an independent condition or is comorbid with another mental disorder
(e.g., major depressive disorder), medical condition (e.g., pain), or
another sleep disorder (e.g., a breathing-related sleep disorder). For
instance, insomnia may develop its own course with some anxiety and
depressive features but in the absence of criteria being met for any one
mental disorder. Insomnia may also manifest as a clinical feature of a
more predominant mental disorder. Persistent insomnia may even be a risk
factor for depression2 and is a common residual symptom after treatment
for this condition. With comorbid insomnia and a mental disorder,
treatment may also need to target both conditions. Given these different
courses, it is often impossible to establish the precise nature of the
relationship between these clinical entities, and this relationship may
change over time. Therefore, in the presence of insomnia and a comorbid
disorder, it is not necessary to make a causal attribution between the
two conditions. Rather, the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is made with
concurrent specification of the clinically comorbid conditions. A
concurrent insomnia diagnosis should only be

considered when the insomnia is sufficiently severe to warrant
independent clinical attention; otherwise, no separate diagnosis is
necessary.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of insomnia disorder is
dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality with complaints of
difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. The sleep complaints are
accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The sleep
disturbance may occur during the course of another mental disorder or
medical condition, or it may occur independently. Different
manifestations of insomnia can occur at different times of the sleep
period. Sleep-onset insomnia (or initial insomnia) involves difficulty
initiating sleep at bedtime. Sleep maintenance insomnia (or middle
insomnia) involves frequent or prolonged awakenings throughout the
night. Late insomnia involves early-morning awakening with an inability
to return to sleep. Difficulty maintaining sleep is the most common
single symptom of insomnia, followed by difficulty falling asleep, while
a combination of these symptoms is the most common presentation
overall15, 19, 24. The specific type of sleep complaint often varies
over time. Individuals who complain of difficulty falling asleep at one
time may later complain of difficulty maintaining sleep, and vice versa.
Symptoms of difficulty falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep
can be quantified by the individual's retrospective self-report, sleep
diaries, or other methods, such as actigraphy or polysomnography, but
the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is based on the individual's
subjective perception of sleep or a caretaker's report. Nonrestorative
sleep, a complaint of poor sleep quality that does not leave the
individual rested upon awakening despite adequate duration, is a common
sleep complaint usually occurring in association with difficulty
initiating or maintaining sleep, or less frequently in isolation. This
complaint can also be reported in association with other sleep disorders
(e.g., breathing-related sleep disorder). When a complaint of
nonrestorative sleep occurs in isolation (i.e., in the absence of
difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep) but all diagnostic
criteria with regard to frequency, duration, and daytime distress and
impairments are otherwise met, a diagnosis of other specified insomnia
disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is made.

Aside from the frequency and duration criteria required to make the
diagnosis, additional criteria are useful to quantify insomnia
severity20, 21. These quantitative criteria, while arbitrary, are
provided for illustrative purpose only. For instance, difficulty
initiating sleep is defined by a subjective sleep latency greater than
20--30 minutes, and difficulty maintaining sleep is defined by a
subjective time awake after sleep onset greater than 20--30 minutes13,
14. Although there is no standard definition of early-morning awakening,
this symptom involves awakening at least 30 minutes before the scheduled
time and before total sleep time reaches 6½ hours. It is essential to
take into account not only the final awakening time but also the bedtime
on the previous evening. Awakening at 4:00 A.M. does not have the same
clinical significance in those who go to bed at 9:00 P.M. as in those
who go to bed at 11:00 P.M. Such a symptom may also reflect an
age-dependent decrease in the ability to sustain sleep or an
age-dependent shift in the timing of the main sleep period. Insomnia
disorder involves daytime impairments as well as nighttime sleep
difficulties. These include fatigue or, less commonly, daytime
sleepiness; the latter is more common among older individuals and when
insomnia is comorbid with another medical condition (e.g., chronic pain)
or sleep disorder (e.g., sleep apnea). Impairment in cognitive
performance may include difficulties with attention, concentration and
memory, and even with performing simple manual skills. Associated mood
disturbances are typically described as irritability or mood lability
and less commonly as depressive or anxiety symptoms6. Not all
individuals with nighttime sleep disturbances are distressed or have
functional impairment. For example, sleep continuity is often
interrupted in healthy older adults who nevertheless identify themselves
as good sleepers. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder should be reserved
for those individuals with significant daytime distress or impairment
related to their nighttime sleep difficulties.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Insomnia is often associated
with physiological and cognitive arousal and conditioning factors that
interfere with sleep. A preoccupation with sleep and distress due to the
inability to sleep may lead to a vicious cycle: the more the individual
strives to sleep, the more frustration builds and further impairs sleep.
Thus, excessive attention and efforts to sleep, which override normal
sleep-onset mechanisms, may contribute to the development of

insomnia10. Individuals with persistent insomnia may also acquire
maladaptive sleep habits (e.g., spending excessive time in bed;
following an erratic sleep schedule; napping) and cognitions (e.g., fear
of sleeplessness; apprehensions of daytime impairments; clock
monitoring) during the course of the disorder. Engaging in such
activities in an environment in which the individual has frequently
spent sleepless nights may further compound the conditioned arousal and
perpetuate sleep difficulties. Conversely, the individual may fall
asleep more easily when not trying to do so. Some individuals also
report better sleep when away from their own bedrooms and their usual
routines. Insomnia may be accompanied by a variety of daytime complaints
and symptoms6, including fatigue, decreased energy, and mood
disturbances. Symptoms of anxiety or depression that do not meet
criteria for a specific mental disorder may be present, as well as an
excessive focus on the perceived effects of sleep loss on daytime
functioning. Individuals with insomnia may have elevated scores on
self-report psychological or personality inventories with profiles
indicating mild depression and anxiety, a worrisome cognitive style, an
emotion-focused and internalizing style of conflict resolution, and a
somatic focus. Patterns of neurocognitive impairment among individuals
with insomnia disorder are inconsistent, although there may be
impairments in performing tasks of higher complexity and those requiring
frequent changes in performance strategy11. Individuals with insomnia
often require more effort to maintain cognitive performance.

Prevalence Population-based estimates indicate that about one-third of
adults report insomnia symptoms, 10%--15% experience associated daytime
impairments, and 6%--10% have symptoms that meet criteria for insomnia
disorder. Insomnia disorder is the most prevalent of all sleep
disorders. In primary care settings, approximately 10%--20% of
individuals complain of significant insomnia symptoms19, 24. Insomnia is
a more prevalent complaint among females than among males, with a gender
ratio of about 1.44:1. Although insomnia can be a symptom or an
independent disorder, it is most frequently observed as a comorbid
condition with another medical

condition or mental disorder. For instance, 40%--50% of individuals with
insomnia also present with a comorbid mental disorder.

Development and Course The onset of insomnia symptoms can occur at any
time during life, but the first episode is more common in young
adulthood. Less frequently, insomnia begins in childhood or adolescence.
In women, new-onset insomnia may occur during menopause and persist even
after other symptoms (e.g., hot flashes) have resolved. Insomnia may
have a late-life onset, which is often associated with the onset of
other health-related conditions. Insomnia can be situational,
persistent, or recurrent. Situational or acute insomnia usually lasts a
few days or a few weeks and is often associated with life events or
rapid changes in sleep schedules or environment. It usually resolves
once the initial precipitating event subsides. For some individuals,
perhaps those more vulnerable to sleep disturbances, insomnia may
persist long after the initial triggering event, possibly because of
conditioning factors and heightened arousal. The factors that
precipitate insomnia may differ from those that perpetuate it. For
example, an individual who is bedridden with a painful injury and has
difficulty sleeping may then develop negative associations for sleep.
Conditioned arousal may then persist and lead to persistent insomnia. A
similar course may develop in the context of an acute psychological
stress or a mental disorder. For instance, insomnia that occurs during
an episode of major depressive disorder can become a focus of attention,
with consequent negative conditioning, and persist even after resolution
of the depressive episode18. In some cases, insomnia may also have an
insidious onset without any identifiable precipitating factor. The
course of insomnia may also be episodic, with recurrent episodes of
sleep difficulties associated with the occurrence of stressful events.
Chronicity rates range from 45% to 75% for follow-ups of 1--7 years7,
16. Even when the course of the insomnia has become chronic, there is
nightto-night variability in sleep patterns, with an occasional restful
night's sleep interspersed with several nights of poor sleep. The
characteristics of insomnia may also change over time. Many individuals
with insomnia have a history of "light" or easily disturbed sleep prior
to onset of more persistent sleep problems.

Insomnia complaints are more prevalent among middle-age and older
adults. The type of insomnia symptom changes as a function of age, with
difficulties initiating sleep being more common among young adults and
problems maintaining sleep occurring more frequently among middle-age
and older individuals15, 19, 24. Difficulties initiating and maintaining
sleep can also occur in children and adolescents, but there are more
limited data on prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity during these
developmental phases of the lifespan. Sleep difficulties in childhood
can result from conditioning factors (e.g., a child who does not learn
to fall asleep or return to sleep without the presence of a parent) or
from the absence of consistent sleep schedules and bedtime routines.
Insomnia in adolescence is often triggered or exacerbated by irregular
sleep schedules (e.g., phase delay). In both children and adolescents,
psychological and medical factors can contribute to insomnia. The
increased prevalence of insomnia in older adults is partly explained by
the higher incidence of physical health problems with aging. Changes in
sleep patterns associated with the normal developmental process must be
differentiated from those exceeding age-related changes. Although
polysomnography is of limited value in the routine evaluation of
insomnia, it may be more useful in the differential diagnosis among
older adults because the etiologies of insomnia (e.g., sleep apnea) are
more often identifiable in older individuals.

Risk and Prognostic Factors While the risk and prognostic factors
discussed in this section increase vulnerability to insomnia, sleep
disturbances are more likely to occur when predisposed individuals are
exposed to precipitating events, such as major life events (e.g.,
illness, separation) or less severe but more chronic daily stress. Most
individuals resume normal sleep patterns after the initial triggering
event has disappeared, but others---perhaps those more vulnerable to
insomnia---continue experiencing persistent sleep difficulties.
Perpetuating factors such as poor sleep habits, irregular sleep
scheduling, and the fear of not sleeping feed into the insomnia problem
and may contribute to a vicious cycle that may induce persistent
insomnia. Temperamental. Anxiety or worry-prone personality or cognitive
styles, increased arousal predisposition, and tendency to repress
emotions can

increase vulnerability to insomnia. Environmental. Noise, light,
uncomfortably high or low temperature, and high altitude may also
increase vulnerability to insomnia. Genetic and physiological. Female
gender and advancing age are associated with increased vulnerability to
insomnia. Disrupted sleep and insomnia display a familial disposition.
The prevalence of insomnia is higher among monozygotic twins relative to
dizygotic twins; it is also higher in first-degree family members
compared with the general population. The extent to which this link is
inherited through a genetic predisposition, learned by observations of
parental models, or established as a by-product of another
psychopathology remains undetermined3, 27. Course modifiers. Deleterious
course modifiers include poor sleep hygiene practices (e.g., excessive
caffeine use, irregular sleep schedules).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint
among females than among males, with first onset often associated with
the birth of a new child or with menopause. Despite higher prevalence
among older females, polysomnographic studies suggest better
preservation of sleep continuity and slow-wave sleep in older females
than in older males.

Diagnostic Markers Polysomnography usually shows impairments of sleep
continuity (e.g., increased sleep latency and time awake after sleep
onset and decreased sleep efficiency \[percentage of time in bed
asleep\] and may show increased stage 1 sleep and decreased stages 3 and
4 sleep. The severity of these sleep impairments does not always match
the individual's clinical presentation or subjective complaint of poor
sleep, as individuals with insomnia often underestimate sleep duration
and overestimate wakefulness relative to polysomnography. Quantitative
electroencephalographic analyses may indicate that individuals with
insomnia have greater high-frequency electroencephalography power
relative to good sleepers both around the sleep onset period and during
non--rapid eye movement sleep, a feature suggestive of increased
cortical arousal23. Individuals with insomnia disorder may have a lower
sleep propensity and typically do not show

increased daytime sleepiness on objective sleep laboratory measures
compared with individuals without sleep disorders. Other laboratory
measures show evidence, although not consistently, of increased arousal
and a generalized activation of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis
(e.g., increased cortisol levels, heart rate variability, reactivity to
stress, metabolic rate)26. In general, findings are consistent with the
hypothesis that increased physiological and cognitive arousal plays a
significant role in insomnia disorder4, 23. Individuals with insomnia
disorder may appear either fatigued or haggard or, conversely,
overaroused and "wired." However, there are no consistent or
characteristic abnormalities on physical examination. There may be an
increased incidence of stress-related psychophysiological symptoms
(e.g., tension headache, muscle tension or pain, gastrointestinal
symptoms).

Functional Consequences of Insomnia Disorder Interpersonal, social, and
occupational problems may develop as a result of insomnia or excessive
concern with sleep, increased daytime irritability, and poor
concentration. Decreased attention and concentration are common and may
be related to higher rates of accidents observed in insomnia. Persistent
insomnia is also associated with long-term consequences, including
increased risks of major depressive disorder7, hypertension25, and
myocardial infarction12; increased absenteeism and reduced productivity
at work; reduced quality of life; and increased economic burden8, 24.

Differential Diagnosis Normal sleep variations. Normal sleep duration
varies considerably across individuals. Some individuals who require
little sleep ("short sleepers") may be concerned about their sleep
duration. Short sleepers differ from individuals with insomnia disorder
by the lack of difficulty falling or staying asleep and by the absence
of characteristic daytime symptoms (e.g., fatigue, concentration
problems, irritability). However, some short sleepers may desire or
attempt to sleep for a longer period of time and, by prolonging time in
bed, may create an insomnia-like sleep pattern. Clinical insomnia also
should be distinguished from normal, agerelated sleep changes. Insomnia
must also be distinguished from sleep deprivation due to inadequate
opportunity or circumstance for sleep

resulting, for example, from an emergency or from professional or family
obligations forcing the individual to stay awake. Situational/acute
insomnia. Situational/acute insomnia is a condition lasting a few days
to a few weeks, often associated with life events or with changes in
sleep schedules. These acute or short-term insomnia symptoms may also
produce significant distress and interfere with social, personal, and
occupational functioning. When such symptoms are frequent enough and
meet all other criteria except for the 3-month duration, a diagnosis of
other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is
made. Delayed sleep phase and shift work types of circadian rhythm
sleepwake disorder. Individuals with the delayed sleep phase type of
circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder report sleep-onset insomnia only
when they try to sleep at socially normal times, but they do not report
difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep when their bed and rising
times are delayed and coincide with their endogenous circadian rhythm.
Shift work type differs from insomnia disorder by the history of recent
shift work. Restless legs syndrome. Restless legs syndrome often
produces difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep. However, an urge
to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant leg sensations are
features that differentiate this disorder from insomnia disorder.
Breathing-related sleep disorders. Most individuals with a
breathingrelated sleep disorder have a history of loud snoring,
breathing pauses during sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness.
Nonetheless, as many as 50% of individuals with sleep apnea may also
report insomnia symptoms, a feature that is more common among females
and older adults. Narcolepsy. Narcolepsy may cause insomnia complaints
but is distinguished from insomnia disorder by the predominance of
symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis,
and sleep-related hallucinations. Parasomnias. Parasomnias are
characterized by a complaint of unusual behavior or events during sleep
that may lead to intermittent awakenings and difficulty resuming sleep.
However, it is these behavioral events, rather than the insomnia per se,
that dominate the clinical picture. Substance/medication-induced sleep
disorder, insomnia type. Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder,
insomnia type, is

distinguished from insomnia disorder by the fact that a substance (i.e.,
a drug of abuse, a medication, or exposure to a toxin) is judged to be
etiologically related to the insomnia (see "Substance/Medication-Induced
Sleep Disorder" later in this chapter). For example, insomnia occurring
only in the context of heavy coffee consumption would be diagnosed as
caffeineinduced sleep disorder, insomnia type, with onset during
intoxication.

Comorbidity Insomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions,
including diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and other chronic pain
conditions22. The risk relationship appears to be bidirectional:
insomnia increases the risk of medical conditions, and medical problems
increase the risk of insomnia. The direction of the relationship is not
always clear and may change over time; for this reason, comorbid
insomnia is the preferred terminology in the presence of coexisting
insomnia with another medical condition (or mental disorder)17.
Individuals with insomnia disorder frequently have a comorbid mental
disorder, particularly bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders24.
Persistent insomnia represents a risk factor or an early symptom of
subsequent bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders5.
Individuals with insomnia may misuse medications or alcohol to help with
nighttime sleep, anxiolytics to combat tension or anxiety, and caffeine
or other stimulants to combat excessive fatigue. In addition to
worsening the insomnia, this type of substance use may in some cases
progress to a substance use disorder.

Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders There
are several distinct insomnia phenotypes relating to the perceived
source of the insomnia that are recognized by the International
Classification of Sleep Disorders,1, 9 2nd Edition (ICSD-2). These
include psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, sleep-state
misperception, and inadequate sleep hygiene. Despite their clinical
appeal and heuristic value, there is limited evidence to support these
distinct phenotypes.

Hypersomnolence Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

307.44 (F51.11)

a.  Self-reported excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence) despite a main
    sleep period lasting at least 7 hours, with at least one of the
    following symptoms:

<!-- -->

1.  Recurrent periods of sleep or lapses into sleep within the same day.
2.  A prolonged main sleep episode of more than 9 hours per day that is
    nonrestorative (i.e., unrefreshing).
3.  Difficulty being fully awake after abrupt awakening.

<!-- -->

b.  The hypersomnolence occurs at least three times per week, for at
    least 3 months.
c.  The hypersomnolence is accompanied by significant distress or
    impairment in cognitive, social, occupational, or other important
    areas of functioning.
d.  The hypersomnolence is not better explained by and does not occur
    exclusively during the course of another sleep disorder (e.g.,

narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorder, circadian rhythm sleepwake
disorder, or a parasomnia). e. The hypersomnolence is not attributable
to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication). f. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not
adequately explain the predominant complaint of hypersomnolence. Specify
if: With mental disorder, including substance use disorders With medical
condition With another sleep disorder Coding note: The code 307.44
(F51.11) applies to all three specifiers. Code also the relevant
associated mental disorder, medical condition, or other sleep disorder
immediately after the code for hypersomnolence disorder in order to
indicate the association. Specify if: Acute: Duration of less than 1
month. Subacute: Duration of 1--3 months. Persistent: Duration of more
than 3 months. Specify current severity: Specify severity based on
degree of difficulty maintaining daytime alertness as manifested by the
occurrence of multiple attacks of irresistible sleepiness within any
given day occurring, for example, while sedentary, driving, visiting
with friends, or working. Mild: Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness
1--2 days/week. Moderate: Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 3--4
days/week. Severe: Difficulty maintaining daytime alertness 5--7
days/week.

Diagnostic Features Hypersomnolence is a broad diagnostic term and
includes symptoms of excessive quantity of sleep (e.g., extended
nocturnal sleep or involuntary daytime sleep), deteriorated quality of
wakefulness (i.e., sleep propensity during wakefulness as shown by
difficulty awakening or inability to remain awake when required), and
sleep inertia (i.e., a period of impaired

performance and reduced vigilance following awakening from the regular
sleep episode or from a nap) (Criterion A)6, 10. Individuals with this
disorder fall asleep quickly and have a good sleep efficiency (\>90%).
They may have difficulty waking up in the morning, sometimes appearing
confused, combative, or ataxic. This prolonged impairment of alertness
at the sleep-wake transition is often referred to as sleep inertia
(i.e., sleep drunkenness). It can also occur upon awakening from a
daytime nap. During that period, the individual appears awake, but there
is a decline in motor dexterity, behavior may be very inappropriate, and
memory deficits, disorientation in time and space, and feelings of
grogginess may occur. This period may last some minutes to hours. The
persistent need for sleep can lead to automatic behavior (usually of a
very routine, low-complexity type) that the individual carries out with
little or no subsequent recall. For example, individuals may find
themselves having driven several miles from where they thought they
were, unaware of the "automatic" driving they did in the preceding
minutes. For some individuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major
sleep episode (for most individuals, nocturnal sleep) has a duration of
9 hours or more. However, the sleep is often nonrestorative and is
followed by difficulty awakening in the morning. For other individuals
with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode is of normal
nocturnal sleep duration (6--9 hours). In these cases, the excessive
sleepiness is characterized by several unintentional daytime naps. These
daytime naps tend to be relatively long (often lasting 1 hour or more),
are experienced as nonrestorative (i.e., unrefreshing), and do not lead
to improved alertness. Individuals with hypersomnolence have daytime
naps nearly everyday regardless of the nocturnal sleep duration1.
Subjective sleep quality may or may not be reported as good. Individuals
typically feel sleepiness developing over a period of time, rather than
experiencing a sudden sleep "attack." Unintentional sleep episodes
typically occur in low-stimulation and lowactivity situations (e.g.,
while attending lectures, reading, watching television, or driving long
distances), but in more severe cases they can manifest in high-attention
situations such as at work, in meetings, or at social gatherings.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Nonrestorative sleep, automatic behavior, difficulties awakening in the
morning, and sleep inertia, although common in hypersomnolence disorder,
may also be seen in a variety of conditions, including narcolepsy.
Approximately 80% of individuals with hypersomnolence report that their
sleep is nonrestorative, and as many have difficulties awakening in the
morning. Sleep inertia, though less common (i.e., observed in 36%--50%
of individuals with hypersomnolence disorder), is highly specific to
hypersomnolence1, 2, 12. Short naps (i.e., duration of less than 30
minutes) are often unrefreshing2, 11, 12. Individuals with
hypersomnolence often appear sleepy and may even fall asleep in the
clinician's waiting area. A subset of individuals with hypersomnolence
disorder have a family history of hypersomnolence and also have symptoms
of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, including recurrent
vascular-type headaches, reactivity of the peripheral vascular system
(Raynaud's phenomenon), and fainting.

Prevalence Approximately 5%--10% of individuals who consult in sleep
disorders clinics with complaints of daytime sleepiness are diagnosed as
having hypersomnolence disorder. It is estimated that about 1% of the
European and U.S. general population has episodes of sleep inertia4, 5.
Hypersomnolence occurs with relatively equal frequency in males and
females5.

Development and Course Hypersomnolence disorder has a persistent course,
with a progressive evolution in the severity of symptoms. In most
extreme cases, sleep episodes can last up to 20 hours. However, the
average nighttime sleep duration is around 9½ hours. While many
individuals with hypersomnolence are able to reduce their sleep time
during working days, weekend and holiday sleep is greatly increased (by
up to 3 hours). Awakenings are very difficult and accompanied by sleep
inertia episodes in nearly 40% of cases. Hypersomnolence fully manifests
in most cases in late adolescence or early adulthood, with a mean age at
onset of 17--24 years1, 7, 9. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder
are diagnosed, on average, 10--15 years after the appearance of the
first symptoms1, 2. Pediatric cases are rare.

Hypersomnolence has a progressive onset, with symptoms beginning between
ages 15 and 25 years, with a gradual progression over weeks to months.
For most individuals, the course is then persistent and stable, unless
treatment is initiated. The development of other sleep disorders (e.g.,
breathing-related sleep disorder) may worsen the degree of sleepiness.
Although hyperactivity may be one of the presenting signs of daytime
sleepiness in children, voluntary napping increases with age. This
normal phenomenon is distinct from hypersomnolence.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Hypersomnolence can be
increased temporarily by psychological stress and alcohol use, but they
have not been documented as environmental precipitating factors. Viral
infections have been reported to have preceded or accompanied
hyper-somnolence in about 10% of cases2. Viral infections, such as HIV
pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome, can
also evolve into hypersomnolence within months after the infection.
Hypersomnolence can also appear within 6--18 months following a head
trauma3. Genetic and physiological. Hypersomnolence may be familial,
with an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance.

Diagnostic Markers Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrates a normal to
prolonged sleep duration, short sleep latency, and normal to increased
sleep continuity. The distribution of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is
also normal. Sleep efficiency is mostly greater than 90%. Some
individuals with hypersomnolence disorder have increased amounts of
slow-wave sleep. The multiple sleep latency test documents sleep
tendency, typically indicated by mean sleep latency values of less than
8 minutes. In hypersomnolence disorder, the mean sleep latency is
typically less than 10 minutes and frequently 8 minutes or less1, 2, 8,
9, 11. Sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs; i.e., the occurrence of REM
sleep within 20 minutes of sleep onset) may be present but occur less
than two times in four to five nap opportunities2.

Functional Consequences of Hypersomnolence Disorder The low level of
alertness that occurs while an individual fights the need for sleep can
lead to reduced efficiency, diminished concentration, and poor memory
during daytime activities. Hypersomnolence can lead to significant
distress and dysfunction in work and social relationships. Prolonged
nocturnal sleep and difficulty awakening can result in difficulty in
meeting morning obligations, such as arriving at work on time.
Unintentional daytime sleep episodes can be embarrassing and even
dangerous, if, for instance, the individual is driving or operating
machinery when the episode occurs.

Differential Diagnosis Normative variation in sleep. "Normal" sleep
duration varies considerably in the general population. "Long sleepers"
(i.e., individuals who require a greater than average amount of sleep)
do not have excessive sleepiness, sleep inertia, or automatic behavior
when they obtain their required amount of nocturnal sleep. Sleep is
reported to be refreshing. If social or occupational demands lead to
shorter nocturnal sleep, daytime symptoms may appear. In hypersomnolence
disorder, by contrast, symptoms of excessive sleepiness occur regardless
of nocturnal sleep duration. An inadequate amount of nocturnal sleep, or
behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome, can produce symptoms
of daytime sleepiness very similar to those of hypersomnolence. An
average sleep duration of fewer than 7 hours per night strongly suggests
inadequate nocturnal sleep, and an average of more than 9--10 hours of
sleep per 24-hour period suggests hypersomnolence. Individuals with
inadequate nocturnal sleep typically "catch up" with longer sleep
durations on days when they are free from social or occupational demands
or on vacations. Unlike hypersomnolence, insufficient nocturnal sleep is
unlikely to persist unabated for decades. A diagnosis of hypersomnolence
disorder should not be made if there is a question regarding the
adequacy of nocturnal sleep duration. A diagnostic and therapeutic trial
of sleep extension for 10--14 days can often clarify the diagnosis. Poor
sleep quality and fatigue. Hypersomnolence disorder should be
distinguished from excessive sleepiness related to insufficient sleep
quantity

or quality and fatigue (i.e., tiredness not necessarily relieved by
increased sleep and unrelated to sleep quantity or quality). Excessive
sleepiness and fatigue are difficult to differentiate and may overlap
considerably. Breathing-related sleep disorders. Individuals with
hypersomnolence and breathing-related sleep disorders may have similar
patterns of excessive sleepiness. Breathing-related sleep disorders are
suggested by a history of loud snoring, pauses in breathing during
sleep, brain injury, or cardiovascular disease and by the presence of
obesity, oropharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, hypertension, or heart
failure on physical examination. Polysomnographic studies can confirm
the presence of apneic events in breathing-related sleep disorder (and
their absence in hypersomnolence disorder). Circadian rhythm sleep-wake
disorders. Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are often characterized
by daytime sleepiness. A history of an abnormal sleep-wake schedule
(with shifted or irregular hours) is present in individuals with a
circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder. Parasomnias. Parasomnias rarely
produce the prolonged, undisturbed nocturnal sleep or daytime sleepiness
characteristic of hypersomnolence disorder. Other mental disorders.
Hypersomnolence disorder must be distinguished from mental disorders
that include hypersomnolence as an essential or associated feature. In
particular, complaints of daytime sleepiness may occur in a major
depressive episode, with atypical features, and in the depressed phase
of bipolar disorder. Assessment for other mental disorders is essential
before a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder is considered. A
diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder can be made in the presence of
another current or past mental disorder.

Comorbidity Hypersomnolence can be associated with depressive disorders,
bipolar disorders (during a depressive episode)5, 6, and major
depressive disorder, with seasonal pattern. Many individuals with
hypersomnolence disorder have symptoms of depression that may meet
criteria for a depressive disorder. This presentation may be related to
the psychosocial consequences of persistent increased sleep need.
Individuals with hypersomnolence

disorder are also at risk for substance-related disorders, particularly
related to self-medication with stimulants. This general lack of
specificity may contribute to very heterogeneous profiles among
individuals whose symptoms meet the same diagnostic criteria for
hypersomnolence disorder. Neurodegenerative conditions, such as
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple system atrophy,
may also be associated with hypersomnolence.

Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders The
International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2),
differentiates nine subtypes of "hypersomnias of central origin,"
including recurrent hypersomnia (Kleine-Levin syndrome).

Narcolepsy Diagnostic Criteria a. Recurrent periods of an irrepressible
need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping occurring within the same
day. These must have been occurring at least three times per week over
the past 3 months. b. The presence of at least one of the following: 1.
Episodes of cataplexy, defined as either (a) or (b), occurring at least
a few times per month: a. In individuals with long-standing disease,
brief (seconds to minutes) episodes of sudden bilateral loss of muscle
tone with maintained consciousness that are precipitated by laughter or
joking. b. In children or in individuals within 6 months of onset,
spontaneous grimaces or jaw-opening episodes with tongue thrusting or a
global hypotonia, without any obvious emotional triggers.

2. Hypocretin deficiency, as measured using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity values (less than or equal to one-third of
values obtained in healthy subjects tested using the same assay, or less
than or equal to 110 pg/mL). Low CSF levels of hypocretin-1 must not be
observed in the context of acute brain injury, inflammation, or
infection. 3. Nocturnal sleep polysomnography showing rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep latency less than or equal to 15 minutes, or a multiple
sleep latency test showing a mean sleep latency less than or equal to 8
minutes and two or more sleeponset REM periods. Specify whether: 347.00
(G47.419) Narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency:
Criterion B requirements of low CSF hypocretin-1 levels and positive
polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test are met, but no cataplexy is
present (Criterion B1 not met). 347.01 (G47.411) Narcolepsy with
cataplexy but without hypocretin deficiency: In this rare subtype (less
than 5% of narcolepsy cases), Criterion B requirements of cataplexy and
positive polysomnography/multiple sleep latency test are met, but CSF
hypocretin-1 levels are normal (Criterion B2 not met). 347.00 (G47.419)
Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, deafness, and narcolepsy: This
subtype is caused by exon 21 DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase-1
mutations and is characterized by late-onset (age 30--40 years)
narcolepsy (with low or intermediate CSF hypocretin-1 levels), deafness,
cerebellar ataxia, and eventually dementia. 347.00 (G47.419) Autosomal
dominant narcolepsy, obesity, and type 2 diabetes: Narcolepsy, obesity,
and type 2 diabetes and low CSF hypocretin-1 levels have been described
in rare cases and are associated with a mutation in the myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein gene. 347.10 (G47.429) Narcolepsy secondary
to another medical condition: This subtype is for narcolepsy that
develops secondary

to medical conditions that cause infectious (e.g., Whipple's disease,
sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral destruction of hypocretin neurons.
Coding note (for ICD-9-CM code 347.10 only): Code first the underlying
medical condition (e.g., 040.2 Whipple's disease; 347.10 narcolepsy
secondary to Whipple's disease). Specify current severity: Mild:
Infrequent cataplexy (less than once per week), need for naps only once
or twice per day, and less disturbed nocturnal sleep. Moderate:
Cataplexy once daily or every few days, disturbed nocturnal sleep, and
need for multiple naps daily. Severe: Drug-resistant cataplexy with
multiple attacks daily, nearly constant sleepiness, and disturbed
nocturnal sleep (i.e., movements, insomnia, and vivid dreaming).

Subtypes In narcolepsy without cataplexy but with hypocretin deficiency,
unclear "cataplexy-like" symptoms may be reported (e.g., the symptoms
are not triggered by emotions and are unusually long lasting). In
extremely rare cases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of hypocretin-1
are low, and polysomnographic/multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) results
are negative: repeating the test is advised before establishing the
subtype diagnosis. In narcolepsy with cataplexy but without hypocretin
deficiency, test results for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQB1*06:02
may be negative. Seizures, falls of other origin, and conversion
disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) should be excluded.
In narcolepsy secondary to infectious (e.g., Whipple's disease,
sarcoidosis), traumatic, or tumoral destruction of hypocretin neurons,
test results for HLA DQB1*06:02 may be positive and may result from the
insult triggering the autoimmune process. In other cases, the
destruction of hypocretin neurons may be secondary to trauma or
hypothalamic surgery. Head trauma or infections of the central nervous
system can, however, produce transitory decreases in CSF hypocretin-1
levels without hypocretin cell loss, complicating the diagnosis.

Diagnostic Features The essential features of sleepiness in narcolepsy
are recurrent daytime naps or lapses into sleep. Sleepiness typically
occurs daily but must occur at a minimum three times a week for at least
3 months (Criterion A). Narcolepsy generally produces cataplexy, which
most commonly presents as brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of sudden,
bilateral loss of muscle tone precipitated by emotions, typically
laughing and joking. Muscles affected may include those of the neck,
jaw, arms, legs, or whole body, resulting in head bobbing, jaw dropping,
or complete falls. Individuals are awake and aware during cataplexy. To
meet Criterion B1(a), cataplexy must be triggered by laughter or joking
and must occur at least a few times per month when the condition is
untreated or in the past1, 3. Cataplexy should not be confused with
"weakness" occurring in the context of athletic activities
(physiological) or exclusively after unusual emotional triggers such as
stress or anxiety (suggesting possible psychopathology). Episodes
lasting hours or days, or those not triggered by emotions, are unlikely
to be cataplexy, nor is rolling on the floor while laughing
hysterically1, 3. In children close to onset, genuine cataplexy can be
atypical, affecting primarily the face, causing grimaces or jaw opening
with tongue thrusting ("cataplectic faces"). Alternatively, cataplexy
may present as low-grade continuous hypotonia, yielding a wobbling walk.
In these cases, Criterion B1(b) can be met in children or in individuals
within 6 months of a rapid onset1. Narcolepsy-cataplexy nearly always
results from the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin)--producing
cells, causing hypocretin deficiency (less than or equal to one-third of
control values, or 110 pg/mL in most laboratories). Cell loss is likely
autoimmune, and approximately 99% of affected individuals carry
HLA-DQB1*06:02 (vs. 12%--38% of control subjects)2. Thus, checking for
the presence of DQB1*06:02 prior to a lumbar puncture for evaluation of
CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity may be useful. Rarely, low CSF levels
of hypocretin-1 occur without cataplexy, notably in youths who may
develop cataplexy later. CSF hypocretin-1 measurement represents the
gold standard, excepting associated severe conditions (neurological,
inflammatory, infectious, trauma) that can interfere with the assay2.

A nocturnal polysomnographic sleep study followed by an MSLT can also be
used to confirm the diagnosis (Criterion B3). These tests must be
performed after the individual has stopped all psychotropic medications,
following 2 weeks of adequate sleep time (as documented with sleep
diaries, actigraphy). Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency
(sleep-onset REM period, REM latency less than or equal to 15 minutes)
during polysomnography is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and meets
Criterion B3. Alternatively, the MSLT result must be positive, showing a
mean sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 minutes and two or more
sleep-onset REM periods in four to five naps1, 3.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis When sleepiness is severe,
automatic behaviors may occur, with the individual continuing his or her
activities in a semi-automatic, hazelike fashion without memory or
consciousness1, 3. Approximately 20%--60% of individuals experience
vivid hypnagogic hallucinations before or upon falling asleep or
hypnopompic hallucinations just after awakening1, 3, 5. These
hallucinations are distinct from the less vivid, nonhallucinatory
dreamlike mentation at sleep onset that occurs in normal sleepers5.
Nightmares and vivid dreaming are also frequent in narcolepsy, as is REM
sleep behavior disorder. Approximately 20%--60% of individuals
experience sleep paralysis upon falling asleep or awakening, leaving
them awake but unable to move or speak. However, many normal sleepers
also report sleep paralysis, especially with stress or sleep
deprivation6. Nocturnal eating may occur. Obesity is common. Nocturnal
sleep disruption with frequent long or short awakenings is common and
can be disabling. Individuals may appear sleepy or fall asleep in the
waiting area or during clinical examination. During cataplexy,
individuals may slump in a chair and have slurred speech or drooping
eyelids. If the clinician has time to check reflexes during cataplexy
(most attacks are less than 10 seconds), reflexes are abolished---an
important finding distinguishing genuine cataplexy from conversion
disorder1, 3.

Prevalence Narcolepsy-cataplexy affects 0.02%--0.04% of the general
population in most countries1, 3. Narcolepsy affects both genders, with
possibly a slight

male preponderance1, 3.

Development and Course Onset is typically in children and
adolescents/young adults but rarely in older adults. Two peaks of onset
are suggested, at ages 15--25 years and ages 30--35 years. Onset can be
abrupt or progressive (over years). Severity is highest when onset is
abrupt in children, and then decreases with age or with treatment, so
that symptoms such as cataplexy can occasionally disappear. Abrupt onset
in young, prepubescent children can be associated with obesity and
premature puberty, a phenotype more frequently observed since 2009. In
adolescents, onset is more difficult to pinpoint. Onset in adults is
often unclear, with some individuals reporting having had excessive
sleepiness since birth. Once the disorder has manifested, the course is
persistent and lifelong1, 3. In 90% of cases, the first symptom to
manifest is sleepiness or increased sleep, followed by cataplexy (within
1 year in 50% of cases, within 3 years in 85%). Sleepiness, hypnagogic
hallucinations, vivid dreaming, and REM sleep behavior disorder
(excessive movements during REM sleep) are early symptoms. Excessive
sleep rapidly progresses to an inability to stay awake during the day,
and to maintain good sleep at night, without a clear increase in total
24-hour sleep needs. In the first months, cataplexy may be atypical,
especially in children. Sleep paralysis usually develops around puberty
in children with prepubertal onset. Exacerbations of symptoms suggest
lack of compliance with medications or development of a concurrent sleep
disorder, notably sleep apnea1, 3. Young children and adolescents with
narcolepsy often develop aggression or behavioral problems secondary to
sleepiness and/or nighttime sleep disruption. Workload and social
pressure increase through high school and college, reducing available
sleep time at night. Pregnancy does not seem to modify symptoms
consistently. After retirement, individuals typically have more
opportunity for napping, reducing the need for stimulants. Maintaining a
regular schedule benefits individuals at all ages1.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Parasomnias, such as
sleepwalking, bruxism, REM sleep behavior disorder, and enuresis, may be
more common in individuals who

develop narcolepsy. Individuals commonly report that they need more
sleep than other family members. Environmental. Group A streptococcal
throat infection, influenza (notably pandemic H1N1 2009), or other
winter infections are likely triggers of the autoimmune process,
producing narcolepsy a few months later4. Head trauma and abrupt changes
in sleep-wake patterns (e.g., job changes, stress) may be additional
triggers1, 3. Genetic and physiological. Monozygotic twins are 25%--32%
concordant for narcolepsy. The prevalence of narcolepsy is 1%--2% in
first-degree relatives (a 10- to 40-fold increase overall). Narcolepsy
is strongly associated with DQB1*06:02 (99% vs. 12%--38% in control
subjects of various ethnic groups; 25% in the general U.S. population).
DQB1*03:01 increases, while DQB1*05:01, DQB1*06:01, and DQB1*06:03
reduce risk in the presence of DQB1*06:02, but the effect is small.
Polymorphisms within the T-cell receptor alpha gene and other immune
modulating genes also modulate risk slightly2, 4.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Narcolepsy has been described in all
ethnic groups and in many cultures. Among African Americans, more cases
present without cataplexy or with atypical cataplexy, complicating
diagnosis, especially in the presence of obesity and obstructive sleep
apnea1.

Diagnostic Markers Functional imaging suggests impaired hypothalamic
responses to humorous stimuli. Nocturnal polysomnography followed by an
MSLT is used to confirm the diagnosis of narcolepsy, especially when the
disorder is first being diagnosed and before treatment has begun, and if
hypocretin deficiency has not been documented biochemically. The
polysomnography/MSLT should be performed after the individual is no
longer taking any psychotropic drugs and after regular sleep-wake
patterns, without shift work or sleep deprivation, have been documented.
A sleep-onset REM period during the polysomnography (REM sleep latency
less than or equal to 15 minutes) is highly specific (approximately 1%
positive in control subjects) but moderately sensitive (approximately
50%). A positive MSLT result displays an average sleep latency of less
than

or equal to 8 minutes, and sleep-onset REM periods in two or more naps
on a four- or five-nap test. The MSLT result is positive in 90%--95% of
individuals with narcolepsy versus 2%--4% of control subjects or
individuals with other sleep disorders. Additional polysomnographic
findings often include frequent arousals, decreased sleep efficiency,
and increased stage 1 sleep. Periodic limb movements (found in about 40%
of individuals with narcolepsy) and sleep apnea are often noted1, 3.
Hypocretin deficiency is demonstrated by measuring CSF hypocretin-1
immunoreactivity2. The test is particularly useful in individuals with
suspected conversion disorder and those without typical cataplexy, or in
treatment-refractory cases. The diagnostic value of the test is not
affected by medications, sleep deprivation, or circadian time, but the
findings are uninterpretable when the individual is severely ill with a
concurrent infection or head trauma or is comatose2. CSF cytology,
protein, and glucose are within normal range even when sampled within
weeks of rapid onset. CSF hypocretin-1 in these incipient cases is
typically already very diminished or undetectable2.

Functional Consequences of Narcolepsy Driving and working are impaired,
and individuals with narcolepsy should avoid jobs that place themselves
(e.g., working with machinery) or others (e.g., bus driver, pilot) in
danger. Once the narcolepsy is controlled with therapy, patients can
usually drive, although rarely long distances alone. Untreated
individuals are also at risk for social isolation and accidental injury
to themselves or others. Social relations may suffer as these
individuals strive to avert cataplexy by exerting control over
emotions1, 3.

Differential Diagnosis Other hypersomnias. Hypersomnolence and
narcolepsy are similar with respect to the degree of daytime sleepiness,
age at onset, and stable course over time but can be distinguished based
on distinctive clinical and laboratory features. Individuals with
hypersomnolence typically have longer and less disrupted nocturnal
sleep, greater difficulty awakening, more persistent daytime sleepiness
(as opposed to more discrete "sleep attacks" in narcolepsy), longer and
less refreshing daytime sleep episodes, and little or no dreaming during
daytime naps. By contrast, individuals with

narcolepsy have cataplexy and recurrent intrusions of elements of REM
sleep into the transition between sleep and wakefulness (e.g.,
sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The MSLT typically
demonstrates shorter sleep latencies (i.e., greater physiological
sleepiness) as well as the presence of multiple sleep-onset REM periods
in individuals with narcolepsy. Sleep deprivation and insufficient
nocturnal sleep. Sleep deprivation and insufficient nocturnal sleep are
common in adolescents and shift workers. In adolescents, difficulties
falling asleep at night are common, causing sleep deprivation. The MSLT
result may be positive if conducted while the individual is sleep
deprived or while his or her sleep is phase delayed. Sleep apnea
syndromes. Sleep apneas are especially likely in the presence of
obesity. Because obstructive sleep apnea is more frequent than
narcolepsy, cataplexy may be overlooked (or absent), and the individual
is assumed to have obstructive sleep apnea unresponsive to usual
therapies. Major depressive disorder. Narcolepsy or hypersomnia may be
associated or confused with depression. Cataplexy is not present in
depression. The MSLT results are most often normal, and there is
dissociation between subjective and objective sleepiness, as measured by
the mean sleep latency during the MSLT. Conversion disorder (functional
neurological symptom disorder). Atypical features, such as long-lasting
cataplexy or unusual triggers, may be present in conversion disorder
(functional neurological symptom disorder). Individuals may report
sleeping and dreaming, yet the MSLT does not show the characteristic
sleep-onset REM period. Fullblown, long-lasting pseudocataplexy may
occur during consultation, allowing the examining physician enough time
to verify reflexes, which remain intact. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder or other behavioral problems. In children and adolescents,
sleepiness can cause behavioral problems, including aggressiveness and
inattention, leading to a misdiagnosis of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Seizures. In young children,
cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as seizures. Seizures are not commonly
triggered by emotions, and when they are, the

trigger is not usually laughing or joking. During a seizure, individuals
are more likely to hurt themselves when falling. Seizures characterized
by isolated atonia are rarely seen in isolation of other seizures, and
they also have signatures on the electroencephalogram. Chorea and
movement disorders. In young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as
chorea or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated
with streptococcal infections, especially in the context of a strep
throat infection and high antistreptolysin O antibody levels. Some
children may have an overlapping movement disorder close to onset of the
cataplexy. Schizophrenia. In the presence of florid and vivid hypnagogic
hallucinations, individuals may think these experiences are real---a
feature that suggests schizophrenia. Similarly, with stimulant
treatment, persecutory delusions may develop. If cataplexy is present,
the clinician should first assume that these symptoms are secondary to
narcolepsy before considering a co-occurring diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Comorbidity Narcolepsy can co-occur with bipolar, depressive, and
anxiety disorders, and in rare cases with schizophrenia. Narcolepsy is
also associated with increased body mass index or obesity, especially
when the narcolepsy is untreated. Rapid weight gain is common in young
children with a sudden disease onset. Comorbid sleep apnea should be
considered if there is a sudden aggravation of preexisting narcolepsy.

Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders The
International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2),
differentiates five subtypes of narcolepsy.

Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders The breathing-related sleep disorders
category encompasses three relatively distinct disorders: obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related
hypoventilation.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Diagnostic Criteria

327.23 (G47.33)

a.  Either (1) or (2):

<!-- -->

1.  Evidence by polysomnography of at least five obstructive apneas or
    hypopneas per hour of sleep and either of the following sleep
    symptoms:

<!-- -->

a.  Nocturnal breathing disturbances: snoring, snorting/gasping, or
    breathing pauses during sleep.
b.  Daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite
    sufficient opportunities to sleep that is not better explained by
    another mental disorder (including a sleep disorder) and is not
    attributable to another medical condition.

<!-- -->

2.  Evidence by polysomnography of 15 or more obstructive apneas and/or
    hypopneas per hour of sleep regardless of

accompanying symptoms. Specify current severity: Mild: Apnea hypopnea
index is less than 15. Moderate: Apnea hypopnea index is 15--30. Severe:
Apnea hypopnea index is greater than 30.

Specifiers Disease severity is measured by a count of the number of
apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep (apnea hypopnea index) using
polysomnography or other overnight monitoring. Overall severity is also
informed by levels of nocturnal desaturation and sleep fragmentation
(measured by brain cortical arousal frequency and sleep stages) and
degree of associated symptoms and daytime impairment. However, the exact
number and thresholds may vary according to the specific measurement
techniques used, and these numbers may change over time. Regardless of
the apnea hypopnea index (count) per se, the disorder is considered to
be more severe when apneas and hypopneas are accompanied by significant
oxygen hemoglobin desaturation (e.g., when more than 10% of the sleep
time is spent at desaturation levels of less than 90%) or when sleep is
severely fragmented as shown by an elevated arousal index (arousal index
greater than 30) or reduced stages in deep sleep (e.g., percentage stage
N3 \[slow-wave sleep\] less than 5%).

Diagnostic Features Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is the most common
breathing-related sleep disorder. It is characterized by repeated
episodes of upper (pharyngeal) airway obstruction (apneas and hypopneas)
during sleep. Apnea refers to the total absence of airflow, and hypopnea
refers to a reduction in airflow. Each apnea or hypopnea represents a
reduction in breathing of at least 10 seconds in duration in adults or
two missed breaths in children and is typically associated with drops in
oxygen saturation of 3% or greater and/or an electroencephalographic
arousal. Both sleep-related (nocturnal) and wake-time symptoms are
common. The cardinal symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are
snoring and daytime sleepiness.

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea in adults is diagnosed on the basis of
polysomnographic findings and symptoms. The diagnosis is based on
symptoms of 1) nocturnal breathing disturbances (i.e., snoring,
snorting/gasping, breathing pauses during sleep), or 2) daytime
sleepiness, fatigue, or unrefreshing sleep despite sufficient
opportunities to sleep that are not better explained by another mental
disorder and not attributable to another medical condition, along with
3) evidence by polysomnography of five or more obstructive apneas or
hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion A1). Diagnosis can be made in the
absence of these symptoms if there is evidence by polysomnography of 15
or more obstructive apneas and/or hypopneas per hour of sleep (Criterion
A2). Specific attention to disturbed sleep occurring in association with
snoring or breathing pauses and physical findings that increase risk of
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., central obesity, crowded
pharyngeal airway, elevated blood pressure) is needed to reduce the
chance of misdiagnosing this treatable condition.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Because of the frequency of
nocturnal awakenings that occur with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea,
individuals may report symptoms of insomnia. Other common, though
nonspecific, symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are heartburn,
nocturia, morning headaches, dry mouth, erectile dysfunction, and
reduced libido. Rarely, individuals may complain of difficulty breathing
while lying supine or sleeping. Hypertension may occur in more than 60%
of individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.

Prevalence Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is a very common disorder,
affecting at least 1%--2% of children, 2%--15% of middle-age adults, and
more than 20% of older individuals4, 14, 18. In the general community,
prevalence rates of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may be
very high in elderly individuals11. Since the disorder is strongly
associated with obesity, increases in obesity rates are likely to be
accompanied by an increased prevalence of this disorder. Prevalence may
be particularly high among males, older adults, and certain
racial/ethnic groups. In adults, the male-to-

female ratio of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea ranges from 2:1 to 4:1.
Gender differences decline in older age, possibly because of an
increased prevalence in females after menopause. There is no gender
difference among prepubertal children.

Development and Course The age distribution of obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea likely follows a Jshaped distribution. There is a peak in
children ages 3--8 years when the nasopharynx may be compromised by a
relatively large mass of tonsillar tissue compared with the size of the
upper airway. With growth of the airway and regression of lymphoid
tissue during later childhood, there is reduction in prevalence. Then,
as obesity prevalence increases in midlife and females enter menopause,
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea again increases. The course in older
age is unclear; the disorder may level off after age 65 years, but in
other individuals, prevalence may increase with aging. Because there is
some age dependency of the occurrence of apneas and hypopneas,
polysomnographic results must be interpreted in light of other clinical
data. In particular, significant clinical symptoms of insomnia or
hypersomnia should be investigated regardless of the individual's age.
Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea usually has an insidious onset, gradual
progression, and persistent course. Typically the loud snoring has been
present for many years, often since childhood, but an increase in its
severity may lead the individual to seek evaluation. Weight gain may
precipitate an increase in symptoms. Although obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea can occur at any age, it most commonly manifests among
individuals ages 40-- 60 years. Over 4--5 years, the average apnea
hypopnea index increases in adults and older individuals by
approximately two apneas/hypopneas per hour. The apnea hypopnea index is
increased and incident obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is greater among
individuals who are older, who are male, or who have a higher baseline
body mass index (BMI) or increase their BMI over time. Spontaneous
resolution of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has been reported with
weight loss, particularly after bariatric surgery. In children, seasonal
variation in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has been observed, as has
improvement with overall growth. In young children, the signs and
symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may be more subtle than in
adults, making diagnosis more difficult to establish9. Polysomnography
is useful in confirming diagnosis.

Evidence of fragmentation of sleep on the polysomnogram may not be as
apparent as in studies of older individuals, possibly because of the
high homeostatic drive in young individuals. Symptoms such as snoring
are usually parent-reported and thus have reduced sensitivity. Agitated
arousals and unusual sleep postures, such as sleeping on the hands and
knees, may occur. Nocturnal enuresis also may occur and should raise the
suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea if it recurs in a child
who was previously dry at night. Children may also manifest excessive
daytime sleepiness, although this is not as common or pronounced as in
adults. Daytime mouth breathing, difficulty in swallowing, and poor
speech articulation are also common features in children. Children
younger than 5 years more often present with nighttime symptoms, such as
observed apneas or labored breathing, than with behavioral symptoms
(i.e., the nighttime symptoms are more noticeable and more often bring
the child to clinical attention). In children older than 5 years,
daytime symptoms such as sleepiness and behavioral problems (e.g.,
impulsivity and hyperactivity), attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder,
learning difficulties, and morning headaches are more often the focus of
concern. Children with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may present
with failure to thrive and developmental delays10. In young children,
obesity is a less common risk factor, while delayed growth and "failure
to thrive" may be present.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. The major risk
factors for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea are obesity and male
gender8. Others include maxillarymandibular retrognathia or
micrognathia, positive family history of sleep apnea, genetic syndromes
that reduce upper airway patency (e.g., Down's syndrome, Treacher
Collin's syndrome), adenotonsillar hypertrophy (especially in young
children), menopause (in females), and various endocrine syndromes
(e.g., acromegaly). Compared with premenopausal females, males are at
increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, possibly reflecting
the influences of sex hormones on ventilatory control and body fat
distribution, as well as because of gender differences in airway
structure. Medications for mental disorders and medical conditions that
tend to induce somnolence may worsen the course of apnea symptoms if
these medications are not managed carefully.

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea has a strong genetic basis, as
evidenced by the significant familial aggregation of the apnea hypopnea
index. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea is
approximately twice as high among the first-degree relatives of probands
with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea as compared with members of
control families12. One-third of the variance in the apnea hypopnea
index is explained by shared familial factors13. Although genetic
markers with diagnostic or prognostic value are not yet available for
use, eliciting a family history of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea
should increase the clinical suspicion for the disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues There is a potential for sleepiness
and fatigue to be reported differently across cultures. In some groups,
snoring may be considered a sign of health and thus may not trigger
concerns. Individuals of Asian ancestry may be at increased risk for
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea despite relatively low BMI, possibly
reflecting the influence of craniofacial risk factors that narrow the
nasopharynx.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Females may more commonly report
fatigue rather than sleepiness and may underreport snoring.

Diagnostic Markers Polysomnography provides quantitative data on
frequency of sleep-related respiratory disturbances and associated
changes in oxygen saturation and sleep continuity. Polysomnographic
findings in children differ from those in adults in that children
demonstrate labored breathing, partial obstructive hypoventilation with
cyclical desaturations, hypercapnia and paradoxical movements. Apnea
hypopnea index levels as low as 2 are used to define thresholds of
abnormality in children. Arterial blood gas measurements while the
individual is awake are usually normal, but some individuals can have
waking hypoxemia or hypercapnia. This pattern should alert the clinician
to the possibility of coexisting lung disease or hypoventilation.
Imaging procedures may reveal narrowing of the upper airway. Cardiac
testing may show evidence of

impaired ventricular function. Individuals with severe nocturnal oxygen
desaturation may also have elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit values.
Validated sleep measures (e.g., multiple sleep latency test \[MSLT\],
maintenance of wakefulness test) may identify sleepiness.

Functional Consequences of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea More than
50% of individuals with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea report symptoms of daytime sleepiness. A twofold increased risk
of occupational accidents has been reported in association with symptoms
of snoring and sleepiness. Motor vehicle crashes also have been reported
to be as much as sevenfold higher among individuals with elevated apnea
hypopnea index values3, 5, 17. Clinicians should be cognizant of state
government requirements for reporting this disorder, especially in
relationship to commercial drivers. Reduced scores on measures of
healthrelated quality of life are common in individuals with obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea, with the largest decrements observed in the
physical and vitality subscales2.

Differential Diagnosis Primary snoring and other sleep disorders.
Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea must be differentiated
from individuals with primary snoring (i.e., otherwise asymptomatic
individuals who snore and do not have abnormalities on overnight
polysomnography). Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may
additionally report nocturnal gasping and choking. The presence of
sleepiness or other daytime symptoms not explained by other etiologies
suggests the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, but this
differentiation requires polysomnography. Definitive differential
diagnosis between hypersomnia, central sleep apnea, sleep-related
hypoventilation, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also requires
polysomnographic studies. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea must be
differentiated from other causes of sleepiness, such as narcolepsy,
hypersomnia, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Obstructive sleep
apnea hypopnea can be differentiated from narcolepsy by the absence of
cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis and by the
presence of loud snoring,

gasping during sleep, or observed apneas in sleep. Daytime sleep
episodes in narcolepsy are characteristically shorter, more refreshing,
and more often associated with dreaming. Obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea shows characteristic apneas and hypopneas and oxygen
desaturation during nocturnal polysomnographic studies. Narcolepsy
results in multiple sleeponset rapid eye movement (REM) periods during
the MSLT. Narcolepsy, like obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, may be
associated with obesity, and some individuals have concurrent narcolepsy
and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. A diagnosis of narcolepsy does not
exclude the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, as the two
conditions may co-occur. Insomnia disorder. For individuals complaining
of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or early-morning
awakenings, insomnia disorder can be differentiated from obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea by the absence of snoring and the absence of the
history, signs, and symptoms characteristic of the latter disorder.
However, insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may coexist, and
if so, both disorders may need to be addressed concurrently to improve
sleep. Panic attacks. Nocturnal panic attacks may include symptoms of
gasping or choking during sleep that may be difficult to distinguish
clinically from obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. However, the lower
frequency of episodes, intense autonomic arousal, and lack of excessive
sleepiness differentiate nocturnal panic attacks from obstructive sleep
apnea hypopnea. Polysomnography in individuals with nocturnal panic
attacks does not reveal the typical pattern of apneas or oxygen
desaturation characteristic of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.
Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea do not provide a
history of daytime panic attacks. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children may
include symptoms of inattention, academic impairment, hyperactivity, and
internalizing behaviors, all of which may also be symptoms of childhood
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. The presence of other symptoms and
signs of childhood obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea (e.g., labored
breathing or snoring during sleep and adenotonsillar hypertrophy) would
suggest the presence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea and attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder may
commonly co-occur, and there may be causal links between them;
therefore, risk factors such as enlarged tonsils,

obesity, or a family history of sleep apnea may help alert the clinician
to their co-occurrence. Substance/medication-induced insomnia or
hypersomnia. Substance use and substance withdrawal (including
medications) can produce insomnia or hypersomnia. A careful history is
usually sufficient to identify the relevant substance/medication, and
follow-up shows improvement of the sleep disturbance after
discontinuation of the substance/medication. In other cases, the use of
a substance/medication (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
tobacco) has been shown to exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea.
An individual with symptoms and signs consistent with obstructive sleep
apnea hypopnea should receive that diagnosis, even in the presence of
concurrent substance use that is exacerbating the condition.

Comorbidity Systemic hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart
failure, stroke, diabetes, and increased mortality are consistently
associated with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Risk estimates vary
from 30% to as much as 300% for moderate to severe obstructive sleep
apnea hypopnea6, 15, 16. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension and right
heart failure (e.g., cor pulmonale, ankle edema, hepatic congestion) are
rare in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and when present indicate
either very severe disease or associated hypoventilation or
cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also may
occur with increased frequency in association with a number of medical
or neurological conditions (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's
disease). Physical findings reflect the co-occurrence of these
conditions. As many as one-third of individuals referred for evaluation
of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea report symptoms of depression, with
as many of 10% having depression scores consistent with moderate to
severe depression7. Severity of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, as
measured by the apnea hypopnea index, has been found to be correlated
with severity of symptoms of depression1. This association may be
stronger in males than in females.

Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders

The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition
(ICSD-2), differentiates 11 subtypes of "sleep-related breathing

Central Sleep Apnea Diagnostic Criteria a. Evidence by polysomnography
of five or more central apneas per hour of sleep. b. The disorder is not
better explained by another current sleep disorder. Specify whether:
327.21 (G47.31) Idiopathic central sleep apnea: Characterized by
repeated episodes of apneas and hypopneas during sleep caused by
variability in respiratory effort but without evidence of airway
obstruction.

786.04 (R06.3) Cheyne-Stokes breathing: A pattern of periodic
crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central
apneas and hypopneas at a frequency of at least five events per hour,
accompanied by frequent arousal. 780.57 (G47.37) Central sleep apnea
comorbid with opioid use: The pathogenesis of this subtype is attributed
to the effects of opioids on the respiratory rhythm generators in the
medulla as well as the differential effects on hypoxic versus
hypercapnic respiratory drive. Coding note (for 780.57 \[G47.37\] code
only): When an opioid use disorder is present, first code the opioid use
disorder: 305.50 (F11.10) mild opioid use disorder or 304.00 (F11.20)
moderate or severe opioid use disorder; then code 780.57 (G47.37)
central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use. When an opioid use
disorder is not present (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the
substance), code only 780.57 (G47.37) central sleep apnea comorbid with
opioid use. Note: See the section "Diagnostic Features" in text. Specify
current severity: Severity of central sleep apnea is graded according to
the frequency of the breathing disturbances as well as the extent of
associated oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation that occur as a
consequence of repetitive respiratory disturbances.

Subtypes Idiopathic central sleep apnea and Cheyne-Stokes breathing are
characterized by increased gain of the ventilatory control system, also
referred to as high loop gain, which leads to instability in ventilation
and PaCO2 levels. This instability is termed periodic breathing and can
be recognized by hyperventilation alternating with hypoventilation.
Individuals with these disorders typically have pCO2 levels while awake
that are slightly hypocapneic or normocapneic2. Central sleep apnea may
also manifest during initiation of treatment of obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea or may occur in association with obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea syndrome (termed complex sleep apnea). The occurrence of
central sleep apnea in association with obstructive sleep apnea is also
considered to be due to high loop gain. In contrast, the pathogenesis of
central sleep apnea

comorbid with opioid use has been attributed to the effects of opioids
on the respiratory rhythm generators in the medulla as well as to its
differential effects on hypoxic versus hypercapneic respiratory drive.
These individuals may have elevated pCO2 levels while awake. Individuals
receiving chronic methadone maintenance therapy have been noted to have
increased somnolence and depression, although the role of breathing
disorders associated with opioid medication in causing these problems
has not been studied4.

Specifiers An increase in the central apnea index (i.e., number of
central apneas per hour of sleep) reflects an increase in severity of
central sleep apnea. Sleep continuity and quality may be markedly
impaired with reductions in restorative stages of non--rapid eye
movement (REM) sleep (i.e., decreased slow-wave sleep \[stage N3\]). In
individuals with severe Cheyne-Stokes breathing, the pattern can also be
observed during resting wakefulness, a finding that is thought to be a
poor prognostic marker for mortality.

Diagnostic Features Central sleep apnea disorders are characterized by
repeated episodes of apneas and hypopneas during sleep caused by
variability in respiratory effort. These are disorders of ventilatory
control in which respiratory events occur in a periodic or intermittent
pattern. Idiopathic central sleep apnea is characterized by sleepiness,
insomnia, and awakenings due to dyspnea in association with five or more
central apneas per hour of sleep1. Central sleep apnea occurring in
individuals with heart failure, stroke, or renal failure typically have
a breathing pattern called Cheyne-Stokes breathing, which is
characterized by a pattern of periodic crescendo-decrescendo variation
in tidal volume that results in central apneas and hypopneas occurring
at a frequency of at least five events per hour that are accompanied by
frequent arousals1. Central and obstructive sleep apneas may coexist;
the ratio of central to obstructive apneas/hypopneas may be used to
identify which condition is predominant. Alterations in neuromuscular
control of breathing can occur in association with medications or
substances used in individuals with mental health conditions, which can
cause or exacerbate impairments of respiratory

rhythm and ventilation. Individuals taking these medications have a
sleeprelated breathing disorder that could contribute to sleep
disturbances and symptoms such as sleepiness, confusion, and depression.
Specifically, chronic use of long-acting opioid medications is often
associated with impairment of respiratory control leading to central
sleep apnea.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with central sleep
apnea hypopneas can manifest with sleepiness or insomnia2. There can be
complaints of sleep fragmentation, including awakening with dyspnea1, 8.
Some individuals are asymptomatic. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea can
coexist with Cheyne-Stokes breathing, and thus snoring and abruptly
terminating apneas may be observed during sleep.

Prevalence The prevalence of idiopathic central sleep apnea is unknown
but thought to be rare. The prevalence of Cheyne-Stokes breathing is
high in individuals with depressed cardiac ventricular ejection
fraction. In individuals with an ejection fraction of less than 45%, the
prevalence has been reported to be 20% or higher8. The male-to-female
ratio for prevalence is even more highly skewed toward males than for
obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. Prevalence increases with age, and
most patients are older than 60 years. Cheyne-Stokes breathing occurs in
approximately 20% of individuals with acute stroke3, 8. Central sleep
apnea comorbid with opioid use occurs in approximately 30% of
individuals taking chronic opioids for nonmalignant pain and similarly
in individuals receiving methadone maintenance therapy5, 6.

Development and Course The onset of Cheyne-Stokes breathing appears tied
to the development of heart failure. The Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern
is associated with oscillations in heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen
desaturation, and elevated sympathetic nervous system activity that can
promote progression of heart failure8. The clinical significance of
Cheyne-Stokes breathing in the setting of stroke is not known, but
Cheyne-Stokes breathing may be a transient finding that resolves with
time after acute stroke3. Central sleep

apnea comorbid with opioid use has been documented with chronic use
(i.e., several months)1.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Cheyne-Stokes
breathing is frequently present in individuals with heart failure. The
coexistence of atrial fibrillation further increases risk, as do older
age and male gender8. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is also seen in
association with acute stroke and possibly renal failure1, 2, 8. The
underlying ventilatory instability in the setting of heart failure has
been attributed to increased ventilatory chemosensitivity and
hyperventilation due to pulmonary vascular congestion and circulatory
delay2, 8. Central sleep apnea is seen in individuals taking long-acting
opioids.

Diagnostic Markers Physical findings seen in individuals with a
Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern relate to its risk factors. Findings
consistent with heart failure, such as jugular venous distension, S3
heart sound, lung crackles, and lower extremity edema, may be present.
Polysomnography is used to characterize the breathing characteristics of
each breathing-related sleep disorder subtype. Central sleep apneas are
recorded when periods of breathing cessation for longer than 10 seconds
occur. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterized by a pattern of periodic
crescendo-decrescendo variation in tidal volume that results in central
apneas and hypopneas occurring at a frequency of at least five events
per hour that are accompanied by frequent arousals1. The cycle length of
Cheyne-Stokes breathing (or time from end of one central apnea to the
end of the next apnea) is about 60 seconds.

Functional Consequences of Central Sleep Apnea Idiopathic central sleep
apnea has been reported to cause symptoms of disrupted sleep, including
insomnia and sleepiness. Cheyne-Stokes breathing with comorbid heart
failure has been associated with excessive sleepiness, fatigue, and
insomnia, although many individuals may be asymptomatic1, 2. Coexistence
of heart failure and Cheyne-Stokes breathing may be associated with
increased cardiac arrhythmias and increased mortality or cardiac
transplantation8. Individuals with central sleep apnea

comorbid with opioid use may present with symptoms of sleepiness or
insomnia.

Differential Diagnosis Idiopathic central sleep apnea must be
distinguished from other breathingrelated sleep disorders, other sleep
disorders, and medical conditions and mental disorders that cause sleep
fragmentation, sleepiness, and fatigue1. This is achieved using
polysomnography. Other breathing-related sleep disorders and sleep
disorders. Central sleep apnea can be distinguished from obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea by the presence of at least five central apneas per
hour of sleep. These conditions may co-occur, but central sleep apnea is
considered to predominate when the ratio of central to obstructive
respiratory events exceeds 50%. Cheyne-Stokes breathing can be
distinguished from other mental disorders, including other sleep
disorders, and other medical conditions that cause sleep fragmentation,
sleepiness, and fatigue based on the presence of a predisposing
condition (e.g., heart failure or stroke) and signs and polysomnographic
evidence of the characteristic breathing pattern. Polysomnographic
respiratory findings can help distinguish Cheyne-Stokes breathing from
insomnia due to other medical conditions. High-altitude periodic
breathing has a pattern that resembles Cheyne-Stokes breathing but has a
shorter cycle time, occurs only at high altitude, and is not associated
with heart failure. Central sleep apnea comorbid with opioid use can be
differentiated from other types of breathing-related sleep disorders
based on the use of longacting opioid medications in conjunction with
polysomnographic evidence of central apneas and periodic or ataxic
breathing1. It can be distinguished from insomnia due to drug or
substance use based on polysomnographic evidence of central sleep apnea.

Comorbidity Central sleep apnea disorders are frequently present in
users of long-acting opioids, such as methadone4, 5, 6, 7. Individuals
taking these medications have a sleep-related breathing disorder that
could contribute to sleep disturbances and symptoms such as sleepiness,
confusion, and depression4.

While the individual is asleep, breathing patterns such as central
apneas, periodic apneas, and ataxic breathing may be observed.
Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may coexist with central sleep apnea,
and features consistent with this condition can also be present (see
"Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea" earlier in this chapter).
Cheyne-Stokes breathing is more commonly observed in association with
conditions that include heart failure, stroke, and renal failure1 and is
seen more frequently in individuals with atrial fibrillation.
Individuals with Cheyne-Stokes breathing are more likely to be older, to
be male, and to have lower weight than individuals with obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea.

Sleep-Related Hypoventilation Diagnostic Criteria

a. Polysomnograpy demonstrates episodes of decreased respiration
associated with elevated CO2 levels. (Note: In the absence of objective
measurement of CO2, persistent low levels of hemoglobin oxygen
saturation unassociated with apneic/hypopneic events may indicate
hypoventilation.) b. The disturbance is not better explained by another
current sleep disorder. Specify whether: 327.24 (G47.34) Idiopathic
hypoventilation: This subtype is not attributable to any readily
identified condition. 327.25 (G47.35) Congenital central alveolar
hypoventilation: This subtype is a rare congenital disorder in which the
individual typically presents in the perinatal period with shallow
breathing, or cyanosis and apnea during sleep. 327.26 (G47.36) Comorbid
sleep-related hypoventilation: This subtype occurs as a consequence of a
medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder (e.g., interstitial lung
disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or a neuromuscular or
chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular dystrophies, postpolio syndrome,
cervical spinal cord injury, kyphoscoliosis), or medications (e.g.,
benzodiazepines, opiates). It also occurs with obesity (obesity
hypoventilation disorder), where it reflects a combination of increased
work of breathing due to reduced chest wall compliance and
ventilation-perfusion mismatch and variably reduced ventilatory drive.
Such individuals usually are characterized by body mass index of greater
than 30 and hypercapnia during wakefulness (with a pCO2 of greater than
45), without other evidence of hypoventilation. Specify current
severity: Severity is graded according to the degree of hypoxemia and
hypercarbia present during sleep and evidence of end organ impairment
due to these abnormalities (e.g., right-sided heart failure). The
presence of blood gas abnormalities during wakefulness is an indicator
of greater severity.

Subtypes Regarding obesity hypoventilation disorder, the prevalence of
obesity hypoventilation in the general population is not known but is
thought to be increasing in association with the increased prevalence of
obesity and extreme obesity.

Diagnostic Features Sleep-related hypoventilation can occur
independently or, more frequently, comorbid with medical or neurological
disorders, medication use, or substance use disorder1. Although symptoms
are not mandatory to make this diagnosis, individuals often report
excessive daytime sleepiness, frequent arousals and awakenings during
sleep, morning headaches, and insomnia complaints.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with sleep-related
hypoventilation can present with sleeprelated complaints of insomnia or
sleepiness1, 2. Episodes of orthopnea can occur in individuals with
diaphragm weakness. Headaches upon awakening may be present. During
sleep, episodes of shallow breathing may be observed, and obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea or central sleep apnea may coexist. Consequences of
ventilatory insufficiency, including pulmonary hypertension, cor
pulmonale (right heart failure), polycythemia, and neurocognitive
dysfunction, can be present1, 2. With progression of ventilatory
insufficiency, blood gas abnormalities extend into wakefulness. Features
of the medical condition causing sleep-related hypoventilation can also
be present. Episodes of hypoventilation may be associated with frequent
arousals or bradytachycardia. Individuals may complain of excessive
sleepiness and insomnia or morning headaches or may present with
findings of neurocognitive dysfunction or depression2. Hypoventilation
may not be present during wakefulness.

Prevalence Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation in adults is very
uncommon. The prevalence of congenital central alveolar hypoventilation
is unknown, but the disorder is rare. Comorbid sleep-related
hypoventilation (i.e., hypoventilation comorbid with other conditions,
such as chronic obstructive

pulmonary disease \[COPD\], neuromuscular disorders, or obesity) is more
common.

Development and Course Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is
thought to be a slowly progressive disorder of respiratory impairment1.
When this disorder occurs comorbidly with other disorders (e.g., COPD,
neuromuscular disorders, obesity), disease severity reflects the
severity of the underlying condition, and the disorder progresses as the
condition worsens. Complications such as pulmonary hypertension, cor
pulmonale, cardiac dysrhythmias, polycythemia, neurocognitive
dysfunction, and worsening respiratory failure can develop with
increasing severity of blood gas abnormalities2. Congenital central
alveolar hypoventilation usually manifests at birth with shallow,
erratic, or absent breathing. This disorder can also manifest during
infancy, childhood, and adulthood because of variable penetrance of the
PHOX2B mutation. Children with congenital central alveolar
hypoventilation are more likely to have disorders of the autonomic
nervous system, Hirschsprung's disease, neural crest tumors, and
characteristic boxshaped face (i.e., the face is short relative to its
width)6.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Ventilatory drive can be
reduced in individuals using central nervous system depressants,
including benzodiazepines, opiates, and alcohol. Genetic and
physiological. Idiopathic sleep-related hypoventilation is associated
with reduced ventilatory drive1, 2 due to a blunted chemoresponsiveness
to CO2 (reduced respiratory drive; i.e., "won't breathe"), reflecting
underlying neurological deficits in centers governing the control of
ventilation1. More commonly, sleep-related hypoventilation is comorbid
with another medical condition, such as a pulmonary disorder, a
neuromuscular or chest wall disorder, or hypothyroidism, or with use of
medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, opiates)2. In these conditions, the
hypoventilation may be a consequence of increased work of breathing
and/or impairment of respiratory muscle function (i.e., "can't breathe")
or reduced respiratory drive (i.e., "won't breathe")2.

Neuromuscular disorders influence breathing through impairment of
respiratory motor innervation or respiratory muscle function. They
include conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord
injury, diaphragmatic paralysis, myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton
syndrome, toxic or metabolic myopathies, postpolio syndrome, and
Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome2. Congenital central alveolar
hypoventilation is a genetic disorder attributable to mutations of
PHOX2B, a gene that is crucial for the development of the embryonic
autonomic nervous system and neural crest derivatives3. Children with
congenital central alveolar hypoventilation show blunted ventilatory
responses to hypercapnia, especially in non--rapid eye movement sleep.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Gender distributions for sleep-related
hypoventilation occurring in association with comorbid conditions
reflect the gender distributions of the comorbid conditions. For
example, COPD is more frequently present in males and with increasing
age.

Diagnostic Markers Sleep-related hypoventilation is diagnosed using
polysomnography showing sleep-related hypoxemia and hypercapnia that is
not better explained by another breathing-related sleep disorder. The
documentation of increased arterial pCO2 levels to greater than 55 mmHg
during sleep or a 10 mmHg or greater increase in pCO2 levels (to a level
that also exceeds 50 mmHg) during sleep in comparison to awake supine
values, for 10 minutes or longer, is the gold standard for diagnosis.
However, obtaining arterial blood gas determinations during sleep is
impractical, and non-invasive measures of pCO2 have not been adequately
validated during sleep and are not widely used during polysomnography in
adults4. Prolonged and sustained decreases in oxygen saturation (oxygen
saturation of less than 90% for more than 5 minutes with a nadir of at
least 85%, or oxygen saturation of less than 90% for at least 30% of
sleep time) in the absence of evidence of upper airway obstruction are
often used as an indication of sleep-related hypoventilation; however,
this finding is not specific, as there are other potential causes of
hypoxemia, such as that due to lung disease5.

Functional Consequences Hypoventilation

of

Sleep-Related

The consequences of sleep-related hypoventilation are related to the
effects of chronic exposure to hypercapnia and hypoxemia. These blood
gas derangements cause vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature
leading to pulmonary hypertension, which, if severe, can result in
right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale). Hypoxemia can lead to
dysfunction of organs such as the brain, blood, and heart, leading to
outcomes such as cognitive dysfunction, polycythemia, and cardiac
arrhythmias2. Hypercapnia can depress ventilatory drive, leading to
progressive respiratory failure.

Differential Diagnosis Other medical conditions affecting ventilation.
In adults, the idiopathic variety of sleep-related hypoventilation is
very uncommon and is determined by excluding the presence of lung
diseases, skeletal malformations, neuromuscular disorders, and other
medical and neurological disorders or medications that affect
ventilation1. Sleep-related hypoventilation must be distinguished from
other causes of sleep-related hypoxemia, such as that due to lung
disease. Other breathing-related sleep disorders. Sleep-related
hypoventilation can be distinguished from obstructive sleep apnea
hypopnea and central sleep apnea based on clinical features and findings
on polysomnography. Sleep-related hypoventilation typically shows more
sustained periods of oxygen desaturation rather that the periodic
episodes seen in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep
apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea and central sleep apnea also
show a pattern of discrete episodes of repeated airflow decreases that
can be absent in sleep-related hypoventilation.

Comorbidity Sleep-related hypoventilation often occurs in association
with a pulmonary disorder (e.g., interstitial lung disease, COPD), with
a neuromuscular or chest wall disorder (e.g., muscular dystrophies,
post-polio syndrome, cervical spinal cord injury, obesity,
kyphoscoliosis), or, most relevant to the mental health provider, with
medication use (e.g., benzodiazepines,

opiates)2. Congenital central alveolar hypoventilation often occurs in
association with autonomic dysfunction and may occur in association with
Hirschsprung's disease. COPD, a disorder of lower airway obstruction
usually associated with cigarette smoking, can result in sleep-related
hypoventilation and hypoxemia. The presence of coexisting obstructive
sleep apnea hypopnea is thought to exacerbate hypoxemia and hypercapnia
during sleep and wakefulness. The relationship between congenital
central alveolar hypoventilation and idiopathic sleep-related
hypoventilation is unclear; in some individuals, idiopathic
sleep-related hypoventilation may represent cases of late-onset
congenital central alveolar hypoventilation.

Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders The
International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2),
combines sleep-related hypoventilation and sleep-related hypoxemia under
the category of sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes1. This
approach to classification reflects the frequent co-occurrence of
disorders that lead to hypoventilation and hypoxemia. In contrast, the
classification used in DSM-5 reflects evidence that there are distinct
sleep-related pathogenetic processes leading to hypoventilation.

Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders Diagnostic Criteria a. A
persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that is primarily
due to an alteration of the circadian system or to a misalignment
between the endogenous circadian rhythm and the sleep--wake schedule
required by an individual's physical environment or social or
professional schedule. b. The sleep disruption leads to excessive
sleepiness or insomnia, or both. c. The sleep disturbance causes
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
and other important areas of functioning. Coding note: For ICD-9-CM,
code 307.45 for all subtypes. For ICD-10CM, code is based on subtype.
Specify whether: 307.45 (G47.21) Delayed sleep phase type: A pattern of
delayed sleep onset and awakening times, with an inability to fall
asleep and awaken at a desired or conventionally acceptable earlier
time. Specify if: Familial: A family history of delayed sleep phase is
present. Specify if: Overlapping with non-24-hour sleep-wake type:
Delayed sleep phase type may overlap with another circadian rhythm
sleep-wake disorder, non-24-hour sleep-wake type.

307.45 (G47.22) Advanced sleep phase type: A pattern of advanced sleep
onset and awakening times, with an inability to remain awake or asleep
until the desired or conventionally acceptable later sleep or wake
times. Specify if: Familial: A family history of advanced sleep phase is
present. 307.45 (G47.23) Irregular sleep-wake type: A temporally
disorganized sleep-wake pattern, such that the timing of sleep and wake
periods is variable throughout the 24-hour period. 307.45 (G47.24)
Non-24-hour sleep-wake type: A pattern of sleepwake cycles that is not
synchronized to the 24-hour environment, with a consistent daily drift
(usually to later and later times) of sleep onset and wake times. 307.45
(G47.26) Shift work type: Insomnia during the major sleep period and/or
excessive sleepiness (including inadvertent sleep) during the major
awake period associated with a shift work schedule (i.e., requiring
unconventional work hours). 307.45 (G47.20) Unspecified type Specify if:
Episodic: Symptoms last at least 1 month but less than 3 months.
Persistent: Symptoms last 3 months or longer. Recurrent: Two or more
episodes occur within the space of 1 year.

Delayed Sleep Phase Type Diagnostic Features The delayed sleep phase
type is based primarily on a history of a delay in the timing of the
major sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to the
desired sleep and wake-up time, resulting in symptoms of insomnia and
excessive sleepiness. When allowed to set their own schedule,
individuals with delayed sleep phase type exhibit normal sleep quality
and duration for age. Symptoms of sleep-onset insomnia, difficulty
waking in the morning, and excessive early day sleepiness are prominent.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Common associated features of delayed sleep phase type include a history
of mental disorders or a concurrent mental disorder. Extreme and
prolonged difficulty awakening with morning confusion is also common.
Psychophysiological insomnia may develop as a result of maladaptive
behaviors that impair sleep and increase arousal because of repeated
attempts to fall asleep at an earlier time.

Prevalence Prevalence of delayed sleep phase type in the general
population is approximately 0.17%7 but appears to be greater than 7% in
adolescents5. Although the prevalence of familial delayed sleep phase
type has not been established, a family history of delayed sleep phase
is present in individuals with delayed sleep phase type.

Development and Course Course is persistent, lasting longer than 3
months, with intermittent exacerbations throughout adulthood. Although
age at onset is variable, symptoms begin typically in adolescence and
early adulthood and persist for several months to years before diagnosis
is established. Severity may decrease with age. Relapse of symptoms is
common. Clinical expression may vary across the lifespan depending on
social, school, and work obligations. Exacerbation is usually triggered
by a change in work or school schedule that requires an early rise time.
Individuals who can alter their work schedules to accommodate the
delayed circadian sleep and wake timing can experience remission of
symptoms. Increased prevalence in adolescence may be a consequence of
both physiological and behavioral factors4. Hormonal changes may be
involved specifically, as delayed sleep phase is associated with the
onset of puberty6. Thus, delayed sleep phase type in adolescents should
be differentiated from the common delay in the timing of circadian
rhythms in this age group. In the familial form, the course is
persistent and may not improve significantly with age.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Predisposing
factors may include a longer than average circadian period, changes in
light sensitivity, and impaired

homeostatic sleep drive. Some individuals with delayed sleep phase type
may be hypersensitive to evening light, which can serve as a delay
signal to the circadian clock1, or they may be hyposensitive to morning
light such that its phase-advancing effects are reduced. Genetic factors
may play a role in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic forms of
delayed sleep phase type, including mutations in circadian genes (e.g.,
PER3, CKIe)2, 8.

Diagnostic Markers Confirmation of the diagnosis includes a complete
history and use of a sleep diary or actigraphy (i.e., a wrist-worn
motion detector that monitors motor activity for prolonged periods and
can be used as a proxy for sleepwake patterns for at least 7 days). The
period covered should include weekends, when social and occupational
obligations are less strict, to ensure that the individual exhibits a
consistently delayed sleep-wake pattern. Biomarkers such as salivary dim
light melatonin onset should be obtained only when the diagnosis is
unclear.

Functional Consequences of Delayed Sleep Phase Type Excessive early day
sleepiness is prominent. Extreme and prolonged difficulty awakening with
morning confusion (i.e., sleep inertia) is also common. The severity of
insomnia and excessive sleepiness symptoms varies substantially among
individuals and largely depends on the occupational and social demands
on the individual.

Differential Diagnosis Normative variations in sleep. Delayed sleep
phase type must be distinguished from "normal" sleep patterns in which
an individual has a late schedule that does not cause personal, social,
or occupational distress (most commonly seen in adolescents and young
adults). Other sleep disorders. Insomnia disorder and other circadian
rhythm sleep-wake disorders should be included in the differential.
Excessive sleepiness may also be caused by other sleep disturbances,
such as breathing-related sleep disorders, insomnias, sleep-related
movement disorders, and medical, neurological, and mental disorders.
Overnight

polysomnography may help in evaluating for other comorbid sleep
disorders, such as sleep apnea. The circadian nature of delayed sleep
phase type, however, should differentiate it from other disorders with
similar complaints.

Comorbidity Delayed sleep phase type is strongly associated with
depression, personality disorder, and somatic symptom disorder or
illness anxiety disorder3. In addition, comorbid sleep disorders, such
as insomnia disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea, as well
as depressive and bipolar disorders and anxiety disorders, can
exacerbate symptoms of insomnia and excessive sleepiness. Delayed sleep
phase type may overlap with another circadian rhythm sleep-wake
disorder, non-24-hour sleep-wake type. Sighted individuals with
non-24-hour sleep-wake type disorder commonly also have a history of
delayed circadian sleep phase.

Advanced Sleep Phase Type Specifiers Advanced sleep phase type may be
documented with the specified "familial." Although the prevalence of
familial advanced sleep phase type has not been established, a family
history of advanced sleep phase is present in individuals with advanced
sleep phase type. In this type, specific mutations demonstrate an
autosomal dominant mode of inheritance2, 4. In the familial form, onset
of symptoms may occur earlier (during childhood and early adulthood),
the course is persistent, and the severity of symptoms may increase with
age.

Diagnostic Features Advanced sleep phase type is characterized by
sleep-wake times that are several hours earlier than desired or
conventional times. Diagnosis is based primarily on a history of an
advance in the timing of the major sleep period (usually more than 2
hours) in relation to the desired sleep and wake-up time, with symptoms
of early morning insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. When allowed
to set their schedule, individuals with advanced sleep phase type will
exhibit normal sleep quality and duration for age.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with advanced sleep
phase type are "morning types," having earlier sleep-wake times, with
the timing of circadian biomarkers such as melatonin and core body
temperature rhythms occurring 2--4 hours earlier than normal3. When
required to keep a conventional schedule requiring a delay of bedtime,
these individuals will continue to have an early rise time, leading to
persistent sleep deprivation and daytime sleepiness. Use of hypnotics or
alcohol to combat sleep-maintenance insomnia and stimulants to reduce
daytime sleepiness may lead to substance abuse in these individuals.

Prevalence The estimated prevalence of advanced sleep phase type is
approximately 1% in middle-age adults1. Sleep-wake times and circadian
phase advance in

older individuals, probably accounting for increased prevalence in this
population.

Development and Course Onset is usually in late adulthood. In the
familial form, onset can be earlier. The course is typically persistent,
lasting more than 3 months, but the severity may increase depending on
work and social schedules. The advanced sleep phase type is more common
in older adults. Clinical expression may vary across the lifespan
depending on social, school, and work obligations. Individuals who can
alter their work schedules to accommodate the advanced circadian sleep
and wake timing can experience remission of symptoms. Increasing age
tends to advance the sleep phase, however, it is unclear whether the
common age-associated advanced sleep phase type is due solely to a
change in circadian timing (as seen in the familial form) or also to
age-related changes in the homeostatic regulation of sleep, resulting in
earlier awakening. Severity, remission, and relapse of symptoms suggest
lack of adherence to behavioral and environmental treatments designed to
control sleep and wake structure and light exposure.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Decreased late
afternoon/early evening exposure to light and/or exposure to early
morning light due to early morning awakening can increase the risk of
advanced sleep phase type by advancing circadian rhythms. By going to
bed early, these individuals are not exposed to light in the phase delay
region of the curve, resulting in perpetuation of advanced phase3. In
familial advanced sleep phase type, a shortening of the endogenous
circadian period2 can result in an advanced sleep phase, although
circadian period does not appear to systematically decrease with age.
Genetic and physiological. Advanced sleep phase type has demonstrated an
autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, including a PER2 gene mutation
causing hypophosphorylation of the PER2 protein and a missense mutation
in CKI6, 7.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

African Americans may have a shorter circadian period and larger
magnitude phase advances to light than do Caucasians, possibly
increasing the risk for development of advanced sleep phase type in this
population5.

Diagnostic Markers A sleep diary and actigraphy may be used as
diagnostic markers, as described earlier for delayed sleep phase type.

Functional Consequences of Advanced Sleep Phase Type Excessive
sleepiness associated with advanced sleep phase can have a negative
effect on cognitive performance, social interaction, and safety. Use of
wake-promoting agents to combat sleepiness or sedatives for early
morning awakening may increase potential for substance abuse.

Differential Diagnosis Other sleep disorders. Behavioral factors such as
irregular sleep schedules, voluntary early awakening, and exposure to
light in the early morning should be considered, particularly in older
adults. Careful attention should be paid to rule out other sleep-wake
disorders, such as insomnia disorder, and other mental disorders and
medical conditions that can cause early morning awakening. Depressive
and bipolar disorders. Because early morning awakening, fatigue, and
sleepiness are prominent features of major depressive disorder,
depressive and bipolar disorders must also be considered.

Comorbidity Medical conditions and mental disorders with the symptom of
early morning awakening, such as insomnia, can co-occur with the advance
sleep phase type.

Irregular Sleep-Wake Type Diagnostic Features The diagnosis of irregular
sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of symptoms of insomnia
at night (during the usual sleep period) and excessive sleepiness
(napping) during the day. Irregular sleep-wake type is characterized by
a lack of discernible sleep-wake circadian rhythm. There is no major
sleep period, and sleep is fragmented into at least three periods during
the 24-hour day.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with irregular
sleep-wake type typically present with insomnia or excessive sleepiness,
depending on the time of day. Sleep and wake periods across 24 hours are
fragmented, although the longest sleep period tends to occur between
2:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M. and is usually less than 4 hours. A history of
isolation or reclusion may occur in association with the disorder and
contribute to the symptoms via a lack of external stimuli to help
entrain a normal pattern. Individuals or their caregivers report
frequent naps throughout the day. Irregular sleep-wake type is most
commonly

associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as major
neurocognitive disorder, and many neurodevelopmental disorders in
children.

Prevalence Prevalence of irregular sleep-wake type in the general
population is unknown.

Development and Course The course of irregular sleep-wake type is
persistent. Age at onset is variable, but the disorder is more common in
older adults.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Neurodegenerative disorders,
such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's
disease, and neurodevelopmental disorders in children increase the risk
for irregular sleep-wake type. Environmental. Decreased exposure to
environmental light and structured daytime activity can be associated
with a low-amplitude circadian rhythm. Hospitalized individuals are
especially prone to such weak external entraining stimuli, and even
outside the hospital setting, individuals with major neurocognitive
disorder (i.e., dementia) are exposed to significantly less bright
light1, 2.

Diagnostic Markers A detailed sleep history and a sleep diary (by a
caregiver) or actigraphy help confirm the irregular sleep-wake pattern.

Functional Consequences of Irregular Sleep-Wake Type Lack of a clearly
discernible major sleep and wake period in irregular sleepwake type
results in insomnia or excessive sleepiness, depending on the time of
day. Disruption of the caregiver's sleep also often occurs and is an
important consideration.

Differential Diagnosis

Normative variations in sleep. Irregular sleep-wake type should be
distinguished from a voluntary irregular sleep-wake schedule and poor
sleep hygiene, which can result in insomnia and excessive sleepiness.
Other medical conditions and mental disorders. Other causes of insomnia
and daytime sleepiness, including comorbid medical conditions and mental
disorders or medication, should be considered.

Comorbidity Irregular sleep-wake type is often comorbid with
neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as major
neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder), and traumatic brain injury3. It is also
comorbid with other medical conditions and mental disorders in which
there is social isolation and/or lack of light and structured
activities.

Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Type Diagnostic Features The diagnosis of
non-24-hour sleep-wake type is based primarily on a history of symptoms
of insomnia or excessive sleepiness related to abnormal synchronization
between the 24-hour light-dark cycle and the endogenous circadian
rhythm. Individuals typically present with periods of insomnia,
excessive sleepiness, or both, which alternate with short asymptomatic
periods. Starting with the asymptomatic period, when the individual's
sleep phase is aligned to the external environment, sleep latency will
gradually increase and the individual will complain of sleep-

onset insomnia. As the sleep phase continues to drift so that sleep time
is now in the daytime, the individual will have trouble staying awake
during the day and will complain of sleepiness. Because the circadian
period is not aligned to the external 24-hour environment, symptoms will
depend on when an individual tries to sleep in relation to the circadian
rhythm of sleep propensity.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Non-24-hour sleep-wake type is
most common among blind or visually impaired individuals who have
decreased light perception. In sighted individuals, there is often a
history of delayed sleep phase and of decreased exposure to light and
structured social and physical activity. Sighted individuals with
non-24-hour sleep-wake type also demonstrate increased sleep duration2,
4.

Prevalence Prevalence of non-24-hour sleep-wake type in the general
population is unclear, but the disorder appears rare in sighted
individuals. The prevalence in blind individuals is estimated to be
50%3.

Development and Course Course of non-24-hour sleep-wake type is
persistent, with intermittent remission and exacerbations due to changes
in work and social schedules throughout the lifespan. Age at onset is
variable, depending on the onset of visual impairment. In sighted
individuals, because of the overlap with delayed sleep phase type,
non-24-hour sleep-wake type may develop in adolescence or early
adulthood. Remission and relapse of symptoms in blind and sighted
individuals largely depend on adherence to treatments designed to
control sleep and wake structure and light exposure. Clinical expression
may vary across the lifespan depending on social, school, and work
obligations. In adolescents and adults, irregular sleepwake schedules
and exposure to light or lack of light at critical times of the day can
exacerbate the effects of sleep loss and disrupt circadian entrainment.
Consequently, symptoms of insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and school,
professional, and interpersonal functioning may worsen.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. In sighted individuals,
decreased exposure or sensitivity to light and social and physical
activity cues may contribute to a freerunning circadian rhythm. With the
high frequency of mental disorders involving social isolation and cases
of non-24-hour sleep-wake type developing after a change in sleep habits
(e.g., night shift work, job loss), behavioral factors in combination
with physiological tendency may precipitate and perpetuate this disorder
in sighted individuals. Hospitalized individuals with neurological and
psychiatric disorders can become insensitive to social cues,
predisposing them to the development of non-24hour sleep-wake type.
Genetic and physiological. Blindness is a risk factor for non-24-hour
sleep-wake type. Non-24-hour sleep-wake type has been associated with
traumatic brain injury1.

Diagnostic Markers Diagnosis is confirmed by history and sleep diary or
actigraphy for an extended period. Sequential measurement of phase
markers (e.g., melatonin) can help determine circadian phase in both
sighted and blind individuals.

Functional Consequences of Non-24-Hour SleepWake Type Complaints of
insomnia (sleep onset and sleep maintenance), excessive sleepiness, or
both are prominent. The unpredictability of sleep and wake times
(typically a daily delay drift) results in an inability to attend school
or maintain a steady job and may increase potential for social
isolation.

Differential Diagnosis Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. In sighted
individuals, non-24hour sleep-wake type should be differentiated from
delayed sleep phase type, as individuals with delayed sleep phase type
may display a similar progressive delay in sleep period for several
days.

Depressive disorders

Depressive symptoms and depressive disorders may result in similar
circadian dysregulation and symptoms.

Comorbidity Blindness is often comorbid with non-24-hour sleep-wake
type, as are depressive and bipolar disorders with social isolation.

Shift Work Type Diagnostic Features Diagnosis is primarily based on a
history of the individual working outside of the normal 8:00 A.M. to
6:00 P.M. daytime window (particularly at night) on a regularly
scheduled (i.e., non-overtime) basis. Symptoms of excessive sleepiness
at work, and impaired sleep at home, on a persistent basis are
prominent. Presence of both sets of symptoms are usually required for a
diagnosis of shift work type6. Typically, when the individual reverts to
a day-work routine, symptoms resolve. Although the etiology is slightly
different, individuals who travel across many time zones on a very
frequent basis may experience effects similar to those experienced by
individuals with shift work type who work rotating shifts.

Prevalence

The prevalence of shift work type is unclear, but the disorder is
estimated to affect 5%--10% of the night worker population (16%--20% of
the workforce)1, 4. Prevalence rises with advancement into middle-age
and beyond (Drake et al. 2004).

Development and Course Shift work type can appear in individuals of any
age but is more prevalent in individuals older than 50 years and
typically worsens with the passage of time if the disruptive work hours
persist. Although older adults may show similar rates of circadian phase
adjustment to a change in routine as do younger adults, they appear to
experience significantly more sleep disruption as a consequence of the
circadian phase shift5.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Predisposing factors include
a morning-type disposition, a need for long (i.e., more than 8 hours)
sleep durations in order to feel well rested, and strong competing
social and domestic needs (e.g., parents of young children). Individuals
who are able to commit to a nocturnal lifestyle, with few competing
day-oriented demands, appear at lower risk for shift work type. Genetic
and physiological. Because shift workers are more likely than day
workers to be obese, obstructive sleep apnea may be present and may
exacerbate the symptoms.

Diagnostic Markers A history and sleep diary or actigraphy may be useful
in diagnosis, as discussed earlier for delayed sleep phase type.

Functional Consequences of Shift Work Type Individuals with shift work
type not only may perform poorly at work but also appear to be at risk
for accidents both at work and on the drive home2. They may also be at
risk for poor mental health (e.g., alcohol use disorder, substance use
disorder, depression) and physical health (e.g., gastrointestinal
disorders, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer)3. Individuals with
a history of bipolar disorder are particularly vulnerable to

shift work type--related episodes of mania resulting from missed nights
of sleep. Shift work type often results in interpersonal problems.

Differential Diagnosis Normative variations in sleep with shift work.
The diagnosis of shift work type, as opposed to the "normal"
difficulties of shift work, must depend to some extent on the severity
of symptoms and/or level of distress experienced by the individual.
Presence of shift work type symptoms even when the individual is able to
live on a day-oriented routine for several weeks at a time may suggest
the presence of other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, insomnia,
and narcolepsy, which should be ruled out.

Comorbidity Shift work type has been associated with increased alcohol
use disorder, other substance use disorders, and depression3. A variety
of physical health disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal disorders,
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer) have been found to be
associated with prolonged exposure to shift work7.

Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders The
International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2),
differentiates nine circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including jet lag
type.

Parasomnias Parasomnias are disorders characterized by abnormal
behavioral, experiential, or physiological events occurring in
association with sleep, specific sleep stages, or sleep-wake
transitions. The most common parasomnias---non--rapid eye movement
(NREM) sleep arousal disorders and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep
behavior disorder---represent admixtures of wakefulness and NREM sleep
and wakefulness and REM sleep, respectively. These conditions serve as a
reminder that sleep and wakefulness are not mutually exclusive and that
sleep is not necessarily a global, whole-brain phenomenon9.

Non--Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders Diagnostic Criteria a.
Recurrent episodes of incomplete awakening from sleep, usually occurring
during the first third of the major sleep episode, accompanied by either
one of the following: 1. Sleepwalking: Repeated episodes of rising from
bed during sleep and walking about. While sleepwalking, the individual
has a blank, staring face; is relatively unresponsive to the efforts of
others to communicate with him or her; and can be awakened only with
great difficulty.

2. Sleep terrors: Recurrent episodes of abrupt terror arousals from
sleep, usually beginning with a panicky scream. There is intense fear
and signs of autonomic arousal, such as mydriasis, tachycardia, rapid
breathing, and sweating, during each episode. There is relative
unresponsiveness to efforts of others to comfort the individual during
the episodes. b. No or little (e.g., only a single visual scene) dream
imagery is recalled. c. Amnesia for the episodes is present. d. The
episodes cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning. e. The
disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication). f. Coexisting mental
and medical disorders do not explain the episodes of sleepwalking or
sleep terrors. Coding note: For ICD-9-CM, code 307.46 for all subtypes.
For ICD-10CM, code is based on subtype. Specify whether: 307.46 (F51.3)
Sleepwalking type Specify if: With sleep-related eating With
sleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia) 307.46 (F51.4) Sleep terror
type

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of non--rapid eye movement
(NREM) sleep arousal disorders is the repeated occurrence of incomplete
arousals, usually beginning during the first third of the major sleep
episode (Criterion A), that typically are brief, lasting 1--10 minutes,
but may be protracted, lasting up to 1 hour. The maximum duration of an
event is unknown. The eyes are typically open during these events. Many
individuals exhibit both subtypes of arousals on different occasions,
which underscores the unitary underlying pathophysiology. The subtypes
reflect varying degrees of simultaneous

occurrence of wakefulness and NREM sleep, resulting in complex behaviors
arising from sleep with varying degrees of conscious awareness, motor
activity, and autonomic activation. The essential feature of
sleepwalking is repeated episodes of complex motor behavior initiated
during sleep, including rising from bed and walking about (Criterion
A1). Sleepwalking episodes begin during any stage of NREM sleep, most
commonly during slow-wave sleep and therefore most often occurring
during the first third of the night. During episodes, the individual has
reduced alertness and responsiveness, a blank stare, and relative
unresponsiveness to communication with others or efforts by others to
awaken the individual. If awakened during the episode (or on awakening
the following morning), the individual has limited recall for the
episode. After the episode, there may initially be a brief period of
confusion or difficulty orienting, followed by full recovery of
cognitive function and appropriate behavior. The essential feature of
sleep terrors is the repeated occurrence of precipitous awakenings from
sleep, usually beginning with a panicky scream or cry (Criterion A2).
Sleep terrors usually begin during the first third of the major sleep
episode and last 1--10 minutes, but they may last considerably longer,
particularly in children. The episodes are accompanied by impressive
autonomic arousal and behavioral manifestations of intense fear. During
an episode, the individual is difficult to awaken or comfort. If the
individual awakens after the sleep terror, little or none of the dream,
or only fragmentary, single images, are recalled. During a typical
episode of sleep terrors, the individual abruptly sits up in bed
screaming or crying, with a frightened expression and autonomic signs of
intense anxiety (e.g., tachycardia, rapid breathing, sweating, dilation
of the pupils). The individual may be inconsolable and is usually
unresponsive to the efforts of others to awaken or comfort him or her.
Sleep terrors are also called "night terrors" or "pavor nocturnus."

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Sleepwalking episodes can
include a wide variety of behaviors. Episodes may begin with confusion:
the individual may simply sit up in bed, look about, or pick at the
blanket or sheet. This behavior then becomes progressively complex. The
individual may actually leave the bed and walk into closets, out of the
room, and even out of buildings. Individuals may use

the bathroom, eat, talk, or engage in more complex behaviors. Running
and frantic attempts to escape some apparent threat can also occur. Most
behaviors during sleepwalking episodes are routine and of low
complexity. However, cases of unlocking doors and even operating
machinery (driving an automobile) have been reported. Sleepwalking can
also include inappropriate behavior (e.g., commonly, urinating in a
closet or wastebasket). Most episodes last for several minutes to a half
hour but may be more protracted. Inasmuch as sleep is a state of
relative analgesia, painful injuries sustained during sleepwalking may
not be appreciated until awakening after the fact. There are two
"specialized" forms of sleepwalking: sleep-related eating behavior and
sleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia or sleep sex)16, 19.
Individuals with sleep-related eating experience unwanted recurrent
episodes of eating with varying degrees of amnesia, ranging from no
awareness to full awareness without the ability to not eat. During these
episodes, inappropriate foods may be ingested. Individuals with
sleeprelated eating disorder may find evidence of their eating only the
next morning. In sexsomnia, varying degrees of sexual activity (e.g.,
masturbation, fondling, groping, sexual intercourse) occur as complex
behaviors arising from sleep without conscious awareness. This condition
is more common in males and may result in serious interpersonal
relationship problems or medicolegal consequences19. During a typical
episode of sleep terrors, there is often a sense of overwhelming dread,
with a compulsion to escape. Although fragmentary vivid dream images may
occur, a storylike dream sequence (as in nightmares) is not reported.
Most commonly, the individual does not awaken fully, but returns to
sleep and has amnesia for the episode on awakening the next morning.
Usually only one episode will occur on any one night. Occasionally
several episodes may occur at intervals throughout the night. These
events rarely arise during daytime naps.

Prevalence Isolated or infrequent NREM sleep arousal disorders are very
common in the general population1, 11, 12. From 10% to 30% of children
have had at least one episode of sleepwalking, and 2%--3% sleepwalk
often. The prevalence of sleepwalking disorder, marked by repeated
episodes and

impairment or distress, is much lower, probably in the range of 1%--5%.
The prevalence of sleepwalking episodes (not sleepwalking disorder) is
1.0%--7.0% among adults, with weekly to monthly episodes occurring in
0.5%--0.7%11. The lifetime prevalence of sleepwalking in adults is
29.2%, with a past-year prevalence of sleepwalking of 3.6%13. The
prevalence of sleep terrors in the general population is unknown. The
prevalence of sleep terror episodes (as opposed to sleep terror
disorder, in which there is recurrence and distress or impairment) is
approximately 36.9% at 18 months of age, 19.7% at 30 months of age, and
2.2% in adults10, 11.

Development and Course NREM sleep arousal disorders occur most commonly
in childhood and diminish in frequency with increasing age. The onset of
sleepwalking in adults with no prior history of sleepwalking as children
should prompt a search for specific etiologies, such as obstructive
sleep apnea, nocturnal seizures, or effect of medication.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Sedative use, sleep
deprivation, sleep-wake schedule disruptions, fatigue, and physical or
emotional stress increase the likelihood of episodes. Fever and sleep
deprivation can produce an increased frequency of NREM sleep arousal
disorders. Genetic and physiological. A family history for sleepwalking
or sleep terrors may occur in up to 80% of individuals who sleepwalk.
The risk for sleepwalking is further increased (to as much as 60% of
offspring) when both parents have a history of the disorder. Individuals
with sleep terrors frequently have a positive family history of either
sleep terrors or sleepwalking, with as high as a 10-fold increase in the
prevalence of the disorder among first-degree biological relatives.
Sleep terrors are much more common in monozygotic twins as compared with
dizygotic twins10. The exact mode of inheritance is unknown.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Violent or sexual activity during
sleepwalking episodes is more likely to occur in adults. Eating during
sleepwalking episodes is more commonly

seen in females. Sleepwalking occurs more often in females during
childhood but more often in males during adulthood. Older children and
adults provide a more detailed recollection of fearful images associated
with sleep terrors than do younger children, who are more likely to have
complete amnesia or report only a vague sense of fear. Among children,
sleep terrors are more common in males than in females. Among adults,
the sex ratio is even.

Diagnostic Markers NREM sleep arousal disorders arise from any stage of
NREM sleep but most commonly from deep NREM sleep (slow-wave sleep).
They are most likely to appear in the first third of the night and do
not commonly occur during daytime naps. During the episode, the
polysomnogram may be obscured with movement artifact. In the absence of
such artifact, the electroencephalogram typically shows theta or alpha
frequency activity during the episode, indicating partial or incomplete
arousal. Polysomnography in conjunction with audiovisual monitoring can
be used to document episodes of sleepwalking. In the absence of actually
capturing an event during a polysomnographic recording, there are no
polysomnographic features that can serve as a marker for sleepwalking.
Sleep deprivation may increase the likelihood of capturing an event20.
As a group, individuals who sleepwalk show instability of deep NREM
sleep, but the overlap in findings with individuals who do not sleepwalk
is great enough to preclude use of this indicator in establishing a
diagnosis3, 14. Unlike arousals from REM sleep associated with
nightmares, in which there is an increase in heart rate and respiration
prior to the arousal, the NREM sleep arousals of sleep terrors begin
precipitously from sleep, without anticipatory autonomic changes. The
arousals are associated with impressive autonomic activity, with
doubling or tripling of the heart rate. The pathophysiology is poorly
understood, but there appears to be instability in the deeper stages of
NREM sleep. Absent capturing an event during a formal sleep study, there
are no reliable polysomnographic indicators of the tendency to
experience sleep terrors.

Functional Consequences of Non-REM Sleep Arousal Disorders

For the diagnosis of a NREM sleep arousal disorder to be made, the
individual or household members must experience clinically significant
distress or impairment, although parasomnia symptoms may occur
occasionally in nonclinical populations and would be subthreshold for
the diagnosis. Embarrassment concerning the episodes can impair social
relationships. Social isolation or occupational difficulties can result.
The determination of a "disorder" depends on a number of factors, which
may vary on an individual basis and will depend on the frequency of
events, potential for violence or injurious behaviors, embarrassment, or
disruption/distress of other household members. Severity determination
is best made based on the nature or consequence of the behaviors rather
than simply on frequency. Uncommonly, NREM sleep arousal disorders may
result in serious injury to the individual or to someone trying to
console the individual. Injuries to others are confined to those in
close proximity; individuals are not "sought out." 15 Typically,
sleepwalking in both children and adults is not associated with
significant mental disorders6, 17. For individuals with sleep-related
eating behaviors, unknowingly preparing or eating food during the sleep
period may create problems such as poor diabetes control, weight gain,
injury (cuts and burns), or consequences of eating dangerous or toxic
inedibles. NREM sleep arousal disorders may rarely result in violent or
injurious behaviors with forensic implications2.

Differential Diagnosis Nightmare disorder. In contrast to individuals
with NREM sleep arousal disorders, individuals with nightmare disorder
typically awaken easily and completely, report vivid storylike dreams
accompanying the episodes, and tend to have episodes later in the night.
NREM sleep arousal disorders occur during NREM sleep, whereas nightmares
usually occur during REM sleep. Parents of children with NREM sleep
arousal disorders may misinterpret reports of fragmentary imagery as
nightmares. Breathing-related sleep disorders. Breathing disorders
during sleep can also produce confusional arousals with subsequent
amnesia. However, breathing-related sleep disorders are also
characterized by characteristic symptoms of snoring, breathing pauses,
and daytime sleepiness. In some individuals, a breathing-related sleep
disorder may precipitate episodes of sleepwalking.

REM sleep behavior disorder. REM sleep behavior disorder may be
difficult to distinguish from NREM sleep arousal disorders. REM sleep
behavior disorder is characterized by episodes of prominent, complex
movements, often involving personal injury arising from sleep. In
contrast to NREM sleep arousal disorders, REM sleep behavior disorder
occurs during REM sleep. Individuals with REM sleep behavior disorder
awaken easily and report more detailed and vivid dream content than do
individuals with NREM sleep arousal disorders. They often report that
they "act out dreams." Parasomnia overlap syndrome. Parasomnia overlap
syndrome consists of clinical and polysomnographic features of both
sleepwalking and REM sleep behavior disorder19. Sleep-related seizures.
Some types of seizures can produce episodes of very unusual behaviors
that occur predominantly or exclusively during sleep. Nocturnal seizures
may closely mimic NREM sleep arousal disorders but tend to be more
stereotypic in nature, occur multiple times nightly, and be more likely
to occur from daytime naps4. The presence of sleep-related seizures does
not preclude the presence of NREM sleep arousal disorders. Sleep-related
seizures should be classified as a form of epilepsy. Alcohol-induced
blackouts. Alcohol-induced blackouts may be associated with extremely
complex behaviors in the absence of other suggestions of intoxication.
They do not involve the loss of consciousness but rather reflect an
isolated disruption of memory for events during a drinking episode. By
history, these behaviors may be indistinguishable from those seen in
NREM sleep arousal disorders. Dissociative amnesia, with dissociative
fugue. Dissociative fugue may be extremely difficult to distinguish from
sleepwalking. Unlike all other parasomnias, nocturnal dissociative fugue
arises from a period of wakefulness during sleep, rather than
precipitously from sleep without intervening wakefulness. A history of
recurrent childhood physical or sexual abuse is usually present (but may
be difficult to obtain)17. Malingering or other voluntary behavior
occurring during wakefulness. As with dissociative fugue, malingering or
other voluntary behavior occurring during wakefulness arises from
wakefulness17.

Panic disorder. Panic attacks may also cause abrupt awakenings from deep
NREM sleep accompanied by fearfulness, but these episodes produce rapid
and complete awakening without the confusion, amnesia, or motor activity
typical of NREM sleep arousal disorders. Medication-induced complex
behaviors. Behaviors similar to those in NREM sleep arousal disorders
can be induced by use of, or withdrawal from, substances or medications
(e.g., benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, opiates,
cocaine, nicotine, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, chloral
hydrate). Such behaviors may arise from the sleep period and may be
extremely complex. The underlying pathophysiology appears to be a
relatively isolated amnesia5, 8. In such cases,
substance/medication-induced sleep disorder, parasomnia type, should be
diagnosed (see "Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder" later in
this chapter). Night eating syndrome. The sleep-related eating disorder
form of sleepwalking is to be differentiated from night eating syndrome,
in which there is a delay in the circadian rhythm of food ingestion and
an association with insomnia and/or depression7.

Comorbidity In adults, there is an association between sleepwalking and
major depressive episodes and obsessive-compulsive disorder13. Children
or adults with sleep terrors may have elevated scores for depression and
anxiety on personality inventories.

Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders The
International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition, includes
"confusional arousal" as a NREM sleep arousal disorder.

Nightmare Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

307.47 (F51.5)

a.  Repeated occurrences of extended, extremely dysphoric, and
    wellremembered dreams that usually involve efforts to avoid threats
    to survival, security, or physical integrity and that generally
    occur during the second half of the major sleep episode.
b.  On awakening from the dysphoric dreams, the individual rapidly
    becomes oriented and alert.
c.  The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or
    impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
    functioning.
d.  The nightmare symptoms are not attributable to the physiological
    effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication).

e. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not adequately explain the
predominant complaint of dysphoric dreams. Specify if: During sleep
onset Specify if: With associated non--sleep disorder, including
substance use disorders With associated other medical condition With
associated other sleep disorder Coding note: The code 307.47 (F51.5)
applies to all three specifiers. Code also the relevant associated
mental disorder, medical condition, or other sleep disorder immediately
after the code for nightmare disorder in order to indicate the
association. Specify if: Acute: Duration of period of nightmares is 1
month or less. Subacute: Duration of period of nightmares is greater
than 1 month but less than 6 months. Persistent: Duration of period of
nightmares is 6 months or greater. Specify current severity: Severity
can be rated by the frequency with which the nightmares occur: Mild:
Less than one episode per week on average. Moderate: One or more
episodes per week but less than nightly. Severe: Episodes nightly.

Diagnostic Features Nightmares are typically lengthy, elaborate,
storylike sequences of dream imagery that seem real and that incite
anxiety, fear, or other dysphoric emotions. Nightmare content typically
focuses on attempts to avoid or cope with imminent danger but may
involve themes that evoke other negative emotions. Nightmares occurring
after traumatic experiences may replicate the threatening situation
("replicative nightmares"), but most do not. On awakening, nightmares
are well remembered and can be described in detail. They arise almost
exclusively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and can thus occur
throughout sleep but are more likely in the second half of the

major sleep episode when dreaming is longer and more intense. Factors
that increase early-night REM intensity, such as sleep fragmentation or
deprivation, jet lag, and REM-sensitive medications, might facilitate
nightmares earlier in the night, including at sleep onset. Nightmares
usually terminate with awakening and rapid return of full alertness.
However, the dysphoric emotions may persist into wakefulness and
contribute to difficulty returning to sleep and lasting daytime
distress. Some nightmares, known as "bad dreams," may not induce
awakening and are recalled only later. If nightmares occur during
sleep-onset REM periods (hypnagogic), the dysphoric emotion is
frequently accompanied by a sense of being both awake and unable to move
voluntarily (isolated sleep paralysis).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Mild autonomic arousal,
including sweating, tachycardia, and tachypnea, may characterize
nightmares. Body movements and vocalizations are not characteristic
because of REM sleep--related loss of skeletal muscle tone, but such
behaviors may occur under situations of emotional stress or sleep
fragmentation and in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). When talking
or emoting occurs, it is typically a brief event terminating the
nightmare. Individuals with frequent nightmares are at substantially
greater risk for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, even when
gender and mental illness are taken into account.

Prevalence Prevalence of nightmares increases through childhood into
adolescence. From 1.3% to 3.9% of parents report that their preschool
children have nightmares "often" or "always" 9. Prevalence increases
from ages 10 to 13 for both males and females but continues to increase
to ages 20--29 for females (while decreasing for males), when it can be
twice as high for females as for males. Prevalence decreases steadily
with age for both sexes, but the gender difference remains. Among
adults, prevalence of nightmares at least monthly is 6%6, whereas
prevalence for frequent nightmares is 1%-- 2%4. Estimates often combine
idiopathic and posttraumatic nightmares indiscriminately.

Development and Course Nightmares often begin between ages 3 and 6 years
but reach a peak prevalence and severity in late adolescence or early
adulthood. Nightmares most likely appear in children exposed to acute or
chronic psychosocial stressors and thus may not resolve spontaneously.
In a minority, frequent nightmares persist into adulthood, becoming
virtually a lifelong disturbance. Although specific nightmare content
may reflect the individual's age, the essential features of the disorder
are the same across age groups.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Individuals who experience
nightmares report more frequent past adverse events, but not necessarily
trauma, and often display personality disturbances or psychiatric
diagnosis. Environmental. Sleep deprivation or fragmentation, and
irregular sleepwake schedules that alter the timing, intensity, or
quantity of REM sleep, can put individuals at risk for nightmares.
Genetic and physiological. Twin studies have identified genetic effects
on the disposition to nightmares and their co-occurrence with other
parasomnias (e.g., sleeptalking)2. Course modifiers. Adaptive parental
bedside behaviors, such as soothing the child following nightmares, may
protect against developing chronic nightmares.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The significance attributed to
nightmares may vary by culture, and sensitivity to such beliefs may
facilitate disclosure.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Adult females report having nightmares
more frequently than do adult males. Nightmare content differs by sex,
with adult females tending to report themes of sexual harassment or of
loved ones disappearing/dying, and adult males tending to report themes
of physical aggression or war/terror7.

Diagnostic Markers Polysomnographic studies demonstrate abrupt
awakenings from REM sleep, usually during the second half of the night,
prior to report of a nightmare. Heart, respiratory, and eye movement
rates may quicken or increase in variability before awakening.
Nightmares following traumatic events may also arise during non-REM
(NREM), particularly stage 2, sleep. The typical sleep of individuals
with nightmares is mildly impaired (e.g., reduced efficiency, less
slow-wave sleep, more awakenings)10, with more frequent periodic leg
movements in sleep and relative sympathetic nervous system activation
after REM sleep deprivation1, 5.

Functional Consequences of Nightmare Disorder Nightmares cause more
significant subjective distress than demonstrable social or occupational
impairment. However, if awakenings are frequent or result in sleep
avoidance, individuals may experience excessive daytime sleepiness, poor
concentration, depression, anxiety, or irritability. Frequent childhood
nightmares (e.g., several per week), may cause significant distress to
parents and child.

Differential Diagnosis Sleep terror disorder. Both nightmare disorder
and sleep terror disorder include awakenings or partial awakenings with
fearfulness and autonomic activation, but the two disorders are
differentiable. Nightmares typically occur later in the night, during
REM sleep, and produce vivid, storylike, and clearly recalled dreams;
mild autonomic arousal; and complete awakenings. Sleep terrors typically
arise in the first third of the night during stage 3 or 4 NREM sleep and
produce either no dream recall or images without an elaborate storylike
quality. The terrors lead to partial awakenings that leave the
individual confused, disoriented, and only partially responsive and with
substantial autonomic arousal. There is usually amnesia for the event in
the morning. REM sleep behavior disorder. The presence of complex motor
activity during frightening dreams should prompt further evaluation for
REM sleep behavior disorder, which occurs more typically among late
middle-age males and, unlike nightmare disorder, is associated with
often violent dream enactments and a history of nocturnal injuries. The
dream disturbance of

REM sleep behavior disorder is described by patients as nightmares but
is controlled by appropriate medication. Bereavement. Dysphoric dreams
may occur during bereavement but typically involve loss and sadness and
are followed by self-reflection and insight, rather than distress, on
awakening3. Narcolepsy. Nightmares are a frequent complaint in
narcolepsy, but the presence of excessive sleepiness and cataplexy
differentiates this condition from nightmare disorder. Nocturnal
seizures. Seizures may rarely manifest as nightmares and should be
evaluated with polysomnography and continuous video
electroencephalography. Nocturnal seizures usually involve stereotypical
motor activity. Associated nightmares, if recalled, are often repetitive
in nature or reflect epileptogenic features such as the content of
diurnal auras (e.g., unmotivated dread), phosphenes, or ictal imagery8.
Disorders of arousal, especially confusional arousals, may also be
present. Breathing-related sleep disorders. Breathing-related sleep
disorders can lead to awakenings with autonomic arousal, but these are
not usually accompanied by recall of nightmares. Panic disorder. Attacks
arising during sleep can produce abrupt awakenings with autonomic
arousal and fearfulness, but nightmares are typically not reported and
symptoms are similar to panic attacks arising during wakefulness.
Sleep-related dissociative disorders. Individuals may recall actual
physical or emotional trauma as a "dream" during
electroencephalographydocumented awakenings. Medication or substance
use. Numerous substances/medications can precipitate nightmares,
including dopaminergics; beta-adrenergic antagonists and other
antihypertensives; amphetamine, cocaine, and other stimulants;
antidepressants; smoking cessation aids; and melatonin. Withdrawal of
REM sleep--suppressant medications (e.g., antidepressants) and alcohol
can produce REM sleep rebound accompanied by nightmares. If nightmares
are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention, a
diagnosis of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder should be
considered.

Comorbidity Nightmares may be comorbid with several medical conditions,
including coronary heart disease, cancer, parkinsonism, and pain, and
can accompany medical treatments, such as hemodialysis, or withdrawal
from medications or substances of abuse. Nightmares frequently are
comorbid with other mental disorders, including PTSD; insomnia disorder;
schizophrenia; psychosis; mood, anxiety, adjustment, and personality
disorders; and grief during bereavement. A concurrent nightmare disorder
diagnosis should only be considered when independent clinical attention
is warranted (i.e., Criteria A--C are met). Otherwise, no separate
diagnosis is necessary. These conditions should be listed under the
appropriate comorbid category specifier. However, nightmare disorder may
be diagnosed as a separate disorder in individuals with PTSD if the
nightmares are temporally unrelated to PTSD (i.e., preceding other PTSD
symptoms or persisting after other PTSD symptoms have resolved).
Nightmares are normally characteristic of REM sleep behavior disorder,
PTSD, and acute stress disorder, but nightmare disorder may be
independently coded if nightmares preceded the condition and their
frequency or severity necessitates independent clinical attention. The
latter may be determined by asking whether nightmares were a problem
before onset of the other disorder and whether they continued after
other symptoms had remitted.

Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

327.42 (G47.52)

a.  Repeated episodes of arousal during sleep associated with
    vocalization and/or complex motor behaviors.
b.  These behaviors arise during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and
    therefore usually occur more than 90 minutes after sleep onset, are
    more frequent during the later portions of the sleep period, and
    uncommonly occur during daytime naps.

c. Upon awakening from these episodes, the individual is completely
awake, alert, and not confused or disoriented. d. Either of the
following: 1. REM sleep without atonia on polysomnographic recording. 2.
A history suggestive of REM sleep behavior disorder and an established
synucleinopathy diagnosis (e.g., Parkinson's disease, multiple system
atrophy). e. The behaviors cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning (which may include injury to self or the bed partner).
f. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition. g. Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not explain the
episodes.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of rapid eye movement (REM)
sleep behavior disorder is repeated episodes of arousal, often
associated with vocalizations and/or complex motor behaviors arising
from REM sleep (Criterion A). These behaviors often reflect motor
responses to the content of action-filled or violent dreams of being
attacked or trying to escape from a threatening situation, which may be
termed dream enacting behaviors. The vocalizations are often loud,
emotion-filled, and profane. These behaviors may be very bothersome to
the individual and the bed partner and may result in significant injury
(e.g., falling, jumping, or flying out of bed; running, punching,
thrusting, hitting, or kicking). Upon awakening, the individual is
immediately awake, alert, and oriented (Criterion C) and is often able
to recall dream mentation, which closely correlates with the observed
behavior. The eyes typically remain closed during these events. The
diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder requires clinically significant
distress or impairment (Criterion E); this determination will depend on
a number of factors, including the frequency of events, the potential
for violence or injurious behaviors, embarrassment, and distress in
other household members.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Severity determination is best
made based on the nature or consequence of the behavior rather than
simply on frequency. Although the behaviors are typically prominent and
violent, lesser behaviors may also occur10.

Prevalence The prevalence of REM sleep behavior disorder is
approximately 0.38%-- 0.5% in the general population. Prevalence in
patients with psychiatric disorders may be greater, possibly related to
medications prescribed for the psychiatric disorder2, 9.

Development and Course The onset of REM sleep behavior disorder may be
gradual or rapid, and the course is usually progressive. REM sleep
behavior disorder associated with neurodegenerative disorders may
improve as the underlying neurodegenerative disorder progresses. Because
of the very high association with the later appearance of an underlying
neurodegenerative disorder, most notably one of the synucleinopathies
(Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or major or mild
neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies), the neurological status of
individuals with REM sleep behavior disorder should be closely
monitored. REM sleep behavior disorder overwhelmingly affects males
older than 50 years, but increasingly this disorder is being identified
in females and in younger individuals1. Symptoms in young individuals,
particularly young females, should raise the possibility of narcolepsy
or medication-induced REM sleep behavior disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Many widely
prescribed medications, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors, and beta-blockers, may result in polysomnographic evidence
of REM sleep without atonia and in frank REM sleep behavior disorder6.
It is not known whether the medications per se result in REM sleep
behavior disorder or they unmask an underlying predisposition.

Diagnostic Markers Associated laboratory findings from polysomnography
indicate increased tonic and/or phasic electromyographic activity during
REM sleep that is normally associated with muscle atonia. The increased
muscle activity variably affects different muscle groups, mandating more
extensive electromyographic monitoring than is employed in conventional
sleep studies. For this reason, it is suggested that electromyographic
monitoring include the submentalis, bilateral extensor digitorum, and
bilateral anterior tibialis muscle groups. Continuous video monitoring
is mandatory. Other polysomnographic findings may include very frequent
periodic and aperiodic extremity electromyography activity during
non-REM (NREM) sleep. This polysomnography observation, termed REM sleep
without atonia, is present in virtually all cases of REM sleep behavior
disorder but may also be an asymptomatic polysomnographic finding.
Clinical dreamenacting behaviors coupled with the polysomnographic
finding of REM without atonia is necessary for the diagnosis of REM
sleep behavior disorder. REM sleep without atonia without a clinical
history of dreamenacting behaviors is simply an asymptomatic
polysomnographic observation. It is not known whether isolated REM sleep
without atonia is a precursor to REM sleep behavior disorder.

Functional Consequences of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder
REM sleep behavior disorder may occur in isolated occasions in otherwise
unaffected individuals8. Embarrassment concerning the episodes can
impair social relationships. Individuals may avoid situations in which
others might become aware of the disturbance, visiting friends
overnight, or sleeping with bed partners. Social isolation or
occupational difficulties can result. Uncommonly, REM sleep behavior
disorder may result in serious injury to the victim or to the bed
partner11.

Differential Diagnosis Other parasomnias. Confusional arousals,
sleepwalking, and sleep terrors can easily be confused with REM sleep
behavior disorder. In general, these disorders occur in younger
individuals. Unlike REM sleep

behavior disorder, they arise from deep NREM sleep and therefore tend to
occur in the early portion of the sleep period. Awakening from a
confusional arousal is associated with confusion, disorientation, and
incomplete recall of dream mentation accompanying the behavior.
Polysomnographic monitoring in the disorders of arousal reveals normal
REM atonia. Nocturnal seizures. Nocturnal seizures may perfectly mimic
REM sleep behavior disorder4, but the behaviors are generally more
stereotyped. Polysomnographic monitoring employing a full
electroencephalographic seizure montage may differentiate the two. REM
sleep without atonia is not present on polysomnographic monitoring.
Obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea may result in behaviors
indistinguishable from REM sleep behavior disorder. Polysomnographic
monitoring is necessary to differentiate between the two7. In this case,
the symptoms resolve following effective treatment of the obstructive
sleep apnea, and REM sleep without atonia is not present on
polysomnography monitoring. Other specified dissociative disorder
(sleep-related psychogenic dissociative disorder). Unlike virtually all
other parasomnias, which arise precipitously from NREM or REM sleep,
psychogenic dissociative behaviors arise from a period of well-defined
wakefulness during the sleep period. Unlike REM sleep behavior disorder,
this condition is more prevalent in young females. Malingering. Many
cases of malingering in which the individual reports problematic sleep
movements perfectly mimic the clinical features of REM sleep behavior
disorder, and polysomnographic documentation is mandatory.

Comorbidity REM sleep behavior disorder is present concurrently in
approximately 30% of patients with narcolepsy. When it occurs in
narcolepsy, the demographics reflect the younger age range of
narcolepsy, with equal frequency in males and females5. Based on
findings from individuals presenting to sleep clinics, most individuals
(\>50%) with initially "idiopathic" REM sleep behavior disorder will
eventually develop a neurodegenerative disease---

most notably, one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease,
multiple system atrophy, or major or mild neurocognitive disorder with
Lewy bodies). REM sleep behavior disorder often predates any other sign
of these disorders by many years (often more than a decade)3, 12.

Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders REM
sleep behavior disorder is virtually identical to REM sleep behavior
disorder in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd
Edition (ICSD-2).

Restless Legs Syndrome Diagnostic Criteria

333.94 (G25.81)

a.  An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by or in response to
    uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs, characterized
    by all of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  The urge to move the legs begins or worsens during periods of rest
    or inactivity.
2.  The urge to move the legs is partially or totally relieved by
    movement.
3.  The urge to move the legs is worse in the evening or at night than
    during the day, or occurs only in the evening or at night.

<!-- -->

b.  The symptoms in Criterion A occur at least three times per week and
    have persisted for at least 3 months.
c.  The symptoms in Criterion A are accompanied by significant distress
    or impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic,
    behavioral, or other important areas of functioning.
d.  The symptoms in Criterion A are not attributable to another mental
    disorder or medical condition (e.g., arthritis, leg edema,
    peripheral ischemia, leg cramps) and are not better explained by a
    behavioral condition (e.g., positional discomfort, habitual foot
    tapping).

e. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a
drug of abuse or medication (e.g., akathisia).

Diagnostic Features Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor,
neurological sleep disorder characterized by a desire to move the legs
or arms, usually associated with uncomfortable sensations typically
described as creeping, crawling, tingling, burning, or itching
(Criterion A). The diagnosis of RLS is based primarily on patient
self-report and history. Symptoms are worse when the individual is at
rest, and frequent movements of the legs occur in an effort to relieve
the uncomfortable sensations. Symptoms are worse in the evening or
night, and in some individuals they occur only in the evening or night.
Evening worsening occurs independently of any differences in activity.
It is important to differentiate RLS from other conditions such as
positional discomfort and leg cramps (Criterion D). The symptoms of RLS
can delay sleep onset and awaken the individual from sleep and are
associated with significant sleep fragmentation. The relief obtained
from moving the legs may no longer be apparent in severe cases. RLS is
associated with daytime sleepiness and is frequently accompanied by
significant clinical distress or functional impairment.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Periodic leg movements in sleep
(PLMS) can serve as corroborating evidence for RLS, with up to 90% of
individuals diagnosed with RLS demonstrating PLMS when recordings are
taken over multiple nights18, 19. Periodic leg movements during
wakefulness are supportive of an RLS diagnosis. Reports of difficulty
initiating and maintaining sleep and of excessive daytime sleepiness may
also support the diagnosis of RLS. Additional supportive features
include a family history of RLS among firstdegree relatives and a
reduction in symptoms, at least initially, with dopaminergic treatment2.

Prevalence Prevalence rates of RLS vary widely when broad criteria are
utilized but range from 2% to 7.2% when more defined criteria are
employed. When

frequency of symptoms is at least three times per week with moderate or
severe distress, the prevalence rate is 1.6%; when frequency of symptoms
is a minimum of one time per week, the prevalence rate is 4.5%. Females
are 1.5--2 times more likely than males to have RLS. RLS also increases
with age. The prevalence of RLS may be lower in Asian populations11.

Development and Course The onset of RLS typically occurs in the second
or third decade. Approximately 40% of individuals diagnosed with RLS
during adulthood report having experienced symptoms before age 20 years,
and 20% report having experienced symptoms before age 10 years.
Prevalence rates of RLS increase steadily with age until about age 60
years, with symptoms remaining stable or decreasing slightly in older
age groups11. Compared with nonfamilial cases, familial RLS usually has
a younger age at onset and a slower progressive course. The clinical
course of RLS differs by age at onset. When onset occurs before age 45,
there is often a slow progression of symptoms. In late-onset RLS, rapid
progression is typical, and aggravating factors are common1. Symptoms of
RLS appear similar across the lifespan, remaining stable or decreasing
slightly in older age groups1, 11. Diagnosis of RLS in children can be
difficult because of the self-report component13. While Criterion A for
adults assumes that the description of "urge to move" is by the patient,
pediatric diagnosis requires a description in the child's own words
rather than by a parent or caretaker. Typically children age 6 years or
older are able to provide detailed, adequate descriptors of RLS.
However, children rarely use or understand the word "urge," reporting
instead that their legs "have to" or "got to" move. Also, potentially
related to prolonged periods of sitting during class, two-thirds of
children and adolescents report daytime leg sensations. Thus, for
diagnostic Criterion A3, it is important to compare equal duration of
sitting or lying down in the day to sitting or lying down in the evening
or night. Nocturnal worsening tends to persist even in the context of
pediatric RLS. As with RLS in adults, there is a significant negative
impact on sleep, mood, cognition, and function. Impairment in children
and adolescents is manifested more often in behavioral and educational
domains.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological. Predisposing factors include female gender,
advancing age, genetic risk variants, and family history of RLS.
Precipitating factors are often time-limited, such as iron deficiency,
with most individuals resuming normal sleep patterns after the initial
triggering event has disappeared. Genetic risk variants also play a role
in RLS secondary to such disorders as uremia15, suggesting that
individuals with a genetic susceptibility develop RLS in the presence of
further risk factors. RLS has a strong familial component. There are
defined pathophysiological pathways subserving RLS. Genome-wide
association studies have found that RLS is significantly associated with
common genetic variants in intronic or intergenic regions in MEIS1,
BTBD9, and MAP2K5 on chromosomes 2p, 6p, and 15q, respectively24, 25.
The association of these three variants with RLS has been independently
replicated16, 20, 25. BTBD9 confers a very large (80%) excessive risk
when even a single allele is present. Because of the high frequency of
this variant in individuals of European descent, the population
attributable risk (PAR) approximates 50%. At-risk alleles associated
with MEIS1 and BTBD9 are less common in individuals of African or Asian
descent, perhaps suggesting lower risk for RLS in these populations.
Pathophysiological mechanisms in RLS also include disturbances in the
central dopaminergic system and disturbances in iron metabolism. The
endogenous opiate system may also be involved18. Treatment effects of
dopaminergic drugs (primarily D2 and D3 non-ergot agonists) provide
further support that RLS is grounded in dysfunctional central
dopaminergic pathways5, 26. While the effective treatment of RLS has
also been shown to significantly reduce depressive symptoms18,
serotonergic antidepressants can induce or aggravate RLS in some
individuals14.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Although RLS is more prevalent in
females than in males, there are no diagnostic differences according to
gender. However, the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy is two to three
times greater than in the general population. RLS associated with
pregnancy peaks during the third trimester and improves or resolves in
most cases soon after delivery. The gender difference in prevalence of
RLS is explained at least in part by parity, with

nulliparous females being at the same risk of RLS as age-matched males7,
12, 18.

Diagnostic Markers Polysomnography demonstrates significant
abnormalities in RLS, commonly increased latency to sleep, and higher
arousal index2, 9, 22. Polysomnography with a preceding immobilization
test may provide an indicator of the motor sign of RLS, periodic limb
movements, under standard conditions of sleep and during quiet resting,
both of which can provoke RLS symptoms.

Functional Syndrome

Consequences

of

Restless

Legs

Forms of RLS severe enough to significantly impair functioning or
associated with mental disorders, including depression and anxiety,
occur in approximately 2%--3% of the population6, 8, 17, 23. Although
the impact of milder symptoms is less well characterized, individuals
with RLS complain of disruption in at least one activity of daily
living, with up to 50% reporting a negative impact on mood, and 47.6%
reporting a lack of energy3. The most common consequences of RLS are
sleep disturbance, including reduced sleep time, sleep fragmentation,
and overall disturbance2, 9, 22, depression, generalized anxiety
disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder6, 23, and
quality-of-life impairments4, 10, 18, 22. RLS can result in daytime
sleepiness or fatigue and is frequently accompanied by significant
distress or impairment in affective, social, occupational, educational,
academic, behavioral, or cognitive functioning.

Differential Diagnosis The most important conditions in the differential
diagnosis of RLS are leg cramps, positional discomfort,
arthralgias/arthritis, myalgias, positional ischemia (numbness), leg
edema, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, and habitual foot tapping.
"Knotting" of the muscle (cramps), relief with a single postural shift,
limitation to joints, soreness to palpation (myalgias), and other
abnormalities on physical examination are not characteristic of

RLS. Unlike RLS, nocturnal leg cramps do not typically present with the
desire to move the limbs nor are there frequent limb movements. Less
common conditions to be differentiated from RLS include
neurolepticinduced akathisia, myelopathy, symptomatic venous
insufficiency, peripheral artery disease, eczema, other orthopedic
problems, and anxietyinduced restlessness. Worsening at night and
periodic limb movements are more common in RLS than in
medication-induced akathisia or peripheral neuropathy. While is it
important that RLS symptoms not be solely accounted for by another
medical or behavioral condition, it should also be appreciated that any
of these similar conditions can occur in an individual with RLS. This
necessitates a separate focus on each possible condition in the
diagnostic process and when assessing impact. For cases in which the
diagnosis of RLS is not certain, evaluation for the supportive features
of RLS, particularly PLMS or a family history of RLS, may be helpful.
Clinical features, such as response to a dopaminergic agent and positive
family history for RLS, can help with the differential diagnosis.

Comorbidity Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and attentional
disorders are commonly comorbid with RLS and are discussed in the
section "Functional Consequences of Restless Legs Syndrome." The main
medical disorder comorbid with RLS is cardiovascular disease21. There
may be an association with numerous other medical disorders, including
hypertension, narcolepsy, migraine, Parkinson's disease, multiple
sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes
mellitus, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis, obesity, thyroid disease, and
cancer. Iron deficiency, pregnancy, and chronic renal failure are also
comorbid with RLS.

Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders The
International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2),
presents similar diagnostic criteria for RLS but does not contain a
criterion specifying frequency or duration of symptoms.

Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A
prominent and severe disturbance in sleep. b. There is evidence from the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and
(2): 1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or after withdrawal from or exposure to a
medication. 2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing
the symptoms in Criterion A. c. The disturbance is not better explained
by a sleep disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such
evidence of an independent sleep disorder could include the following:
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the
symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month)
after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there
is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent
non-substance/medication-induced sleep disorder (e.g., a history of
recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes). d. The disturbance
does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.

e. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Note:
This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance
intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion
A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently
severe to warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and
ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific substance/medication\]-induced sleep
disorders are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder
present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use
disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th
position character is "1," and the clinician should record "mild
\[substance\] use disorder" before the substance-induced sleep disorder
(e.g., "mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder").
If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the
substance-induced sleep disorder, the 4th position character is "2," and
the clinician should record "moderate \[substance\] use disorder" or
"severe \[substance\] use disorder," depending on the severity of the
comorbid substance use disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use
disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the
4th position character is "9," and the clinician should record only the
substance-induced sleep disorder. A moderate or severe tobacco use
disorder is required in order to code a tobacco-induced sleep disorder;
it is not permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder or no
tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced sleep disorder. Specify
whether: Insomnia type: Characterized by difficulty falling asleep or
maintaining sleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, or nonrestorative
sleep. Daytime sleepiness type: Characterized by predominant complaint
of excessive sleepiness/fatigue during waking hours or, less commonly, a
long sleep period. Parasomnia type: Characterized by abnormal behavioral
events during sleep.

Mixed type: Characterized by a substance/medication-induced sleep
problem characterized by multiple types of sleep symptoms, but no
symptom clearly predominates. Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter
"Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders" for diagnoses associated
with substance class): With onset during intoxication: This specifier
should be used if criteria are met for intoxication with the
substance/medication and symptoms developed during the intoxication
period. With onset during discontinuation/withdrawal: This specifier
should be used if criteria are met for discontinuation/withdrawal from
the substance/medication and symptoms developed during, or shortly
after, discontinuation of the substance/medication.

Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the
substance/medication-induced sleep disorder begins with the specific
substance (e.g., cocaine, bupropion) that is presumed to be causing the
sleep disturbance. The diagnostic code is selected from the table
included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For
substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., bupropion),
the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases in which a
substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class
of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance" should be
used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during
discontinuation/withdrawal), followed by the subtype designation (i.e.,
insomnia type, daytime sleepiness type, parasomnia type, mixed type).
Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the
substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single
code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance
use disorder. For example, in the case of insomnia occurring during
withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis
is 292.85 lorazepam-induced sleep disorder, with onset during
withdrawal, insomnia type. An additional diagnosis of 304.10 severe
lorazepam use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is
judged to play a significant role in the development of the sleep
disturbance, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.85
alcohol-induced sleep disorder, with onset during intoxication, insomnia
type; 292.85 cocaine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during
intoxication, insomnia type). ICD-10-CM. The name of the
substance/medication-induced sleep disorder begins with the specific
substance (e.g., cocaine, bupropion) that is presumed to be causing the
sleep disturbance. The diagnostic code is selected from the table
included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and
presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances
that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., bupropion), the code for
"other substance" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is
judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance
is unknown, the category "unknown substance" should be used.

When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use
disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed
by the name of the substance-induced sleep disorder, followed by the
specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during
discontinuation/withdrawal), followed by the subtype designation (i.e.,
insomnia type, daytime sleepiness type, parasomnia type, mixed type).
For example, in the case of insomnia occurring during withdrawal in a
man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is F13.282
severe lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced sleep disorder,
with onset during withdrawal, insomnia type. A separate diagnosis of the
comorbid severe lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the
substance-induced sleep disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use
disorder (e.g., with medication use), no accompanying substance use
disorder is noted (e.g., F19.982 bupropion-induced sleep disorder, with
onset during medication use, insomnia type). When more than one
substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the
sleep disturbance, each should be listed separately (e.g., F10.282
severe alcohol use disorder with alcoholinduced sleep disorder, with
onset during intoxication, insomnia type; F14.282 severe cocaine use
disorder with cocaine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during
intoxication, insomnia type).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of
substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is a prominent sleep
disturbance that is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical
attention (Criterion A) and that is judged to be primarily associated
with the pharmacological effects of a substance (i.e., a drug of abuse,
a medication, toxin exposure) (Criterion B). Depending on the substance
involved, one of four types of sleep disturbances is reported. Insomnia
type and daytime sleepiness type are most common, while parasomnia type
is seen less often. The mixed type is noted when more than one type of
sleep disturbance--related symptom is present and none predominates. The
disturbance must not be better explained by another sleep disorder
(Criterion C). A substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is
distinguished from insomnia disorder or a disorder associated with
excessive daytime sleepiness by considering onset and course. For drugs
of abuse, there must be evidence of intoxication or withdrawal from the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings.

Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder arises only in association
with intoxication or discontinuation/withdrawal states, whereas other
sleep disorders may precede the onset of substance use or occur during
times of sustained abstinence. As discontinuation/withdrawal states for
some substances can be protracted, onset of the sleep disturbance can
occur 4 weeks after cessation of substance use, and the disturbance may
have features atypical of other sleep disorders (e.g., atypical age at
onset or course). The diagnosis is not made if the sleep disturbance
occurs only during a delirium (Criterion D). The symptoms must cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E). This diagnosis
should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or
substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate
in the clinical picture and when the symptoms warrant independent
clinical attention.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis During periods of
substance/medication use, intoxication, or withdrawal, individuals
frequently complain of dysphoric mood, including depression and anxiety,
irritability, cognitive impairment, inability to concentrate, and
fatigue. Prominent and severe sleep disturbances can occur in
association with intoxication with the following classes of substances:
alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown)
substances. Prominent and severe sleep disturbances can occur in
association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances:
alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics; stimulant (including cocaine); tobacco; and other (or
unknown) substances. Some medications that invoke sleep disturbances
include adrenergic agonists and antagonists, dopamine agonists and
antagonists, cholinergic agonists and antagonists, serotonergic agonists
and antagonists, antihistamines, and corticosteroids. Alcohol.
Alcohol-induced sleep disorder typically occurs as insomnia type. During
acute intoxication, alcohol produces an immediate sedative effect
depending on dose, accompanied by increased stages 3 and 4 non-- rapid
eye movement (NREM) sleep and reduced rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
Following these initial effects, there may be increased

wakefulness, restless sleep, and vivid and anxiety-laden dreams for the
remaining sleep period. In parallel, stages 3 and 4 sleep are reduced,
and wakefulness and REM sleep are increased. Alcohol can aggravate
breathing-related sleep disorder. With habitual use, alcohol continues
to show a short-lived sedative effect in the first half of the night,
followed by sleep continuity disruption in the second half5. During
alcohol withdrawal, there is extremely disrupted sleep continuity, and
an increased amount and intensity of REM sleep, associated frequently
with vivid dreaming, which in extreme form, constitutes part of alcohol
withdrawal delirium. After acute withdrawal, chronic alcohol users may
continue to complain of light, fragmented sleep for weeks to years
associated with a persistent deficit in slow-wave sleep. Caffeine.
Caffeine-induced sleep disorder produces insomnia in a dosedependent
manner, with some individuals presenting with daytime sleepiness related
to withdrawal5. Cannabis. Acute administration of cannabis may shorten
sleep latency, though arousing effects with increments in sleep latency
also occur. Cannabis enhances slow-wave sleep and suppresses REM sleep
after acute administration. In chronic users, tolerance to the
sleep-inducing and slowwave sleep--enhancing effects develops. Upon
withdrawal, sleep difficulties and unpleasant dreams have been reported
lasting for several weeks. Polysomnography studies demonstrate reduced
slow-wave sleep and increased REM sleep during this phase6. Opioids.
Opioids may produce an increase in sleepiness and in subjective depth of
sleep, and reduced REM sleep, during acute short-term use. With
continued administration, tolerance to the sedative effects of opioids
develops and there are complaints of insomnia. Consistent with their
respiratory depressant effects, opioids exacerbate sleep apnea.
Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances. Sedatives, hypnotics, and
anxiolytics (e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines receptor agonists,
meprobamate, glutethimide, methyprylon) have similar effects as opioids
on sleep. During acute intoxication, sedative-hypnotic drugs produce the
expected increase in sleepiness and decrease in wakefulness. Chronic use
(particularly of barbiturates and the older nonbarbiturate,
nonbenzodiazepine drugs) may cause tolerance with subsequent return of

insomnia4. Daytime sleepiness may occur. Sedative-hypnotic drugs can
increase the frequency and severity of obstructive sleep apnea events.
Parasomnias are associated with use of benzodiazepine receptor
agonists2, especially when these medications are taken at higher doses
and when they are combined with other sedative drugs. Abrupt
discontinuation of chronic sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use can
lead to withdrawal but more commonly rebound insomnia, a condition of an
exacerbation of insomnia upon drug discontinuation for 1--2 days
reported to occur even with shortterm use. Sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic drugs with short durations of action are most likely to
produce complaints of rebound insomnia, whereas those with longer
durations of action are more often associated with daytime sleepiness.
Any sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drug can potentially cause daytime
sedation, withdrawal, or rebound insomnia. Amphetamines and related
substances and other stimulants. Sleep disorders induced by amphetamine
and related substances and other stimulants are characterized by
insomnia during intoxication and excessive sleepiness during withdrawal.
During acute intoxication, stimulants reduce the total amount of sleep,
increase sleep latency and sleep continuity disturbances, and decrease
REM sleep. Slow-wave sleep tends to be reduced. During withdrawal from
chronic stimulant use, there is both prolonged nocturnal sleep duration
and excessive daytime sleepiness. Multiple sleep latency tests may show
increased daytime sleepiness during the withdrawal phase. Drugs like
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; "ecstasy") and related
substances lead to restless and disturbed sleep within 48 hours of
intake; frequent use of these compounds is associated with persisting
symptoms of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances, even during
longer-term abstinence6. Tobacco. Chronic tobacco consumption is
associated primarily with symptoms of insomnia, decreased slow-wave
sleep with a reduction of sleep efficiency, and increased daytime
sleepiness. Withdrawal from tobacco can lead to impaired sleep.
Individuals who smoke heavily may experience regular nocturnal
awakenings caused by tobacco craving3. Other or unknown
substances/medications. Other substances/medications may produce sleep
disturbances, particularly medications that affect the central or
autonomic nervous systems (e.g., adrenergic agonists and antagonists,
dopamine agonists and antagonists,

cholinergic agonists and antagonists, serotonergic agonists and
antagonists, antihistamines, corticosteroids).

Development and Course Insomnia in children can be identified by either
a parent or the child. Often the child has a clear sleep disturbance
associated with initiation of a medication but may not report symptoms,
although parents observe the sleep disturbances. The use of some illicit
substances (e.g., cannabis, ecstasy) is prevalent in adolescence and
early adulthood. Insomnia or any other sleep disturbance encountered in
this age group should prompt careful consideration of whether the sleep
disturbance is due to consumption of these substances. Help-seeking
behavior for the sleep disturbance in these age groups is limited, and
thus corroborative report may be elicited from a parent, caregiver, or
teacher. Older individuals take more medications and are at increased
risk for developing a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. They
may interpret sleep disturbance as part of normal aging and fail to
report symptoms. Individuals with major neurocognitive disorder (e.g.,
dementia) are at risk for substance/medication-induced sleep disorders
but may not report symptoms, making corroborative report from
caregiver(s) particularly important.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Risk and prognostic factors involved in
substance abuse/dependence or medication use are normative for certain
age groups. They are relevant for, and likely applicable to, the type of
sleep disturbance encountered (see the chapter "Substance-Related and
Addictive Disorders" for descriptions of respective substance use
disorders). Temperamental. Substance use generally precipitates or
accompanies insomnia in vulnerable individuals. Thus, presence of
insomnia in response to stress or change in sleep environment or timing
can represent a risk for developing substance/medication-induced sleep
disorder. A similar risk may be present for individuals with other sleep
disorders (e.g., individuals with hypersomnia who use stimulants).

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

The consumption of substances, including prescribed medications, may
depend in part on cultural background and specific local drug
regulations.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Gender-specific prevalences (i.e.,
females affected more than males at a ratio of about 2:1) exist for
patterns of consumption of some substances (e.g., alcohol). The same
amount and duration of consumption of a given substance may lead to
highly different sleep-related outcomes in males and females based on,
for example, gender-specific differences in hepatic functioning.

Diagnostic Markers Each of the substance/medication-induced sleep
disorders produces electroencephalographic sleep patterns that are
associated with, but cannot be considered diagnostic of, other
disorders. The electroencephalographic sleep profile for each substance
is related to the stage of use, whether intake/intoxication, chronic
use, or withdrawal following discontinuation of the substance. All-night
polysomnography can help define the severity of insomnia complaints,
while the multiple sleep latency test provides information about the
severity of daytime sleepiness. Monitoring of nocturnal respiration and
periodic limb movements with polysomnography may verify a substance's
impact on nocturnal breathing and motor behavior. Sleep diaries for 2
weeks and actigraphy are considered helpful in confirming the presence
of substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Drug screening can be of
use when the individual is not aware or unwilling to relate information
about substance intake.

Functional Consequences of Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder
While there are many functional consequences associated with sleep
disorders, the only unique consequence for substance/medication-induced
sleep disorder is increased risk for relapse. The degree of sleep
disturbance during alcohol withdrawal (e.g., REM sleep rebound predicts
risk of relapse of drinking)1. Monitoring of sleep quality and daytime
sleepiness during and after withdrawal may provide clinically meaningful
information on whether an individual is at increased risk for relapse.

Differential Diagnosis Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal.
Sleep disturbances are commonly encountered in the context of substance
intoxication or substance discontinuation/withdrawal. A diagnosis of
substance/medication-induced sleep disorder should be made instead of a
diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when
the sleep disturbance is predominant in the clinical picture and is
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. Delirium.
If the substance/medication-induced sleep disturbance occurs exclusively
during the course of a delirium, it is not diagnosed separately. Other
sleep disorders. A substance/medication-induced sleep disorder is
distinguished from another sleep disorder if a substance/medication is
judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms. A
substance/medicationinduced sleep disorder attributed to a prescribed
medication for a mental disorder or medical condition must have its
onset while the individual is receiving the medication or during
discontinuation, if there is a discontinuation/withdrawal syndrome
associated with the medication. Once treatment is discontinued, the
sleep disturbance will usually remit within days to several weeks. If
symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks, other causes for the sleep
disturbance--related symptoms should be considered. Not infrequently,
individuals with another sleep disorder use medications or drugs of
abuse to self-medicate their symptoms (e.g., alcohol for management of
insomnia). If the substance/medication is judged to play a significant
role in the exacerbation of the sleep disturbance, an additional
diagnosis of a substance/medication-induced sleep disorder may be
warranted. Sleep disorder due to another medical condition.
Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder and sleep disorder
associated with another medical condition may produce similar symptoms
of insomnia, daytime sleepiness, or a parasomnia. Many individuals with
other medical conditions that cause sleep disturbance are treated with
medications that may also cause sleep disturbances. The chronology of
symptoms is the most important factor in distinguishing between these
two sources of sleep symptoms. Difficulties with sleep that clearly
preceded the use of any medication for treatment of a medical condition
would suggest a diagnosis of sleep disorder associated with

another medical condition. Conversely, sleep symptoms that appear only
after the initiation of a particular medication/substance suggest a
substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. If the disturbance is
comorbid with another medical condition and is also exacerbated by
substance use, both diagnoses (i.e., sleep disorder associated with
another medical condition and substance/medication-induced sleep
disorder) are given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine
whether the sleep disturbance is attributable to a substance/medication
or to another medical condition or is primary (i.e., not due to either a
substance/medication or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other
specified sleep-wake disorder or unspecified sleep-wake disorder is
indicated.

Comorbidity See the "Comorbidity" sections for other sleep disorders in
this chapter, including insomnia, hypersomnolence, central sleep apnea,
sleep-related hypoventilation, and circadian rhythm sleep-wake
disorders, shift work type.

Relationship to International Classification of Sleep Disorders The
International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2),
lists sleep disorders "due to drug or substance" under their respective
phenotypes (e.g., insomnia, hypersomnia).

Other Specified Insomnia Disorder 780.52 (G47.09) This category applies
to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of insomnia disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for insomnia disorder or any of the disorders
in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class. The other specified
insomnia disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does
not meet the criteria for insomnia disorder or any specific sleep-wake
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified insomnia disorder"
followed by the specific reason (e.g., "brief insomnia disorder").
Examples of presentations that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation include the following: 1. Brief insomnia
disorder: Duration is less than 3 months. 2. Restricted to
nonrestorative sleep: Predominant complaint is nonrestorative sleep
unaccompanied by other sleep symptoms such as difficulty falling asleep
or remaining asleep.

Unspecified Insomnia Disorder

780.52 (G47.00) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of insomnia disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
insomnia disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake disorders
diagnostic class. The unspecified insomnia disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that
the criteria are not met for insomnia disorder or a specific sleep-wake
disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Hypersomnolence Disorder 780.54 (G47.19) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of
hypersomnolence disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
hypersomnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake
disorders diagnostic class. The other specified hypersomnolence disorder
category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to
communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for hypersomnolence disorder or any specific sleep-wake
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified hypersomnolence
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "briefduration
hypersomnolence," as in Kleine-Levin syndrome).

Unspecified Hypersomnolence Disorder 780.54 (G47.10) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of
hypersomnolence disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for
hypersomnolence disorder or any of the disorders in the sleep-wake
disorders diagnostic class. The

unspecified hypersomnolence disorder category is used in situations in
which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria
are not met for hypersomnolence disorder or a specific sleep-wake
disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Specified Sleep-Wake Disorder 780.59 (G47.8) This category applies
to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sleep-wake
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders
in the sleep-wake disorders diagnostic class and do not qualify for a
diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or other specified
hypersomnolence disorder. The other specified sleep-wake disorder
category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to
communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the
criteria for any specific sleep-wake disorder. This is done by recording
"other specified sleep-wake disorder" followed by the specific reason
(e.g., "repeated arousals during rapid eye movement sleep without
polysomnography or history of Parkinson's disease or other
synucleinopathy").

Unspecified Sleep-Wake Disorder 780.59 (G47.9) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sleep-wake disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sleep-wake
disorders diagnostic class and do not qualify for a diagnosis of
unspecified insomnia disorder or unspecified hypersomnolence disorder.
The unspecified sleep-wake disorder category is used in situations in
which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria
are not met

for a specific sleep-wake disorder, and includes presentations in which
there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Sexual Dysfunctions Sexual dysfunctions include delayed ejaculation,
erectile disorder, female orgasmic disorder, female sexual
interest/arousal disorder, genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder, male
hypoactive sexual desire disorder, premature (early) ejaculation,
substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, other specified sexual
dysfunction, and unspecified sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunctions are
a heterogeneous group of disorders that are typically characterized by a
clinically significant disturbance in a person's ability to respond
sexually or to experience sexual pleasure. An individual may have
several sexual dysfunctions at the same time. In such cases, all of the
dysfunctions should be diagnosed. Clinical judgment should be used to
determine if the sexual difficulties are the result of inadequate sexual
stimulation; in these cases, there may still be a need for care, but a
diagnosis of a sexual dysfunction would not be made. These cases may
include, but are not limited to, conditions in which lack of knowledge
about effective stimulation prevents the experience of arousal or
orgasm. Subtypes are used to designate the onset of the difficulty. In
many individuals with sexual dysfunctions, the time of onset may
indicate different etiologies and interventions. Lifelong refers to a
sexual problem that has been present from first sexual experiences, and
acquired applies to sexual disorders that develop after a period of
relatively normal sexual function. Generalized refers to sexual
difficulties that are not limited to certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners, and situational refers to sexual difficulties
that only occur with certain types of stimulation, situations, or
partners. In addition to the lifelong/acquired and
generalized/situational subtypes, a number of factors must be considered
during the assessment of sexual dysfunction, given that they may be
relevant to etiology and/or treatment, and that may contribute, to
varying degrees, across individuals: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner's
sexual problems; partner's health status); 2) relationship factors
(e.g., poor communication; discrepancies in desire for

sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body
image; history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity
(e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement);
4) cultural or religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to
prohibitions against sexual activity or pleasure; attitudes toward
sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or
treatment. Clinical judgment about the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction
should take into consideration cultural factors that may influence
expectations or engender prohibitions about the experience of sexual
pleasure. Aging may be associated with a normative decrease in sexual
response. Sexual response has a requisite biological underpinning, yet
is usually experienced in an intrapersonal, interpersonal, and cultural
context. Thus, sexual function involves a complex interaction among
biological, sociocultural, and psychological factors. In many clinical
contexts, a precise understanding of the etiology of a sexual problem is
unknown. Nonetheless, a sexual dysfunction diagnosis requires ruling out
problems that are better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder, by
the effects of a substance (e.g., drug or medication), by a medical
condition (e.g., due to pelvic nerve damage), or by severe relationship
distress, partner violence, or other stressors. If the sexual
dysfunction is mostly explainable by another nonsexual mental disorder
(e.g., depressive or bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, posttraumatic
stress disorder, psychotic disorder), then only the other mental
disorder diagnosis should be made. If the problem is thought to be
better explained by the use/misuse or discontinuation of a drug or
substance, it should be diagnosed accordingly as a
substance/medicationinduced sexual dysfunction. If the sexual
dysfunction is attributable to another medical condition (e.g.,
peripheral neuropathy), the individual would not receive a psychiatric
diagnosis. If severe relationship distress, partner violence, or
significant stressors better explain the sexual difficulties, then a
sexual dysfunction diagnosis is not made, but an appropriate V or Z code
for the relationship problem or stressor may be listed. In many cases, a
precise etiological relationship between another condition (e.g., a
medical condition) and a sexual dysfunction cannot be established.

Delayed Ejaculation

Diagnostic Criteria

302.74 (F52.32)

a.  Either of the following symptoms must be experienced on almost all
    or all occasions (approximately 75%--100%) of partnered sexual
    activity (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in
    all contexts), and without the individual desiring delay:

<!-- -->

1.  Marked delay in ejaculation.
2.  Marked infrequency or absence of ejaculation.

<!-- -->

b.  The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of
    approximately 6 months.
c.  The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in
    the individual.
d.  The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental
    disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress or
    other significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects
    of a substance/medication or another medical condition. Specify
    whether: Lifelong: The disturbance has been present since the
    individual became sexually active. Acquired: The disturbance began
    after a period of relatively normal sexual function. Specify
    whether: Generalized: Not limited to certain types of stimulation,
    situations, or partners. Situational: Only occurs with certain types
    of stimulation, situations, or partners. Specify current severity:
    Mild: Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.
    Moderate: Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in
    Criterion A. Severe: Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the
    symptoms in Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features The distinguishing feature of delayed ejaculation is
a marked delay in or inability to achieve ejaculation (Criterion A). The
man reports difficulty or inability to ejaculate despite the presence of
adequate sexual stimulation and the desire to ejaculate. The presenting
complaint usually involves partnered sexual activity. In most cases, the
diagnosis will be made by selfreport of the individual. The definition
of "delay" does not have precise boundaries, as there is noconsensus as
to what constitutes a reasonable time to reach orgasm or what is
unacceptably long for most men and their sexual partners9.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The man and his partner may
report prolonged thrusting to achieve orgasm to the point of exhaustion
or genital discomfort and then ceasing efforts. Some men may report
avoiding sexual activity because of a repetitive pattern of difficulty
ejaculating. Some sexual partners may report feeling less sexually
attractive because their partner cannot ejaculate easily. In addition to
the subtypes "lifelong/acquired" and "generalized/situational," the
following five factors must be considered during assessment and
diagnosis of delayed ejaculation, given that they may be relevant to
etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual
problems, partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor
communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3)
individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image; history of
sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression,
anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4)
cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions
against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical
factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these
factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of
different men with this disorder.

Prevalence Prevalence is unclear because of the lack of a precise
definition of this syndrome. It is the least common male sexual
complaint. Only 75% of men report always ejaculating during sexual
activity3, and less than 1% of men

will complain of problems with reaching ejaculation that last more than
6 months6.

Development and Course Lifelong delayed ejaculation begins with early
sexual experiences and continues throughout life2. By definition,
acquired delayed ejaculation begins after a period of normal sexual
function. There is minimal evidence concerning the course of acquired
delayed ejaculation. The prevalence of delayed ejaculation appears to
remain relatively constant until around age 50 years, when the incidence
begins to increase significantly. Men in their 80s report twice as much
difficulty ejaculating as men younger than 59 years1.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Age-related loss
of the fast-conducting peripheral sensory nerves and age-related
decreased sex steroid secretion may be associated with the increase in
delayed ejaculation in men older than 50 years7.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Complaints of ejaculatory delay vary
across countries and cultures. Such complaints are more common among men
in Asian populations than in men living in Europe, Australia, or the
United States4. This variation may be attributable to cultural or
genetic differences between cultures.

Functional Consequences of Delayed Ejaculation Difficulty with
ejaculation may contribute to difficulties in conception. Delayed
ejaculation is often associated with considerable psychological distress
in one or both partners.

Differential Diagnosis Another medical condition. The major differential
diagnosis is between delayed ejaculation fully explained by another
medical illness or injury and delayed ejaculation with a psychogenic,
idiopathic, or combined psychological and medical etiology. A
situational aspect to the complaint is

suggestive of a psychological basis for the problem (e.g., men who can
ejaculate during sexual activity with one sex but not the other; men who
can ejaculate with one partner but not another of the same sex; men with
paraphilic arousal patterns; men who require highly ritualized activity
to ejaculate during partnered sexual activity). Another medical illness
or injury may produce delays in ejaculation independent of psychological
issues. For example, inability to ejaculate can be caused by
interruption of the nerve supply to the genitals, such as can occur
after traumatic surgical injury to the lumbar sympathetic ganglia,
abdominoperitoneal surgery, or lumbar sympathectomy5. Ejaculation is
thought to be under autonomic nervous system control involving the
hypogastric (sympathetic) and pudendal (parasympathetic) nerves. A
number of neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and
diabetic and alcoholic neuropathy, can cause inability to ejaculate7.
Delayed ejaculation should also be differentiated from retrograde
ejaculation (i.e., ejaculation into the bladder), which may follow
transurethral prostatic resection. Substance/medication use. A number of
pharmacological agents, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, alpha
sympathetic drugs, and opioid drugs, can cause ejaculatory problems8.
Dysfunction with orgasm. It is important in the history to ascertain
whether the complaint concerns delayed ejaculation or the sensation of
orgasm, or both. Ejaculation occurs in the genitals, whereas the
experience of orgasm is believed to be primarily subjective. Ejaculation
and orgasm usually occur together but not always. For example, a man
with a normal ejaculatory pattern may complain of decreased pleasure
(i.e., anhedonic ejaculation). Such a complaint would not be coded as
delayed ejaculation but could be coded as other specified sexual
dysfunction or unspecified sexual dysfunction.

Comorbidity There is some evidence to suggest that delayed ejaculation
may be more common in severe forms of major depressive disorder.

Erectile Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.72 (F52.21)

a.  At least one of the three following symptoms must be experienced on
    almost all or all (approximately 75%--100%) occasions of sexual
    activity (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in
    all contexts):

<!-- -->

1.  Marked difficulty in obtaining an erection during sexual activity.

2. Marked difficulty in maintaining an erection until the completion of
sexual activity. 3. Marked decrease in erectile rigidity. b. The
symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of
approximately 6 months. c. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically
significant distress in the individual. d. The sexual dysfunction is not
better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a consequence of
severe relationship distress or other significant stressors and is not
attributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical
condition. Specify whether: Lifelong: The disturbance has been present
since the individual became sexually active. Acquired: The disturbance
began after a period of relatively normal sexual function. Specify
whether: Generalized: Not limited to certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners. Situational: Only occurs with certain types of
stimulation, situations, or partners. Specify current severity: Mild:
Evidence of mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A. Moderate:
Evidence of moderate distress over the symptoms in Criterion A. Severe:
Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of erectile disorder is the
repeated failure to obtain or maintain erections during partnered sexual
activities (Criterion A). A careful sexual history is necessary to
ascertain that the problem has been present for a significant duration
of time (i.e., at least approximately 6

months) and occurs on the majority of sexual occasions (i.e., at least
75% of the time). Symptoms may occur only in specific situations
involving certain types of stimulation or partners, or they may occur in
a generalized manner in all types of situations, stimulation, or
partners.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Many men with erectile disorder
may have low self-esteem, low selfconfidence, and a decreased sense of
masculinity, and may experience depressed affect. Fear and/or avoidance
of future sexual encounters may occur. Decreased sexual satisfaction and
reduced sexual desire in the individual's partner are common. In
addition to the subtypes "lifelong/acquired" and
"generalized/situational," the following five factors must be considered
during assessment and diagnosis of erectile disorder given that they may
be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g.,
partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2) relationship
factors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual
activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image,
history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g.,
depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4)
cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions
against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical
factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these
factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of
different men with this disorder.

Prevalence The prevalence of lifelong versus acquired erectile disorder
is unknown. There is a strong age-related increase in both prevalence
and incidence of problems with erection4, particularly after age 50
years. Approximately 13%--21% of men ages 40--80 years complain of
occasional problems with erections. Approximately 2% of men younger than
age 40--50 years complain of frequent problems with erections, whereas
40%--50% of men older than 60--70 years may have significant problems
with erections7. About 20% of men fear erectile problems on their first
sexual experience, whereas approximately 8% experienced erectile
problems that hindered penetration during their first sexual experience.

Development and Course Erectile failure on first sexual attempt has been
found to be related to having sex with a previously unknown partner,
concomitant use of drugs or alcohol, not wanting to have sex, and peer
pressure8. There is minimal evidence regarding the persistence of such
problems after the first attempt. It is assumed that most of these
problems spontaneously remit without professional intervention, but some
men may continue to have episodic problems. In contrast, acquired
erectile disorder is often associated with biological factors such as
diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Acquired erectile disorder is
likely to be persistent in most men. The natural history of lifelong
erectile disorder is unknown. Clinical observation supports the
association of lifelong erectile disorder with psychological factors
that are self-limiting or responsive to psychological interventions,
whereas, as noted above, acquired erectile disorder is more likely to be
related to biological factors and to be persistent. The incidence of
erectile disorder increases with age. A minority of men diagnosed as
having moderate erectile failure may experience spontaneous remission of
symptoms without medical intervention10. Distress associated with
erectile disorder is lower in older men as compared with younger men.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Neurotic personality traits
may be associated with erectile problems in college students, and
submissive personality traits may be associated with erectile problems
in men age 40 years and older1. Alexithymia (i.e., deficits in cognitive
processing of emotions) is common in men diagnosed with "psychogenic"
erectile dysfunction5. Erectile problems are common in men diagnosed
with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder9. Course modifiers.
Risk factors for acquired erectile disorder include age, smoking
tobacco, lack of physical exercise, diabetes, and decreased desire2.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Complaints of erectile disorder have
been found to vary across countries6. It is unclear to what extent these
differences represent differences in cultural

expectations as opposed to genuine differences in the frequency of
erectile failure.

Diagnostic Markers Nocturnal penile tumescence testing and measured
erectile turgidity during sleep can be employed to help differentiate
organic from psychogenic erectile problems on the assumption that
adequate erections during rapid eye movement sleep indicate a
psychological etiology to the problem11. A number of other diagnostic
procedures may be employed depending on the clinician's assessment of
their relevance given the individual's age, comorbid medical problems,
and clinical presentation. Doppler ultrasonography and intravascular
injection of vasoactive drugs, as well as invasive diagnostic procedures
such as dynamic infusion cavernosography, can be used to assess vascular
integrity. Pudendal nerve conduction studies, including somatosensory
evoked potentials, can be employed when a peripheral neuropathy is
suspected. In men also complaining of decreased sexual desire, serum
bioavailable or free testosterone is frequently assessed to determine if
the difficulty is secondary to endocrinological factors. Thyroid
function may also be assessed. Determination of fasting serum glucose is
useful to screen for the presence of diabetes mellitus. The assessment
of serum lipids is important, as erectile disorder in men 40 years and
older is predictive of the future risk of coronary artery disease3.

Functional Consequences of Erectile Disorder Erectile disorder can
interfere with fertility and produce both individual and interpersonal
distress. Fear and/or avoidance of sexual encounters may interfere with
the ability to develop intimate relationships.

Differential Diagnosis Nonsexual mental disorders. Major depressive
disorder and erectile disorder are closely associated, and erectile
disorder accompanying severe depressive disorder may occur. Normal
erectile function. The differential should include consideration of
normal erectile function in men with excessive expectations.
Substance/medication use. Another major differential diagnosis is
whether the erectile problem is secondary to substance/medication use.
An

onset that coincides with the beginning of substance/medication use and
that dissipates with discontinuation of the substance/medication or dose
reduction is suggestive of a substance/medication-induced sexual
dysfunction. Another medical condition. The most difficult aspect of the
differential diagnosis of erectile disorder is ruling out erectile
problems that are fully explained by medical factors. Such cases would
not receive a diagnosis of a mental disorder. The distinction between
erectile disorder as a mental disorder and erectile dysfunction as the
result of another medical condition is usually unclear, and many cases
will have complex, interactive biological and psychiatric etiologies. If
the individual is older than 40--50 years and/or has concomitant medical
problems, the differential diagnosis should include medical etiologies,
especially vascular disease. The presence of an organic disease known to
cause erectile problems does not confirm a causal relationship. For
example, a man with diabetes mellitus can develop erectile disorder in
response to psychological stress. In general, erectile dysfunction due
to organic factors is generalized and gradual in onset. An exception
would be erectile problems after traumatic injury to the nervous
innervation of the genital organs (e.g., spinal cord injury). Erectile
problems that are situational and inconsistent and that have an acute
onset after a stressful life event are most often due to psychological
events. An age of less than 40 years is also suggestive of a
psychological etiology to the difficulty. Other sexual dysfunctions.
Erectile disorder may coexist with premature (early) ejaculation and
male hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

Comorbidity Erectile disorder can be comorbid with other sexual
diagnoses, such as premature (early) ejaculation and male hypoactive
sexual desire disorder, as well as with anxiety and depressive
disorders. Erectile disorder is common in men with lower urinary tract
symptoms related to prostatic hypertrophy. Erectile disorder may be
comorbid with dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypogonadism,
multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and other diseases that interfere
with the vascular, neurological, or endocrine function necessary for
normal erectile function.

Relationship to International Classification of Diseases Erectile
response is coded as failure of genital response in ICD-10 (F2.2).

Female Orgasmic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.73 (F52.31)

a.  Presence of either of the following symptoms and experienced on
    almost all or all (approximately 75%--100%) occasions of sexual
    activity (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in
    all contexts):

<!-- -->

1.  Marked delay in, marked infrequency of, or absence of orgasm.
2.  Markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations.

<!-- -->

b.  The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of
    approximately 6 months.
c.  The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in
    the individual.
d.  The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental
    disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress (e.g.,
    partner violence) or other significant stressors and is not
    attributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another
    medical condition. Specify whether: Lifelong: The disturbance has
    been present since the individual became sexually active. Acquired:
    The disturbance began after a period of relatively normal sexual
    function. Specify whether: Generalized: Not limited to certain types
    of stimulation, situations, or partners. Situational: Only occurs
    with certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners. Specify
    if: Never experienced an orgasm under any situation.

Specify current severity: Mild: Evidence of mild distress over the
symptoms in Criterion A. Moderate: Evidence of moderate distress over
the symptoms in Criterion A. Severe: Evidence of severe or extreme
distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by
difficulty experiencing orgasm and/or markedly reduced intensity of
orgasmic sensations (Criterion A). Women show wide variability in the
type or intensity of stimulation that elicits orgasm. Similarly,
subjective descriptions of orgasm are extremely varied, suggesting that
it is experienced in very different ways, both across women and on
different occasions by the same woman. For a diagnosis of female
orgasmic disorder, symptoms must be experienced on almost all or all
(approximately 75%--100%) occasions of sexual activity (in identified
situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts) and have a
minimum duration of approximately 6 months. The use of the minimum
severity and duration criteria is intended to distinguish transient
orgasm difficulties from more persistent orgasmic dysfunction. The
inclusion of "approximately" in Criterion B allows for clinician
judgment in cases in which symptom duration does not meet the
recommended 6-month threshold. For a woman to have a diagnosis of female
orgasmic disorder, clinically significant distress must accompany the
symptoms (Criterion C). In many cases of orgasm problems, the causes are
multifactorial or cannot be determined. If female orgasmic disorder is
deemed to be better explained by another mental disorder, the effects of
a substance/medication, or a medical condition, then a diagnosis of
female orgasmic disorder would not be made. Finally, if interpersonal or
significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship distress,
intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, are present,
then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made. Many
women require clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm, and a relatively
small proportion of women report that they always experience orgasm
during penile-vaginal intercourse. Thus, a woman's experiencing orgasm
through clitoral stimulation but not during intercourse does not meet

criteria for a clinical diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. It is
also important to consider whether orgasmic difficulties are the result
of inadequate sexual stimulation; in these cases, there may still be a
need for care, but a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be
made.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Associations between specific
patterns of personality traits or psychopathology and orgasmic
dysfunction have generally not been supported. Compared with women
without the disorder, some women with female orgasmic disorder may have
greater difficulty communicating about sexual issues. Overall sexual
satisfaction, however, is not strongly correlated with orgasmic
experience. Many women report high levels of sexual satisfaction despite
rarely or never experiencing orgasm. Orgasmic difficulties in women
often co-occur with problems related to sexual interest and arousal. In
addition to the subtypes "lifelong/acquired" and
"generalized/situational," the following five factors must be considered
during assessment and diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder given that
they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors
(e.g., partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2)
relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire
for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor
body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric
comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss,
bereavement); (4) cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related
to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality);
and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each
of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms
of different women with this disorder.

Prevalence Reported prevalence rates for female orgasmic problems in
women vary widely, from 10% to 42%, depending on multiple factors (e.g.,
age, culture, duration, and severity of symptoms)4, however, these
estimates do not take into account the presence of distress. Only a
proportion of women experiencing orgasm difficulties also report
associated distress11. Variation in how symptoms are assessed (e.g., the
duration of symptoms and the

recall period) also influence prevalence rates9. Approximately 10% of
women do not experience orgasm throughout their lifetime6.

Development and Course By definition, lifelong female orgasmic disorder
indicates that the orgasmic difficulties have always been present,
whereas the acquired subtype would be assigned if the woman's orgasmic
difficulties developed after a period of normal orgasmic functioning. A
woman's first experience of orgasm can occur any time from the
prepubertal period to well into adulthood. Women show a more variable
pattern in age at first orgasm than do men, and women's reports of
having experienced orgasm increase with age5. Many women learn to
experience orgasm as they experience a wide variety of stimulation and
acquire more knowledge about their bodies. Women's rates of orgasm
consistency (defined as "usually or always" experiencing orgasm) are
higher during masturbation than during sexual activity with a partner6.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. A wide range of psychological
factors, such as anxiety and concerns about pregnancy, can potentially
interfere with a woman's ability to experience orgasm. Environmental.
There is a strong association between relationship problems, physical
health, and mental health and orgasm difficulties in women2, 6.
Sociocultural factors (e.g., gender role expectations and religious
norms) are also important influences on the experience of orgasmic
difficulties. Genetic and physiological. Many physiological factors may
influence a woman's experience of orgasm, including medical conditions
and medications. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, pelvic nerve
damage from radical hysterectomy, and spinal cord injury can all
influence orgasmic functioning in women. Selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors are known to delay or inhibit orgasm in women. Women with
vulvovaginal atrophy (characterized by symptoms such as vaginal dryness,
itching, and pain) are significantly more likely to report orgasm
difficulties than are women without this condition8. Menopausal status
is not consistently associated

with the likelihood of orgasm difficulties1. There may be a significant
genetic contribution to variation in female orgasmic function3. However,
psychological, sociocultural, and physiological factors likely interact
in complex ways to influence women's experience of orgasm and of orgasm
difficulties.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The degree to which lack of orgasm in
women is regarded as a problem that requires treatment may vary
depending on cultural context. In addition, women differ in how
important orgasm is to their sexual satisfaction. There may be marked
sociocultural and generational differences in women's orgasmic ability.
For example, the prevalence of inability to reach orgasm has ranged from
17.7% (in Northern Europe) to 42.2% (in Southeast Asia)7.

Diagnostic Markers Although measurable physiological changes occur
during female orgasm, including changes in hormones, pelvic floor
musculature, and brain activation, there is significant variability in
these indicators of orgasm across women10. In clinical situations, the
diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder is based on a woman's self-report.

Functional Consequences of Female Orgasmic Disorder The functional
consequences of female orgasmic disorder are unclear. Although there is
a strong association between relationship problems and orgasmic
difficulties in women, it is unclear whether relationship factors are
risk factors for orgasmic difficulties or are consequences of those
difficulties.

Differential Diagnosis Nonsexual mental disorders. Nonsexual mental
disorders, such as major depressive disorder, which is characterized by
markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
activities, may explain female orgasmic disorder. If the orgasmic
difficulties are better explained by another mental disorder, then a
diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made.

Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction. Substance/medication
use may explain the orgasmic difficulties. Another medical condition. If
the disorder is due to another medical condition (e.g., multiple
sclerosis, spinal cord injury), then a diagnosis of female orgasmic
disorder would not be made. Interpersonal factors. If interpersonal or
significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship distress,
intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, are
associated with the orgasmic difficulties, then a diagnosis of female
orgasmic disorder would not be made. Other sexual dysfunctions. Female
orgasmic disorder may occur in association with other sexual
dysfunctions (e.g., female sexual interest/arousal disorder). The
presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis of
female orgasmic disorder. Occasional orgasmic difficulties that are
short-term or infrequent and are not accompanied by clinically
significant distress or impairment are not diagnosed as female orgasmic
disorder. A diagnosis is also not appropriate if the problems are the
result of inadequate sexual stimulation.

Comorbidity Women with female orgasmic disorder may have co-occurring
sexual interest/arousal difficulties. Women with diagnoses of other
nonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder, may
experience lower sexual interest/arousal, and this may indirectly
increase the likelihood of orgasmic difficulties.

Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.72 (F52.22)

a.  Lack of, or significantly reduced, sexual interest/arousal, as
    manifested by at least three of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Absent/reduced interest in sexual activity.
2.  Absent/reduced sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies.
3.  No/reduced initiation of sexual activity, and typically unreceptive
    to a partner's attempts to initiate.

4. Absent/reduced sexual excitement/pleasure during sexual activity in
almost all or all (approximately 75%--100%) sexual encounters (in
identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts). 5.
Absent/reduced sexual interest/arousal in response to any internal or
external sexual/erotic cues (e.g., written, verbal, visual). 6.
Absent/reduced genital or nongenital sensations during sexual activity
in almost all or all (approximately 75%--100%) sexual encounters (in
identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts). b.
The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of
approximately 6 months. c. The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically
significant distress in the individual. d. The sexual dysfunction is not
better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a consequence of
severe relationship distress (e.g., partner violence) or other
significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects of a
substance/medication or another medical condition. Specify whether:
Lifelong: The disturbance has been present since the individual became
sexually active. Acquired: The disturbance began after a period of
relatively normal sexual function. Specify whether: Generalized: Not
limited to certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners.
Situational: Only occurs with certain types of stimulation, situations,
or partners. Specify current severity: Mild: Evidence of mild distress
over the symptoms in Criterion A. Moderate: Evidence of moderate
distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

Severe: Evidence of severe or extreme distress over the symptoms in
Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features In assessing female sexual interest/arousal
disorder, interpersonal context must be taken into account. A "desire
discrepancy," in which a woman has lower desire for sexual activity than
her partner, is not sufficient to diagnose female sexual
interest/arousal disorder. In order for the criteria for the disorder to
be met, there must be absence or reduced frequency or intensity of at
least three of six indicators (Criterion A) for a minimum duration of
approximately 6 months (Criterion B). There may be different symptom
profiles across women, as well as variability in how sexual interest and
arousal are expressed19. For example, in one woman, sexual
interest/arousal disorder may be expressed as a lack of interest in
sexual activity, an absence of erotic or sexual thoughts, and reluctance
to initiate sexual activity and respond to a partner's sexual
invitations. In another woman, an inability to become sexually excited,
to respond to sexual stimuli with sexual desire, and a corresponding
lack of signs of physical sexual arousal may be the primary features.
Because sexual desire and arousal frequently coexist and are elicited in
response to adequate sexual cues, the criteria for female sexual
interest/arousal disorder take into account that difficulties in desire
and arousal often simultaneously characterize the complaints of women
with this disorder. Short-term changes in sexual interest or arousal are
common and may be adaptive responses to events in a woman's life11 and
do not represent a sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis of female sexual
interest/arousal disorder requires a minimum duration of symptoms of
approximately 6 months as a reflection that the symptoms must be a
persistent problem. The estimation of persistence may be determined by
clinical judgment when a duration of 6 months cannot be ascertained
precisely. There may be absent or reduced frequency or intensity of
interest in sexual activity (Criterion A1), which was previously termed
hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The frequency or intensity of sexual
and erotic thoughts or fantasies may be absent or reduced (Criterion
A2). The expression of fantasies varies widely across women and may
include memories of past sexual experiences. The normative decline in
sexual

thoughts with age should be taken into account when this criterion is
being assessed. Absence or reduced frequency of initiating sexual
activity and of receptivity to a partner's sexual invitations (Criterion
A3) is a behaviorally focused criterion. A couple's beliefs and
preferences for sexual initiation patterns are highly relevant to the
assessment of this criterion. There may be absent or reduced sexual
excitement or pleasure during sexual activity in almost all or all
(approximately 75%--100%) sexual encounters (Criterion A4). Lack of
pleasure is a common presenting clinical complaint in women with low
desire. Among women who report low sexual desire, there are fewer sexual
or erotic cues that elicit sexual interest or arousal (i.e., there is a
lack of "responsive desire")15. Assessment of the adequacy of sexual
stimuli will assist in determining if there is a difficulty with
responsive sexual desire (Criterion A5). Frequency or intensity of
genital or nongenital sensations during sexual activity may be reduced
or absent (Criterion A6). This may include reduced vaginal
lubrication/vasocongestion, but because physiological measures of
genital sexual response do not differentiate women who report sexual
arousal concerns from those who do not, the selfreport of reduced or
absent genital or nongenital sensations is sufficient. For a diagnosis
of female sexual interest/arousal disorder to be made, clinically
significant distress must accompany the symptoms in Criterion A.
Distress may be experienced as a result of the lack of sexual
interest/arousal or as a result of significant interference in a woman's
life and well-being. If a lifelong lack of sexual desire is better
explained by one's selfidentification as "asexual," then a diagnosis of
female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made3.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Female sexual interest/arousal
disorder is frequently associated with problems in experiencing orgasm,
pain experienced during sexual activity, infrequent sexual activity, and
couple-level discrepancies in desire. Relationship difficulties and mood
disorders are also frequently associated features of female sexual
interest/arousal disorder. Unrealistic expectations and norms regarding
the "appropriate" level of sexual interest or arousal, along with poor
sexual techniques and lack of information about sexuality, may also be
evident in women diagnosed with female sexual interest/arousal disorder.
The latter, as well as normative beliefs about gender roles, are
important factors to consider.

In addition to the subtypes "lifelong/acquired" and
"generalized/situational," the following five factors must be considered
during assessment and diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal
disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or
treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems,
partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor
communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3)
individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of
sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression,
anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4)
cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions
against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical
factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Note that each of
these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of
different women with this disorder.

Prevalence The prevalence of female sexual interest/arousal disorder, as
defined in this manual, is unknown. The prevalence of low sexual desire
and of problems with sexual arousal (with and without associated
distress), as defined by DSM-IV or ICD-10, may vary markedly in relation
to age, cultural setting, duration of symptoms, and presence of
distress2, 10. Regarding duration of symptoms, there are striking
differences in prevalence estimates between short-term and persistent
problems related to lack of sexual interest16. When distress about
sexual functioning is required, prevalence estimates are markedly
lower1, 8. Some older women report less distress about low sexual desire
than younger women, although sexual desire may decrease with age1.

Development and Course By definition, lifelong female sexual
interest/arousal disorder suggests that the lack of sexual interest or
arousal has been present for the woman's entire sexual life. For
Criteria A3, A4, and A6, which assess functioning during sexual
activity, a subtype of lifelong would mean presence of symptoms since
the individual's first sexual experiences. The acquired subtype would be
assigned if the difficulties with sexual interest or arousal developed
after a period of nonproblematic sexual functioning. Adaptive

and normative changes in sexual functioning may result from
partnerrelated, interpersonal, or personal events and may be transient
in nature. However, persistence of symptoms for approximately 6 months
or more would constitute a sexual dysfunction. There are normative
changes in sexual interest and arousal across the life span.
Furthermore, women in relationships of longer duration are more likely
to report engaging in sex despite no obvious feelings of sexual desire
at the outset of a sexual encounter compared with women in
shorterduration relationships6. Vaginal dryness in older women is
related to age and menopausal status13, 18.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Temperamental factors include
negative cognitions and attitudes about sexuality and past history of
mental disorders4, 7, 17. Differences in propensity for sexual
excitation and sexual inhibition may also predict the likelihood of
developing sexual problems20. Environmental. Environmental factors
include relationship difficulties, partner sexual functioning, and
developmental history, such as early relationships with caregivers and
childhood stressors4, 7, 17. Genetic and physiological. Some medical
conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction) can be risk
factors for female sexual interest/arousal disorder. There appears to be
a strong influence of genetic factors on vulnerability to sexual
problems in women5. Psychophysiological research using vaginal
photoplethysmography has not found differences between women with and
without perceived lack of genital arousal12.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues There is marked variability in
prevalence rates of low desire across cultures13. Lower rates of sexual
desire may be more common among East Asian women compared with
Euro-Canadian women22, 23. Although the lower levels of sexual desire
and arousal found in men and women from East Asian countries compared
with Euro-American groups may reflect less interest in sex in those
cultures, the possibility remains that such group differences are an
artifact of the measures used to quantify desire. A judgment about
whether low sexual desire reported by a woman from a

certain ethnocultural group meets criteria for female sexual
interest/arousal disorder must take into account the fact that different
cultures may pathologize some behaviors and not others.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues By definition, the diagnosis of female
sexual interest/arousal disorder is only given to women. Distressing
difficulties with sexual desire in men would be considered under male
hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

Functional Consequences Interest/Arousal Disorder

of

Female

Sexual

Difficulties in sexual interest/arousal are often associated with
decreased relationship satisfaction.

Differential Diagnosis Nonsexual mental disorders. Nonsexual mental
disorders, such as major depressive disorder, in which there is
"markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
activities most of the day, nearly every day," may explain the lack of
sexual interest/arousal. If the lack of interest or arousal is
completely attributable to another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of
female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made.
Substance/medication use. Substance or medication use may explain the
lack of interest/arousal. Another medical condition. If the sexual
symptoms are considered to be almost exclusively associated with the
effects of another medical condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
endothelial disease, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system
disease), then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder
would not be made. Interpersonal factors. If interpersonal or
significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship distress,
intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, explain the
sexual interest/arousal symptoms, then a diagnosis of female sexual
interest/arousal disorder would not be made. Other sexual dysfunctions.
The presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis
of female sexual interest/arousal disorder. It is common for women to
experience more than one sexual dysfunction9. For

example, the presence of chronic genital pain may lead to a lack of
desire for the (painful) sexual activity. Lack of interest and arousal
during sexual activity may impair orgasmic ability. For some women, all
aspects of the sexual response may be unsatisfying and distressing.
Inadequate or absent sexual stimuli. When differential diagnoses are
being considered, it is important to assess the adequacy of sexual
stimuli within the woman's sexual experience. In cases where inadequate
or absent sexual stimuli are contributing to the clinical picture, there
may be evidence for clinical care, but a sexual dysfunction diagnosis
would not be made. Similarly, transient and adaptive alterations in
sexual functioning that are secondary to a significant life or personal
event must be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Comorbidity Comorbidity between sexual interest/arousal problems and
other sexual difficulties is extremely common. Sexual distress and
dissatisfaction with sex life are also highly correlated in women with
low sexual desire. Distressing low desire is associated with depression,
thyroid problems, anxiety, urinary incontinence21, and other medical
factors. Arthritis and inflammatory or irritable bowel disease are also
associated with sexual arousal problems. Low desire appears to be
comorbid with depression, sexual and physical abuse in adulthood, global
mental functioning, and use of alcohol14.

Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.76 (F52.6)

a.  Persistent or recurrent difficulties with one (or more) of the
    following:

<!-- -->

1.  Vaginal penetration during intercourse.
2.  Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse or
    penetration attempts.
3.  Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in
    anticipation of, during, or as a result of vaginal penetration.

4. Marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during
attempted vaginal penetration. b. The symptoms in Criterion A have
persisted for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months. c. The
symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in the
individual. d. The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a
nonsexual mental disorder or as a consequence of a severe relationship
distress (e.g., partner violence) or other significant stressors and is
not attributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another
medical condition. Specify whether: Lifelong: The disturbance has been
present since the individual became sexually active. Acquired: The
disturbance began after a period of relatively normal sexual function.
Specify current severity: Mild: Evidence of mild distress over the
symptoms in Criterion A. Moderate: Evidence of moderate distress over
the symptoms in Criterion A. Severe: Evidence of severe or extreme
distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder refers to
four commonly comorbid symptom dimensions: 1) difficulty having
intercourse, 2) genito-pelvic pain, 3) fear of pain or vaginal
penetration, and 4) tension of the pelvic floor muscles (Criterion A).
Because major difficulty in any one of these symptom dimensions is often
sufficient to cause clinically significant distress, a diagnosis can be
made on the basis of marked difficulty in only one symptom dimension.
However, all four symptom dimensions should be assessed even if a
diagnosis can be made on the basis of only one symptom dimension1, 2.
Marked difficulty having vaginal intercourse/penetration (Criterion A1)
can vary from a total inability to experience vaginal penetration in any

situation (e.g., intercourse, gynecological examinations, tampon
insertion) to the ability to easily experience penetration in one
situation and but not in another. Although the most common clinical
situation is when a woman is unable to experience intercourse or
penetration with a partner, difficulties in undergoing required
gynecological examinations may also be present. Marked vulvovaginal or
pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts
(Criterion A2) refers to pain occurring in different locations in the
genito-pelvic area. Location of pain as well as intensity should be
assessed. Typically, pain can be characterized as superficial
(vulvovaginal or occurring during penetration) or deep (pelvic; i.e.,
not felt until deeper penetration). The intensity of the pain is often
not linearly related to distress or interference with sexual intercourse
or other sexual activities. Some genito-pelvic pain only occurs when
provoked (i.e., by intercourse or mechanical stimulation); other
genito-pelvic pain may be spontaneous as well as provoked. Genito-pelvic
pain can also be usefully characterized qualitatively (e.g., "burning,"
"cutting," "shooting," "throbbing"). The pain may persist for a period
after intercourse is completed and may also occur during urination.
Typically, the pain experienced during sexual intercourse can be
reproduced during a gynecological examination. Marked fear or anxiety
about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain either in anticipation of, or during,
or as a result of vaginal penetration (Criterion A3) is commonly
reported by women who have regularly experienced pain during sexual
intercourse. This "normal" reaction may lead to avoidance of
sexual/intimate situations. In other cases, this marked fear does not
appear to be closely related to the experience of pain but nonetheless
leads to avoidance of intercourse and vaginal penetration situations.
Some have described this as similar to a phobic reaction except that the
phobic object may be vaginal penetration or the fear of pain. Marked
tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted
vaginal penetration (Criterion A4) can vary from reflexive-like spasm of
the pelvic floor in response to attempted vaginal entry to
"normal/voluntary" muscle guarding in response to the anticipated or the
repeated experience of pain or to fear or anxiety. In the case of
"normal/guarding" reactions, penetration may be possible under
circumstances of relaxation. The characterization and assessment of
pelvic

floor dysfunction is often best undertaken by a specialist gynecologist
or by a pelvic floor physical therapist14.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Genito-pelvic pain/penetration
disorder is frequently associated with other sexual dysfunctions,
particularly reduced sexual desire and interest (female sexual
interest/arousal disorder). Sometimes desire and interest are preserved
in sexual situations that are not painful or do not require penetration.
Even when individuals with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder
report sexual interest/motivation, there is often behavioral avoidance
of sexual situations and opportunities. Avoidance of gynecological
examinations despite medical recommendations is also frequent. The
pattern of avoidance is similar to that seen in phobic disorders. It is
common for women who have not succeeded in having sexual intercourse to
come for treatment only when they wish to conceive. Many women with
genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder will experience associated
relationship/marital problems; they also often report that the symptoms
significantly diminish their feelings of femininity3. In addition to the
subtype "lifelong/acquired," five factors should be considered during
assessment and diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder
because they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner
factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2)
relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, discrepancies in desire
for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor
body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric
comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss,
bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related
to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality);
and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each
of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms
of different women with this disorder. There are no valid physiological
measures of any of the component symptom dimensions of genito-pelvic
pain/penetration disorder. Validated psychometric inventories may be
used to formally assess the pain and anxiety components related to
genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder.

Prevalence The prevalence of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is
unknown. However, approximately 15% of women in North America report
recurrent pain during intercourse10. Difficulties having intercourse
appear to be a frequent referral to sexual dysfunction clinics and to
specialist clinicians.

Development and Course The development and course of genito-pelvic
pain/penetration disorder is unclear. Because women generally do not
seek treatment until they experience problems in sexual functioning, it
can, in general, be difficult to characterize genito-pelvic
pain/penetration disorder as lifelong (primary) or acquired (secondary).
Although women typically come to clinical attention after the initiation
of sexual activity, there are often earlier clinical signs. For example,
difficulty with or the avoidance of use of tampons is an important
predictor of later problems. Difficulties with vaginal penetration
(inability or fear or pain) may not be obvious until sexual intercourse
is attempted. Even once intercourse is attempted, the frequency of
attempts may not be significant or regular. In cases where it is
difficult to establish whether symptomatology is lifelong or acquired,
it is useful to determine the presence of any consistent period of
successful pain-, fear-, and tensionfree intercourse. If the experience
of such a period can be established, then genito-pelvic pain/penetration
disorder can be characterized as acquired. Once symptomatology is well
established for a period of approximately 6 months, the probability of
spontaneous and significant symptomatic remission appears to diminish.
Complaints related to genito-pelvic pain peak during early adulthood and
in the peri- and postmenopausal period. Women with complaints about
difficulty having intercourse appear to be primarily premenopausal.
There may also be an increase in genito-pelvic pain--related symptoms in
the postpartum period12.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Sexual and/or physical abuse
have often been cited as predictors of the DSM-IV-defined sexual pain
disorders dyspareunia and vaginismus. This is a matter of controversy in
the current literature13.

Genetic and physiological. Women experiencing superficial pain during
sexual intercourse often report the onset of the pain after a history of
vaginal infections. Even after the infections have resolved and there
are no known residual physical findings, the pain persists6. Pain during
tampon insertion or the inability to insert tampons before any sexual
contact has been attempted is an important risk factor for genito-pelvic
pain/penetration disorder7.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues In the past, inadequate sexual
education and religious orthodoxy have often been considered to be
culturally related predisposing factors to the DSM-IV diagnosis of
vaginismus. This perception appears to be confirmed by recent reports
from Turkey, a primarily Muslim country, indicating a strikingly high
prevalence for the disorder5. However, most available research, although
limited in scope, does not support this notion9.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues By definition, the diagnosis of
genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is only given to women. There is
relatively new research concerning urological chronic pelvic pain
syndrome in men, suggesting that men may experience some similar
problems. The research and clinical experience are not sufficiently
developed yet to justify the application of this diagnosis to men4.
Other specified sexual dysfunction or unspecified sexual dysfunction may
be diagnosed in men appearing to fit this pattern.

Functional Consequences Pain/Penetration Disorder

of

Genito-Pelvic

Functional difficulties in genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder are
often associated with interference in relationship satisfaction and
sometimes with the ability to conceive via penile/vaginal intercourse.

Differential Diagnosis Another medical condition. In many instances,
women with genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder will also be diagnosed
with another medical condition (e.g., lichen sclerosus, endometriosis,
pelvic

inflammatory disease, vulvovaginal atrophy). In some cases, treating the
medical condition may alleviate the genito-pelvic pain/penetration
disorder. Much of the time, this is not the case. There are no reliable
tools or diagnostic methods to allow clinicians to know whether the
medical condition or genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is primary.
Often, the associated medical conditions are difficult to diagnose and
treat. For example, the increased incidence of postmenopausal pain
during intercourse may sometimes be attributable to vaginal dryness or
vulvovaginal atrophy associated with declining estrogen levels. The
relationship, however, between vulvovaginal atrophy/dryness, estrogen,
and pain is not well understood8. Somatic symptom and related disorders.
Some women with genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder may also be
diagnosable with somatic symptom disorder. Since both genito-pelvic
pain/penetration disorder and the somatic symptom and related disorders
are new diagnoses, it is not yet clear whether they can be reliably
differentiated. Some women diagnosed with genito-pelvic pain/penetration
disorder will also be diagnosed with a specific phobia. Inadequate
sexual stimuli. It is important that the clinician, in considering
differential diagnoses, assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the
woman's sexual experience. Sexual situations in which there is
inadequate foreplay or arousal may lead to difficulties in penetration,
pain, or avoidance. Erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation in the
male partner may result in difficulties with penetration. These
conditions should be carefully assessed. In some situations, a diagnosis
of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder may not be appropriate.

Comorbidity Comorbidity between genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder
and other sexual difficulties appears to be common. Comorbidity with
relationship distress is also common. This is not surprising, since in
Western cultures the inability to have (pain-free) intercourse with a
desired partner and the avoidance of sexual opportunities may be either
a contributing factor to or the result of other sexual or relationship
problems. Because pelvic floor symptoms are implicated in the diagnosis
of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, there is likely to be a
higher prevalence of other disorders related

to the pelvic floor or reproductive organs (e.g., interstitial cystitis,
constipation, vaginal infection, endometriosis, irritable bowel
syndrome).

Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.71 (F52.0)

a.  Persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual/erotic
    thoughts or fantasies and desire for sexual activity. The judgment
    of deficiency is made by the clinician, taking into account factors
    that affect sexual functioning, such as age and general and
    sociocultural contexts of the individual's life.
b.  The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of
    approximately 6 months.
c.  The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in
    the individual.
d.  The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental
    disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress or
    other significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects
    of a substance/medication or another medical condition. Specify
    whether: Lifelong: The disturbance has been present since the
    individual became sexually active. Acquired: The disturbance began
    after a period of relatively normal sexual function. Specify
    whether:

Generalized: Not limited to certain types of stimulation, situations, or
partners. Situational: Only occurs with certain types of stimulation,
situations, or partners. Specify current severity: Mild: Evidence of
mild distress over the symptoms in Criterion A. Moderate: Evidence of
moderate distress over the symptoms in Criterion A. Severe: Evidence of
severe or extreme distress over the symptoms in Criterion A.

Diagnostic Features When an assessment for male hypoactive sexual desire
disorder is being made, interpersonal context must be taken into
account. A "desire discrepancy," in which a man has lower desire for
sexual activity than his partner, is not sufficient to diagnose male
hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Both low/absent desire for sex and
deficient/absent sexual thoughts or fantasies are required for a
diagnosis of the disorder. There may be variation across men in how
sexual desire is expressed9. The lack of desire for sex and
deficient/absent erotic thoughts or fantasies must be persistent or
recurrent and must occur for a minimum duration of approximately 6
months. The inclusion of this duration criterion is meant to safeguard
against making a diagnosis in cases in which a man's low sexual desire
may represent an adaptive response to adverse life conditions (e.g.,
concern about a partner's pregnancy when the man is considering
terminating the relationship). The introduction of "approximately" in
Criterion B allows for clinician judgment in cases in which symptom
duration does not meet the recommended 6-month threshold.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Male hypoactive sexual desire
disorder is sometimes associated with erectile and/or ejaculatory
concerns. For example, persistent difficulties obtaining an erection may
lead a man to lose interest in sexual activity. Men with hypoactive
sexual desire disorder often report that they no longer initiate sexual
activity and that they are minimally receptive to a partner's

attempt to initiate. Sexual activities (e.g., masturbation or partnered
sexual activity) may sometimes occur even in the presence of low sexual
desire. Relationship-specific preferences regarding patterns of sexual
initiation must be taken into account when making a diagnosis of male
hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Although men are more likely to
initiate sexual activity2, and thus low desire may be characterized by a
pattern of noninitiation, many men may prefer to have their partner
initiate sexual activity. In such situations, the man's lack of
receptivity to a partner's initiation should be considered when
evaluating low desire. In addition to the subtypes "lifelong/acquired"
and "generalized/situational," the following five factors must be
considered during assessment and diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual
desire disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or
treatment: 1) partner factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems,
partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor
communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3)
individual vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of
sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression,
anxiety), or stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4)
cultural/religious factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions
against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical
factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these
factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of
different men with this disorder.

Prevalence The prevalence of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder
varies depending on country of origin and method of assessment.
Approximately 6% of younger men (ages 18--24 years) and 41% of older men
(ages 66--74 years) have problems with sexual desire8. However, a
persistent lack of interest in sex, lasting 6 months or more, affects
only a small proportion of men ages 16--44 (1.8%)11.

Development and Course By definition, lifelong male hypoactive sexual
desire disorder indicates that low or no sexual desire has always been
present, whereas the acquired subtype would be assigned if the man's low
desire developed after a period of normal sexual desire. There is a
requirement that low desire persist for

approximately 6 months or more; thus, short-term changes in sexual
desire should not be diagnosed as male hypoactive sexual desire
disorder. There is a normative age-related decline in sexual desire.
Like women, men identify a variety of triggers for their sexual desire,
and they describe a wide range of reasons that they choose to engage in
sexual activity12. Although erotic visual cues may be more potent
elicitors of desire in younger men, the potency of sexual cues may
decrease with age and must be considered when evaluating men for
hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Mood and anxiety symptoms
appear to be strong predictors of low desire in men6. Up to half of men
with a past history of psychiatric symptoms may have moderate or severe
loss of desire, compared with only 15% of those without such a history.
A man's feelings about himself, his perception of his partner's sexual
desire toward him, feelings of being emotionally connected, and
contextual variables may all negatively (as well as positively) affect
sexual desire. Environmental. Alcohol use may increase the occurrence of
low desire. Among gay men, self-directed homophobia, interpersonal
problems, attitudes, lack of adequate sex education, and trauma
resulting from early life experiences must be taken into account in
explaining the low desire13. Social and cultural contextual factors
should also be considered. Genetic and physiological. Endocrine
disorders such as hyperprolactinemia significantly affect sexual desire
in men3. Age is a significant risk factor for low desire in men. It is
unclear whether or not men with low desire also have abnormally low
levels of testosterone; however, among hypogonadal men, low desire is
common. There also may be a critical threshold below which testosterone
will affect sexual desire in men and above which there is little effect
of testosterone on men's desire1.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues There is marked variability in
prevalence rates of low desire across cultures, ranging from 12.5% in
Northern European men to 28% in Southeast Asian men ages 40--80 years10.
Just as there are higher rates of low desire among East Asian subgroups
of women, men of East Asian ancestry also have

higher rates of low desire. Guilt about sex may mediate this association
between East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men5.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues In contrast to the classification of
sexual disorders in women, desire and arousal disorders have been
retained as separate constructs in men. Despite some similarities in the
experience of desire across men and women, and the fact that desire
fluctuates over time and is dependent on contextual factors9, men do
report a significantly higher intensity and frequency of sexual desire
compared with women2.

Differential Diagnosis Nonsexual mental disorders. Nonsexual mental
disorders, such as major depressive disorder, which is characterized by
"markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
activities," may explain the lack of sexual desire. If the lack of
desire is better explained by another mental disorder, then a diagnosis
of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made.
Substance/medication use. lack of sexual desire.

Substance/medication use may explain the

Another medical condition. If the low/absent desire and deficient/absent
erotic thoughts or fantasies are better explained by the effects of
another medical condition (e.g., hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus,
thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a diagnosis
of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made.
Interpersonal factors. If interpersonal or significant contextual
factors, such as severe relationship distress or other significant
stressors, are associated with the loss of desire in the man, then a
diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made.
Other sexual dysfunctions. The presence of another sexual dysfunction
does not rule out a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder;
there is some evidence that up to one-half of men with low sexual desire
also have erectile difficulties, and slightly fewer may also have early
ejaculation difficulties7. If the man's low desire is explained by self-

identification as an asexual, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual
desire disorder is not made4.

Comorbidity Depression and other mental disorders, as well as
endocrinological factors, are often comorbid with male hypoactive sexual
desire disorder.

Premature (Early) Ejaculation Diagnostic Criteria

302.75 (F52.4)

a.  A persistent or recurrent pattern of ejaculation occurring during
    partnered sexual activity within approximately 1 minute following
    vaginal penetration and before the individual wishes it. Note:
    Although the diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation may be
    applied to individuals engaged in nonvaginal sexual activities,
    specific duration criteria have not been established for these
    activities.
b.  The symptom in Criterion A must have been present for at least 6
    months and must be experienced on almost all or all (approximately
    75%--100%) occasions of sexual activity (in identified situational
    contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts).
c.  The symptom in Criterion A causes clinically significant distress in
    the individual.
d.  The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental
    disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress or
    other significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects
    of a substance/medication or another medical condition. Specify
    whether: Lifelong: The disturbance has been present since the
    individual became sexually active. Acquired: The disturbance began
    after a period of relatively normal sexual function.

Specify whether: Generalized: Not limited to certain types of
stimulation, situations, or partners. Situational: Only occurs with
certain types of stimulation, situations, or partners. Specify current
severity: Mild: Ejaculation occurring within approximately 30 seconds to
1 minute of vaginal penetration. Moderate: Ejaculation occurring within
approximately 15--30 seconds of vaginal penetration. Severe: Ejaculation
occurring prior to sexual activity, at the start of sexual activity, or
within approximately 15 seconds of vaginal penetration.

Diagnostic Features Premature (early) ejaculation is manifested by
ejaculation that occurs prior to or shortly after vaginal penetration,
operationalized by an individual's estimate of ejaculatory latency
(i.e., elapsed time before ejaculation) after vaginal penetration.
Estimated and measured intravaginal ejaculatory latencies are highly
correlated as long as the ejaculatory latency is of short duration;
therefore, self-reported estimates of ejaculatory latency are sufficient
for diagnostic purposes8. A 60-second intravaginal ejaculatory latency
time is an appropriate cutoff for the diagnosis of lifelong premature
(early) ejaculation in heterosexual men. There are insufficient data to
determine if this duration criterion can be applied to acquired
premature (early) ejaculation. The durational definition may apply to
males of varying sexual orientations, since ejaculatory latencies appear
to be similar across men of different sexual orientations and across
different sexual activities3.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Many males with premature
(early) ejaculation complain of a sense of lack of control over
ejaculation and report apprehension about their anticipated inability to
delay ejaculation on future sexual encounters1. The following factors
may be relevant in the evaluation of any sexual dysfunction: 1) partner
factors (e.g., partner's sexual problems, partner's

health status); 2) relationship factors (e.g., poor communication,
discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual
vulnerability factors (e.g., poor body image, history of sexual or
emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., depression, anxiety),
and stressors (e.g., job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious
factors (e.g., inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual
activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant
to prognosis, course, or treatment.

Prevalence Estimates of the prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation
vary widely depending on the definition utilized. Internationally, more
than 20%--30% of men ages 18--70 years report concern about how rapidly
they ejaculate4. With the new definition of premature (early)
ejaculation (i.e., ejaculation occurring within approximately 1 minute
of vaginal penetration), only 1%-- 3% of men would be diagnosed with the
disorder. Prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation may increase with
age.

Development and Course By definition, lifelong premature (early)
ejaculation starts during a male's initial sexual experiences and
persists thereafter. Some men may experience premature (early)
ejaculation during their initial sexual encounters but gain ejaculatory
control over time. It is the persistence of ejaculatory problems for
longer than 6 months that determines the diagnosis of premature (early)
ejaculation. In contrast, some men develop the disorder after a period
of having a normal ejaculatory latency, known as acquired premature
(early) ejaculation. There is far less known about acquired premature
(early) ejaculation than about lifelong premature (early) ejaculation.
The acquired form likely has a later onset, usually appearing during or
after the fourth decade of life. Lifelong is relatively stable
throughout life. Little is known about the course of acquired premature
(early) ejaculation. Reversal of medical conditions such as
hyperthyroidism and prostatitis appears to restore ejaculatory latencies
to baseline values6. Lifelong premature (early) ejaculation begins with
early sexual experiences and persists throughout an individual's life.
In approximately 20% of men with premature (early) ejaculation,
ejaculatory latencies decrease further with age. Age and

relationship length have been found to be negatively associated with
prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Premature (early) ejaculation
may be more common in men with anxiety disorders, especially social
anxiety disorder (social phobia). Genetic and physiological. There is a
moderate genetic contribution to lifelong premature (early)
ejaculation2. Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with
dopamine transporter gene polymorphism7 or serotonin transporter gene
polymorphism9. Thyroid disease, prostatitis, and drug withdrawal are
associated with acquired premature (early) ejaculation. Positron
emission tomography measures of regional cerebral blood flow during
ejaculation have shown primary activation in the mesocephalic transition
zone, including the ventral tegmental area.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Perception of what constitutes a
normal ejaculatory latency is different in many cultures. Measured
ejaculatory latencies may differ in some countries11. Such differences
may be explained by cultural or religious factors as well as genetic
differences between populations.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Premature (early) ejaculation is a
sexual disorder in males. Males and their sexual partners may differ in
their perception of what constitutes an acceptable ejaculatory latency.
There may be increasing concerns in females about early ejaculation in
their sexual partners, which may be a reflection of changing societal
attitudes concerning female sexual activity.

Diagnostic Markers Ejaculatory latency is usually monitored in research
settings by the sexual partner utilizing a timing device (e.g.,
stopwatch), though this is not ideal in real-life sexual situations. For
vaginal intercourse, the time between intravaginal penetration and
ejaculation is measured.

Functional Consequences of Premature (Early) Ejaculation A pattern of
premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with decreased
self-esteem, a sense of lack of control, and adverse consequences for
partner relationships. It may also cause personal distress in the sexual
partner and decreased sexual satisfaction in the sexual partner5.
Ejaculation prior to penetration may be associated with difficulties in
conception.

Differential Diagnosis Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction.
When problems with premature ejaculation are due exclusively to
substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal, substance/medication-induced
sexual dysfunction should be diagnosed. Ejaculatory concerns that do not
meet diagnostic criteria. It is necessary to identify males with normal
ejaculatory latencies who desire longer ejaculatory latencies and males
who have episodic premature (early) ejaculation (e.g., during the first
sexual encounter with a new partner when a short ejaculatory latency may
be common or normative). Neither of these situations would lead to a
diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation, even though these situations
may be distressing to some males10.

Comorbidity Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with
erectile problems. In many cases, it may be difficult to determine which
difficulty preceded the other. Lifelong premature (early) ejaculation
may be associated with certain anxiety disorders. Acquired premature
(early) ejaculation may be associated with prostatitis, thyroid disease,
or drug withdrawal (e.g., during opioid withdrawal).

Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction Diagnostic Criteria

a. A clinically significant disturbance in sexual function is
predominant in the clinical picture. b. There is evidence from the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and
(2): 1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after
substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the
symptoms in Criterion A. c. The disturbance is not better explained by a
sexual dysfunction that is not substance/medication-induced. Such
evidence of an independent sexual dysfunction could include the
following: The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication
use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about
1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication;
or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent
non-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction (e.g., a history of
recurrent nonsubstance/medication-related episodes). d. The disturbance
does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. e. The
disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the individual.
Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance
intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion
A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to
warrant clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM
codes for the \[specific substance/medication\]-induced sexual
dysfunctions are indicated in the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM
code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use
disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance
use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual dysfunction,
the 4th position character is "1," and the clinician should record "mild
\[substance\] use disorder" before the substance-induced sexual
dysfunction (e.g., "mild cocaine use disorder

with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction"). If a moderate or severe
substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced sexual
dysfunction, the 4th position character is "2," and the clinician should
record "moderate \[substance\] use disorder" or "severe \[substance\]
use disorder," depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use
disorder. If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a
onetime heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is
"9," and the clinician should record only the substance-induced sexual
dysfunction. ICD-10-CM ICD-9- With use CM disorder, mild

Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter "Substance-Related and Addictive
Disorders" for diagnoses associated with substance class): With onset
during intoxication: If the criteria are met for intoxication with the
substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication. With onset
during withdrawal: If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance
and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.

With onset after medication use: Symptoms may appear either at
initiation of medication or after a modification or change in use.
Specify current severity: Mild: Occurs on 25%--50% of occasions of
sexual activity. Moderate: Occurs on 50%--75% of occasions of sexual

Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the
substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction begins with the specific
substance (e.g., alcohol, fluoxetine) that is presumed to be causing the
sexual dysfunction. The diagnostic code is selected from the table
included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For
substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., fluoxetine),
the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases in which a
substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class
of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance" should be
used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset
(i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset
after medication use), followed by the severity specifier (e.g., mild,
moderate, severe). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which
combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a
single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the
substance use disorder. For example, in the case of erectile dysfunction
occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe alcohol use
disorder, the diagnosis is 291.89 alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction,
with onset during intoxication, moderate. An additional diagnosis of
303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given. When more than one
substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the
sexual dysfunction, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.89
cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction with onset during intoxication,
moderate; 292.89 fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset after
medication use). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced
sexual dysfunction begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol,
fluoxetine) that is presumed to be causing the sexual dysfunction. The
diagnostic code

is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based
on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use
disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
fluoxetine), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases
in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid
substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word
"with," followed by the name of the substance-induced sexual
dysfunction, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during
intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use),
followed by the severity specifier (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). For
example, in the case of erectile dysfunction occurring during
intoxication in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis
is F10.281 moderate alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced sexual
dysfunction, with onset during intoxication, moderate. A separate
diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. If
the substance-induced sexual dysfunction occurs without a comorbid
substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the
substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g.,
F15.981 amphetamine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during
intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a
significant role in the development of the sexual dysfunction, each
should be listed separately (e.g., F14.181 mild cocaine use disorder
with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during intoxication,
moderate; F19.981 fluoxetineinduced sexual dysfunction, with onset after
medication use, moderate).

Diagnostic Features The major feature is a disturbance in sexual
function that has a temporal relationship with substance/medication
initiation, dose increase, or substance/medication discontinuation.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Sexual dysfunctions can occur
in association with intoxication with the following classes of
substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics;
stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown) substances.
Sexual dysfunctions can occur in association with withdrawal from the
following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives,

hypnotics, or anxiolytics; and other (or unknown) substances.
Medications that can induce sexual dysfunctions include antidepressants,
antipsychotics, and hormonal contraceptives. The most commonly reported
side effect of antidepressant drugs is difficulty with orgasm or
ejaculation. Problems with desire and erection are less frequent.
Approximately 30% of sexual complaints are clinically significant11.
Certain agents, such as bupropion and mirtazapine, appear not to be
associated with sexual side effects. The sexual problems associated with
antipsychotic drugs, including problems with sexual desire, erection,
lubrication, ejaculation, or orgasm, have occurred with typical as well
as atypical agents. However, problems are less common with
prolactin-sparing antipsychotics than with agents that cause significant
prolactin elevation8. Although the effects of mood stabilizers on sexual
function are unclear, it is possible that lithium and anticonvulsants,
with the possible exception of lamotrigine, have adverse effects on
sexual desire. Problems with orgasm may occur with gabapentin.
Similarly, there may be a higher prevalence of erectile and orgasmic
problems associated with benzodiazepines. There have not been such
reports with buspirone. Many nonpsychiatric medications, such as
cardiovascular, cytotoxic, gastrointestinal, and hormonal agents, are
associated with disturbances in sexual function. Illicit substance use
is associated with decreased sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, and
difficulty reaching orgasm. Sexual dysfunctions are also seen in
individuals receiving methadone but are seldom reported by patients
receiving buprenorphine. Chronic alcohol abuse and chronic nicotine
abuse are associated with erectile problems7.

Prevalence The prevalence and the incidence of
substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction are unclear, likely
because of underreporting of treatmentemergent sexual side effects. Data
on substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction typically concern the
effects of antidepressant drugs11. The prevalence of
antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction varies in part depending on
the specific agent. Approximately 25%--80% of individuals taking
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonergic
antidepressants, and combined serotonergic-adrenergic antidepressants

report sexual side effects11. There are differences in the incidence of
sexual side effects between some serotonergic and combined
adrenergicserotonergic antidepressants, although it is unclear if these
differences are clinically significant9. Approximately 50% of
individuals taking antipsychotic medications will experience adverse
sexual side effects, including problems with sexual desire, erection,
lubrication, ejaculation, or orgasm3. The incidence of these side
effects among different antipsychotic agents is unclear. Exact
prevalence and incidence of sexual dysfunctions among users of
nonpsychiatric medications such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic,
gastrointestinal, and hormonal agents are unknown. Elevated rates of
sexual dysfunction have been reported with methadone or high-dose opioid
drugs for pain. There are increased rates of decreased sexual desire,
erectile dysfunction, and difficulty reaching orgasm associated with
illicit substance use. The prevalence of sexual problems appears related
to chronic drug abuse and appears higher in individuals who abuse heroin
(approximately 60%--70%) than in individuals who abuse amphetamines or
3,4methylenedioxymethamphetamine (i.e., MDMA, ecstasy). Elevated rates
of sexual dysfunction are also seen in individuals receiving methadone
but are seldom reported by patients receiving buprenorphine. Chronic
alcohol abuse and chronic nicotine abuse are related to higher rates of
erectile problems7.

Development and Course The onset of antidepressant-induced sexual
dysfunction may be as early as 8 days after the agent is first taken2.
Approximately 30% of individuals with mild to moderate orgasm delay will
experience spontaneous remission of the dysfunction within 6 months5. In
some cases, serotonin reuptake inhibitor--induced sexual dysfunction may
persist after the agent is discontinued. The time to onset of sexual
dysfunction after initiation of antipsychotic drugs or drugs of abuse is
unknown. It is probable that the adverse effects of nicotine and alcohol
may not appear until after years of use. Premature (early) ejaculation
can sometimes occur after cessation of opioid use. There is some
evidence that disturbances in sexual function related to
substance/medication use increase with age10.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues There may be an interaction among
cultural factors, the influence of medications on sexual functioning,
and the response of the individual to those changes4.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Some gender differences in sexual side
effects may exist1, 6.

Differential Diagnosis Non-substance/medication-induced sexual
dysfunctions. Many mental conditions, such as depressive, bipolar,
anxiety, and psychotic disorders, are associated with disturbances of
sexual function. Thus, differentiating a substance/medication-induced
sexual dysfunction from a manifestation of the underlying mental
disorder can be quite difficult. The diagnosis is usually established if
a close relationship between substance/medication initiation or
discontinuation is observed. A clear diagnosis can be established if the
problem occurs after substance/medication initiation, dissipates with
substance/medication discontinuation, and recurs with introduction of
the same agent. Most substance/medication-induced side effects occur
shortly after initiation or discontinuation. Sexual side effects that
only occur after chronic use of a substance/medication may be extremely
difficult to diagnose with certainty.

Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction 302.79 (F52.8) This category applies
to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sexual
dysfunction that cause clinically significant distress in the

individual predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class. The other
specified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific sexual
dysfunction. This is done by recording "other specified sexual
dysfunction" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "sexual aversion").

Unspecified Sexual Dysfunction 302.70 (F52.9) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sexual dysfunction
that cause clinically significant distress in the individual predominate
but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sexual
dysfunctions diagnostic class. The unspecified sexual dysfunction
category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific sexual
dysfunction, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Gender Dysphoria In this chapter, there is one overarching diagnosis of
gender dysphoria, with separate developmentally appropriate criteria
sets for children and for adolescents and adults. The area of sex and
gender is highly controversial and has led to a proliferation of terms
whose meanings vary over time and within and between disciplines. An
additional source of confusion is that in English "sex" connotes both
male/female and sexuality. This chapter employs constructs and terms as
they are widely used by clinicians from various disciplines with
specialization in this area. In this chapter, sex and sexual refer to
the biological indicators of male and female (understood in the context
of reproductive capacity), such as in sex chromosomes, gonads, sex
hormones, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia. Disorders of
sex development denote conditions of inborn somatic deviations of the
reproductive tract from the norm and/or discrepancies among the
biological indicators of male and female. Crosssex hormone treatment
denotes the use of feminizing hormones in an individual assigned male at
birth based on traditional biological indicators or the use of
masculinizing hormones in an individual assigned female at birth. The
need to introduce the term gender arose with the realization that for
individuals with conflicting or ambiguous biological indicators of sex
(i.e., "intersex"), the lived role in society and/or the identification
as male or female could not be uniformly associated with or predicted
from the biological indicators and, later, that some individuals develop
an identity as female or male at variance with their uniform set of
classical biological indicators. Thus, gender is used to denote the
public (and usually legally recognized) lived role as boy or girl, man
or woman, but, in contrast to certain social constructionist theories,
biological factors are seen as contributing, in interaction with social
and psychological factors, to gender development. Gender assignment
refers to the initial assignment as male or female. This occurs usually
at birth and, thereby, yields the "natal gender." Gender-atypical refers
to somatic features or behaviors that are not typical

(in a statistical sense) of individuals with the same assigned gender in
a given society and historical era; for behavior, gender-nonconforming
is an alternative descriptive term. Gender reassignment denotes an
official (and usually legal) change of gender. Gender identity is a
category of social identity and refers to an individual's identification
as male, female, or, occasionally, some category other than male or
female. Gender dysphoria as a general descriptive term refers to an
individual's affective/cognitive discontent with the assigned gender but
is more specifically defined when used as a diagnostic category.
Transgender refers to the broad spectrum of individuals who transiently
or persistently identify with a gender different from their natal
gender. Transsexual denotes an individual who seeks, or has undergone, a
social transition from male to female or female to male, which in many,
but not all, cases also involves a somatic transition by crosssex
hormone treatment and genital surgery (sex reassignment surgery). Gender
dysphoria refers to the distress that may accompany the incongruence
between one's experienced or expressed gender and one's assigned gender.
Although not all individuals will experience distress as a result of
such incongruence, many are distressed if the desired physical
interventions by means of hormones and/or surgery are not available. The
current term is more descriptive than the previous DSM-IV term gender
identity disorder and focuses on dysphoria as the clinical problem, not
identity per se.

vaginoplasty in a natal male; mastectomy or phalloplasty in a natal
female).

Specifiers

The posttransition specifier may be used in the context of continuing
treatment procedures that serve to support the new gender assignment.

Diagnostic Features Individuals with gender dysphoria have a marked
incongruence between the gender they have been assigned to (usually at
birth, referred to as natal gender) and their experienced/expressed
gender. This discrepancy is the core component of the diagnosis. There
must also be evidence of distress about this incongruence. Experienced
gender may include alternative gender identities beyond binary
stereotypes. Consequently, the distress is not limited to a desire to
simply be of the other gender, but may include a desire to be of an
alternative gender, provided that it differs from the individual's
assigned gender. Gender dysphoria manifests itself differently in
different age groups. Prepubertal natal girls with gender dysphoria may
express the wish to be a boy, assert they are a boy, or assert they will
grow up to be a man. They prefer boys' clothing and hairstyles, are
often perceived by strangers as boys, and may ask to be called by a
boy's name. Usually, they display intense negative reactions to parental
attempts to have them wear dresses or other feminine attire. Some may
refuse to attend school or social events where such clothes are
required. These girls may demonstrate marked cross-gender identification
in role-playing, dreams, and fantasies. Contact sports, rough-and-tumble
play, traditional boyhood games, and boys as playmates are most often
preferred. They show little interest in stereotypically feminine toys
(e.g., dolls) or activities (e.g., feminine dressup or role-play).
Occasionally, they refuse to urinate in a sitting position. Some natal
girls may express a desire to have a penis or claim to have a penis or
that they will grow one when older. They may also state that they do not
want to develop breasts or menstruate. Prepubertal natal boys with
gender dysphoria may express the wish to be a girl or assert they are a
girl or that they will grow up to be a woman. They have a preference for
dressing in girls' or women's clothes or may improvise clothing from
available materials (e.g., using towels, aprons, and scarves for long
hair or skirts). These children may role-play female figures (e.g.,
playing "mother") and often are intensely interested in female fantasy
figures. Traditional feminine activities, stereotypical games, and
pastimes (e.g., "playing house"; drawing feminine pictures; watching
television or

videos of favorite female characters) are most often preferred.
Stereotypical female-type dolls (e.g., Barbie) are often favorite toys,
and girls are their preferred playmates. They avoid rough-and-tumble
play and competitive sports and have little interest in stereotypically
masculine toys (e.g., cars, trucks). Some may pretend not to have a
penis and insist on sitting to urinate. More rarely, they may state that
they find their penis or testes disgusting, that they wish them removed,
or that they have, or wish to have, a vagina. In young adolescents with
gender dysphoria, clinical features may resemble those of children or
adults with the condition, depending on developmental level. As
secondary sex characteristics of young adolescents are not yet fully
developed, these individuals may not state dislike of them, but they are
concerned about imminent physical changes. In adults with gender
dysphoria, the discrepancy between experienced gender and physical sex
characteristics is often, but not always, accompanied by a desire to be
rid of primary and/or secondary sex characteristics and/or a strong
desire to acquire some primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of
the other gender. To varying degrees, adults with gender dysphoria may
adopt the behavior, clothing, and mannerisms of the experienced gender.
They feel uncomfortable being regarded by others, or functioning in
society, as members of their assigned gender. Some adults may have a
strong desire to be of a different gender and treated as such, and they
may have an inner certainty to feel and respond as the experienced
gender without seeking medical treatment to alter body characteristics.
They may find other ways to resolve the incongruence between
experienced/expressed and assigned gender by partially living in the
desired role or by adopting a gender role neither conventionally male
nor conventionally female.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis When visible signs of puberty
develop, natal boys may shave their legs at the first signs of hair
growth. They sometimes bind their genitals to make erections less
visible. Girls may bind their breasts, walk with a stoop, or use loose
sweaters to make breasts less visible. Increasingly, adolescents
request, or may obtain without medical prescription and supervision,
hormonal suppressors ("blockers") of gonadal steroids (e.g.,
gonadotropinreleasing hormone \[GnRH\] analog, spironolactone).
Clinically referred

adolescents often want hormone treatment and many also wish for gender
reassignment surgery. Adolescents living in an accepting environment may
openly express the desire to be and be treated as the experienced gender
and dress partly or completely as the experienced gender, have a
hairstyle typical of the experienced gender, preferentially seek
friendships with peers of the other gender, and/or adopt a new first
name consistent with the experienced gender. Older adolescents, when
sexually active, usually do not show or allow partners to touch their
sexual organs. For adults with an aversion toward their genitals, sexual
activity is constrained by the preference that their genitals not be
seen or touched by their partners. Some adults may seek hormone
treatment (sometimes without medical prescription and supervision) and
gender reassignment surgery. Others are satisfied with either hormone
treatment or surgery alone. Adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria
before gender reassignment are at increased risk for suicidal ideation,
suicide attempts, and suicides. After gender reassignment, adjustment
may vary, and suicide risk may persist.

Prevalence For natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0.005% to
0.014%, and for natal females, from 0.002% to 0.003%. Since not all
adults seeking hormone treatment and surgical reassignment attend
specialty clinics, these rates are likely modest underestimates. Sex
differences in rate of referrals to specialty clinics vary by age group.
In children, sex ratios of natal boys to girls range from 2:1 to 4.5:1.
In adolescents, the sex ratio is close to parity; in adults, the sex
ratio favors natal males, with ratios ranging from 1:1 to 6.1:1. In two
countries, the sex ratio appears to favor natal females (Japan: 2.2:1;
Poland: 3.4:1).

Development and Course Because expression of gender dysphoria varies
with age, there are separate criteria sets for children versus
adolescents and adults. Criteria for children are defined in a more
concrete, behavioral manner than those for adolescents and adults. Many
of the core criteria draw on well-documented behavioral gender
differences between typically developing boys and girls. Young children
are less likely than older children, adolescents, and adults to express
extreme and persistent anatomic dysphoria. In adolescents and

adults, incongruence between experienced gender and somatic sex is a
central feature of the diagnosis. Factors related to distress and
impairment also vary with age. A very young child may show signs of
distress (e.g., intense crying) only when parents tell the child that he
or she is "really" not a member of the other gender but only "desires"
to be. Distress may not be manifest in social environments supportive of
the child's desire to live in the role of the other gender and may
emerge only if the desire is interfered with. In adolescents and adults,
distress may manifest because of strong incongruence between experienced
gender and somatic sex. Such distress may, however, be mitigated by
supportive environments and knowledge that biomedical treatments exist
to reduce incongruence. Impairment (e.g., school refusal, development of
depression, anxiety, and substance abuse) may be a consequence of gender
dysphoria. Gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development. For
clinicreferred children, onset of cross-gender behaviors is usually
between ages 2 and 4 years. This corresponds to the developmental time
period in which most typically developing children begin expressing
gendered behaviors and interests. For some preschool-age children, both
pervasive cross-gender behaviors and the expressed desire to be the
other gender may be present, or, more rarely, labeling oneself as a
member of the other gender may occur. In some cases, the expressed
desire to be the other gender appears later, usually at entry into
elementary school. A small minority of children express discomfort with
their sexual anatomy or will state the desire to have a sexual anatomy
corresponding to the experienced gender ("anatomic dysphoria").
Expressions of anatomic dysphoria become more common as children with
gender dysphoria approach and anticipate puberty. Rates of persistence
of gender dysphoria from childhood into adolescence or adulthood vary.
In natal males, persistence has ranged from 2.2% to 30%. In natal
females, persistence has ranged from 12% to 50%. Persistence of gender
dysphoria is modestly correlated with dimensional measures of severity
ascertained at the time of a childhood baseline assessment. In one
sample of natal males, lower socioeconomic background was also modestly
correlated with persistence. It is unclear if particular therapeutic
approaches to gender dysphoria in children are related to rates of
long-term persistence. Extant follow-up samples consisted of children
receiving no formal therapeutic intervention or receiving therapeutic
interventions of various types, ranging from active efforts to reduce
gender

dysphoria to a more neutral, "watchful waiting" approach. It is unclear
if children "encouraged" or supported to live socially in the desired
gender will show higher rates of persistence, since such children have
not yet been followed longitudinally in a systematic manner. For both
natal male and female children showing persistence, almost all are
sexually attracted to individuals of their natal sex. For natal male
children whose gender dysphoria does not persist, the majority are
androphilic (sexually attracted to males) and often self-identify as gay
or homosexual (ranging from 63% to 100%). In natal female children whose
gender dysphoria does not persist, the percentage who are gynephilic
(sexually attracted to females) and selfidentify as lesbian is lower
(ranging from 32% to 50%). In both adolescent and adult natal males,
there are two broad trajectories for development of gender dysphoria:
early onset and late onset. Earlyonset gender dysphoria starts in
childhood and continues into adolescence and adulthood; or, there is an
intermittent period in which the gender dysphoria desists and these
individuals self-identify as gay or homosexual, followed by recurrence
of gender dysphoria. Late-onset gender dysphoria occurs around puberty
or much later in life. Some of these individuals report having had a
desire to be of the other gender in childhood that was not expressed
verbally to others. Others do not recall any signs of childhood gender
dysphoria. For adolescent males with late-onset gender dysphoria,
parents often report surprise because they did not see signs of gender
dysphoria during childhood. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are more
common and salient in adolescents and adults once secondary sex
characteristics have developed. Adolescent and adult natal males with
early-onset gender dysphoria are almost always sexually attracted to men
(androphilic). Adolescents and adults with late-onset gender dysphoria
frequently engage in transvestic behavior with sexual excitement. The
majority of these individuals are gynephilic or sexually attracted to
other posttransition natal males with lateonset gender dysphoria. A
substantial percentage of adult males with lateonset gender dysphoria
cohabit with or are married to natal females. After gender transition,
many self-identify as lesbian. Among adult natal males with gender
dysphoria, the early-onset group seeks out clinical care for hormone
treatment and reassignment surgery at an earlier age than does the
late-onset group. The late-onset group may have more fluctuations in the

degree of gender dysphoria and be more ambivalent about and less likely
satisfied after gender reassignment surgery. In both adolescent and
adult natal females, the most common course is the early-onset form of
gender dysphoria. The late-onset form is much less common in natal
females compared with natal males. As in natal males with gender
dysphoria, there may have been a period in which the gender dysphoria
desisted and these individuals self-identified as lesbian; however, with
recurrence of gender dysphoria, clinical consultation is sought, often
with the desire for hormone treatment and reassignment surgery. Parents
of natal adolescent females with the late-onset form also report
surprise, as no signs of childhood gender dysphoria were evident.
Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are much more common and salient in
adolescents and adults than in children. Adolescent and adult natal
females with early-onset gender dysphoria are almost always gynephilic.
Adolescents and adults with the late-onset form of gender dysphoria are
usually androphilic and after gender transition selfidentify as gay men.
Natal females with the late-onset form do not have cooccurring
transvestic behavior with sexual excitement. Gender dysphoria in
association with a disorder of sex development. Most individuals with a
disorder of sex development who develop gender dysphoria have already
come to medical attention at an early age. For many, starting at birth,
issues of gender assignment were raised by physicians and parents.
Moreover, as infertility is quite common for this group, physicians are
more willing to perform cross-sex hormone treatments and genital surgery
before adulthood. Disorders of sex development in general are frequently
associated with gender-atypical behavior starting in early childhood.
However, in the majority of cases, this does not lead to gender
dysphoria. As individuals with a disorder of sex development become
aware of their medical history and condition, many experience
uncertainty about their gender, as opposed to developing a firm
conviction that they are another gender. However, most do not progress
to gender transition. Gender dysphoria and gender transition may vary
considerably as a function of a disorder of sex development, its
severity, and assigned gender.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental. For individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder
of sex development, atypical gender behavior among individuals with
early-onset gender dysphoria develops in early preschool age, and it is
possible that a high degree of atypicality makes the development of
gender dysphoria and its persistence into adolescence and adulthood more
likely. Environmental. Among individuals with gender dysphoria without a
disorder of sex development, males with gender dysphoria (in both
childhood and adolescence) more commonly have older brothers than do
males without the condition. Additional predisposing factors under
consideration, especially in individuals with late-onset gender
dysphoria (adolescence, adulthood), include habitual fetishistic
transvestism developing into autogynephilia (i.e., sexual arousal
associated with the thought or image of oneself as a woman) and other
forms of more general social, psychological, or developmental problems.
Genetic and physiological. For individuals with gender dysphoria without
a disorder of sex development, some genetic contribution is suggested by
evidence for (weak) familiality of transsexualism among nontwin
siblings, increased concordance for transsexualism in monozygotic
compared with dizygotic same-sex twins, and some degree of heritability
of gender dysphoria. As to endocrine findings, no endogenous systemic
abnormalities in sex-hormone levels have been found in 46,XY
individuals, whereas there appear to be increased androgen levels (in
the range found in hirsute women but far below normal male levels) in
46,XX individuals. Overall, current evidence is insufficient to label
gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development as a form of
intersexuality limited to the central nervous system. In gender
dysphoria associated with a disorder of sex development, the likelihood
of later gender dysphoria is increased if prenatal production and
utilization (via receptor sensitivity) of androgens are grossly atypical
relative to what is usually seen in individuals with the same assigned
gender. Examples include 46,XY individuals with a history of normal male
prenatal hormone milieu but inborn nonhormonal genital defects (as in
cloacal bladder exstrophy or penile agenesis) and who have been assigned
to the female gender. The likelihood of gender dysphoria is further
enhanced by additional, prolonged, highly gender-atypical postnatal
androgen exposure with somatic virilization as may occur in
female-raised

and noncastrated 46,XY individuals with 5-alpha reductase-2 deficiency
or 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3 deficiency or in female-raised
46,XX individuals with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia with
prolonged periods of non-adherence to glucocorticoid replacement
therapy. However, the prenatal androgen milieu is more closely related
to gendered behavior than to gender identity. Many individuals with
disorders of sex development and markedly gender-atypical behavior do
not develop gender dysphoria. Thus, gender-atypical behavior by itself
should not be interpreted as an indicator of current or future gender
dysphoria. There appears to be a higher rate of gender dysphoria and
patient-initiated gender change from assigned female to male than from
assigned male to female in 46,XY individuals with a disorder of sex
development.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Individuals with gender dysphoria have
been reported across many countries and cultures. The equivalent of
gender dysphoria has also been reported in individuals living in
cultures with institutionalized gender categories other than male or
female. It is unclear whether with these individuals the diagnostic
criteria for gender dysphoria would be met.

Diagnostic Markers Individuals with a somatic disorder of sex
development show some correlation of final gender identity outcome with
the degree of prenatal androgen production and utilization. However, the
correlation is not robust enough for the biological factor, where
ascertainable, to replace a detailed and comprehensive diagnostic
interview evaluation for gender dysphoria.

Functional Consequences of Gender Dysphoria Preoccupation with
cross-gender wishes may develop at all ages after the first 2--3 years
of childhood and often interfere with daily activities. In older
children, failure to develop age-typical same-sex peer relationships and
skills may lead to isolation from peer groups and to distress. Some
children may refuse to attend school because of teasing and harassment
or pressure to dress in attire associated with their assigned sex. Also
in adolescents and adults, preoccupation with cross-gender wishes often
interferes with daily activities. Relationship difficulties, including
sexual relationship problems,

are common, and functioning at school or at work may be impaired. Gender
dysphoria, along with atypical gender expression, is associated with
high levels of stigmatization, discrimination, and victimization,
leading to negative self-concept, increased rates of mental disorder
comorbidity, school dropout, and economic marginalization, including
unemployment, with attendant social and mental health risks, especially
in individuals from resource-poor family backgrounds. In addition, these
individuals' access to health services and mental health services may be
impeded by structural barriers, such as institutional discomfort or
inexperience in working with this patient population.

Differential Diagnosis Nonconformity to gender roles. Gender dysphoria
should be distinguished from simple nonconformity to stereotypical
gender role behavior by the strong desire to be of another gender than
the assigned one and by the extent and pervasiveness of gender-variant
activities and interests. The diagnosis is not meant to merely describe
nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior (e.g., "tomboyism"
in girls, "girly-boy" behavior in boys, occasional cross-dressing in
adult men). Given the increased openness of atypical gender expressions
by individuals across the entire range of the transgender spectrum, it
is important that the clinical diagnosis be limited to those individuals
whose distress and impairment meet the specified criteria. Transvestic
disorder. Transvestic disorder occurs in heterosexual (or bisexual)
adolescent and adult males (rarely in females) for whom crossdressing
behavior generates sexual excitement and causes distress and/or
impairment without drawing their primary gender into question. It is
occasionally accompanied by gender dysphoria. An individual with
transvestic disorder who also has clinically significant gender
dysphoria can be given both diagnoses. In many cases of late-onset
gender dysphoria in gynephilic natal males, transvestic behavior with
sexual excitement is a precursor. Body dysmorphic disorder. An
individual with body dysmorphic disorder focuses on the alteration or
removal of a specific body part because it is perceived as abnormally
formed, not because it represents a repudiated assigned gender. When an
individual's presentation meets criteria for both

gender dysphoria and body dysmorphic disorder, both diagnoses can be
given. Individuals wishing to have a healthy limb amputated (termed by
some body integrity identity disorder) because it makes them feel more
"complete" usually do not wish to change gender, but rather desire to
live as an amputee or a disabled person. Schizophrenia and other
psychotic disorders. In schizophrenia, there may rarely be delusions of
belonging to some other gender. In the absence of psychotic symptoms,
insistence by an individual with gender dysphoria that he or she is of
some other gender is not considered a delusion. Schizophrenia (or other
psychotic disorders) and gender dysphoria may cooccur. Other clinical
presentations. Some individuals with an emasculinization desire who
develop an alternative, nonmale/nonfemale gender identity do have a
presentation that meets criteria for gender dysphoria. However, some
males seek castration and/or penectomy for aesthetic reasons or to
remove psychological effects of androgens without changing male
identity; in these cases, the criteria for gender dysphoria are not met.

Comorbidity Clinically referred children with gender dysphoria show
elevated levels of emotional and behavioral problems---most commonly,
anxiety, disruptive and impulse-control, and depressive disorders. In
prepubertal children, increasing age is associated with having more
behavioral or emotional problems; this is related to the increasing
non-acceptance of gender-variant behavior by others. In older children,
gender-variant behavior often leads to peer ostracism, which may lead to
more behavioral problems. The prevalence of mental health problems
differs among cultures; these differences may also be related to
differences in attitudes toward gender variance in children. However,
also in some non-Western cultures, anxiety has been found to be
relatively common in individuals with gender dysphoria, even in cultures
with accepting attitudes toward gender-variant behavior. Autism spectrum
disorder is more prevalent in clinically referred children with gender
dysphoria than in the general population. Clinically referred
adolescents with gender dysphoria appear to have comorbid mental
disorders, with anxiety and depressive disorders being the most common.
As in children, autism spectrum disorder is more prevalent in clinically

referred adolescents with gender dysphoria than in the general
population. Clinically referred adults with gender dysphoria may have
coexisting mental health problems, most commonly anxiety and depressive
disorders.

Other Specified Gender Dysphoria 302.6 (F64.8) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria. The other specified
gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does
not meet the criteria for gender dysphoria. This is done by recording
"other specified gender dysphoria" followed by the specific reason
(e.g., "brief gender dysphoria"). An example of a presentation that can
be specified using the "other specified" designation is the following:
The current disturbance meets symptom criteria for gender dysphoria, but
the duration is less than 6 months.

Unspecified Gender Dysphoria 302.6 (F64.9) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria. The unspecified gender
dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for gender
dysphoria, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders Disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders include conditions involving
problems in the self-control of emotions and behaviors. While other
disorders in DSM-5 may also involve problems in emotional and/or
behavioral regulation, the disorders in this chapter are unique in that
these problems are manifested in behaviors that violate the rights of
others (e.g., aggression, destruction of property) and/or that bring the
individual into significant conflict with societal norms or authority
figures. The underlying causes of the problems in the self-control of
emotions and behaviors can vary greatly across the disorders in this
chapter and among individuals within a given diagnostic category. The
chapter includes oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive
disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder (which is
described in the chapter "Personality Disorders"), pyromania,
kleptomania, and other specified and unspecified disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders. Although all the disorders in
the chapter involve problems in both emotional and behavioral
regulation, the source of variation among the disorders is the relative
emphasis on problems in the two types of self-control. For example, the
criteria for conduct disorder focus largely on poorly controlled
behaviors that violate the rights of others or that violate major
societal norms. Many of the behavioral symptoms (e.g., aggression) can
be a result of poorly controlled emotions such as anger. At the other
extreme, the criteria for intermittent explosive disorder focus largely
on such poorly controlled emotion, outbursts of anger that are
disproportionate to the interpersonal or other provocation or to other
psychosocial stressors. Intermediate in impact to these two disorders is
oppositional defiant disorder, in which the criteria are more evenly
distributed between emotions (anger and irritation) and behaviors
(argumentativeness and defiance). Pyromania and kleptomania are less
commonly used diagnoses characterized by poor impulse control related to

specific behaviors (fire setting or stealing) that relieve internal
tension. Other specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct
disorder is a category for conditions in which there are symptoms of
conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or other disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders, but the number of symptoms does
not meet the diagnostic threshold for any of the disorders in this
chapter, even though there is evidence of clinically significant
impairment associated with the symptoms. The disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders all tend to be more common in
males than in females, although the relative degree of male predominance
may differ both across disorders and within a disorder at different
ages. The disorders in this chapter tend to have first onset in
childhood or adolescence. In fact, it is very rare for either conduct
disorder or oppositional defiant disorder to first emerge in adulthood.
There is a developmental relationship between oppositional defiant
disorder and conduct disorder, in that most cases of conduct disorder
previously would have met criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, at
least in those cases in which conduct disorder emerges prior to
adolescence. However, most children with oppositional defiant disorder
do not eventually develop conduct disorder. Furthermore, children with
oppositional defiant disorder are at risk for eventually developing
other problems besides conduct disorder, including anxiety and
depressive disorders. Many of the symptoms that define the disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders are behaviors that can occur to
some degree in typically developing individuals. Thus, it is critical
that the frequency, persistence, pervasiveness across situations, and
impairment associated with the behaviors indicative of the diagnosis be
considered relative to what is normative for a person's age, gender, and
culture when determining if they are symptomatic of a disorder. The
disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders have been linked to a
common externalizing spectrum associated with the personality dimensions
labeled as disinhibition and (inversely) constraint and, to a lesser
extent, negative emotionality. These shared personality dimensions could
account for the high level of comorbidity among these disorders and
their frequent comorbidity with substance use disorders and antisocial
personality disorder. However, the specific nature of the shared
diathesis that constitutes the externalizing spectrum remains unknown.

Oppositional Defiant Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

313.81 (F91.3)

a.  A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior,
    or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months as evidenced by at least
    four symptoms from any of the following categories, and exhibited
    during interaction with at least one individual who is not a
    sibling. Angry/Irritable Mood

<!-- -->

1.  Often loses temper.
2.  Is often touchy or easily annoyed.
3.  Is often angry and resentful. Argumentative/Defiant Behavior
4.  Often argues with authority figures or, for children and
    adolescents, with adults.
5.  Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from
    authority figures or with rules.
6.  Often deliberately annoys others.
7.  Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.
    Vindictiveness
8.  Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6
    months. Note: The persistence and frequency of these behaviors
    should be used to distinguish a behavior that is within normal
    limits from a behavior that is symptomatic. For children younger
    than 5 years, the behavior should occur on most days for a period of
    at least 6 months unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For
    individuals 5 years or older, the behavior should occur at least
    once per week for at least 6 months, unless otherwise noted
    (Criterion A8). While these frequency criteria provide guidance on a
    minimal level of frequency to define symptoms, other factors should
    also be considered, such as whether the frequency and intensity of
    the behaviors are outside a range that

is normative for the individual's developmental level, gender, and
culture. b. The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in
the individual or others in his or her immediate social context (e.g.,
family, peer group, work colleagues), or it impacts negatively on
social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning. c. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course
of a psychotic, substance use, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also,
the criteria are not met for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.
Specify current severity: Mild: Symptoms are confined to only one
setting (e.g., at home, at school, at work, with peers). Moderate: Some
symptoms are present in at least two settings. Severe: Some symptoms are
present in three or more settings.

Specifiers It is not uncommon for individuals with oppositional defiant
disorder to show symptoms only at home and only with family members.
However, the pervasiveness of the symptoms is an indicator of the
severity of the disorder5.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of oppositional defiant
disorder is a frequent and persistent pattern of angry/irritable mood,
argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness (Criterion A). It is
not unusual for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show
the behavioral features of the disorder without problems of negative
mood. However, individuals with the disorder who show the
angry/irritable mood symptoms typically show the behavioral features as
well. The symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder may be confined to
only one setting, and this is most frequently the home. Individuals who
show enough symptoms to meet the diagnostic threshold, even if it is
only at home, may be significantly impaired in their social
functioning5. However,

in more severe cases, the symptoms of the disorder are present in
multiple settings. Given that the pervasiveness of symptoms is an
indicator of the severity of the disorder, it is critical that the
individual's behavior be assessed across multiple settings and
relationships. Because these behaviors are common among siblings, they
must be observed during interactions with persons other than siblings.
Also, because symptoms of the disorder are typically more evident in
interactions with adults or peers whom the individual knows well, they
may not be apparent during a clinical examination. The symptoms of
oppositional defiant disorder can occur to some degree in individuals
without this disorder. There are several key considerations for
determining if the behaviors are symptomatic of oppositional defiant
disorder. First, the diagnostic threshold of four or more symptoms
within the preceding 6 months must be met. Second, the persistence and
frequency of the symptoms should exceed what is normative for an
individual's age, gender, and culture. For example, it is not unusual
for preschool children to show temper tantrums on a weekly basis4.
Temper outbursts for a preschool child would be considered a symptom of
oppositional defiant disorder only if they occurred on most days for the
preceding 6 months, if they occurred with at least three other symptoms
of the disorder, and if the temper outbursts contributed to the
significant impairment associated with the disorder (e.g., led to
destruction of property during outbursts, resulted in the child being
asked to leave a preschool). The symptoms of the disorder often are part
of a pattern of problematic interactions with others. Furthermore,
individuals with this disorder typically do not regard themselves as
angry, oppositional, or defiant. Instead, they often justify their
behavior as a response to unreasonable demands or circumstances. Thus,
it can be difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of the
individual with the disorder to the problematic interactions he or she
experiences. For example, children with oppositional defiant disorder
may have experienced a history of hostile parenting, and it is often
impossible to determine if the child's behavior caused the parents to
act in a more hostile manner toward the child, if the parents' hostility
led to the child's problematic behavior, or if there was some
combination of both. Whether or not the clinician can separate the
relative contributions of potential causal factors should not influence
whether or not the diagnosis is made. In the event that the child may be
living in particularly poor

conditions where neglect or mistreatment may occur (e.g., in
institutional settings), clinical attention to reducing the contribution
of the environment may be helpful.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis In children and adolescents,
oppositional defiant disorder is more prevalent in families in which
child care is disrupted by a succession of different caregivers or in
families in which harsh, inconsistent, or neglectful childrearing
practices are common. Two of the most common co-occurring conditions
with oppositional defiant disorder are attentiondeficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (see the section "Comorbidity" for
this disorder). Oppositional defiant disorder has been associated with
increased risk for suicide attempts, even after comorbid disorders are
controlled for8.

Prevalence The prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder ranges from
1% to 11%, with an average prevalence estimate of around 3.3%3. The rate
of oppositional defiant disorder may vary depending on the age and
gender of the child. The disorder appears to be somewhat more prevalent
in males than in females (1.4:1) prior to adolescence. This male
predominance is not consistently found in samples of adolescents1 or
adults7.

Development and Course The first symptoms of oppositional defiant
disorder usually appear during the preschool years and rarely later than
early adolescence9. Oppositional defiant disorder often precedes the
development of conduct disorder, especially for those with the
childhood-onset type of conduct disorder2. However, many children and
adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder do not subsequently
develop conduct disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder also conveys
risk for the development of anxiety disorders and major depressive
disorder, even in the absence of conduct disorder. The defiant,
argumentative, and vindictive symptoms carry most of the risk for
conduct disorder, whereas the angry-irritable mood symptoms carry most
of the risk for emotional disorders10.

Manifestations of the disorder across development appear consistent.
Children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder are at
increased risk for a number of problems in adjustment as adults,
including antisocial behavior, impulse-control problems, substance
abuse, anxiety, and depression6, 7, 9. Many of the behaviors associated
with oppositional defiant disorder increase in frequency during the
preschool period and in adolescence. Thus, it is especially critical
during these development periods that the frequency and intensity of
these behaviors be evaluated against normative levels before it is
decided that they are symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Features Temperamental. Temperamental factors
related to problems in emotional regulation (e.g., high levels of
emotional reactivity, poor frustration tolerance) have been predictive
of the disorder. Environmental. Harsh, inconsistent, or neglectful
child-rearing practices are common in families of children and
adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder, and these parenting
practices play an important role in many causal theories of the
disorder. Genetic and physiological. A number of neurobiological markers
(e.g., lower heart rate and skin conductance reactivity; reduced basal
cortisol reactivity; abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex and
amygdala) have been associated with oppositional defiant disorder.
However, the vast majority of studies have not separated children with
oppositional defiant disorder from those with conduct disorder11. Thus,
it is unclear whether there are markers specific to oppositional defiant
disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The prevalence of the disorder in
children and adolescents is relatively consistent across countries that
differ in race and ethnicity3.

Functional Consequences of Oppositional Defiant Disorder When
oppositional defiant disorder is persistent throughout development,
individuals with the disorder experience frequent conflicts with
parents,

teachers, supervisors, peers, and romantic partners. Such problems often
result in significant impairments in the individual's emotional, social,
academic, and occupational adjustment.

Differential Diagnosis Conduct disorder. Conduct disorder and
oppositional defiant disorder are both related to conduct problems that
bring the individual in conflict with adults and other authority figures
(e.g., teachers, work supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional
defiant disorder are typically of a less severe nature than those of
conduct disorder and do not include aggression toward people or animals,
destruction of property, or a pattern of theft or deceit. Furthermore,
oppositional defiant disorder includes problems of emotional
dysregulation (i.e., angry and irritable mood) that are not included in
the definition of conduct disorder. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder. ADHD is often comorbid with oppositional defiant disorder. To
make the additional diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder, it is
important to determine that the individual's failure to conform to
requests of others is not solely in situations that demand sustained
effort and attention or demand that the individual sit still. Depressive
and bipolar disorders. Depressive and bipolar disorders often involve
negative affect and irritability. As a result, a diagnosis of
oppositional defiant disorder should not be made if the symptoms occur
exclusively during the course of a mood disorder. Disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder shares with
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder the symptoms of chronic negative
mood and temper outbursts. However, the severity, frequency, and
chronicity of temper outbursts are more severe in individuals with
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder than in those with oppositional
defiant disorder. Thus, only a minority of children and adolescents
whose symptoms meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder would
also be diagnosed with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. When the
mood disturbance is severe enough to meet criteria for disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is
not given, even if all criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are
met.

Intermittent explosive disorder. Intermittent explosive disorder also
involves high rates of anger. However, individuals with this disorder
show serious aggression toward others that is not part of the definition
of oppositional defiant disorder. Intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder). In individuals with intellectual disability, a
diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is given only if the
oppositional behavior is markedly greater than is commonly observed
among individuals of comparable mental age and with comparable severity
of intellectual disability. Language disorder. Oppositional defiant
disorder must also be distinguished from a failure to follow directions
that is the result of impaired language comprehension (e.g., hearing
loss). Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Oppositional defiant
disorder must also be distinguished from defiance due to fear of
negative evaluation associated with social anxiety disorder.

Comorbidity Rates of oppositional defiant disorder are much higher in
samples of children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD, and this may be
the result of shared temperamental risk factors. Also, oppositional
defiant disorder often precedes conduct disorder, although this appears
to be most common in children with the childhood-onset subtype2.
Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder are also at increased
risk for anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, and this seems
largely attributable to the presence of the angry-irritable mood
symptoms9. Adolescents and adults with oppositional defiant disorder
also show a higher rate of substance use disorders, although it is
unclear if this association is independent of the comorbidity with
conduct disorder9.

Intermittent Explosive Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

312.34 (F63.81)

a. Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control
aggressive impulses as manifested by either of the following: 1. Verbal
aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights)
or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals,
occurring twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months. The
physical aggression does not result in damage or destruction of property
and does not result in physical injury to animals or other individuals.
2. Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of
property and/or physical assault involving physical injury against
animals or other individuals occurring within a 12month period. b. The
magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent outbursts is
grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating
psychosocial stressors. c. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not
premeditated (i.e., they are impulsive and/or anger-based) and are not
committed to achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power,
intimidation). d. The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked
distress in the individual or impairment in occupational or
interpersonal functioning, or are associated with financial or legal
consequences. e. Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent
developmental level). f. The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not
better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive
disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a
psychotic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline
personality disorder) and are not attributable to another medical
condition (e.g., head trauma, Alzheimer's disease) or to the
physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a
medication). For children ages 6--18 years, aggressive behavior that
occurs as part of an adjustment disorder should not be considered for
this diagnosis. Note: This diagnosis can be made in addition to the
diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder,
oppositional

defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder when recurrent impulsive
aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually seen in these
disorders and warrant independent clinical attention.

Diagnostic Features The impulsive (or anger-based) aggressive outbursts
in intermittent explosive disorder have a rapid onset and, typically,
little or no prodromal period. Outbursts typically last for less than 30
minutes and commonly occur in response to a minor provocation by a close
intimate or associate. Individuals with intermittent explosive disorder
often have less severe episodes of verbal and/or nondamaging,
nondestructive, or noninjurious physical assault (Criterion A1) in
between more severe destructive/assaultive episodes (Criterion A2).
Criterion A1 defines frequent (i.e., twice weekly, on average, for a
period of 3 months) aggressive outbursts characterized by temper
tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights, or assault without damage
to objects or without injury to animals or other individuals. Criterion
A2 defines infrequent (i.e., three in a 1-year period) impulsive
aggressive outbursts characterized by damaging or destroying an object,
regardless of its tangible value, or by assaulting/striking or otherwise
causing physical injury to an animal or to another individual.
Regardless of the nature of the impulsive aggressive outburst, the core
feature of intermittent explosive disorder is failure to control
impulsive aggressive behavior in response to subjectively experienced
provocation (i.e., psychosocial stressor) that would not typically
result in an aggressive outburst (Criterion B). The aggressive outbursts
are generally impulsive and/or anger-based, rather than premeditated or
instrumental (Criterion C) and are associated with significant distress
or impairment in psychosocial function (Criterion D). A diagnosis of
intermittent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals
younger than 6 years, or the equivalent developmental level (Criterion
E), or to individuals whose aggressive outbursts are better explained by
another mental disorder (Criterion F). A diagnosis of intermittent
explosive disorder should not be given to individuals with disruptive
mood dysregulation disorder or to individuals whose impulsive aggressive
outbursts are attributable to another medical condition or to the
physiological effects of a substance (Criterion F). In addition,
children ages

6--18 years should not receive this diagnosis when impulsive aggressive
outbursts occur in the context of an adjustment disorder (Criterion F).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Mood disorders (unipolar),
anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are associated with
intermittent explosive disorder, although onset of these disorders is
typically later than that of intermittent explosive disorder2.

Prevalence One-year prevalence data for intermittent explosive disorder
in the United States is about 2.7% (narrow definition)6. Intermittent
explosive disorder is more prevalent among younger individuals (e.g.,
younger than 35--40 years), compared with older individuals (older than
50 years), and in individuals with a high school education or less5.

Development and Course The onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive
aggressive behavior is most common in late childhood or adolescence and
rarely begins for the first time after age 40 years2. The core features
of intermittent explosive disorder, typically, are persistent and
continue for many years. The course of the disorder may be episodic,
with recurrent periods of impulsive aggressive outbursts. Intermittent
explosive disorder appears to follow a chronic and persistent course
over many years5. It also appears to be quite common regardless of the
presence2 or absence7 of attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
or disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders (e.g., conduct
disorder, oppositional defiant disorder).

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Individuals with a history of
physical and emotional trauma during the first two decades of life are
at increased risk for intermittent explosive disorder2. Genetic and
physiological. First-degree relatives of individuals with intermittent
explosive disorder are at increased risk for intermittent explosive
disorder2, and twin studies have demonstrated a substantial genetic
influence for impulsive aggression1.

Research provides neurobiological support for the presence of
serotonergic abnormalities, globally4 and in the brain, specifically in
areas of the limbic system (anterior cingulate)8 and orbitofrontal
cortex9 in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder. Amygdala
responses to anger stimuli, during functional magnetic resonance imaging
scanning, are greater in individuals with intermittent explosive
disorder compared with healthy individuals3.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The lower prevalence of intermittent
explosive disorder in some regions (Asia, Middle East) or countries
(Romania, Nigeria), compared with the United States, suggests that
information about recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behaviors
either is not elicited on questioning or is less likely to be present,
because of cultural factors.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues In some studies the prevalence of
intermittent explosive disorder is greater in males than in females
(odds ratio = 1.4--2.3); other studies have found no gender difference2.

Functional Consequences Explosive Disorder

of

Intermittent

Social (e.g., loss of friends, relatives, marital instability),
occupational (e.g., demotion, loss of employment), financial (e.g., due
to value of objects destroyed), and legal (e.g., civil suits as a result
of aggressive behavior against person or property; criminal charges for
assault) problems often develop as a result of intermittent explosive
disorder.

Differential Diagnosis A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder
should not be made when Criteria A1 and/or A2 are only met during an
episode of another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder,
bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder), or when impulsive aggressive
outbursts are attributable to another medical condition or to the
physiological effects of a substance or medication. This diagnosis also
should not be made, particularly in children

and adolescents ages 6--18 years, when the impulsive aggressive
outbursts occur in the context of an adjustment disorder. Other examples
in which recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts may, or
may not, be diagnosed as intermittent explosive disorder include the
following. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. In contrast to
intermittent explosive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
is characterized by a persistently negative mood state (i.e.,
irritability, anger) most of the day, nearly every day, between
impulsive aggressive outbursts. A diagnosis of disruptive mood
dysregulation disorder can only be given when the onset of recurrent,
problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts is before age 10 years.
Finally, a diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should
not be made for the first time after age 18 years. Otherwise, these
diagnoses are mutually exclusive. Antisocial personality disorder or
borderline personality disorder. Individuals with antisocial personality
disorder or borderline personality disorder often display recurrent,
problematic impulsive aggressive outbursts. However, the level of
impulsive aggression in individuals with antisocial personality disorder
or borderline personality disorder is lower than that in individuals
with intermittent explosive disorder. Delirium, major neurocognitive
disorder, and personality change due to another medical condition,
aggressive type. A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should
not be made when aggressive outbursts are judged to result from the
physiological effects of another diagnosable medical condition (e.g.,
brain injury associated with a change in personality characterized by
aggressive outbursts; complex partial epilepsy). Nonspecific
abnormalities on neurological examination (e.g., "soft signs") and
nonspecific electroencephalographic changes are compatible with a
diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder unless there is a
diagnosable medical condition that better explains the impulsive
aggressive outbursts. Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal. A
diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when
impulsive aggressive outbursts are nearly always associated with
intoxication with or withdrawal from substances (e.g., alcohol,
phencyclidine, cocaine and other stimulants, barbiturates, inhalants).
However, when a sufficient number of

impulsive aggressive outbursts also occur in the absence of substance
intoxication or withdrawal, and these warrant independent clinical
attention, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may be given.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional
defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with any of
these childhood-onset disorders may exhibit impulsive aggressive
outbursts. Individuals with ADHD are typically impulsive and, as a
result, may also exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. While
individuals with conduct disorder can exhibit impulsive aggressive
outbursts, the form of aggression characterized by the diagnostic
criteria is proactive and predatory. Aggression in oppositional defiant
disorder is typically characterized by temper tantrums and verbal
arguments with authority figures, whereas impulsive aggressive outbursts
in intermittent explosive disorder are in response to a broader array of
provocation and include physical assault. The level of impulsive
aggression in individuals with a history of one or more of these
disorders has been reported as lower than that in comparable individuals
whose symptoms also meet intermittent explosive disorder Criteria A
through E2. Accordingly, if Criteria A through E are also met, and the
impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant independent clinical attention, a
diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may be given.

Comorbidity Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use
disorders are most commonly comorbid with intermittent explosive
disorder2. In addition, individuals with antisocial personality disorder
or borderline personality disorder, and individuals with a history of
disorders with disruptive behaviors (e.g., ADHD, conduct disorder,
oppositional defiant disorder), are at greater risk for comorbid
intermittent explosive disorder2.

Conduct Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A repetitive and persistent
pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major
age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated, as manifested by
the presence of at least three of the following 15 criteria in the past
12 months from any of the categories below, with at least one criterion
present in the past 6 months: Aggression to People and Animals

1. Often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others. 2. Often initiates
physical fights. 3. Has used a weapon that can cause serious physical
harm to others (e.g., a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun). 4. Has
been physically cruel to people. 5. Has been physically cruel to
animals. 6. Has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse
snatching, extortion, armed robbery). 7. Has forced someone into sexual
activity. Destruction of Property 8. Has deliberately engaged in fire
setting with the intention of causing serious damage. 9. Has
deliberately destroyed others' property (other than by fire setting).
Deceitfulness or Theft 10. Has broken into someone else's house,
building, or car. 11. Often lies to obtain goods or favors or to avoid
obligations (i.e., "cons" others). 12. Has stolen items of nontrivial
value without confronting a victim (e.g., shoplifting, but without
breaking and entering; forgery). Serious Violations of Rules 13. Often
stays out at night despite parental prohibitions, beginning before age
13 years. 14. Has run away from home overnight at least twice while
living in the parental or parental surrogate home, or once without
returning for a lengthy period. 15. Is often truant from school,
beginning before age 13 years. b. The disturbance in behavior causes
clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational
functioning.

c. If the individual is age 18 years or older, criteria are not met for
antisocial personality disorder. Specify whether: 312.81 (F91.1)
Childhood-onset type: Individuals show at least one symptom
characteristic of conduct disorder prior to age 10 years. 312.82 (F91.2)
Adolescent-onset type: Individuals show no symptom characteristic of
conduct disorder prior to age 10 years. 312.89 (F91.9) Unspecified
onset: Criteria for a diagnosis of conduct disorder are met, but there
is not enough information available to determine whether the onset of
the first symptom was before or after age 10 years. Specify if: With
limited prosocial emotions: To qualify for this specifier, an individual
must have displayed at least two of the following characteristics
persistently over at least 12 months and in multiple relationships and
settings. These characteristics reflect the individual's typical pattern
of interpersonal and emotional functioning over this period and not just
occasional occurrences in some situations. Thus, to assess the criteria
for the specifier, multiple information sources are necessary. In
addition to the individual's self-report, it is necessary to consider
reports by others who have known the individual for extended periods of
time (e.g., parents, teachers, co-workers, extended family members,
peers). Lack of remorse or guilt: Does not feel bad or guilty when he or
she does something wrong (exclude remorse when expressed only when
caught and/or facing punishment). The individual shows a general lack of
concern about the negative consequences of his or her actions. For
example, the individual is not remorseful after hurting someone or does
not care about the consequences of breaking rules. Callous---lack of
empathy: Disregards and is unconcerned about the feelings of others. The
individual is described as cold and uncaring. The person appears more
concerned about the effects of his or her actions on himself or herself,
rather than their effects on others, even when they result in
substantial harm to others.

Unconcerned about performance: Does not show concern about
poor/problematic performance at school, at work, or in other important
activities. The individual does not put forth the effort necessary to
perform well, even when expectations are clear, and typically blames
others for his or her poor performance. Shallow or deficient affect:
Does not express feelings or show emotions to others, except in ways
that seem shallow, insincere, or superficial (e.g., actions contradict
the emotion displayed; can turn emotions "on" or "off" quickly) or when
emotional expressions are used for gain (e.g., emotions displayed to
manipulate or intimidate others). Specify current severity: Mild: Few if
any conduct problems in excess of those required to make the diagnosis
are present, and conduct problems cause relatively minor harm to others
(e.g., lying, truancy, staying out after dark without permission, other
rule breaking). Moderate: The number of conduct problems and the effect
on others are intermediate between those specified in "mild" and those
in "severe" (e.g., stealing without confronting a victim, vandalism).
Severe: Many conduct problems in excess of those required to make the
diagnosis are present, or conduct problems cause considerable harm to
others (e.g., forced sex, physical cruelty, use of a weapon, stealing
while confronting a victim, breaking and entering).

Subtypes Three subtypes of conduct disorder are provided based on the
age at onset of the disorder. Onset is most accurately estimated with
information from both the youth and the caregiver; estimates are often 2
years later than actual onset18. Both subtypes can occur in a mild,
moderate, or severe form. An unspecified-onset subtype is designated
when there is insufficient information to determine age at onset. In
childhood-onset conduct disorder, individuals are usually male,
frequently display physical aggression toward others, have disturbed
peer relationships, may have had oppositional defiant disorder during
early childhood, and usually have symptoms that meet full criteria for
conduct

disorder prior to puberty. Many children with this subtype also have
concurrent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other
neurodevelopmental difficulties. Individuals with childhood-onset type
are more likely to have persistent conduct disorder into adulthood than
are those with adolescent-onset type. As compared with individuals with
childhood-onset type, individuals with adolescent-onset conduct disorder
are less likely to display aggressive behaviors and tend to have more
normative peer relationships (although they often display conduct
problems in the company of others). These individuals are less likely to
have conduct disorder that persists into adulthood. The ratio of males
to females with conduct disorder is more balanced for the
adolescent-onset type than for the childhood-onset type.

Specifiers A minority of individuals with conduct disorder exhibit
characteristics that qualify for the "with limited prosocial emotions"
specifier10, 27. The indicators of this specifier are those that have
often been labeled as callous and unemotional traits in research. Other
personality features, such as thrill seeking, fearlessness, and
insensitivity to punishment, may also distinguish those with
characteristics described in the specifier7. Individuals with
characteristics described in this specifier may be more likely than
other individuals with conduct disorder to engage in aggression that is
planned for instrumental gain8. Individuals with conduct disorder of any
subtype or any level of severity can have characteristics that qualify
for the specifier "with limited prosocial emotions," although
individuals with the specifier are more likely to have childhood-onset
type and a severity specifier rating of severe7, 8. Although the
validity of self-report to assess the presence of the specifier has been
supported in some research contexts, individuals with conduct disorder
with this specifier may not readily admit to the traits in a clinical
interview. Thus, to assess the criteria for the specifier, multiple
information sources are necessary. Also, because the indicators of the
specifier are characteristics that reflect the individual's typical
pattern of interpersonal and emotional functioning, it is important to
consider reports by others who have known the individual for extended
periods of time and across

relationships and settings (e.g., parents, teachers, co-workers,
extended family members, peers).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of conduct disorder is a
repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights
of others or major ageappropriate societal norms or rules are violated
(Criterion A). These behaviors fall into four main groupings: aggressive
conduct that causes or threatens physical harm to other people or
animals (Criteria A1--A7); nonaggressive conduct that causes property
loss or damage (Criteria A8-- A9); deceitfulness or theft (Criteria
A10--A12); and serious violations of rules (Criteria A13--A15). Three or
more characteristic behaviors must have been present during the past 12
months, with at least one behavior present in the past 6 months. The
disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in
social, academic, or occupational functioning (Criterion B). The
behavior pattern is usually present in a variety of settings, such as
home, at school, or in the community. Because individuals with conduct
disorder are likely to minimize their conduct problems, the clinician
often must rely on additional informants. However, informants' knowledge
of the individual's conduct problems may be limited if they have
inadequately supervised the individual or the individual has concealed
symptom behaviors. Individuals with conduct disorder often initiate
aggressive behavior and react aggressively to others. They may display
bullying, threatening, or intimidating behavior (including bullying via
messaging on Web-based social media) (Criterion A1); initiate frequent
physical fights (Criterion A2); use a weapon that can cause serious
physical harm (e.g., a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun) (Criterion
A3); be physically cruel to people (Criterion A4) or animals (Criterion
A5); steal while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching,
extortion, armed robbery) (Criterion A6); or force someone into sexual
activity (Criterion A7). Physical violence may take the form of rape,
assault, or, in rare cases, homicide. Deliberate destruction of others'
property may include deliberate fire setting with the intention of
causing serious damage (Criterion A8) or deliberate destroying of other
people's property in other ways (e.g., smashing car windows, vandalizing
school property) (Criterion A9). Acts of deceitfulness or theft may
include breaking into someone else's house, building, or car (Criterion

A10); frequently lying or breaking promises to obtain goods or favors or
to avoid debts or obligations (e.g., "conning" other individuals)
(Criterion A11); or stealing items of nontrivial value without
confronting the victim (e.g., shoplifting, forgery, fraud) (Criterion
A12). Individuals with conduct disorder may also frequently commit
serious violations of rules (e.g., school, parental, workplace).
Children with conduct disorder often have a pattern, beginning before
age 13 years, of staying out late at night despite parental prohibitions
(Criterion A13). Children may also show a pattern of running away from
home overnight (Criterion A14). To be considered a symptom of conduct
disorder, the running away must have occurred at least twice (or only
once if the individual did not return for a lengthy period). Runaway
episodes that occur as a direct consequence of physical or sexual abuse
do not typically qualify for this criterion. Children with conduct
disorder may often be truant from school, beginning prior to age 13
years (Criterion A15).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Especially in ambiguous
situations, aggressive individuals with conduct disorder frequently
misperceive the intentions of others as more hostile and threatening
than is the case and respond with aggression that they then feel is
reasonable and justified6. Personality features of trait negative
emotionality and poor self-control, including poor frustration
tolerance, irritability, temper outbursts, suspiciousness, insensitivity
to punishment, thrill seeking, and recklessness, frequently co-occur
with conduct disorder7. Substance misuse is often an associated feature,
particularly in adolescent females19. Suicidal ideation, suicide
attempts, and completed suicide occur at a higher-than-expected rate in
individuals with conduct disorder1.

Prevalence One-year population prevalence estimates range from 2% to
more than 10%, with a median of 4%5. The prevalence of conduct disorder
appears to be fairly consistent across various countries that differ in
race and ethnicity3. Prevalence rates rise from childhood to adolescence
and are higher among males than among females15, 20. Few children with
impairing conduct disorder receive treatment5.

Development and Course The onset of conduct disorder may occur as early
as the preschool years11, 19, but the first significant symptoms usually
emerge during the period from middle childhood through middle
adolescence. Oppositional defiant disorder is a common precursor to the
childhood-onset type of conduct disorder24. Conduct disorder may be
diagnosed in adults, however, symptoms of conduct disorder usually
emerge in childhood or adolescence, and onset is rare after age 16
years. The course of conduct disorder after onset is variable. In a
majority of individuals, the disorder remits by adulthood. Many
individuals with conduct disorder---particularly those with
adolescent-onset type and those with few and milder symptoms---achieve
adequate social and occupational adjustment as adults. However, the
earlyonset type predicts a worse prognosis and an increased risk of
criminal behavior, conduct disorder, and substance-related disorders in
adulthood2. Individuals with conduct disorder are at risk for later mood
disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder,
impulse-control disorders, psychotic disorders, somatic symptom
disorders, and substance-related disorders as adults12, 20. Symptoms of
the disorder vary with age as the individual develops increased physical
strength, cognitive abilities, and sexual maturity. Symptom behaviors
that emerge first tend to be less serious (e.g., lying, shoplifting),
whereas conduct problems that emerge last tend to be more severe (e.g.,
rape, theft while confronting a victim)13. However, there are wide
differences among individuals, with some engaging in the more damaging
behaviors at an early age (which is predictive of a worse prognosis).
When individuals with conduct disorder reach adulthood, symptoms of
aggression, property destruction, deceitfulness, and rule violation,
including violence against co-workers, partners, and children, may be
exhibited in the workplace and the home, such that antisocial
personality disorder may be considered9, 26.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Temperamental risk factors
include a difficult undercontrolled infant temperament and
lower-than-average intelligence, particularly with regard to verbal IQ.

Environmental. Family-level risk factors include parental rejection and
neglect, inconsistent child-rearing practices, harsh discipline,
physical or sexual abuse, lack of supervision, early institutional
living, frequent changes of caregivers, large family size, parental
criminality, and certain kinds of familial psychopathology (e.g.,
substance-related disorders). Community-level risk factors include peer
rejection, association with a delinquent peer group, and neighborhood
exposure to violence. Both types of risk factors tend to be more common
and severe among individuals with the childhood-onset subtype of conduct
disorder7. Genetic and physiological. Conduct disorder is influenced by
both genetic and environmental factors17, 25. The risk is increased in
children with a biological or adoptive parent or a sibling with conduct
disorder. The disorder also appears to be more common in children of
biological parents with severe alcohol use disorder, depressive and
bipolar disorders, or schizophrenia or biological parents who have a
history of ADHD or conduct disorder. Family history particularly
characterizes individuals with the childhood-onset subtype of conduct
disorder19, 22. Slower resting heart rate has been reliably noted in
individuals with conduct disorder compared with those without the
disorder, and this marker is not characteristic of any other mental
disorder23. Reduced autonomic fear conditioning, particularly low skin
conductance, is also well documented14, 19, 29. However, these
psychophysiological findings are not diagnostic of the disorder.
Structural and functional differences in brain areas associated with
affect regulation and affect processing, particularly
frontotemporal-limbic connections involving the brain's ventral
prefrontal cortex and amygdala, have been consistently noted in
individuals with conduct disorder compared with those without the
disorder28. However, neuroimaging findings are not diagnostic of the
disorder.

Course modifiers Persistence is more likely for individuals with
behaviors that meet criteria for the childhood-onset subtype and qualify
for the specifier "with limited prosocial emotions" 16, 19, 27. The risk
that conduct disorder will persist is also increased by co-occurring
ADHD and by substance abuse19.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Conduct disorder diagnosis may at times be potentially misapplied to
individuals in settings where patterns of disruptive behavior are viewed
as near-normative (e.g., in very threatening, high-crime areas or war
zones). Therefore, the context in which the undesirable behaviors have
occurred should be considered.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Males with a diagnosis of conduct
disorder frequently exhibit fighting, stealing, vandalism, and school
discipline problems. Females with a diagnosis of conduct disorder are
more likely to exhibit lying, truancy, running away, substance use, and
prostitution15. Whereas males tend to exhibit both physical aggression
and relational aggression (behavior that harms social relationships of
others), females tend to exhibit relatively more relational aggression4.

Functional Consequences of Conduct Disorder Conduct disorder behaviors
may lead to school suspension or expulsion, problems in work adjustment,
legal difficulties, sexually transmitted diseases, unplanned pregnancy,
and physical injury from accidents or fights. These problems may
preclude attendance in ordinary schools or living in a parental or
foster home. Conduct disorder is often associated with an early onset of
sexual behavior, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, use of illegal
substances, and reckless and risk-taking acts. Accident rates appear to
be higher among individuals with conduct disorder compared with those
without the disorder. These functional consequences of conduct disorder
may predict health difficulties when individuals reach midlife21. It is
not uncommon for individuals with conduct disorder to come into contact
with the criminal justice system for engaging in illegal behavior.
Conduct disorder is a common reason for treatment referral and is
frequently diagnosed in mental health facilities for children,
especially in forensic practice. It is associated with impairment that
is more severe and chronic than that experienced by other
clinic-referred children.

Differential Diagnosis Oppositional defiant disorder. Conduct disorder
and oppositional defiant disorder are both related to symptoms that
bring the individual in conflict

with adults and other authority figures (e.g., parents, teachers, work
supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder are
typically of a less severe nature than those of individuals with conduct
disorder and do not include aggression toward individuals or animals,
destruction of property, or a pattern of theft or deceit. Furthermore,
oppositional defiant disorder includes problems of emotional
dysregulation (i.e., angry and irritable mood) that are not included in
the definition of conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both
oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, both diagnoses can
be given. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although children
with ADHD often exhibit hyperactive and impulsive behavior that may be
disruptive, this behavior does not by itself violate societal norms or
the rights of others and therefore does not usually meet criteria for
conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both ADHD and conduct
disorder, both diagnoses should be given. Depressive and bipolar
disorders. Irritability, aggression, and conduct problems can occur in
children or adolescents with a major depressive disorder, a bipolar
disorder, or disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The behavioral
problems associated with these mood disorders can usually be
distinguished from the pattern of conduct problems seen in conduct
disorder based on their course. Specifically, persons with conduct
disorder will display substantial levels of aggressive or non-aggressive
conduct problems during periods in which there is no mood disturbance,
either historically (i.e., a history of conduct problems predating the
onset of the mood disturbance) or concurrently (i.e., display of some
conduct problems that are premeditated and do not occur during periods
of intense emotional arousal). In those cases in which criteria for
conduct disorder and a mood disorder are met, both diagnoses can be
given. Intermittent explosive disorder. Both conduct disorder and
intermittent explosive disorder involve high rates of aggression.
However, the aggression in individuals with intermittent explosive
disorder is limited to impulsive aggression and is not premeditated, and
it is not committed in order to achieve some tangible objective (e.g.,
money, power, intimidation). Also, the definition of intermittent
explosive disorder does not include the non-aggressive symptoms of
conduct disorder. If criteria for both disorders are met, the diagnosis
of intermittent explosive disorder should be given

only when the recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant
independent clinical attention. Adjustment disorders. The diagnosis of
an adjustment disorder (with disturbance of conduct or with mixed
disturbance of emotions and conduct) should be considered if clinically
significant conduct problems that do not meet the criteria for another
specific disorder develop in clear association with the onset of a
psychosocial stressor and do not resolve within 6 months of the
termination of the stressor (or its consequences). Conduct disorder is
diagnosed only when the conduct problems represent a repetitive and
persistent pattern that is associated with impairment in social,
academic, or occupational functioning.

Comorbidity ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder are both common in
individuals with conduct disorder, and this comorbid presentation
predicts worse outcomes. Individuals who show the personality features
associated with antisocial personality disorder often violate the basic
rights of others or violate major age-appropriate societal norms, and as
a result their pattern of behavior often meets criteria for conduct
disorder. Conduct disorder may also co-occur with one or more of the
following mental disorders: specific learning disorder, anxiety
disorders, depressive or bipolar disorders, and substance-related
disorders. Academic achievement, particularly in reading and other
verbal skills, is often below the level expected on the basis of age and
intelligence and may justify the additional diagnosis of specific
learning disorder or a communication disorder.

Antisocial Personality Disorder Criteria and text for antisocial
personality disorder can be found in the chapter "Personality
Disorders." Because this disorder is closely connected to the spectrum
of "externalizing" conduct disorders in this chapter, as well as to the
disorders in the adjoining chapter "Substance-Related and Addictive
Disorders," it is dual coded here as well as in the chapter "Personality
Disorders."

a.  Deliberate and purposeful fire setting on more than one occasion.
b.  Tension or affective arousal before the act.
c.  Fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to
    fire and its situational contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses,
    consequences).
d.  Pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting fires or when
    witnessing or participating in their aftermath.
e.  The fire setting is not done for monetary gain, as an expression of
    sociopolitical ideology, to conceal criminal activity, to express
    anger or vengeance, to improve one's living circumstances, in
    response to a

delusion or hallucination, or as a result of impaired judgment (e.g., in
major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability \[intellectual
developmental disorder\], substance intoxication). f. The fire setting
is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or
antisocial personality disorder.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of pyromania is the presence
of multiple episodes of deliberate and purposeful fire setting
(Criterion A). Individuals with this disorder experience tension or
affective arousal before setting a fire (Criterion B). There is a
fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to fire
and its situational contexts (e.g., paraphernalia, uses, consequences)
(Criterion C). Individuals with this disorder are often regular
"watchers" at fires in their neighborhoods, may set off false alarms,
and derive pleasure from institutions, equipment, and personnel
associated with fire. They may spend time at the local fire department,
set fires to be affiliated with the fire department, or even become
firefighters. Individuals with this disorder experience pleasure,
gratification, or relief when setting the fire, witnessing its effects,
or participating in its aftermath (Criterion D). The fire setting is not
done for monetary gain, as an expression of sociopolitical ideology, to
conceal criminal activity, to express anger or vengeance, to improve
one's living circumstances, or in response to a delusion or a
hallucination (Criterion E). The fire setting does not result from
impaired judgment (e.g., in major neurocognitive disorder or
intellectual disability \[intellectual developmental disorder\]). The
diagnosis is not made if the fire setting is better explained by conduct
disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder (Criterion
F).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with pyromania may
make considerable advance preparation for starting a fire. They may be
indifferent to the consequences to life or property caused by the fire,
or they may derive satisfaction from the resulting property destruction.
The behaviors may lead to property damage, legal consequences, or injury
or loss of life to the fire setter or to others.

Individuals who impulsively set fires (who may or may not have
pyromania) often have a current or past history of alcohol use disorder.

Prevalence The population prevalence of pyromania is not known. The
lifetime prevalence of fire setting, which is just one component of
pyromania and not sufficient for a diagnosis by itself, was reported as
1.13% in a population sample, but the most common comorbidities were
antisocial personality disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar
disorder, and pathological gambling (gambling disorder)1. In contrast,
pyromania as a primary diagnosis appears to be very rare. Among a sample
of persons reaching the criminal system with repeated fire setting, only
3.3% had symptoms that met full criteria for pyromania3.

Development and Course There are insufficient data to establish a
typical age at onset of pyromania. The relationship between fire setting
in childhood and pyromania in adulthood has not been documented. In
individuals with pyromania, firesetting incidents are episodic and may
wax and wane in frequency. Longitudinal course is unknown. Although fire
setting is a major problem in children and adolescents (over 40% of
those arrested for arson offenses in the United States are younger than
18 years), pyromania in childhood appears to be rare. Juvenile fire
setting is usually associated with conduct disorder,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or an adjustment disorder.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Pyromania occurs much more often in
males, especially those with poorer social skills and learning
difficulties.

Differential Diagnosis Other causes of intentional fire setting. It is
important to rule out other causes of fire setting before giving the
diagnosis of pyromania. Intentional fire setting may occur for profit,
sabotage, or revenge; to conceal a crime; to make a political statement
(e.g., an act of terrorism or protest); or to attract attention or
recognition (e.g., setting a fire in order to discover it and save

the day). Fire setting may also occur as part of developmental
experimentation in childhood (e.g., playing with matches, lighters, or
fire). Other mental disorders. A separate diagnosis of pyromania is not
given when fire setting occurs as part of conduct disorder, a manic
episode, or antisocial personality disorder, or if it occurs in response
to a delusion or a hallucination (e.g., in schizophrenia) or is
attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition
(e.g., epilepsy). The diagnosis of pyromania should also not be given
when fire setting results from impaired judgment associated with major
neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability, or substance
intoxication.

Comorbidity There appears to be a high co-occurrence of substance use
disorders, gambling disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and
other disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders with
pyromania2.

Kleptomania Diagnostic Criteria

312.32 (F63.2)

a.  Recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not
    needed for personal use or for their monetary value.
b.  Increasing sense of tension immediately before committing the theft.

c. Pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the
theft. d. The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance
and is not in response to a delusion or a hallucination. e. The stealing
is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or
antisocial personality disorder.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of kleptomania is the
recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal items even though the
items are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value
(Criterion A). The individual experiences a rising subjective sense of
tension before the theft (Criterion B) and feels pleasure,
gratification, or relief when committing the theft (Criterion C). The
stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance, is not done in
response to a delusion or hallucination (Criterion D), and is not better
explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial
personality disorder (Criterion E). The objects are stolen despite the
fact that they are typically of little value to the individual, who
could have afforded to pay for them and often gives them away or
discards them. Occasionally the individual may hoard the stolen objects
or surreptitiously return them. Although individuals with this disorder
will generally avoid stealing when immediate arrest is probable (e.g.,
in full view of a police officer), they usually do not preplan the
thefts or fully take into account the chances of apprehension. The
stealing is done without assistance from, or collaboration with, others.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with kleptomania
typically attempt to resist the impulse to steal, and they are aware
that the act is wrong and senseless. The individual frequently fears
being apprehended and often feels depressed or guilty about the thefts.
Neurotransmitter pathways associated with behavioral addictions,
including those associated with the serotonin, dopamine, and opioid
systems, appear to play a role in kleptomania as well1.

Prevalence

Kleptomania occurs in about 4%--24% of individuals arrested for
shoplifting2. Its prevalence in the general population is very rare, at
approximately 0.3%--0.6%1, 2. Females outnumber males at a ratio of
3:12.

Development and Course Age at onset of kleptomania is variable, but the
disorder often begins in adolescence2. However, the disorder may begin
in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, and in rare cases in late
adulthood. There is little systematic information on the course of
kleptomania, but three typical courses have been described: sporadic
with brief episodes and long periods of remission; episodic with
protracted periods of stealing and periods of remission; and chronic
with some degree of fluctuation. The disorder may continue for years,
despite multiple convictions for shoplifting.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. There are no
controlled family history studies of kleptomania. However, first-degree
relatives of individuals with kleptomania may have higher rates of
obsessive-compulsive disorder than the general population. There also
appears to be a higher rate of substance use disorders, including
alcohol use disorder, in relatives of individuals with kleptomania than
in the general population1.

Functional Consequences of Kleptomania The disorder may cause legal,
family, career, and personal difficulties.

Differential Diagnosis Ordinary theft. Kleptomania should be
distinguished from ordinary acts of theft or shoplifting. Ordinary theft
(whether planned or impulsive) is deliberate and is motivated by the
usefulness of the object or its monetary worth. Some individuals,
especially adolescents, may also steal on a dare, as an act of
rebellion, or as a rite of passage. The diagnosis is not made unless
other characteristic features of kleptomania are also present.
Kleptomania is exceedingly rare, whereas shoplifting is relatively
common. Malingering. In malingering, individuals may simulate the
symptoms of kleptomania to avoid criminal prosecution.

Antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder. Antisocial
personality disorder and conduct disorder are distinguished from
kleptomania by a general pattern of antisocial behavior. Manic episodes,
psychotic episodes, and major neurocognitive disorder. Kleptomania
should be distinguished from intentional or inadvertent stealing that
may occur during a manic episode, in response to delusions or
hallucinations (as in, e.g., schizophrenia), or as a result of a major
neurocognitive disorder.

Comorbidity Kleptomania may be associated with compulsive buying as well
as with depressive and bipolar disorders (especially major depressive
disorder), anxiety disorders, eating disorders (particularly bulimia
nervosa), personality disorders, substance use disorders (especially
alcohol use disorder), and other disruptive, impulse-control, and
conduct disorders1, 2.

Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder 312.89
(F91.8) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of a disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder category is
used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the
specific reason that the presentation does not

meet the criteria for any specific disruptive, impulse-control, and
conduct disorder. This is done by recording "other specified disruptive,
impulsecontrol, and conduct disorder" followed by the specific reason
(e.g., "recurrent behavioral outbursts of insufficient frequency").

Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder 312.9
(F91.9) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of a disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive,
impulse-control, and conduct disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder category is used in
situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that
the criteria are not met for a specific disruptive, impulse-control, and
conduct disorder, and includes presentations in which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders The substance-related
disorders encompass 10 separate classes of drugs: alcohol; caffeine;
cannabis; hallucinogens (with separate categories for phencyclidine \[or
similarly acting arylcyclohexylamines\] and other hallucinogens);
inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants
(amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, and other stimulants); tobacco;
and other (or unknown) substances. These 10 classes are not fully
distinct. All drugs that are taken in excess have in common direct
activation of the brain reward system, which is involved in the
reinforcement of behaviors and the production of memories. They produce
such an intense activation of the reward system that normal activities
may be neglected. Instead of achieving reward system activation through
adaptive behaviors, drugs of abuse directly activate the reward
pathways2. The pharmacological mechanisms by which each class of drugs
produces reward are different, but the drugs typically activate the
system and produce feelings of pleasure, often referred to as a "high."
Furthermore, individuals with lower levels of self-control, which may
reflect impairments of brain inhibitory mechanisms, may be particularly
predisposed to develop substance use disorders, suggesting that the
roots of substance use disorders for some persons can be seen in
behaviors long before the onset of actual substance use itself5. In
addition to the substance-related disorders, this chapter also includes
gambling disorder, reflecting evidence that gambling behaviors activate
reward systems similar to those activated by drugs of abuse and produce
some behavioral symptoms that appear comparable to those produced by the
substance use disorders. Other excessive behavioral patterns, such as
Internet gaming, have also been described, but the research on these and
other behavioral syndromes is less clear. Thus, groups of repetitive
behaviors, which some term behavioral addictions, with such
subcategories as "sex addiction," "exercise addiction," or "shopping
addiction," are not included because at this time there is insufficient
peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course
descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders. The
substance-related disorders are divided into two groups: substance use
disorders and substance-induced disorders. The following conditions may
be classified as substance-induced: intoxication, withdrawal, and other
substance/medication-induced mental disorders (psychotic disorders,
bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders,
obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, sleep disorders, sexual
dysfunctions, delirium, and neurocognitive disorders). The current
section begins with a general discussion of criteria sets for a
substance use disorder, substance intoxication and withdrawal, and other
substance/medication-induced mental disorders, at least some of which
are applicable across classes of substances. Reflecting some unique
aspects of the 10 substance classes relevant to this chapter, the
remainder of the chapter is organized by the class of substance and
describes their unique aspects. To facilitate differential diagnosis,
the text and criteria for the remaining substance/medication-induced
mental disorders are included with disorders with which they share
phenomenology (e.g., substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is
in the chapter "Depressive Disorders"). The broad diagnostic categories
associated with each specific group of substances are shown in Table 1..

Substance-Related Disorders Substance Use Disorders Features The
essential feature of a substance use disorder is a cluster of cognitive,
behavioral, and physiological symptoms indicating that the individual
continues using the substance despite significant substance-related
problems. As seen in Table 1., the diagnosis of a substance use disorder
can be applied to all 10 classes included in this chapter except
caffeine. For certain classes some symptoms are less salient, and in a
few instances not all symptoms apply (e.g., withdrawal symptoms are not
specified for phencyclidine use disorder, other hallucinogen use
disorder, or inhalant use disorder). An important characteristic of
substance use disorders is an underlying change in brain circuits that
may persist beyond detoxification, particularly in individuals with
severe disorders. The behavioral effects of these brain changes may be
exhibited in the repeated relapses and intense drug craving when the
individuals are exposed to drug-related stimuli. These persistent drug
effects may benefit from long-term approaches to treatment3. Overall,
the diagnosis of a substance use disorder is based on a pathological
pattern of behaviors related to use of the substance. To assist with
organization, Criterion A criteria can be considered to fit within
overall groupings of impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and
pharmacological criteria. Impaired control over substance use is the
first criteria grouping (Criteria 1--4). The individual may take the
substance in larger amounts or over a longer period than was originally
intended (Criterion 1). The individual may express a persistent desire
to cut down or regulate substance use and may report multiple
unsuccessful efforts to decrease or discontinue use (Criterion 2). The
individual may spend a great deal of time obtaining the substance, using
the substance, or recovering from its effects (Criterion 3). In some
instances of more severe substance use disorders, virtually all of the
individual's daily activities revolve around the substance. Craving
(Criterion 4) is manifested by an intense desire or urge for the drug
that may occur at any time but is more likely when in an environment
where the drug previously was obtained or used. Craving has also been
shown to involve classical conditioning and is associated with
activation of specific reward structures in the brain. Craving is
queried by asking if there has ever been a time when they had such
strong urges to take the drug that they could not think of anything
else. Current craving is often used as a treatment outcome measure
because it may be a signal of impending relapse4.

Social impairment is the second grouping of criteria (Criteria 5--7).
Recurrent substance use may result in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home (Criterion 5). The individual may
continue substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or
interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the
substance (Criterion 6). Important social, occupational, or recreational
activities may be given up or reduced because of substance use
(Criterion 7). The individual may withdraw from family activities and
hobbies in order to use the substance. Risky use of the substance is the
third grouping of criteria (Criteria 8--9). This may take the form of
recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous (Criterion 8). The individual may continue substance use
despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or
psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated
by the substance (Criterion 9). The key issue in evaluating this
criterion is not the existence of the problem, but rather the
individual's failure to abstain from using the substance despite the
difficulty it is causing. Pharmacological criteria are the final
grouping (Criteria 10 and 11). Tolerance (Criterion 10) is signaled by
requiring a markedly increased dose of the substance to achieve the
desired effect or a markedly reduced effect when the usual dose is
consumed. The degree to which tolerance develops varies greatly across
different individuals as well as across substances and may involve a
variety of central nervous system effects. For example, tolerance to
respiratory depression and tolerance to sedating and motor coordination
may develop at different rates, depending on the substance. Tolerance
may be difficult to determine by history alone, and laboratory tests may
be helpful (e.g., high blood levels of the substance coupled with little
evidence of intoxication suggest that tolerance is likely). Tolerance
must also be distinguished from individual variability in the initial
sensitivity to the effects of particular substances. For example, some
first-time alcohol drinkers show very little evidence of intoxication
with three or four drinks, whereas others of similar weight and drinking
histories have slurred speech and incoordination6. Withdrawal (Criterion
11) is a syndrome that occurs when blood or tissue concentrations of a
substance decline in an individual who had maintained prolonged heavy
use of the substance. After developing withdrawal symptoms, the
individual is likely to consume the substance to relieve the symptoms.
Withdrawal symptoms vary greatly across the classes of substances, and
separate criteria sets for withdrawal are provided for the drug classes.
Marked and generally easily measured physiological signs of withdrawal
are common with alcohol, opioids, and sedatives, hypnotics, and
anxiolytics. Withdrawal signs and symptoms with stimulants (amphetamines
and cocaine), as well as tobacco and cannabis, are often present but may
be less apparent. Significant withdrawal has not been documented in
humans after repeated use of phencyclidine, other hallucinogens, and
inhalants; therefore, this criterion is not included for these
substances. Neither tolerance nor withdrawal is necessary for a
diagnosis of a substance use disorder. However, for most classes of
substances, a past history of withdrawal is associated with a more
severe clinical course (i.e., an earlier onset of a substance use
disorder, higher levels of substance intake, and a greater number of
substance-related problems)1. Symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal
occurring during appropriate medical treatment with prescribed
medications (e.g., opioid analgesics, sedatives, stimulants) are
specifically not counted when diagnosing a substance use disorder. The
appearance of normal, expected pharmacological tolerance and withdrawal
during the course of medical treatment has been known to lead to an
erroneous diagnosis of "addiction" even when these were the only
symptoms present. Individuals whose only symptoms are those that occur
as a result of medical treatment (i.e., tolerance and withdrawal as part
of medical care when the medications are taken as prescribed) should not
receive a diagnosis solely on the basis of these symptoms. However,
prescription medications can be used inappropriately, and a substance
use disorder can be correctly diagnosed when there are other symptoms of
compulsive, drug-seeking behavior.

Severity and Specifiers Substance use disorders occur in a broad range
of severity, from mild to severe, with severity based on the number of
symptom criteria endorsed. As a general estimate of severity, a mild
substance use disorder is suggested by the presence of two to three
symptoms, moderate by four to five symptoms, and severe by six or more
symptoms. Changing severity across time is also reflected by reductions
or increases in the frequency and/or dose of substance use, as assessed
by the individual's own report, report of knowledgeable others,
clinician's observations, and biological testing. The following course
specifiers and descriptive features specifiers are also available for
substance use disorders: "in early remission," "in sustained remission,"
"on maintenance therapy," and "in a controlled environment." Definitions
of each are provided within respective criteria sets.

Recording Procedures for Substance Use Disorders The clinician should
use the code that applies to the class of substances but record the name
of the specific substance. For example, the clinician should record
304.10 (F13.20) moderate alprazolam use disorder (rather than moderate
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder) or 305.70 (F15.10) mild
methamphetamine use disorder (rather than mild stimulant use disorder).
For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., anabolic
steroids), the appropriate code for "other substance use disorder"
should be used and the specific substance indicated (e.g., 305.90
\[F19.10\] mild anabolic steroid use disorder). If the substance taken
by the individual is unknown, the code for the class "other (or
unknown)" should be used (e.g., 304.90 \[F19.20\] severe unknown
substance use disorder). If criteria are met for more than one substance
use disorder, all should be diagnosed (e.g., 304.00 \[F11.20\] severe
heroin use disorder; 304.20 \[F14.20\] moderate cocaine use disorder).
The appropriate ICD-10-CM code for a substance use disorder depends on
whether there is a comorbid substance-induced disorder (including
intoxication and withdrawal). In the above example, the diagnostic code
for moderate alprazolam use disorder, F13.20, reflects the absence of a
comorbid alprazolam-induced mental disorder. Because ICD-10-CM codes for
substance-induced disorders indicate both the presence (or absence) and
severity of the substance use disorder, ICD-10-CM codes for substance
use disorders can be used only in the absence of a substance-induced
disorder. See the individual substance-specific sections for additional
coding information. Note that the word addiction is not applied as a
diagnostic term in this classification, although it is in common usage
in many countries to describe severe problems related to compulsive and
habitual use of substances. The more neutral term substance use disorder
is used to describe the wide range of the disorder, from a mild form to
a severe state of chronically relapsing, compulsive drug taking. Some
clinicians will choose to use the word addiction to describe more
extreme presentations, but the word is omitted from the official DSM-5
substance use disorder diagnostic terminology because of its uncertain
definition and its potentially negative connotation.

Substance-Induced Disorders The overall category of substance-induced
disorders includes intoxication, withdrawal, and other
substance/medication-induced mental disorders (e.g., substance-induced
psychotic disorder, substance-induced depressive disorder).

Substance Intoxication and Withdrawal Criteria for substance
intoxication are included within the substance-specific sections of this
chapter. The essential feature is the development of a reversible
substance-specific syndrome due to the recent ingestion of a substance
(Criterion A). The clinically significant problematic behavioral or
psychological changes associated with intoxication (e.g., belligerence,
mood lability, impaired judgment) are attributable to the physiological
effects of the substance on the central nervous system and develop
during or shortly after use of the substance (Criterion B). The symptoms
are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better
explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D). Substance
intoxication is common among those with a substance use disorder but
also occurs frequently in individuals without a substance use disorder.
This category does not apply to tobacco.

The most common changes in intoxication involve disturbances of
perception, wakefulness, attention, thinking, judgment, psychomotor
behavior, and interpersonal behavior. Short-term, or "acute,"
intoxications may have different signs and symptoms than sustained, or
"chronic," intoxications. For example, moderate cocaine doses may
initially produce gregariousness, but social withdrawal may develop if
such doses are frequently repeated over days or weeks1. When used in the
physiological sense, the term intoxication is broader than substance
intoxication as defined here. Many substances may produce physiological
or psychological changes that are not necessarily problematic. For
example, an individual with tachycardia from substance use has a
physiological effect, but if this is the only symptom in the absence of
problematic behavior, the diagnosis of intoxication would not apply.
Intoxication may sometimes persist beyond the time when the substance is
detectable in the body. This may be due to enduring central nervous
system effects, the recovery of which takes longer than the time for
elimination of the substance. These longer-term effects of intoxication
must be distinguished from withdrawal (i.e., symptoms initiated by a
decline in blood or tissue concentrations of a substance). Criteria for
substance withdrawal are included within the substance-specific sections
of this chapter. The essential feature is the development of a
substance-specific problematic behavioral change, with physiological and
cognitive concomitants, that is due to the cessation of, or reduction
in, heavy and prolonged substance use (Criterion A). The
substance-specific syndrome causes clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms are not due to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder
(Criterion D). Withdrawal is usually, but not always, associated with a
substance use disorder. Most individuals with withdrawal have an urge to
re-administer the substance to reduce the symptoms.

Route of Administration and Speed of Substance Effects Routes of
administration that produce more rapid and efficient absorption into the
bloodstream (e.g., intravenous, smoking, intranasal "snorting") tend to
result in a more intense intoxication and an increased likelihood of an
escalating pattern of substance use leading to withdrawal. Similarly,
rapidly acting substances are more likely than slower-acting substances
to produce immediate intoxication1.

Duration of Effects Within the same drug category, relatively
short-acting substances tend to have a higher potential for the
development of withdrawal than do those with a longer duration of
action. However, longer-acting substances tend to have longer withdrawal
duration. The half-life of the substance parallels aspects of
withdrawal: the longer the duration of action, the longer the time
between cessation and the onset of withdrawal symptoms and the longer
the withdrawal duration. In general, the longer the acute withdrawal
period, the less intense the syndrome tends to be1.

Use of Multiple Substances Substance intoxication and withdrawal often
involve several substances used simultaneously or sequentially. In these
cases, each diagnosis should be recorded separately.

Associated Laboratory Findings Laboratory analyses of blood and urine
samples can help determine recent use and the specific substances
involved. However, a positive laboratory test result does not by itself
indicate that the individual has a pattern of substance use that meets
criteria for a substance-induced or substance use disorder, and a
negative test result does not by itself rule out a diagnosis. Laboratory
tests can be useful in identifying withdrawal. If the individual
presents with withdrawal from an unknown substance, laboratory tests may
help identify the substance and may also be helpful in differentiating
withdrawal from other mental disorders. In addition, normal functioning
in the presence of high blood levels of a substance suggests
considerable tolerance.

Development and Course Individuals ages 18--24 years have relatively
high prevalence rates for the use of virtually every substance.
Intoxication is usually the initial substance-related disorder and often
begins in the teens. Withdrawal can occur at any age as long as the
relevant drug has been taken in sufficient doses over an extended period
of time.

Recording Procedures for Intoxication and Withdrawal The clinician
should use the code that applies to the class of substances but record
the name of the specific substance. For example, the clinician should
record 292.0 (F13.239) secobarbital withdrawal (rather than sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal) or 292.89 (F15.129) methamphetamine
intoxication (rather than stimulant intoxication). Note that the
appropriate ICD-10-CM diagnostic code for intoxication depends on
whether there is a comorbid substance use disorder. In this case, the
F15.129 code for methamphetamine indicates the presence of a comorbid
mild methamphetamine use disorder. If there had been no comorbid
methamphetamine use disorder, the diagnostic code would have been
F15.929. ICD-10-CM coding rules require that all withdrawal codes imply
a comorbid moderate to severe substance use disorder for that substance.
In the above case, the code for secobarbital withdrawal (F13.239)
indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate to severe secobarbital use
disorder. See the coding note for the substance-specific intoxication
and withdrawal syndromes for the actual coding options. For substances
that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., anabolic steroids), the
appropriate code for "other substance intoxication" should be used and
the specific substance indicated (e.g., 292.89 \[F19.929\] anabolic
steroid intoxication). If the substance taken by the individual is
unknown, the code for the class "other (or unknown)" should be used
(e.g., 292.89 \[F19.929\] unknown substance intoxication). If there are
symptoms or problems associated with a particular substance but criteria
are not met for any of the substance-specific disorders, the unspecified
category can be used (e.g., 292.9 \[F12.99\] unspecified
cannabis-related disorder). As noted above, the substance-related codes
in ICD-10-CM combine the substance use disorder aspect of the clinical
picture and the substance-induced aspect into a single combined code.
Thus, if both heroin withdrawal and moderate heroin use disorder are
present, the single code F11.23 is given to cover both presentations. In
ICD-9CM, separate diagnostic codes (292.0 and 304.00) are given to
indicate withdrawal and a moderate heroin use disorder, respectively.
See the individual substance-specific sections for additional coding
information.

Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders The
substance/medication-induced mental disorders are potentially severe,
usually temporary, but sometimes persisting central nervous system (CNS)
syndromes that develop in the context of the effects of substances of
abuse, medications, or several toxins. They are distinguished from the
substance use disorders, in which a cluster of cognitive, behavioral,
and physiological symptoms contribute to the continued use of a
substance despite significant substance-related problems. The
substance/medication-induced mental disorders may be induced by the 10
classes of substances that produce substance use disorders, or by a
great variety of other medications used in medical treatment. Each
substance-induced mental disorder is described in the relevant chapter
(e.g., "Depressive Disorders," "Neurocognitive Disorders"), and
therefore, only a brief description is offered here. All
substance/medication-induced disorders share common characteristics. It
is important to recognize these common features to aid in the detection
of these disorders. These features are described as follows: a. The
disorder represents a clinically significant symptomatic presentation of
a relevant mental disorder. b. There is evidence from the history,
physical examination, or laboratory findings of both of the
following: 1. The disorder developed during or within 1 month of a
substance intoxication or withdrawal or taking a medication; and 2. The
involved substance/medication is capable of producing the mental
disorder. c. The disorder is not better explained by an independent
mental disorder (i.e., one that is not substance- or
medication-induced). Such evidence of an independent mental disorder
could include the following: 1. The disorder preceded the onset of
severe intoxication or withdrawal or exposure to the medication; or 2.
The full mental disorder persisted for a substantial period of time
(e.g., at least 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or
severe intoxication or taking the medication. This criterion does not
apply to substance-induced neurocognitive disorders or hallucinogen
persisting perception disorder, which persist beyond the cessation of
acute intoxication or withdrawal. d. The disorder does not occur
exclusively during the course of a delirium.

e. The disorder causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Features Some generalizations can be made regarding the categories of
substances capable of producing clinically relevant substance-induced
mental disorders. In general, the more sedating drugs (sedative,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics, and alcohol) can produce prominent and
clinically significant depressive disorders during intoxication, while
anxiety conditions are likely to be observed during withdrawal syndromes
from these substances14. Also, during intoxication, the more stimulating
substances (e.g., amphetamines and cocaine) are likely to be associated
with substance-induced psychotic disorders and substance-induced anxiety
disorders9, with substance-induced major depressive episodes observed
during withdrawal. Both the more sedating and more stimulating drugs are
likely to produce significant but temporary sleep and sexual
disturbances19. An overview of the relationship between specific
categories of substances and specific psychiatric syndromes is presented
in Table 1.. The medication-induced conditions include what are often
idiosyncratic CNS reactions or relatively extreme examples of side
effects for a wide range of medications taken for a variety of medical
concerns. These include neurocognitive complications of anesthetics,
antihistamines, antihypertensives, and a variety of other medications
and toxins (e.g., organophosphates, insecticides, carbon monoxide), as
described in the chapter on neurocognitive disorders. Psychotic
syndromes may be temporarily experienced in the context of
anticholinergic, cardiovascular, and steroid drugs, as well as during
use of stimulant-like and depressant-like prescription or
over-the-counter drugs. Temporary but severe mood disturbances can be
observed with a wide range of medications, including steroids,
antihypertensives, disulfiram, and any prescription or over-the-counter
depressant or stimulant-like substances. A similar range of medications
can be associated with temporary anxiety syndromes, sexual dysfunctions,
and conditions of disturbed sleep. In general, to be considered a
substance/medication-induced mental disorder, there must be evidence
that the disorder being observed is not likely to be better explained by
an independent mental condition. The latter are most likely to be seen
if the mental disorder was present before the severe intoxication or
withdrawal or medication administration, or, with the exception of
several substance-induced persisting disorders listed in Table 1.,
continued more than 1 month after cessation of acute withdrawal, severe
intoxication, or use of the medications4, 7, 14. When symptoms are only
observed during a delirium (e.g., alcohol withdrawal delirium), the
mental disorder should be diagnosed as a delirium, and the psychiatric
syndrome occurring during the delirium should not also be diagnosed
separately, as many symptoms (including disturbances in mood, anxiety,
and reality testing) are commonly seen during agitated, confused states.
The features associated with each relevant major mental disorder are
similar whether observed with independent or
substance/medication-induced mental disorders. However, individuals with
substance/medication-induced mental disorders are likely to also
demonstrate the associated features seen with the specific category of
substance or medication, as listed in other subsections of this chapter.

Development and Course Substance-induced mental disorders develop in the
context of intoxication or withdrawal from substances of abuse, and
medication-induced mental disorders are seen with prescribed or
over-the-counter medications that are taken at the suggested doses. Both
conditions are usually temporary and likely to disappear within 1 month
or so of cessation of acute withdrawal, severe intoxication, or use of
the medication. Exceptions to these generalizations occur for certain
long-duration substance-induced disorders: substance-associated
neurocognitive disorders that relate to conditions such as
alcohol-induced neurocognitive disorder, inhalant-induced neurocognitive
disorder, and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced neurocognitive
disorder; and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder ("flashbacks";
see the section "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders" later in this chapter).
However, most other substance/medication-induced mental disorders,
regardless of the severity of the symptoms, are likely to improve
relatively quickly with abstinence and unlikely to remain clinically
relevant for more than 1 month after complete cessation of use. As is
true of many consequences of heavy substance use, some individuals are
more and others less prone toward specific substance-induced disorders2,
5, 11, 12. Similar types of predispositions may make some individuals
more likely to develop psychiatric side effects of some types of
medications, but not others. However, it is unclear whether individuals
with family histories or personal prior histories with independent
psychiatric syndromes are more likely to develop the induced syndrome
once the consideration is made as to whether the quantity and frequency
of the substance was sufficient to lead to the development of a
substance-induced syndrome.

There are indications that the intake of substances of abuse or some
medications with psychiatric side effects in the context of a
preexisting mental disorder is likely to result in an intensification of
the preexisting independent syndrome5, 18. The risk for
substance/medication-induced mental disorders is likely to increase with
both the quantity and the frequency of consumption of the relevant
substance. The symptom profiles for the substance/medication-induced
mental disorders resemble independent mental disorders4, 8, 13, 16.
While the symptoms of substance/medication-induced mental disorders can
be identical to those of independent mental disorders (e.g., delusions,
hallucinations, psychoses, major depressive episodes, anxiety
syndromes), and although they can have the same severe consequences
(e.g., suicide)1, most induced mental disorders are likely to improve in
a matter of days to weeks of abstinence3, 6, 10, 17. The
substance/medication-induced mental disorders are an important part of
the differential diagnoses for the independent psychiatric conditions.
The importance of recognizing an induced mental disorder is similar to
the relevance of identifying the possible role of some medical
conditions and medication reactions before diagnosing an independent
mental disorder. Symptoms of substance- and medication-induced mental
disorders may be identical cross-sectionally to those of independent
mental disorders but have different treatments and prognoses from the
independent condition.

Functional Disorders

Consequences

of

Substance/Medication-Induced

Mental

The same consequences related to the relevant independent mental
disorder (e.g., suicide attempts) are likely to apply to the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders, but these are likely to
disappear within 1 month after abstinence. Similarly, the same
functional consequences associated with the relevant substance use
disorder are likely to be seen for the substance-induced mental
disorders.

Recording Procedures for Substance/Medication-Induced Mental Disorders
Coding notes and separate recording procedures for ICD-9-CM and
ICD-10-CM codes for other specific substance/medication-induced mental
disorders are provided in other chapters of the manual with disorders
with which they share phenomenology (see the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters:
"Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders," "Bipolar and
Related Disorders," "Depressive Disorders," "Anxiety Disorders,"
"Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders," "Sleep-Wake Disorders,"
"Sexual Dysfunctions," and "Neurocognitive Disorders"). Generally, for
ICD-9-CM, if a mental disorder is induced by a substance use disorder, a
separate diagnostic code is given for the specific substance use
disorder, in addition to the code for the substance/medication-induced
mental disorder. For ICD-10-CM, a single code combines the
substance-induced mental disorder with the substance use disorder. A
separate diagnosis of the comorbid substance use disorder is not given,
although the name and severity of the specific substance use disorder
(when present) are used when recording the substance/medication-induced
mental disorder. ICD-10-CM codes are also provided for situations in
which the substance/medication-induced mental disorder is not induced by
a substance use disorder (e.g., when a disorder is induced by one-time
use of a substance or medication). Additional information needed to
record the diagnostic name of the substance/medication-induced mental
disorder is provided in the section "Recording Procedures" for each
substance/medication-induced mental disorder in its respective chapter.

Alcohol-Related Disorders Alcohol Use Disorder Alcohol Intoxication
Alcohol Withdrawal Other Alcohol-Induced Disorders Unspecified
Alcohol-Related Disorder

Alcohol Use Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A problematic pattern of
alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as
manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period: 1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer
period than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or
unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use. 3. A great deal
of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alcohol,
or recover from its effects.

4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol. 5. Recurrent
alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at
work, school, or home. 6. Continued alcohol use despite having
persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or
exacerbated by the effects of alcohol. 7. Important social,
occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because
of alcohol use. 8. Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is
physically hazardous. 9. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of
having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that
is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol. 10. Tolerance,
as defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased
amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect. b. A
markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of
alcohol. 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a.
The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol (refer to Criteria A
and B of the criteria set for alcohol withdrawal, pp. 499--500). b.
Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is
taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Specify if: In early
remission: After full criteria for alcohol use disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for alcohol use disorder have been met for at
least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that
Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol," may
be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria for alcohol use
disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for alcohol use
disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use alcohol," may be met). Specify if: In a controlled
environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in
an environment where access to alcohol is restricted. Code based on
current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an alcohol intoxication,
alcohol withdrawal, or another alcohol-induced mental disorder is also
present, do not use the codes below for alcohol use disorder. Instead,
the comorbid alcohol use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of
the alcohol-induced disorder code (see the coding note for alcohol
intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, or a specific alcohol-induced mental
disorder). For example, if there is comorbid alcohol intoxication and
alcohol use disorder, only the alcohol intoxication code is given, with
the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid alcohol use disorder
is mild, moderate, or severe: F10.129 for mild alcohol use disorder with
alcohol intoxication or F10.229 for a moderate or severe alcohol use
disorder with alcohol intoxication. Specify current severity: 305.00
(F10.10) Mild: Presence of 2--3 symptoms. 303.90 (F10.20) Moderate:
Presence of 4--5 symptoms. 303.90 (F10.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more
symptoms.

Specifiers "In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier
of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units. Severity of the
disorder is based on the number of diagnostic criteria endorsed. For a
given individual, changes in severity of alcohol use disorder across
time are also reflected by reductions in the frequency (e.g., days of
use per month) and/or dose (e.g., number of standard drinks consumed per
day) of alcohol used, as assessed by the

individual's self-report, report of knowledgeable others, clinician
observations, and, when practical, biological testing (e.g., elevations
in blood tests as described in the section "Diagnostic Markers" for this
disorder).

Diagnostic Features Alcohol use disorder is defined by a cluster of
behavioral and physical symptoms, which can include withdrawal,
tolerance, and craving. Alcohol withdrawal is characterized by
withdrawal symptoms that develop approximately 4--12 hours after the
reduction of intake following prolonged, heavy alcohol ingestion22.
Because withdrawal from alcohol can be unpleasant and intense,
individuals may continue to consume alcohol despite adverse
consequences, often to avoid or to relieve withdrawal symptoms. Some
withdrawal symptoms (e.g., sleep problems) can persist at lower
intensities for months and can contribute to relapse. Once a pattern of
repetitive and intense use develops, individuals with alcohol use
disorder may devote substantial periods of time to obtaining and
consuming alcoholic beverages. Craving for alcohol is indicated by a
strong desire to drink that makes it difficult to think of anything else
and that often results in the onset of drinking8. School and job
performance may also suffer either from the aftereffects of drinking or
from actual intoxication at school or on the job; child care or
household responsibilities may be neglected; and alcohol-related
absences may occur from school or work. The individual may use alcohol
in physically hazardous circumstances (e.g., driving an automobile,
swimming, operating machinery while intoxicated). Finally, individuals
with an alcohol use disorder may continue to consume alcohol despite the
knowledge that continued consumption poses significant physical (e.g.,
blackouts, liver disease), psychological (e.g., depression), social, or
interpersonal problems (e.g., violent arguments with spouse while
intoxicated, child abuse).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Alcohol use disorder is often
associated with problems similar to those associated with other
substances (e.g., cannabis; cocaine; heroin; amphetamines; sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics). Alcohol may be used to alleviate the
unwanted effects of these other substances or to substitute for them
when they are not available. Symptoms of conduct problems, depression,
anxiety, and insomnia frequently accompany heavy drinking and sometimes
precede it. Repeated intake of high doses of alcohol can affect nearly
every organ system, especially the gastrointestinal tract,
cardiovascular system, and the central and peripheral nervous systems18,
21. Gastrointestinal effects include gastritis, stomach or duodenal
ulcers, and, in about 15% of individuals who use alcohol heavily, liver
cirrhosis and/or pancreatitis. There is also an increased rate of cancer
of the esophagus, stomach, and other parts of the gastrointestinal
tract. One of the most commonly associated conditions is low-grade
hypertension. Cardiomyopathy and other myopathies are less common but
occur at an increased rate among those who drink very heavily. These
factors, along with marked increases in levels of triglycerides and
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, contribute to an elevated risk of
heart disease. Peripheral neuropathy may be evidenced by muscular
weakness, paresthesias, and decreased peripheral sensation. More
persistent central nervous system effects include cognitive deficits,
severe memory impairment, and degenerative changes in the cerebellum.
These effects are related to the direct effects of alcohol or of trauma
and to vitamin deficiencies (particularly of the B vitamins, including
thiamine). One devastating central nervous system effect is the
relatively rare alcohol-induced persisting amnestic disorder, or
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, in which the ability to encode new memory
is severely impaired. This condition would now be described within the
chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders" and would be termed a
substance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder. Alcohol use
disorder is an important contributor to suicide risk during severe
intoxication and in the context of a temporary alcohol-induced
depressive and bipolar disorder. There is an increased rate of suicidal
behavior as well as of completed suicide among individuals with the
disorder.

Prevalence Alcohol use disorder is a common disorder. In the United
States, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder is estimated to
be 4.6% among 12- to 17-year-olds and 8.5% among adults age 18 years and
older in the United States. Rates of the disorder are greater among
adult men (12.4%) than among adult women (4.9%). Twelve-month prevalence
of alcohol use disorder among adults decreases in middle age, being
greatest among individuals 18- to 29-years-old (16.2%) and lowest among
individuals age 65 years and older (1.5%). Twelve-month prevalence
varies markedly across race/ethnic subgroups of the U.S. population. For
12- to 17year-olds, rates are greatest among Hispanics (6.0%) and Native
Americans and Alaska Natives (5.7%) relative to

whites (5.0%), African Americans (1.8%), and Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders (1.6%). In contrast, among adults, the 12-month prevalence of
alcohol use disorder is clearly greater among Native Americans and
Alaska Natives (12.1%) than among whites (8.9%), Hispanics (7.9%),
African Americans (6.9%), and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
(4.5%).

Development and Course The first episode of alcohol intoxication is
likely to occur during the mid-teens. Alcohol-related problems that do
not meet full criteria for a use disorder or isolated problems may occur
prior to age 20 years, but the age at onset of an alcohol use disorder
with two or more of the criteria clustered together peaks in the late
teens or early to mid 20s19, 26. The large majority of individuals who
develop alcohol-related disorders do so by their late 30s. The first
evidence of withdrawal is not likely to appear until after many other
aspects of an alcohol use disorder have developed. An earlier onset of
alcohol use disorder is observed in adolescents with preexisting conduct
problems and those with an earlier onset of intoxication16. Alcohol use
disorder has a variable course that is characterized by periods of
remission and relapse9, 14, 23. A decision to stop drinking, often in
response to a crisis, is likely to be followed by a period of weeks or
more of abstinence, which is often followed by limited periods of
controlled or nonproblematic drinking. However, once alcohol intake
resumes, it is highly likely that consumption will rapidly escalate and
that severe problems will once again develop. Alcohol use disorder is
often erroneously perceived as an intractable condition, perhaps based
on the fact that individuals who present for treatment typically have a
history of many years of severe alcohol-related problems. However, these
most severe cases represent only a small proportion of individuals with
this disorder, and the typical individual with the disorder has a much
more promising prognosis. Among adolescents, conduct disorder and
repeated antisocial behavior often co-occur with alcohol- and with other
substance-related disorders3. While most individuals with alcohol use
disorder develop the condition before age 40 years, perhaps 10% have
later onset5, 23. Age-related physical changes in older individuals
result in increased brain susceptibility to the depressant effects of
alcohol; decreased rates of liver metabolism of a variety of substances,
including alcohol; and decreased percentages of body water. These
changes can cause older people to develop more severe intoxication and
subsequent problems at lower levels of consumption. Alcohol-related
problems in older people are also especially likely to be associated
with other medical complications.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Environmental risk and
prognostic factors may include cultural attitudes toward drinking and
intoxication, the availability of alcohol (including price), acquired
personal experiences with alcohol, and stress levels. Additional
potential mediators of how alcohol problems develop in predisposed
individuals include heavier peer substance use, exaggerated positive
expectations of the effects of alcohol, and suboptimal ways of coping
with stress24. Genetic and physiological. Alcohol use disorder runs in
families, with 40%--60% of the variance of risk explained by genetic
influences11, 20. The rate of this condition is three to four times
higher in close relatives of individuals with alcohol use disorder, with
values highest for individuals with a greater number of affected
relatives, closer genetic relationships to the affected person, and
higher severity of the alcohol-related problems in those relatives. A
significantly higher rate of alcohol use disorders exists in the
monozygotic twin than in the dizygotic twin of an individual with the
condition. A three- to fourfold increase in risk has been observed in
children of individuals with alcohol use disorder, even when these
children were given up for adoption at birth and raised by adoptive
parents who did not have the disorder. Recent advances in our
understanding of genes that operate through intermediate characteristics
(or phenotypes) to affect the risk of alcohol use disorder can help to
identify individuals who might be at particularly low or high risk for
alcohol use disorder20. Among the low-risk phenotypes are the acute
alcohol-related skin flush (seen most prominently in Asians). High
vulnerability is associated with preexisting schizophrenia or bipolar
disorder, as well as impulsivity (producing enhanced rates of all
substance use disorders and gambling disorder), and a high risk
specifically for alcohol use disorder is associated with a low level of
response (low sensitivity) to alcohol. A number of gene variations may
account for low response to alcohol or modulate the dopamine reward
systems; it is important to note, however, that any one gene variation
is likely to explain only 1%--2% of the risk for these disorders.

Course modifiers. In general, high levels of impulsivity are associated
with an earlier onset and more severe alcohol use disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues In most cultures, alcohol is the most
frequently used intoxicating substance and contributes to considerable
morbidity and mortality. An estimated 3.8% of all global deaths and 4.6%
of global disability-adjusted life-years are attributable to alcohol13.
In the United States, 80% of adults (age 18 years and older) have
consumed alcohol at some time in their lives, and 65% are current
drinkers (last 12 months)12. An estimated 3.6% of the world population
(15--64 years old) has a current (12-month) alcohol use disorder, with a
lower prevalence (1.1%) found in the African region, a higher rate
(5.2%) found in the American region (North, South, and Central America
and the Caribbean), and the highest rate (10.9%) found in the Eastern
Europe region13. Polymorphisms of genes for the alcohol-metabolizing
enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase are most often
seen in Asians and affect the response to alcohol. When consuming
alcohol, individuals with these gene variations can experience a flushed
face and palpitations, reactions that can be so severe as to limit or
preclude future alcohol consumption and diminish the risk for alcohol
use disorder. These gene variations are seen in as many as 40% of
Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and related groups worldwide and are related
to lower risks for the disorder4, 25. Despite small variations regarding
individual criterion items, the diagnostic criteria perform equally well
across most race/ethnicity groups1, 6, 15.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Males have higher rates of drinking and
related disorders than females. However, because females generally weigh
less than males, have more fat and less water in their bodies, and
metabolize less alcohol in their esophagus and stomach, they are likely
to develop higher blood alcohol levels per drink than males. Females who
drink heavily may also be more vulnerable than males to some of the
physical consequences associated with alcohol, including liver disease.

Diagnostic Markers Individuals whose heavier drinking places them at
elevated risk for alcohol use disorder can be identified both through
standardized questionnaires and by elevations in blood test results
likely to be seen with regular heavier drinking. These measures do not
establish a diagnosis of an alcohol-related disorder but can be useful
in highlighting individuals for whom more information should be
gathered. The most direct test available to measure alcohol consumption
cross-sectionally is blood alcohol concentration, which can also be used
to judge tolerance to alcohol. For example, an individual with a
concentration of 150 mg of ethanol per deciliter (dL) of blood who does
not show signs of intoxication can be presumed to have acquired at least
some degree of tolerance to alcohol. At 200 mg/dL, most nontolerant
individuals demonstrate severe intoxication. Regarding laboratory
tests2, 10, one sensitive laboratory indicator of heavy drinking is a
modest elevation or high-normal levels (\>35 units) of
gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). This may be the only laboratory
finding. At least 70% of individuals with a high GGT level are
persistent heavy drinkers (i.e., consuming eight or more drinks daily on
a regular basis). A second test with comparable or even higher levels of
sensitivity and specificity is carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT),
with levels of 20 units or higher useful in identifying individuals who
regularly consume eight or more drinks daily. Since both GGT and CDT
levels return toward normal within days to weeks of stopping drinking,
both state markers may be useful in monitoring abstinence, especially
when the clinician observes increases, rather than decreases, in these
values over time---a finding indicating that the person is likely to
have returned to heavy drinking. The combination of tests for CDT and
GGT may have even higher levels of sensitivity and specificity than
either test used alone. Additional useful tests include the mean
corpuscular volume (MCV), which may be elevated to high-normal values in
individuals who drink heavily---a change that is due to the direct toxic
effects of alcohol on erythropoiesis. Although the MCV can be used to
help identify those who drink heavily, it is a poor method of monitoring
abstinence because of the long half-life of red blood cells. Liver
function tests (e.g., alanine aminotransferase \[ALT\] and alkaline
phosphatase) can reveal liver injury that is a consequence of heavy
drinking. Other potential markers of heavy drinking that are more
nonspecific for alcohol but can help the clinician think of the possible
effects of alcohol include elevations in blood levels or lipids (e.g.,
triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and high-normal
levels of uric acid.

Additional diagnostic markers relate to signs and symptoms that reflect
the consequences often associated with persistent heavy drinking. For
example, dyspepsia, nausea, and bloating can accompany gastritis, and
hepatomegaly, esophageal varices, and hemorrhoids may reflect
alcohol-induced changes in the liver. Other physical signs of heavy
drinking include tremor, unsteady gait, insomnia, and erectile
dysfunction. Males with chronic alcohol use disorder may exhibit
decreased testicular size and feminizing effects associated with reduced
testosterone levels. Repeated heavy drinking in females is associated
with menstrual irregularities and, during pregnancy, spontaneous
abortion and fetal alcohol syndrome. Individuals with preexisting
histories of epilepsy or severe head trauma are more likely to develop
alcohol-related seizures. Alcohol withdrawal may be associated with
nausea, vomiting, gastritis, hematemesis, dry mouth, puffy blotchy
complexion, and mild peripheral edema.

Functional Consequences of Alcohol Use Disorder The diagnostic features
of alcohol use disorder highlight major areas of life functioning likely
to be impaired. These include driving and operating machinery, school
and work, interpersonal relationships and communication, and health.
Alcohol-related disorders contribute to absenteeism from work,
job-related accidents, and low employee productivity. Rates are elevated
in homeless individuals, perhaps reflecting a downward spiral in social
and occupational functioning, although most individuals with alcohol use
disorder continue to live with their families and function within their
jobs. Alcohol use disorder is associated with a significant increase in
the risk of accidents, violence, and suicide7. It is estimated that one
in five intensive care unit admissions in some urban hospitals is
related to alcohol and that 40% of individuals in the United States
experience an alcohol-related adverse event at some time in their lives,
with alcohol accounting for up to 55% of fatal driving events. Severe
alcohol use disorder, especially in individuals with antisocial
personality disorder, is associated with the commission of criminal
acts, including homicide. Severe problematic alcohol use also
contributes to disinhibition and feelings of sadness and irritability,
which contribute to suicide attempts and completed suicides.
Unanticipated alcohol withdrawal in hospitalized individuals for whom a
diagnosis of alcohol use disorder has been overlooked can add to the
risks and costs of hospitalization and to time spent in the hospital.

Differential Diagnosis Nonpathological use of alcohol. The key element
of alcohol use disorder is the use of heavy doses of alcohol with
resulting repeated and significant distress or impaired functioning.
While most drinkers sometimes consume enough alcohol to feel
intoxicated, only a minority (less than 20%) ever develop alcohol use
disorder. Therefore, drinking, even daily, in low doses and occasional
intoxication do not by themselves make this diagnosis. Sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. The signs and symptoms of alcohol
use disorder are similar to those seen in sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder. The two must be distinguished, however, because
the course may be different, especially in relation to medical problems.
Conduct disorder in childhood and adult antisocial personality disorder.
Alcohol use disorder, along with other substance use disorders, is seen
in the majority of individuals with antisocial personality and
preexisting conduct disorder. Because these diagnoses are associated
with an early onset of alcohol use disorder as well as a worse
prognosis, it is important to establish both conditions.

Comorbidity Bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, and antisocial personality
disorder are associated with a markedly increased rate of alcohol use
disorder, and several anxiety and depressive disorders may relate to
alcohol use disorder as well. At least a part of the reported
association between depression and moderate to severe alcohol use
disorder may be attributable to temporary, alcohol-induced comorbid
depressive symptoms resulting from the acute effects of intoxication or
withdrawal17. Severe, repeated alcohol intoxication may also suppress
immune mechanisms and predispose individuals to infections and increase
the risk for cancers.

Alcohol Intoxication Diagnostic Criteria a. Recent ingestion of alcohol.
b. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological
changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood
lability, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after,
alcohol ingestion. c. One (or more) of the following signs or symptoms
developing during, or shortly after, alcohol use: 1. Slurred speech. 2.
Incoordination. 3. Unsteady gait. 4. Nystagmus. 5. Impairment in
attention or memory. 6. Stupor or coma. d. The signs or symptoms are not
attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained
by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another
substance. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 303.00. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid alcohol use disorder. If a mild
alcohol use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F10.129, and if
a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM
code is F10.229. If there is no comorbid alcohol use disorder, then the
ICD-10-CM code is F10.929.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of alcohol intoxication is the
presence of clinically significant problematic behavioral or
psychological changes (e.g., inappropriate sexual or aggressive
behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment, impaired social or
occupational functioning) that develop during, or shortly after, alcohol
ingestion (Criterion B). These changes are accompanied by evidence of
impaired functioning and judgment and, if intoxication is intense, can
result in a life-threatening coma. The symptoms must not be attributable
to another medical condition (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis), are not a
reflection of conditions such as delirium, and are not related to
intoxication with other depressant drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines)
(Criterion D). The levels of incoordination can interfere with driving
abilities and performance of usual activities to the point of causing
accidents. Evidence of alcohol use can be obtained by smelling alcohol
on the individual's breath, eliciting a history from the individual or
another observer, and, when needed, having the individual provide
breath, blood, or urine samples for toxicology analyses.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Alcohol intoxication is
sometimes associated with amnesia for the events that occurred during
the course of the intoxication ("blackouts")3. This phenomenon may be
related to the presence of a high blood alcohol level and, perhaps, to
the rapidity with which this level is reached. During even mild alcohol
intoxication, different symptoms are likely to be observed at different
time points. Evidence of mild intoxication with alcohol can be seen in
most individuals after approximately two drinks (each standard drink is
approximately 10--12 grams of ethanol and raises the blood alcohol
concentration approximately 20 mg/dL). Early in the drinking period,
when blood alcohol levels are rising, symptoms often include
talkativeness, a sensation of well-being, and a bright, expansive mood.
Later, especially when blood alcohol levels are falling, the individual
is likely to become progressively more depressed, withdrawn, and
cognitively impaired. At very high blood alcohol levels (e.g., 200--300
mg/dL), an individual who has not developed tolerance for alcohol is
likely to fall asleep and enter a first stage of anesthesia. Higher
blood alcohol levels (e.g., in excess of 300--400 mg/dL) can cause
inhibition of respiration and pulse and even death in nontolerant
individuals. The duration of intoxication depends on how much alcohol
was consumed over what period of time. In general, the body is able to
metabolize approximately one drink per hour, so that the blood alcohol
level generally decreases at a rate of 15--20 mg/dL per hour. Signs and
symptoms of intoxication are likely to be more intense when the blood
alcohol level is rising than when it is falling.

Alcohol intoxication is an important contributor to suicidal behavior.
There appears to be an increased rate of suicidal behavior, as well as
of completed suicide, among persons intoxicated by alcohol.

Prevalence The large majority of alcohol consumers are likely to have
been intoxicated to some degree at some point in their lives. For
example, in 2010, 44% of 12th-grade students admitted to having been
"drunk in the past year," with more than 70% of college students
reporting the same2.

Development and Course Intoxication usually occurs as an episode usually
developing over minutes to hours and typically lasting several hours. In
the United States, the average age at first intoxication is
approximately 15 years, with the highest prevalence at approximately
18--25 years. Frequency and intensity usually decrease with further
advancing age. The earlier the onset of regular intoxication, the
greater the likelihood the individual will go on to develop alcohol use
disorder1.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Episodes of alcohol
intoxication increase with personality characteristics of sensation
seeking and impulsivity. Environmental. Episodes of alcohol intoxication
increase with a heavy drinking environment.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The major issues parallel the cultural
differences regarding the use of alcohol overall. Thus, college
fraternities and sororities may encourage alcohol intoxication. This
condition is also frequent on certain dates of cultural significance
(e.g., New Year's Eve) and, for some subgroups, during specific events
(e.g., wakes following funerals). Other subgroups encourage drinking at
religious celebrations (e.g., Jewish and Catholic holidays), while still
others strongly discourage all drinking or intoxication (e.g., some
religious groups, such as Mormons, fundamentalist Christians, and
Muslims).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Historically, in many Western
societies, acceptance of drinking and drunkenness is more tolerated for
males, but such gender differences may be much less prominent in recent
years, especially during adolescence and young adulthood.

Diagnostic Markers Intoxication is usually established by observing an
individual's behavior and smelling alcohol on the breath. The degree of
intoxication increases with an individual's blood or breath alcohol
level and with the ingestion of other substances, especially those with
sedating effects.

Functional Consequences of Alcohol Intoxication Alcohol intoxication
contributes to the more than 30,000 alcohol-related drinking deaths in
the United States each year. In addition, intoxication with this drug
contributes to huge costs associated with drunk driving, lost time from
school or work, as well as interpersonal arguments and physical fights.

Differential Diagnosis Other medical conditions. Several medical (e.g.,
diabetic acidosis) and neurological conditions (e.g., cerebellar ataxia,
multiple sclerosis) can temporarily resemble alcohol intoxication.
Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication. Intoxication with
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs or with other sedating
substances (e.g., antihistamines, anticholinergic drugs) can be mistaken
for alcohol intoxication. The differential requires observing alcohol on
the breath, measuring blood or breath alcohol levels, ordering a medical
workup, and gathering a good history. The signs and symptoms of
sedative-hypnotic intoxication are very similar to those observed with
alcohol and include similar problematic behavioral or psychological
changes. These changes are accompanied by evidence of impaired
functioning and judgment---which, if intense, can result in a
life-threatening coma---and levels of incoordination that can interfere
with driving abilities and with performing

usual activities. However, there is no smell as there is with alcohol,
but there is likely to be evidence of misuse of the depressant drug in
the blood or urine toxicology analyses.

Comorbidity Alcohol intoxication may occur comorbidly with other
substance intoxication, especially in individuals with conduct disorder
or antisocial personality disorder.

Alcohol Withdrawal Diagnostic Criteria a. Cessation of (or reduction in)
alcohol use that has been heavy and prolonged. b. Two (or more) of the
following, developing within several hours to a few days after the
cessation of (or reduction in) alcohol use described in Criterion A: 1.
Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating or pulse rate greater than 100
bpm). 2. Increased hand tremor. 3. Insomnia. 4. Nausea or vomiting. 5.
Transient visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions. 6.
Psychomotor agitation. 7. Anxiety. 8. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
c. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning. d. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another
medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.
Specify if: With perceptual disturbances: This specifier applies in the
rare instance when hallucinations (usually visual or tactile) occur with
intact reality testing, or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur
in the absence of a delirium. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 291.81.
The ICD-10-CM code for alcohol withdrawal without perceptual
disturbances is F10.239, and the ICD-10-CM code for alcohol withdrawal
with perceptual disturbances is F10.232. Note that the ICD-10-CM code
indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe alcohol use
disorder, reflecting the fact that alcohol withdrawal can only occur in
the presence of a moderate or severe alcohol use disorder. It is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild alcohol use disorder with alcohol
withdrawal.

Specifiers When hallucinations occur in the absence of delirium (i.e.,
in a clear sensorium), a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced
psychotic disorder should be considered.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of alcohol withdrawal is the presence of a
characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops within several hours to
a few days after the cessation of (or reduction in) heavy and prolonged
alcohol use (Criteria A and B)1. The withdrawal syndrome includes two or
more of the symptoms reflecting autonomic hyperactivity and anxiety
listed in Criterion B, along with gastrointestinal symptoms2. Withdrawal
symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The
symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., generalized
anxiety disorder), including intoxication or withdrawal from another
substance (e.g., sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal)
(Criterion D). Symptoms can be relieved by administering alcohol or
benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam). The withdrawal symptoms typically
begin when blood concentrations of alcohol decline sharply (i.e., within
4--12 hours) after alcohol use has been stopped or reduced. Reflecting
the relatively fast metabolism of alcohol, symptoms of alcohol
withdrawal usually peak in intensity during the second day of abstinence
and are likely to improve markedly by the fourth or fifth day. Following
acute withdrawal, however, symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, and autonomic
dysfunction may persist for up to 3--6 months at lower levels of
intensity. Fewer than 10% of individuals who develop alcohol withdrawal
will ever develop dramatic symptoms (e.g., severe autonomic
hyperactivity, tremors, alcohol withdrawal delirium). Tonic-clonic
seizures occur in fewer than 3% of individuals.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Although confusion and changes
in consciousness are not core criteria for alcohol withdrawal, alcohol
withdrawal delirium (see "Delirium" in the chapter "Neurocognitive
Disorders") may occur in the context of withdrawal. As is true for any
agitated, confused state, regardless of the cause, in addition to a
disturbance of consciousness and cognition, withdrawal delirium can
include visual, tactile, or (rarely) auditory hallucinations (delirium
tremens). When alcohol withdrawal delirium develops, it is likely that a
clinically relevant medical condition may be present (e.g., liver
failure, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, sequelae of head trauma,
hypoglycemia, an electrolyte imbalance, postoperative status).

Prevalence It is estimated that approximately 50% of middle-class,
highly functional individuals with alcohol use disorder have ever
experienced a full alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Among individuals with
alcohol use disorder who are hospitalized or homeless, the rate of
alcohol withdrawal may be greater than 80%. Less than 10% of individuals
in withdrawal ever demonstrate alcohol withdrawal delirium or withdrawal
seizures.

Development and Course Acute alcohol withdrawal occurs as an episode
usually lasting 4--5 days and only after extended periods of heavy
drinking. Withdrawal is relatively rare in individuals younger than 30
years, and the risk and severity increase with increasing age.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. The probability of developing
alcohol withdrawal increases with the quantity and frequency of alcohol
consumption. Most individuals with this condition are drinking daily,
consuming large amounts (approximately more than eight drinks per day)
for multiple days. However, there are large inter-individual
differences, with enhanced risks for individuals with concurrent medical
conditions, those with family histories of alcohol withdrawal (i.e., a
genetic component), those with prior withdrawals, and individuals who
consume sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs.

Diagnostic Markers Autonomic hyperactivity in the context of moderately
high but falling blood alcohol levels and a history of prolonged heavy
drinking indicate a likelihood of alcohol withdrawal.

Functional Consequences of Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms of withdrawal may
serve to perpetuate drinking behaviors and contribute to relapse,
resulting in persistently impaired social and occupational functioning.
Symptoms requiring medically supervised detoxification

result in hospital utilization and loss of work productivity. Overall,
the presence of withdrawal is associated with greater functional
impairment and poor prognosis.

Differential Diagnosis Other medical conditions. The symptoms of alcohol
withdrawal can also be mimicked by some medical conditions (e.g.,
hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis). Essential tremor, a disorder
that frequently runs in families, may erroneously suggest the
tremulousness associated with alcohol withdrawal. Sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal
produces a syndrome very similar to that of alcohol withdrawal.

Comorbidity Withdrawal is more likely to occur with heavier alcohol
intake, and that might be most often observed in individuals with
conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Withdrawal states
are also more severe in older individuals, individuals who are also
dependent on other depressant drugs (sedative-hypnotics), and
individuals who have had more alcohol withdrawal experiences in the
past.

Other Alcohol-Induced Disorders The following alcohol-induced disorders
are described in other chapters of the manual with disorders with which
they share phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced mental
disorders in these chapters): alcoholinduced psychotic disorder
("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders");
alcohol-induced bipolar disorder ("Bipolar and Related Disorders");
alcohol-induced depressive disorder ("Depressive Disorders");
alcohol-induced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety Disorders"); alcohol-induced
sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake Disorders"); alcohol-induced sexual
dysfunction ("Sexual Dysfunctions"); and alcohol-induced major or mild
neurocognitive disorder ("Neurocognitive Disorders"). For alcohol
intoxication delirium and alcohol withdrawal delirium, see the criteria
and discussion of delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders."
These alcoholinduced disorders are diagnosed instead of alcohol
intoxication or alcohol withdrawal only when the symptoms are
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

Features The symptom profiles for an alcohol-induced condition resemble
independent mental disorders as described elsewhere in DSM-52, 6.
However, the alcohol-induced disorder is temporary and observed after
severe intoxication with and/or withdrawal from alcohol. While the
symptoms can be identical to those of independent mental disorders
(e.g., psychoses, major depressive disorder), and while they can have
the same severe consequences (e.g., suicide attempts), alcohol-induced
conditions are likely to improve without formal treatment in a matter of
days to weeks after cessation of severe intoxication and/or withdrawal1,
4. Each alcohol-induced mental disorder is listed in the relevant
diagnostic section and therefore only a brief description is offered
here. Alcohol-induced disorders must have developed in the context of
severe intoxication and/or withdrawal from the substance capable of
producing the mental disorder. In addition, there must be evidence that
the disorder being observed is not likely to be better explained by
another non-alcohol-induced mental disorder. The latter is likely to
occur if the mental disorder was present before the severe intoxication
or withdrawal, or continued more than 1 month after the cessation of
severe intoxication and/or withdrawal2, 5. When symptoms are observed
only during a delirium, they should be considered part of the delirium
and not diagnosed separately, as many symptoms (including disturbances
in mood, anxiety, and reality testing) are commonly seen during
agitated, confused states. The alcohol-induced disorder must be
clinically relevant, causing significant levels of distress or
significant functional impairment. Finally, there are indications that
the intake of substances of abuse in the context of a preexisting mental
disorder are likely to result in an intensification of the preexisting
independent syndrome3, 7.

The features associated with each relevant major mental disorder (e.g.,
psychotic episodes, major depressive disorder) are similar whether
observed with an independent or an alcohol-induced condition. However,
individuals with alcohol-induced disorders are likely to also
demonstrate the associated features seen with an alcohol use disorder,
as listed in the subsections of this chapter. Rates of alcohol-induced
disorders vary somewhat by diagnostic category. For example, the
lifetime risk for major depressive episodes in individuals with alcohol
use disorder is approximately 40%, but only about one-third to one-half
of these represent independent major depressive syndromes observed
outside the context of intoxication. Similar rates of alcohol-induced
sleep and anxiety conditions are likely, but alcohol-induced psychotic
episodes are fairly rare.

Development and Course Once present, the symptoms of an alcohol-induced
condition are likely to remain clinically relevant as long as the
individual continues to experience severe intoxication and/or
withdrawal. While the symptoms are identical to those of independent
mental disorders (e.g., psychoses, major depressive disorder), and while
they can have the same severe consequences (e.g., suicide attempts), all
alcohol-induced syndromes other than alcohol-induced neurocognitive
disorder, amnestic confabulatory type (alcohol-induced persisting
amnestic disorder), regardless of the severity of the symptoms, are
likely to improve relatively quickly and unlikely to remain clinically
relevant for more than 1 month after cessation of severe intoxication
and/or withdrawal. The alcohol-induced disorders are an important part
of the differential diagnoses for the independent mental conditions.
Independent schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder,
and anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, are likely to be
associated with much longer-lasting periods of symptoms and often
require longerterm medications to optimize the probability of
improvement or recovery. The alcohol-induced conditions, on the other
hand, are likely to be much shorter in duration and disappear within
several days to 1 month after cessation of severe intoxication and/or
withdrawal, even without psychotropic medications. The importance of
recognizing an alcohol-induced disorder is similar to the relevance of
identifying the possible role of some endocrine conditions and
medication reactions before diagnosing an independent mental disorder.
In light of the high prevalence of alcohol use disorders worldwide, it
is important that these alcohol-induced diagnoses be considered before
independent mental disorders are diagnosed.

Unspecified Alcohol-Related Disorder 291.9 (F10.99) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an
alcohol-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning

predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific
alcohol-related disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

Caffeine-Related Disorders Caffeine Intoxication Caffeine Withdrawal
Other Caffeine-Induced Disorders Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorder

Caffeine Intoxication Diagnostic Criteria

305.90 (F15.929)

a.  Recent consumption of caffeine (typically a high dose well in excess
    of 250 mg).
b.  Five (or more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during,
    or shortly after, caffeine use:

<!-- -->

1.  Restlessness.
2.  Nervousness.
3.  Excitement.
4.  Insomnia.
5.  Flushed face.
6.  Diuresis.
7.  Gastrointestinal disturbance.
8.  Muscle twitching.
9.  Rambling flow of thought and speech.
10. Tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia.
11. Periods of inexhaustibility.
12. Psychomotor agitation.

<!-- -->

c.  The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
    distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
    areas of functioning.
d.  The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
    condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
    including intoxication with another substance.

Diagnostic Features Caffeine can be consumed from a number of different
sources, including coffee, tea, caffeinated soda, "energy" drinks,
over-the-counter analgesics and cold remedies, energy aids (e.g.,
drinks), weight-loss aids, and chocolate. Caffeine is also increasingly
being used as an additive to vitamins and to food products. More than
85% of children and adults consume caffeine regularly3, 7. Some caffeine
users display symptoms consistent with problematic use, including
tolerance and withdrawal (see "Caffeine Withdrawal" later in this
chapter); the data are not available at this time to determine the
clinical significance of a caffeine use disorder and its prevalence. In
contrast, there is evidence that caffeine withdrawal and caffeine
intoxication are clinically significant and sufficiently prevalent2. The
essential feature of caffeine intoxication is recent consumption of
caffeine and five or more signs or symptoms that develop during or
shortly after caffeine use (Criteria A and B). Symptoms include
restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, diuresis,
and gastrointestinal complaints, which can occur with low doses (e.g.,
200 mg) in vulnerable individuals such as children, the elderly, or
individuals who have not been exposed to caffeine previously. Symptoms
that generally appear at levels of more than 1 g/day include muscle

twitching, rambling flow of thought and speech, tachycardia or cardiac
arrhythmia, periods of inexhaustibility, and psychomotor agitation.
Caffeine intoxication may not occur despite high caffeine intake because
of the development of tolerance. The signs or symptoms must cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The signs or
symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., an anxiety
disorder) or intoxication with another substance (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Mild sensory disturbances
(e.g., ringing in the ears and flashes of light) may occur with high
doses of caffeine. Although large doses of caffeine can increase heart
rate, smaller doses can slow heart rate. Whether excess caffeine intake
can cause headaches is unclear. On physical examination, agitation,
restlessness, sweating, tachycardia, flushed face, and increased bowel
motility may be seen. Caffeine blood levels may provide important
information for diagnosis, particularly when the individual is a poor
historian, although these levels are not diagnostic by themselves in
view of the individual variation in response to caffeine.

Prevalence The prevalence of caffeine intoxication in the general
population is unclear. In the United States, approximately 7% of
individuals in the population may experience five or more symptoms along
with functional impairment consistent with a diagnosis of caffeine
intoxication1.

Development and Course Consistent with a half-life of caffeine of
approximately 4--6 hours, caffeine intoxication symptoms usually remit
within the first day or so and do not have any known long-lasting
consequences. However, individuals who consume very high doses of
caffeine (i.e., 5--10 g) may require immediate medical attention, as
such doses can be lethal5. With advancing age, individuals are likely to
demonstrate increasingly intense reactions to caffeine, with greater
complaints of interference with sleep or feelings of hyperarousal.
Caffeine intoxication among young individuals after consumption of
highly caffeinated products, including energy drinks, has been
observed6, 8. Children and adolescents may be at increased risk for
caffeine intoxication because of low body weight, lack of tolerance, and
lack of knowledge about the pharmacological effects of caffeine.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Caffeine intoxication is
often seen among individuals who use caffeine less frequently or in
those who have recently increased their caffeine intake by a substantial
amount. Furthermore, oral contraceptives significantly decrease the
elimination of caffeine and consequently may increase the risk of
intoxication. Genetic and physiological. Genetic factors may affect risk
of caffeine intoxication4.

Functional Consequences of Caffeine Intoxication Impairment from
caffeine intoxication may have serious consequences, including
dysfunction at work or school, social indiscretions, or failure to
fulfill role obligations. Moreover, extremely high doses of caffeine can
be fatal. In some cases, caffeine intoxication may precipitate a
caffeine-induced disorder.

Differential Diagnosis Other mental disorders. Caffeine intoxication may
be characterized by symptoms (e.g., panic attacks) that resemble primary
mental disorders. To meet criteria for caffeine intoxication, the
symptoms must not be associated with another medical condition or
another mental disorder, such as an anxiety disorder, that could better
explain them. Manic episodes; panic disorder; generalized anxiety
disorder; amphetamine intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal or tobacco withdrawal; sleep disorders; and
medication-induced side effects (e.g., akathisia) can cause a clinical
picture that is similar to that of caffeine intoxication. Other
caffeine-induced disorders. The temporal relationship of the symptoms to
increased caffeine use or to abstinence from caffeine helps to establish
the diagnosis. Caffeine intoxication is differentiated from
caffeineinduced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication (see
"Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder" in the chapter "Anxiety
Disorders"), and caffeine-induced sleep disorder, with onset during
intoxication (see

"Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder" in the chapter "Sleep-Wake
Disorders"), by the fact that the symptoms in these latter disorders are
in excess of those usually associated with caffeine intoxication and are
severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.

Comorbidity Typical dietary doses of caffeine have not been consistently
associated with medical problems. However, heavy use (e.g., \>400 mg)
can cause or exacerbate anxiety and somatic symptoms and
gastrointestinal distress3. With acute, extremely high doses of
caffeine, grand mal seizures and respiratory failure may result in
death. Excessive caffeine use is associated with depressive disorders,
bipolar disorders, eating disorders, psychotic disorders, sleep
disorders, and substance-related disorders, whereas individuals with
anxiety disorders are more likely to avoid caffeine3.

Caffeine Withdrawal Diagnostic Criteria

292.0 (F15.93)

a.  Prolonged daily use of caffeine.
b.  Abrupt cessation of or reduction in caffeine use, followed within 24
    hours by three (or more) of the following signs or symptoms:

<!-- -->

1.  Headache.
2.  Marked fatigue or drowsiness.
3.  Dysphoric mood, depressed mood, or irritability.
4.  Difficulty concentrating.
5.  Flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or muscle pain/stiffness).

<!-- -->

c.  The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
    distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
    areas of functioning.
d.  The signs or symptoms are not associated with the physiological
    effects of another medical condition (e.g., migraine, viral illness)
    and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including
    intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of caffeine withdrawal is the presence of a
characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the abrupt
cessation of (or substantial reduction in) prolonged daily caffeine
ingestion (Criterion B). The caffeine withdrawal syndrome is indicated
by three or more of the following (Criterion B): headache; marked
fatigue or drowsiness; dysphoric mood, depressed mood, or irritability;
difficulty concentrating; and flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, or
muscle pain/stiffness). The withdrawal syndrome causes clinical
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be
associated with the physiological effects of another medical condition
and are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D).
Headache is the hallmark feature of caffeine withdrawal and may be
diffuse, gradual in development, throbbing, severe, and sensitive to
movement5. However, other symptoms of caffeine withdrawal can occur in
the absence of headache6, 6. Caffeine is the most widely used
behaviorally active drug in the world and is present in many different
types of beverages (e.g., coffee, tea, maté, soft drinks, energy
drinks), foods, energy aids, medications, and dietary supplements4.
Because caffeine ingestion is often integrated into social customs and
daily rituals (e.g., coffee break, tea time), some caffeine consumers
may be unaware of their physical dependence on caffeine. Thus, caffeine
withdrawal symptoms could be unexpected and misattributed to other
causes (e.g., the flu, migraine). Furthermore, caffeine withdrawal
symptoms may occur when individuals are required to abstain from foods
and beverages prior to medical procedures or when a usual caffeine dose
is missed because of a change in routine (e.g., during travel,
weekends). The probability and severity of caffeine withdrawal generally
increase as a function of usual daily caffeine dose. However, there is
large variability among individuals and within individuals across
different episodes in the incidence, severity, and time course of
withdrawal symptoms2, 5. Caffeine withdrawal symptoms may occur after
abrupt cessation of relatively low chronic daily doses of caffeine
(i.e., 100 mg).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Caffeine abstinence has been
shown to be associated with impaired behavioral and cognitive
performance (e.g., sustained attention)5. Electroencephalographic
studies have shown that caffeine withdrawal symptoms are significantly
associated with increases in theta power and decreases in beta-2 power.
Decreased motivation to work and decreased sociability have also been
reported during caffeine withdrawal. Increased analgesic use during
caffeine withdrawal has been documented.

Prevalence More than 85% of adults and children in the United States
regularly consume caffeine, with adult caffeine consumers ingesting
about 280 mg/day on average. The incidence and prevalence of the
caffeine withdrawal syndrome in the general population are unclear. In
the United States, headache may occur in approximately 50% of cases of
caffeine abstinence5. In attempts to permanently stop caffeine use, more
than 70% of individuals may experience at least one caffeine withdrawal
symptom (47% may experience headache), and 24% may experience headache
plus one or more other symptoms as well as functional impairment due to
withdrawal3. Among individuals who abstain from caffeine for at least 24
hours but are not trying to permanently stop caffeine use, 11% may
experience headache plus one or more other symptoms as well as
functional impairment3. Caffeine consumers can decrease the incidence of
caffeine withdrawal by using caffeine daily or only infrequently (e.g.,
no more than 2 consecutive days). Gradual reduction in caffeine over a
period of days or weeks may decrease the incidence and severity of
caffeine withdrawal.

Development and Course Symptoms usually begin 12--24 hours after the
last caffeine dose1 and peak after 1--2 days of abstinence. Caffeine
withdrawal symptoms last for 2--9 days, with the possibility of
withdrawal headaches occurring for up to 21 days. Symptoms usually remit
rapidly (within 30--60 minutes) after re-ingestion of caffeine. Caffeine
is unique in that it is a behaviorally active drug that is consumed by
individuals of nearly all ages. Rates of caffeine consumption and
overall level of caffeine consumption increase with age until the early
to mid-30s and then level off. Although caffeine withdrawal among
children and adolescents has been documented, relatively little is known
about risk factors for caffeine withdrawal among this age group. The use
of highly caffeinated energy drinks is increasing with in young
individuals, which could increase the risk for caffeine withdrawal.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental. Heavy caffeine use has been observed among individuals
with mental disorders, including eating disorders; smokers; prisoners;
and drug and alcohol abusers. Thus, these individuals could be at higher
risk for caffeine withdrawal upon acute caffeine abstinence.
Environmental. The unavailability of caffeine is an environmental risk
factor for incipient withdrawal symptoms. While caffeine is legal and
usually widely available, there are conditions in which caffeine use may
be restricted, such as during medical procedures, pregnancy,
hospitalizations, religious observances, wartime, travel, and research
participation. These external environmental circumstances may
precipitate a withdrawal syndrome in vulnerable individuals. Genetic and
physiological factors. Genetic factors appear to increase vulnerability
to caffeine withdrawal, but no specific genes have been identified7.
Course modifiers. Caffeine withdrawal symptoms usually remit within
30--60 minutes of reexposure to caffeine. Doses of caffeine
significantly less than one's usual daily dose may be sufficient to
prevent or attenuate caffeine withdrawal symptoms (e.g., consumption of
25 mg by an individual who typically consumes 300 mg).

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Habitual caffeine consumers who fast
for religious reasons may be at increased risk for caffeine withdrawal.

Functional Consequences of Caffeine Withdrawal Disorder Caffeine
withdrawal symptoms can vary from mild to extreme, at times causing
functional impairment in normal daily activities. Rates of functional
impairment range from 10% to 55% (median 13%)5, with rates as high as
73% found among individuals who also show other problematic features of
caffeine use9. Examples of functional impairment include being unable to
work, exercise, or care for children; staying in bed all day; missing
religious services; ending a vacation early; and cancelling a social
gathering9. Caffeine withdrawal headaches may be described by
individuals as "the worst headaches" ever experienced. Decrements in
cognitive and motor performance have also been observed.

Differential Diagnosis Other medical disorders and medical side effects.
Several disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
caffeine withdrawal. Caffeine withdrawal can mimic migraine and other
headache disorders, viral illnesses, sinus conditions, tension, other
drug withdrawal states (e.g., from amphetamines, cocaine), and
medication side effects. The final determination of caffeine withdrawal
should rest on a determination of the pattern and amount consumed, the
time interval between caffeine abstinence and onset of symptoms, and the
particular clinical features presented by the individual. A challenge
dose of caffeine followed by symptom remission may be used to confirm
the diagnosis.

Comorbidity Caffeine withdrawal may be associated with major depressive
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, antisocial
personality disorder in adults, moderate to severe alcohol use disorder,
and cannabis and cocaine use8.

Other Caffeine-Induced Disorders The following caffeine-induced
disorders are described in other chapters of the manual with disorders
with which they share phenomenology (see the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters):
caffeineinduced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety Disorders") and
caffeine-induced sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake Disorders"). These
caffeine-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of caffeine
intoxication or caffeine withdrawal only when the symptoms are
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorder 292.9 (F15.99) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
caffeine-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific caffeine-related disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

Cannabis-Related Disorders Cannabis Use Disorder Cannabis Intoxication
Cannabis Withdrawal Other Cannabis-Induced Disorders Unspecified
Cannabis-Related Disorder

Cannabis Use Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A problematic pattern of
cannabis use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress,
as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a
12-month period: 1. Cannabis is often taken in larger amounts or over a
longer period than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or
unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control cannabis use. 3. A great
deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain cannabis, use
cannabis, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong desire or
urge to use cannabis. 5. Recurrent cannabis use resulting in a failure
to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. 6. Continued
cannabis use despite having persistent or recurrent social or
interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of cannabis.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of cannabis use. 8. Recurrent cannabis use in
situations in which it is physically hazardous. 9. Cannabis use is
continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical
or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
exacerbated by cannabis.

10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of cannabis to achieve intoxication or
desired effect. b. Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the
same amount of cannabis. 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the
following: a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for cannabis (refer
to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for cannabis withdrawal,
pp. 517--518). b. Cannabis (or a closely related substance) is taken to
relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Specify if: In early remission:
After full criteria for cannabis use disorder were previously met, none
of the criteria for cannabis use disorder have been met for at least 3
months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion
A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use cannabis," may be met).
In sustained remission: After full criteria for cannabis use disorder
were previously met, none of the criteria for cannabis use disorder have
been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the
exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
cannabis," may be present). Specify if: In a controlled environment:
This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment
where access to cannabis is restricted. Code based on current severity:
Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a cannabis intoxication, cannabis
withdrawal, or another cannabis-induced mental disorder is also present,
do not use the codes below for cannabis use disorder. Instead, the
comorbid cannabis use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the
cannabis-induced disorder code (see the coding note for cannabis
intoxication, cannabis withdrawal, or a specific cannabisinduced mental
disorder). For example, if there is comorbid cannabis-induced anxiety
disorder and cannabis use disorder, only the cannabis-induced anxiety
disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the
comorbid cannabis use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F12.180 for
mild cannabis use disorder with cannabis-induced anxiety disorder or
F12.280 for a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder with
cannabisinduced anxiety disorder. Specify current severity: 305.20
(F12.10) Mild: Presence of 2--3 symptoms. 304.30 (F12.20) Moderate:
Presence of 4--5 symptoms. 304.30 (F12.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more
symptoms.

Specifiers "In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier
of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units. Changing severity
across time in an individual may also be reflected by changes in the
frequency (e.g., days of use per month or times used per day) and/or
dose (e.g., amount used per episode) of cannabis, as assessed by
individual self-report, report of knowledgeable others, clinician's
observations, and biological testing.

Diagnostic Features Cannabis use disorder and the other cannabis-related
disorders include problems that are associated with substances derived
from the cannabis plant and chemically similar synthetic compounds. Over
time, this plant material has accumulated many names (e.g., weed, pot,
herb, grass, reefer, mary jane, dagga, dope, bhang, skunk, boom,
gangster, kif, and ganja). A concentrated extraction of the cannabis
plant that is also commonly used is hashish. Cannabis is the generic and
perhaps the most appropriate scientific term for the psychoactive
substance(s) derived from the plant, and as such it is used in this
manual to refer to all forms of cannabis-like substances, including
synthetic cannabinoid compounds6, 20. Synthetic oral formulations
(pill/capsules) of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC) are
available by prescription for a number of approved medical indications
(e.g., for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy;

for anorexia and weight loss in individuals with AIDS). Other synthetic
cannabinoid compounds have been manufactured and distributed for
nonmedical use in the form of plant material that has been sprayed with
a cannabinoid formulation (e.g., K2, Spice, JWH-018, JWH-073)21. The
cannabinoids have diverse effects in the brain, prominent among which
are actions on CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors that are found
throughout the central nervous system23. Endogenous ligands for these
receptors behave essentially like neurotransmitters. The potency of
cannabis (delta-9-THC concentration) that is generally available varies
greatly, ranging from 1% to approximately 15% in typical cannabis plant
material and 10%--20% in hashish. During the past two decades, a steady
increase in the potency of seized cannabis has been observed19. Cannabis
is most commonly smoked via a variety of methods: pipes, water pipes
(bongs or hookahs), cigarettes (joints or reefers), or, most recently,
in the paper from hollowed out cigars (blunts). Cannabis is also
sometimes ingested orally, typically by mixing it into food. More
recently, devices have been developed in which cannabis is "vaporized."
Vaporization involves heating the plant material to release psychoactive
cannabinoids for inhalation. As with other psychoactive substances,
smoking (and vaporization) typically produces more rapid onset and more
intense experiences of the desired effects. Individuals who regularly
use cannabis can develop all the general diagnostic features of a
substance use disorder3. Cannabis use disorder is commonly observed as
the only substance use disorder experienced by the individual; however,
it also frequently occurs concurrently with other types of substance use
disorders (i.e., alcohol, cocaine, opioid)22. In cases for which
multiple types of substances are used, many times the individual may
minimize the symptoms related to cannabis, as the symptoms may be less
severe or cause less harm than those directly related to the use of the
other substances. Pharmacological and behavioral tolerance to most of
the effects of cannabis has been reported in individuals who use
cannabis persistently16. Generally, tolerance is lost when cannabis use
is discontinued for a significant period of time (i.e., for at least
several months). New to DSM-5 is the recognition that abrupt cessation
of daily or near-daily cannabis use often results in the onset of a
cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Common symptoms of withdrawal include
irritability, anger or aggression, anxiety, depressed mood,
restlessness, sleep difficulty, and decreased appetite or weight loss4,
15. Although typically not as severe as alcohol or opioid withdrawal,
the cannabis withdrawal syndrome can cause significant distress and
contribute to difficulty quitting or relapse among those trying to
abstain5. Individuals with cannabis use disorder may use cannabis
throughout the day over a period of months or years, and thus may spend
many hours a day under the influence20. Others may use less frequently,
but their use causes recurrent problems related to family, school, work,
or other important activities (e.g., repeated absences at work; neglect
of family obligations). Periodic cannabis use and intoxication can
negatively affect behavioral and cognitive functioning and thus
interfere with optimal performance at work or school, or place the
individual at increased physical risk when performing activities that
could be physically hazardous (e.g., driving a car; playing certain
sports; performing manual work activities, including operating
machinery). Arguments with spouses or parents over the use of cannabis
in the home, or its use in the presence of children, can adversely
impact family functioning and are common features of those with cannabis
use disorder. Last, individuals with cannabis use disorder may continue
using despite knowledge of physical problems (e.g., chronic cough
related to smoking) or psychological problems (e.g., excessive sedation
or exacerbation of other mental health problems) associated with its
use. Whether or not cannabis is being used for legitimate medical
reasons may also affect diagnosis. When a substance is taken as
indicated for a medical condition, symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal
will naturally occur and should not be used as the primary criteria for
determining a diagnosis of a substance use disorder. Although medical
uses of cannabis remain controversial and equivocal, use for medical
circumstances should be considered when a diagnosis is being made.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals who regularly use
cannabis often report that it is being used to cope with mood, sleep,
pain, or other physiological or psychological problems, and those
diagnosed with cannabis use disorder frequently do have concurrent other
mental disorders22. Careful assessment typically reveals reports of
cannabis use contributing to exacerbation of these same symptoms, as
well as other reasons for frequent use (e.g., to experience euphoria, to
forget about problems, in response to anger, as an enjoyable social
activity). Related to this issue, some individuals who use cannabis
multiple times per day for the aforementioned reasons do not perceive
themselves as (and thus do not report) spending an excessive amount of
time under the influence or recovering from the effects of

cannabis, despite being intoxicated on cannabis or coming down from it
effects for the majority of most days. An important marker of a
substance use disorder diagnosis, particularly in milder cases, is
continued use despite a clear risk of negative consequences to other
valued activities or relationships (e.g., school, work, sport activity,
partner or parent relationship). Because some cannabis users are
motivated to minimize their amount or frequency of use, it is important
to be aware of common signs and symptoms of cannabis use and
intoxication so as to better assess the extent of use. As with other
substances, experienced users of cannabis develop behavioral and
pharmacological tolerance such that it can be difficult to detect when
they are under the influence. Signs of acute and chronic use include red
eyes (conjunctival injection), cannabis odor on clothing, yellowing of
finger tips (from smoking joints), chronic cough, burning of incense (to
hide the odor), and exaggerated craving and impulse for specific foods,
sometimes at unusual times of the day or night.

Prevalence Cannabinoids, especially cannabis, are the most widely used
illicit psychoactive substances in the United States. The 12-month
prevalence of cannabis use disorder (DSM-IV abuse and dependence rates
combined) is approximately 3.4% among 12- to 17-year-olds and 1.5% among
adults age 18 years and older22. Rates of cannabis use disorder are
greater among adult males (2.2%) than among adult females (0.8%) and
among 12- to 17-year-old males (3.8%) than among 12- to 17-year-old
females (3.0%). Twelve-month prevalence rates of cannabis use disorder
among adults decrease with age, with rates highest among 18- to
29-year-olds (4.4%) and lowest among individuals age 65 years and older
(0.01%). The high prevalence of cannabis use disorder likely reflects
the much more widespread use of cannabis relative to other illicit drugs
rather than greater addictive potential. Ethnic and racial differences
in prevalence are moderate. Twelve-month prevalences of cannabis use
disorder vary markedly across racial-ethnic subgroups in the United
States. For 12- to 17-year-olds, rates are highest among Native American
and Alaska Natives (7.1%) compared with Hispanics (4.1%), whites (3.4%),
African Americans (2.7%), and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
(0.9%). Among adults, the prevalence of cannabis use disorder is also
highest among Native Americans and Alaska Natives (3.4%) relative to
rates among African Americans (1.8%), whites (1.4%), Hispanics (1.2%),
and Asian and Pacific Islanders (1.2%). During the past decade the
prevalence of cannabis use disorder has increased among adults and
adolescents. Gender differences in cannabis use disorder generally are
concordant with those in other substance use disorders. Cannabis use
disorder is more commonly observed in males, although the magnitude of
this difference is less among adolescents.

Development and Course The onset of cannabis use disorder can occur at
any time during or following adolescence, but onset is most commonly
during adolescence or young adulthood2, 7. Although much less frequent,
onset of cannabis use disorder in the preteen years or in the late 20s
or older can occur. Recent acceptance by some of the use and
availability of "medical marijuana" may increase the rate of onset of
cannabis use disorder among older adults. Generally, cannabis use
disorder develops over an extended period of time, although the
progression appears to be more rapid in adolescents, particularly those
with pervasive conduct problems7, 22. Most people who develop a cannabis
use disorder typically establish a pattern of cannabis use that
gradually increases in both frequency and amount. Cannabis, along with
tobacco and alcohol, is traditionally the first substance that
adolescents try. Many perceive cannabis use as less harmful than alcohol
or tobacco use, and this perception likely contributes to increased use.
Moreover, cannabis intoxication does not typically result in as severe
behavioral and cognitive dysfunction as does significant alcohol
intoxication, which may increase the probability of more frequent use in
more diverse situations than with alcohol. These factors likely
contribute to the potential rapid transition from cannabis use to a
cannabis use disorder among some adolescents and the common pattern of
using throughout the day that is commonly observed among those with more
severe cannabis use disorder. Cannabis use disorder among preteens,
adolescents, and young adults is typically expressed as excessive use
with peers that is a component of a pattern of other delinquent
behaviors usually associated with conduct problems. Milder cases
primarily reflect continued use despite clear problems related to
disapproval of use by other peers, school administration, or family,
which also places the youth at risk for physical or behavioral
consequences. In more severe cases, there is a progression to using
alone or using throughout the day such that use interferes with daily
functioning and takes the place of previously established, prosocial
activities. With adolescent users, changes in mood stability, energy
level, and eating patterns are commonly observed. These signs and
symptoms are likely due to the direct effects of cannabis use
(intoxication) and the subsequent

effects following acute intoxication (coming down), as well as attempts
to conceal use from others. School-related problems are commonly
associated with cannabis use disorder in adolescents, particularly a
dramatic drop in grades, truancy, and reduced interest in general school
activities and outcomes18. Cannabis use disorder among adults typically
involves well-established patterns of daily cannabis use that continue
despite clear psychosocial or medical problems. Many adults have
experienced repeated desire to stop or have failed at repeated cessation
attempts. Milder adult cases may resemble the more common adolescent
cases in that cannabis use is not as frequent or heavy but continues
despite potential significant consequences of sustained use. The rate of
use among middle-age and older adults appears to be increasing, likely
because of a cohort effect resulting from high prevalence of use in the
late 1960s and the 1970s. Early onset of cannabis use (e.g., prior to
age 15 years) is a robust predictor of the development of cannabis use
disorder and other types of substance use disorders and mental disorders
during young adulthood11, 18. Such early onset is likely related to
concurrent other externalizing problems, most notably conduct disorder
symptoms. However, early onset is also a predictor of internalizing
problems and as such probably reflects a general risk factor for the
development of mental health disorders8.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. A history of conduct disorder
in childhood or adolescence and antisocial personality disorder are risk
factors for the development of many substance-related disorders,
including cannabis-related disorders. Other risk factors include
externalizing or internalizing disorders during childhood or
adolescence. Youths with high behavioral disinhibition scores show
early-onset substance use disorders, including cannabis use disorder,
multiple substance involvement, and early conduct problems14.
Environmental. Risk factors include academic failure, tobacco smoking,
unstable or abusive family situation, use of cannabis among immediate
family members, a family history of a substance use disorder, and low
socioeconomic status. As with all substances of abuse, the ease of
availability of the substance is a risk factor; cannabis is relatively
easy to obtain in most cultures, which increases the risk of developing
a cannabis use disorder. Genetic and physiological. Genetic influences
contribute to the development of cannabis use disorders1. Heritable
factors contribute between 30% and 80% of the total variance in risk of
cannabis use disorders. It should be noted that common genetic and
shared environmental influences between cannabis and other types of
substance use disorders suggest a common genetic basis for adolescent
substance use and conduct problems.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Cannabis is probably the world's most
commonly used illicit substance9. Occurrence of cannabis use disorder
across countries is unknown, but the prevalence rates are likely similar
among developed countries13. It is frequently among the first drugs of
experimentation (often in the teens) of all cultural groups in the
United States10. Acceptance of cannabis for medical purposes varies
widely across and within cultures. Cultural factors (acceptability and
legal status) that might impact diagnosis relate to differential
consequences across cultures for detection of use (i.e., arrest, school
suspensions, or employment suspension). The general change in substance
use disorder diagnostic criteria from DSM-IV to DSM-5 (i.e., removal of
the recurrent substance-related legal problems criterion) mitigates this
concern to some degree.

Diagnostic Markers Biological tests for cannabinoid metabolites are
useful for determining if an individual has recently used cannabis. Such
testing is helpful in making a diagnosis, particularly in milder cases
if an individual denies using while others (family, work, school)
purport concern about a substance use problem. Because cannabinoids are
fat soluble, they persist in bodily fluids for extended periods of time
and are excreted slowly. Expertise in urine testing methods is needed to
reliably interpret results.

Functional Consequences of Cannabis Use Disorder Functional consequences
of cannabis use disorder are part of the diagnostic criteria. Many areas
of psychosocial, cognitive, and health functioning may be compromised in
relation to cannabis use disorder6. Cognitive function, particularly
higher executive function, appears to be compromised in cannabis users,
and this relationship appears

to be dose dependent (both acutely and chronically)12, 25. This may
contribute to increased difficulty at school or work. Cannabis use has
been related to a reduction in prosocial goal-directed activity, which
some have labeled an amotivational syndrome, that manifests itself in
poor school performance and employment problems. These problems may be
related to pervasive intoxication or recovery from the effects of
intoxication. Similarly, cannabisassociated problems with social
relationships are commonly reported in those with cannabis use disorder.
Accidents due to engagement in potentially dangerous behaviors while
under the influence (e.g., driving, sport, recreational or employment
activities) are also of concern. Cannabis smoke contains high levels of
carcinogenic compounds that place chronic users at risk for respiratory
illnesses similar to those experienced by tobacco smokers. Chronic
cannabis use may contribute to the onset or exacerbation of many other
mental disorders. In particular, concern has been raised about cannabis
use as a causal factor in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
Cannabis use can contribute to the onset of an acute psychotic episode,
can exacerbate some symptoms, and can adversely affect treatment of a
major psychotic illness.

Differential Diagnosis Nonproblematic use of cannabis. The distinction
between nonproblematic use of cannabis and cannabis use disorder can be
difficult to make because social, behavioral, or psychological problems
may be difficult to attribute to the substance, especially in the
context of use of other substances. Also, denial of heavy cannabis use
and the attribution that cannabis is related to or causing substantial
problems are common among individuals who are referred to treatment by
others (i.e., school, family, employer, criminal justice system). Other
mental disorders. Cannabis-induced disorder may be characterized by
symptoms (e.g., anxiety) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g.,
generalized anxiety disorder vs. cannabis-induced anxiety disorder, with
generalized anxiety, with onset during intoxication). Chronic intake of
cannabis can produce a lack of motivation that resembles persistent
depressive disorder (dysthymia). Acute adverse reactions to cannabis
should be differentiated from the symptoms of panic disorder, major
depressive disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, or
schizophrenia, paranoid type. Physical examination will usually show an
increased pulse and conjunctival injection. Urine toxicological testing
can be helpful in making a diagnosis.

Comorbidity Cannabis has been commonly thought of as a "gateway" drug
because individuals who frequently use cannabis have a much greater
lifetime probability than nonusers of using what are commonly considered
more dangerous substances, like opioids or cocaine10. Cannabis use and
cannabis use disorder are highly comorbid with other substance use
disorders22. Co-occurring mental conditions are common in cannabis use
disorder6. Cannabis use has been associated with poorer life
satisfaction; increased mental health treatment and hospitalization; and
higher rates of depression, anxiety disorders, suicide attempts, and
conduct disorder. Individuals with past-year or lifetime cannabis use
disorder have high rates of alcohol use disorder (greater than 50%) and
tobacco use disorder (53%). Rates of other substance use disorders are
also likely to be high among individuals with cannabis use disorder.
Among those seeking treatment for a cannabis use disorder, 74% report
problematic use of a secondary or tertiary substance: alcohol (40%),
cocaine (12%), methamphetamine (6%), and heroin or other opiates (2%).
Among those younger than 18 years, 61% reported problematic use of a
secondary substance: alcohol (48%), cocaine (4%), methamphetamine (2%),
and heroin or other opiates (2%). Cannabis use disorder is also often
observed as a secondary problem among those with a primary diagnosis of
other substance use disorders, with approximately 25%--80% of those in
treatment for another substance use disorder reporting use of cannabis.
Individuals with past-year or lifetime diagnoses of cannabis use
disorder also have high rates of concurrent mental disorders other than
substance use disorders6. Major depressive disorder (11%), any anxiety
disorder (24%), and bipolar I disorder (13%) are quite common among
individuals with a past-year diagnosis of a cannabis use disorder, as
are antisocial (30%), obsessive-compulsive, (19%), and paranoid (18%)
personality disorders. Approximately 33% of adolescents with cannabis
use disorder have internalizing disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression,
posttraumatic stress disorder), and 60% have externalizing disorders
(e.g., conduct disorder, attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder).
Although cannabis use can impact multiple aspects of normal human
functioning, including the cardiovascular, immune, neuromuscular,
ocular, reproductive, and respiratory systems, as well as appetite and
cognition/perception, there are few clear medical conditions that
commonly co-occur with cannabis use disorder. The most significant
health effects of cannabis involve the respiratory system, and chronic
cannabis smokers exhibit high rates of respiratory symptoms of
bronchitis, sputum production, shortness of breath, and wheezing24.

Cannabis Intoxication Diagnostic Criteria a. Recent use of cannabis. b.
Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes
(e.g., impaired motor coordination, euphoria, anxiety, sensation of
slowed time, impaired judgment, social withdrawal) that developed
during, or shortly after, cannabis use. c. Two (or more) of the
following signs or symptoms developing within 2 hours of cannabis
use: 1. Conjunctival injection. 2. Increased appetite. 3. Dry mouth. 4.
Tachycardia. d. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another
medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder, including intoxication with another substance. Specify if:
With perceptual disturbances: Hallucinations with intact reality testing
or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a
delirium. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether or not there is a comorbid cannabis use disorder and
whether or not there are perceptual disturbances. For cannabis
intoxication, without perceptual disturbances: If a mild cannabis use
disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.129, and if a moderate
or severe cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10CM code is
F12.229. If there is no comorbid cannabis use disorder, then the
ICD-10-CM code is F12.929. For cannabis intoxication, with perceptual
disturbances: If a mild cannabis use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM
code is F12.122, and if a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F12.222. If there is no comorbid
cannabis use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F12.922.

Specifiers When hallucinations occur in the absence of intact reality
testing, a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder
should be considered.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of cannabis intoxication is
the presence of clinically significant problematic behavioral or
psychological changes that develop during, or shortly after, cannabis
use (Criterion B)1. Intoxication typically begins with a "high" feeling
followed by symptoms that include euphoria with inappropriate laughter
and grandiosity, sedation, lethargy, impairment in short-term memory,
difficulty carrying out complex mental processes, impaired judgment,
distorted sensory perceptions, impaired motor performance, and the
sensation that time is passing slowly. Occasionally, anxiety (which can
be severe), dysphoria, or social withdrawal occurs. These psychoactive
effects are accompanied by two or more of the following signs,
developing within 2 hours of cannabis use: conjunctival injection,
increased appetite, dry mouth, and tachycardia (Criterion C).
Intoxication develops within minutes if the cannabis is smoked but may
take a few hours to develop if the cannabis is ingested orally. The
effects usually last 3--4 hours, with the duration being somewhat longer
when the substance is ingested orally. The magnitude of the behavioral
and physiological changes depends on the dose, the method of
administration, and the characteristics of the individual using the
substance, such as rate of absorption, tolerance, and sensitivity to the
effects of the substance. Because most cannabinoids, including delta-9-

tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), are fat soluble, the effects of
cannabis or hashish may occasionally persist or reoccur for 12--24 hours
because of the slow release of psychoactive substances from fatty tissue
or to enterohepatic circulation.

Prevalence The prevalence of actual episodes of cannabis intoxication in
the general population is unknown. However, it is probable that most
cannabis users would at some time meet criteria for cannabis
intoxication. Given this, the prevalence of cannabis users and the
prevalence of individuals experiencing cannabis intoxication are likely
similar.

Functional Consequences of Cannabis Intoxication Impairment from
cannabis intoxication may have serious consequences, including
dysfunction at work or school, social indiscretions, failure to fulfill
role obligations, traffic accidents, and having unprotected sex. In rare
cases, cannabis intoxication may precipitate a psychosis that may vary
in duration.

Differential Diagnosis Note that if the clinical presentation includes
hallucinations in the absence of intact reality testing, a diagnosis of
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder should be considered.
Other substance intoxication. Cannabis intoxication may resemble
intoxication with other types of substances. However, in contrast to
cannabis intoxication, alcohol intoxication and sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic intoxication frequently decrease appetite, increase
aggressive behavior, and produce nystagmus or ataxia. Hallucinogens in
low doses may cause a clinical picture that resembles cannabis
intoxication. Phencyclidine, like cannabis, can be smoked and also
causes perceptual changes, but phencyclidine intoxication is much more
likely to cause ataxia and aggressive behavior. Other cannabis-induced
disorders. Cannabis intoxication is distinguished from the other
cannabis-induced disorders (e.g., cannabis-induced anxiety disorder,
with onset during intoxication) because the symptoms in these latter
disorders predominate the clinical presentation and are severe enough to
warrant independent clinical attention.

Cannabis Withdrawal Diagnostic Criteria

292.0 (F12.288)

a.  Cessation of cannabis use that has been heavy and prolonged (i.e.,
    usually daily or almost daily use over a period of at least a few
    months).
b.  Three (or more) of the following signs and symptoms develop within
    approximately 1 week after Criterion A:

<!-- -->

1.  Irritability, anger, or aggression.
2.  Nervousness or anxiety.
3.  Sleep difficulty (e.g., insomnia, disturbing dreams).
4.  Decreased appetite or weight loss.
5.  Restlessness.
6.  Depressed mood.
7.  At least one of the following physical symptoms causing significant
    discomfort: abdominal pain, shakiness/tremors, sweating, fever,
    chills, or headache.

<!-- -->

c.  The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
    distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
    areas of functioning.

d. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. Coding
note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for cannabis
withdrawal is F12.288. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the
comorbid presence of a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder,
reflecting the fact that cannabis withdrawal can only occur in the
presence of a moderate or severe cannabis use disorder. It is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild cannabis use disorder with cannabis
withdrawal.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of cannabis withdrawal is the
presence of a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the
cessation of or substantial reduction in heavy and prolonged cannabis
use. In addition to the symptoms in Criterion B, the following may also
be observed postabstinence: fatigue, yawning, difficulty concentrating,
and rebound periods of increased appetite and hypersomnia that follow
initial periods of loss of appetite and insomnia4, 10. For the
diagnosis, withdrawal symptoms must cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning (Criterion C). Many cannabis users report smoking
cannabis or taking other substances to help relieve withdrawal symptoms,
and many report that withdrawal symptoms make quitting difficult or have
contributed to relapse5, 7. The symptoms typically are not of sufficient
severity to require medical attention, but medication or behavioral
strategies may help alleviate symptoms and improve prognosis in those
trying to quit using cannabis. Cannabis withdrawal is commonly observed
in individuals seeking treatment for cannabis use as well as in heavy
cannabis users who are not seeking treatment. Among individuals who have
used cannabis regularly during some period of their lifetime, up to
one-third report having experienced cannabis withdrawal1, 3, 9. Among
adults and adolescents enrolled in treatment or heavy cannabis users,
50%--95% report cannabis withdrawal3, 6, 7, 8, 10. These findings
indicate that cannabis withdrawal occurs among a substantial subset of
regular cannabis users who try to quit.

Development and Course The amount, duration, and frequency of cannabis
smoking that is required to produce an associated withdrawal disorder
during a quit attempt are unknown. Most symptoms have their onset within
the first 24--72 hours of cessation, peak within the first week, and
last approximately 1--2 weeks. Sleep difficulties may last more than 30
days. Cannabis withdrawal has been documented among adolescents and
adults. Withdrawal tends to be more common and severe among adults, most
likely related to the more persistent and greater frequency and quantity
of use among adults.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Most likely, the prevalence
and severity of cannabis withdrawal are greater among heavier cannabis
users, and particularly among those seeking treatment for cannabis use
disorders3. Withdrawal severity also appears to be positively related to
the severity of comorbid symptoms of mental disorders.

Functional Consequences of Cannabis Withdrawal Cannabis users report
using cannabis to relieve withdrawal symptoms, suggesting that
withdrawal might contribute to ongoing expression of cannabis use
disorder. Worse outcomes may be associated with greater withdrawal6, 8.
A substantial proportion of adults and adolescents in treatment for
moderate to severe cannabis use disorder acknowledge moderate to severe
withdrawal symptoms, and many complain that these symptoms make
cessation more difficult. Cannabis users report having relapsed to
cannabis use or initiating use of other drugs (e.g., tranquilizers) to
provide relief from cannabis withdrawal symptoms. Last, individuals
living with cannabis users observe significant withdrawal effects,
suggesting that such symptoms are disruptive to daily living.

Differential Diagnosis Because many of the symptoms of cannabis
withdrawal are also symptoms of other substance withdrawal syndromes or
of depressive or bipolar disorders, careful evaluation should focus on
ensuring that the symptoms are not better explained by cessation from
another substance (e.g., tobacco or alcohol withdrawal), another mental
disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder), or
another medical condition.

Other Cannabis-Induced Disorders The following cannabis-induced
disorders are described in other chapters of the manual with disorders
with which they share phenomenology (see the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters):
cannabis-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other
Psychotic Disorders"); cannabis-induced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety
Disorders"); and cannabis-induced sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake
Disorders"). For cannabis intoxication delirium, see the criteria and
discussion of delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders." These
cannabis-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of cannabis
intoxication or cannabis withdrawal when the symptoms are sufficiently
severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder 292.9 (F12.99) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
cannabis-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific cannabisrelated disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

Unspecified Phencyclidine-Related Disorder Unspecified
Hallucinogen-Related Disorder

Phencyclidine Use Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A pattern of
phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar substance) use leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least
two of the following, occurring within a 12month period: 1.
Phencyclidine is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period
than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful
efforts to cut down or control phencyclidine use. 3. A great deal of
time is spent in activities necessary to obtain phencyclidine, use the
phencyclidine, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use phencyclidine. 5. Recurrent phencyclidine use
resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,
school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from work or poor work
performance related to phencyclidine use; phencyclidine-related
absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or
household). 6. Continued phencyclidine use despite having persistent or
recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the
effects of the phencyclidine (e.g., arguments with a spouse about
consequences of intoxication; physical fights). 7. Important social,
occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because
of phencyclidine use. 8. Recurrent phencyclidine use in situations in
which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or
operating a machine when impaired by a phencyclidine).

9. Phencyclidine use is continued despite knowledge of having a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely
to have been caused or exacerbated by the phencyclidine. 10. Tolerance,
as defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased
amounts of the phencyclidine to achieve intoxication or desired effect.
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of
the phencyclidine. Note: Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not
established for phencyclidines, and so this criterion does not apply.
(Withdrawal from phencyclidines has been reported in animals but not
documented in human users.) Specify if: In early remission: After full
criteria for phencyclidine use disorder were previously met, none of the
criteria for phencyclidine use disorder have been met for at least 3
months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion
A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the phencyclidine," may
be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria for phencyclidine
use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for phencyclidine
use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use the phencyclidine," may be met). Specify if: In a
controlled environment: This additional specifier is used if the
individual is in an environment where access to phencyclidines is
restricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes:
If a phencyclidine intoxication or another phencyclidine-induced mental
disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for phencyclidine
use disorder. Instead, the comorbid phencyclidine use disorder is
indicated in the 4th character of the phencyclidine-induced disorder
code (see the coding note for phencyclidine intoxication or a specific
phencyclidineinduced mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid

phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, only the phencyclidineinduced
psychotic disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating
whether the comorbid phencyclidine use disorder is mild, moderate, or
severe: F16.159 for mild phencyclidine use disorder with
phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder or F16.259 for a moderate or
severe phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced psychotic
disorder. Specify current severity: 305.90 (F16.10) Mild: Presence of
2--3 symptoms. 304.60 (F16.20) Moderate: Presence of 4--5 symptoms.
304.60 (F16.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers "In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier
of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Diagnostic Features The phencyclidines (or phencyclidine-like
substances) include phencyclidine (e.g., PCP, "angel dust") and less
potent but similarly acting compounds such as ketamine, cyclohexamine,
and dizocilpine. These substances were first developed as dissociative
anesthetics in the 1950s and became street drugs in the 1960s. They
produce feelings of separation from mind and body (hence "dissociative")
in low doses, and at high doses, stupor and coma can result. These
substances are most commonly smoked or taken orally, but they may also
be snorted or injected. Although the primary psychoactive effects of PCP
last for a few hours, the total elimination rate of this drug from the
body typically extends 8 days or longer. The hallucinogenic effects in
vulnerable individuals may last for weeks and may precipitate a
persistent psychotic episode resembling schizophrenia5. Ketamine has
been observed to have utility in the treatment of major depressive
disorder1. Withdrawal symptoms have not been clearly

established in humans, and therefore the withdrawal criterion is not
included in the diagnosis of phencyclidine use disorder.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Phencyclidine may be detected
in urine for up to 8 days or even longer at very high doses6. In
addition to laboratory tests to detect its presence, characteristic
symptoms resulting from intoxication with phencyclidine or related
substances may aid in its diagnosis. Phencyclidine is likely to produce
dissociative symptoms, analgesia, nystagmus, and hypertension, with risk
of hypotension and shock. Violent behavior can also occur with
phencyclidine use, as intoxicated persons may believe that they are
being attacked. Residual symptoms following use may resemble
schizophrenia.

Prevalence The prevalence of phencyclidine use disorder is unknown.
Approximately 2.5% of the population reports having ever used
phencyclidine. The proportion of users increases with age, from 0.3% of
12- to 17-year-olds, to 1.3% of 18- to 25-year-olds, to 2.9% of those
age 26 years and older reporting ever using phencyclidine9. There
appears to have been an increase among 12th graders in both ever used
(to 2.3% from 1.8%) and past-year use (to 1.3% from 1.0%) of
phencyclidine4. Past-year use of ketamine appears relatively stable
among 12th graders (1.6%--1.7% over the past 3 years).

Risk and Prognostic Factors There is little information about risk
factors for phencyclidine use disorder. Among individuals admitted to
substance abuse treatment, those for whom phencyclidine was the primary
substance were younger than those admitted for other substance use, had
lower educational levels, and were more likely to be located in the West
and Northeast regions of the United States, compared with other
admissions8.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Ketamine use in youths ages 16--23
years has been reported to be more common among whites (0.5%) than among
other ethnic groups (range 0%-- 0.3%)11. Among individuals admitted to
substance abuse treatment, those

for whom phencyclidine was the primary substance were predominantly
black (49%) or Hispanic (29%)8.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Males make up about three-quarters of
those with phencyclidine-related emergency room visits10.

Diagnostic Markers Laboratory testing may be useful, as phencyclidine is
present in the urine in intoxicated individuals up to 8 days after
ingestion6. The individual's history, along with certain physical signs,
such as nystagmus, analgesia and prominent hypertension, may aid in
distinguishing the phencyclidine clinical picture from that of other
hallucinogens.

Functional Consequences of Phencyclidine Use Disorder In individuals
with phencyclidine use disorder, there may be physical evidence of
injuries from accidents, fights, and falls. Chronic use of phencyclidine
may lead to deficits in memory, speech, and cognition that may last for
months3. Cardiovascular and neurological toxicities (e.g., seizures,
dystonias, dyskinesias, catalepsy, hypothermia or hyperthermia) may
result from intoxication with phencyclidine7. Other consequences include
intracranial hemorrhage, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory problems, and
(occasionally) cardiac arrest2.

Differential Diagnosis Other substance use disorders. Distinguishing the
effects of phencyclidine from those of other substances is important,
since it may be a common additive to other substances (e.g., cannabis,
cocaine). Schizophrenia and other mental disorders. Some of the effects
of phencyclidine and related substance use may resemble symptoms of
other psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis (schizophrenia), low mood
(major depressive disorder), violent aggressive behaviors (conduct
disorder, antisocial personality disorder). Discerning whether these
behaviors occurred before the intake of the drug is important in the
differentiation of

acute drug effects from preexisting mental disorder.
Phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder should be considered when there
is impaired reality testing in individuals experiencing disturbances in
perception resulting from ingestion of phencyclidine.

Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A problematic
pattern of hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine) use leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least
two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period: 1. The
hallucinogen is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period
than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful
efforts to cut down or control hallucinogen use. 3. A great deal of time
is spent in activities necessary to obtain the hallucinogen, use the
hallucinogen, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use the hallucinogen. 5. Recurrent hallucinogen use
resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,
school, or home (e.g., repeated absences from work or poor work
performance related to hallucinogen use; hallucinogen-related absences,
suspensions, or expulsions from school; neglect of children or
household). 6. Continued hallucinogen use despite having persistent or
recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the
effects of the hallucinogen (e.g., arguments with a spouse about
consequences of intoxication; physical fights). 7. Important social,
occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because
of hallucinogen use. 8. Recurrent hallucinogen use in situations in
which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an automobile or
operating a

machine when impaired by the hallucinogen). 9. Hallucinogen use is
continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical
or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
exacerbated by the hallucinogen. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of
the following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of the
hallucinogen to achieve intoxication or desired effect. b. A markedly
diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
hallucinogen. Note: Withdrawal symptoms and signs are not established
for hallucinogens, and so this criterion does not apply. Specify the
particular hallucinogen. Specify if: In early remission: After full
criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder were previously met, none
of the criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder have been met for at
least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the exception that
Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the
hallucinogen," may be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria
for other hallucinogen use disorder were previously met, none of the
criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder have been met at any time
during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that
Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the
hallucinogen," may be met). Specify if: In a controlled environment:
This additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment
where access to hallucinogens is restricted. Coding based on current
severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a hallucinogen intoxication or
another hallucinogen-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use
the codes below for hallucinogen use disorder. Instead, the comorbid
hallucinogen use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the
hallucinogen-induced disorder code (see the coding note for hallucinogen
intoxication or specific hallucinogeninduced mental disorder). For
example, if there is comorbid hallucinogen-

induced psychotic disorder and hallucinogen use disorder, only the
hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder code is given, with the 4th
character indicating whether the comorbid hallucinogen use disorder is
mild, moderate, or severe: F16.159 for mild hallucinogen use disorder
with hallucinogen-induced psychotic disorder or F16.259 for a moderate
or severe hallucinogen use disorder with hallucinogen-induced psychotic
disorder. Specify current severity: 305.30 (F16.10) Mild: Presence of
2--3 symptoms. 304.50 (F16.20) Moderate: Presence of 4--5 symptoms.
304.50 (F16.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers "In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier
of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Diagnostic Features Hallucinogens comprise a diverse group of substances
that, despite having different chemical structures and possibly
involving different molecular mechanisms, produce similar alterations of
perception, mood, and cognition in users. Hallucinogens included are
phenylalkylamines (e.g., mescaline, DOM
\[2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine\], and MDMA
\[3,4methylenedioxymethamphetamine; also called "ecstasy"\]); the
indoleamines, including psilocybin (i.e., psilocin) and
dimethyltryptamine (DMT); and the ergolines, such as LSD (lysergic acid
diethylamide) and morning glory seeds. In addition, miscellaneous other
ethnobotanical compounds are classified as "hallucinogens," of which
Salvia divinorum and jimsonweed are two examples. Excluded from the
hallucinogen group are cannabis and its active compound,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (see the section "Cannabis-Related
Disorders"). These substances can have

hallucinogenic effects but are diagnosed separately because of
significant differences in their psychological and behavioral effects.
Hallucinogens are usually taken orally, although some forms are smoked
(e.g., DMT, salvia) or (rarely) taken intranasally or by injection
(e.g., ecstasy). Duration of effects varies across types of
hallucinogens. Some of these substances (i.e., LSD, MDMA) have a long
half-life and extended duration such that users may spend hours to days
using and/or recovering from the effects of these drugs. However, other
hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., DMT, salvia) are short acting. Tolerance to
hallucinogens develops with repeated use and has been reported to have
both autonomic and psychological effects13. Cross-tolerance exists
between LSD and other hallucinogens (e.g., psilocybin, mescaline) but
does not extend to other drug categories such as amphetamines and
cannabis13. MDMA/ecstasy as a hallucinogen may have distinctive effects
attributable to both its hallucinogenic and its stimulant properties.
Among heavy ecstasy users, continued use despite physical or
psychological problems, tolerance, hazardous use, and spending a great
deal of time obtaining the substance are the most commonly reported
criteria---over 50% in adults5 and over 30% in a younger sample4, while
legal problems related to substance use and persistent desire/inability
to quit are rarely reported. As found for other substances, diagnostic
criteria for other hallucinogen use disorder are arrayed along a single
continuum of severity11, 22. One of the generic criteria for substance
use disorders, a clinically significant withdrawal syndrome, has not
been consistently documented in humans, and therefore the diagnosis of
hallucinogen withdrawal syndrome is not included in DSM-5. However,
there is evidence of withdrawal from MDMA, with endorsement of two or
more withdrawal symptoms observed in 59%--98% in selected samples of
ecstasy users. Both psychological and physical problems have been
commonly reported as withdrawal problems4, 5.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The characteristic symptom
features of some of the hallucinogens can aid in diagnosis if urine or
blood toxicology results are not available. For example, individuals who
use LSD tend to experience visual hallucinations

that can be frightening. Individuals intoxicated with hallucinogens may
exhibit a temporary increase in suicidality8.

Prevalence Of all substance use disorders, other hallucinogen use
disorder is one of the rarest. The 12-month prevalence is estimated to
be 0.5% among 12- to 17year-olds16 and 0.1% among adults age 18 and
older in the United States3. Rates are higher in adult males (0.2%)
compared with females (0.1%), but the opposite is observed in adolescent
samples ages 12--17, in which the 12month rate is slightly higher in
females (0.6%) than in males (0.4%). Rates are highest in individuals
younger than 30 years, with the peak occurring in individuals ages
18--29 years (0.6%) and decreasing to virtually 0.0% among individuals
age 45 and older. There are marked ethnic differences in 12-month
prevalence of other hallucinogen use disorder. Among youths ages 12--17
years, 12-month prevalence is higher among Native Americans and Alaska
Natives (1.2%) than among Hispanics (0.6%), whites (0.6%), African
Americans (0.2%), and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.2%).
Among adults, 12month prevalence of other hallucinogen use disorder is
similar for Native Americans and Alaska Natives, whites, and Hispanics
(all 0.2%) but somewhat lower for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
(0.07%) and African Americans (0.03%). Past-year prevalence is higher in
clinical samples (e.g., 19% in adolescents in treatment)1. Among
individuals currently using hallucinogens in the general population,
7.8% (adult) to 17% (adolescent) had a problematic pattern of use that
met criteria for pastyear other hallucinogen use disorder18, 20. Among
select groups of individuals who use hallucinogens (e.g., recent heavy
ecstasy use), 73.5% of adults and 77% of adolescents have a problematic
pattern of use that may meet other hallucinogen use disorder criteria4,
5.

Development and Course Unlike most substances where an early age at
onset is associated with elevations in risk for the corresponding use
disorder, it is unclear whether there is an association of an early age
at onset with elevations in risk for other hallucinogen use disorder.
However, patterns of drug consumption have been found to differ by age
at onset, with early-onset ecstasy users

more likely to be polydrug users than their later-onset counterparts21.
There may be a disproportionate influence of use of specific
hallucinogens on risk of developing other hallucinogen use disorder,
with use of ecstasy/MDMA increasing the risk of the disorder relative to
use of other hallucinogens20. Little is known regarding the course of
other hallucinogen use disorder, but it is generally thought to have low
incidence, low persistence, and high rates of recovery. Adolescents are
especially at risk for using these drugs, and it is estimated that 2.7%
of youths ages 12--17 years have used one or more of these drugs in the
past 12 months, with 44% having used ecstasy/MDMA20. Other hallucinogen
use disorder is a disorder observed primarily in individuals younger
than 30 years, with rates vanishingly rare among older adults.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. In adolescents but not
consistently in adults, MDMA use is associated with an elevated rate of
other hallucinogen use disorder18, 19, 20. Other substance use
disorders, particularly alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis, and major
depressive disorder are associated with elevated rates of other
hallucinogen use disorder18, 20. Antisocial personality disorder may be
elevated among individuals who use more than two other drugs in addition
to hallucinogens, compared with their counterparts with less extensive
use history21. The influence of adult antisocial behaviors---but not
conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder---on other
hallucinogen use disorder may be stronger in females than in males2. Use
of specific hallucinogens (e.g., salvia) is prominent among individuals
ages 18--25 years with other risk-taking behaviors and illegal
activities14. Cannabis use has also been implicated as a precursor to
initiation of use of hallucinogens (e.g., ecstasy)24, along with early
use of alcohol and tobacco23. Higher drug use by peers and high
sensation seeking have also been associated with elevated rates of
ecstasy use12. MDMA/ecstasy use appears to signify a more severe group
of hallucinogen users. Genetic and physiological. Among male twins,
total variance due to additive genetics has been estimated to range from
26% to 79%, with inconsistent evidence for shared environmental
influences10, 17.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Historically, hallucinogens have been
used as part of established religious practices, such as the use of
peyote in the Native American Church and in Mexico. Ritual use by
indigenous populations of psilocybin obtained from certain types of
mushrooms has occurred in South America, Mexico, and some areas in the
United States, or of ayahuasca in the Santo Daime and União de Vegetal
sects6. Regular use of peyote as part of religious rituals is not linked
to neuropsychological or psychological deficits9. For adults, no race or
ethnicity differences for the full criteria or for any individual
criterion are apparent at this time.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues In adolescents, females may be less
likely than males to endorse "hazardous use," and female gender may be
associated with increased odds of other hallucinogen use disorder22.

Diagnostic Markers Laboratory testing can be useful in distinguishing
among the different hallucinogens. However, because some agents (e.g.,
LSD) are so potent that as little as 75 micrograms can produce severe
reactions, typical toxicological examination will not always reveal
which substance has been used.

Functional Consequences of Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder There is
evidence for long-term neurotoxic effects of MDMA/ecstasy use, including
impairments in memory, psychological function, and neuroendocrine
function; serotonin system dysfunction; and sleep disturbance; as well
as adverse effects on brain microvasculature, white matter maturation,
and damage to axons7. Use of MDMA/ecstasy may diminish functional
connectivity among brain regions15.

Differential Diagnosis Other substance use disorders. The effects of
hallucinogens must be distinguished from those of other substances
(e.g., amphetamines),

especially because contamination of the hallucinogens with other drugs
is relatively common. Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia also must be ruled
out, as some affected individuals (e.g., individuals with schizophrenia
who exhibit paranoia) may falsely attribute their symptoms to use of
hallucinogens6. Other mental disorders or medical conditions. Other
potential disorders or conditions to consider include panic disorder,
depressive and bipolar disorders, alcohol or sedative withdrawal,
hypoglycemia and other metabolic conditions, seizure disorder, stroke,
ophthalmological disorder, and central nervous system tumors6. Careful
history of drug taking, collateral reports from family and friends (if
possible), age, clinical history, physical examination, and toxicology
reports should be useful in arriving at the final diagnostic decision.

Comorbidity Adolescents who use MDMA/ecstasy and other hallucinogens, as
well as adults who have recently used ecstasy, have a higher prevalence
of other substance use disorders compared with nonhallucinogen substance
users19, 20. Individuals who use hallucinogens exhibit elevations of
nonsubstance mental disorders (especially anxiety, depressive, and
bipolar disorders), particularly with use of ecstasy and salvia14, 19,
21. Rates of antisocial personality disorder (but not conduct disorder)
are significantly elevated among individuals with other hallucinogen use
disorder, as are rates of adult antisocial behavior2. However, it is
unclear whether the mental illnesses may be precursors to rather than
consequences of other hallucinogen use disorder (see the section "Risk
and Prognostic Factors" for this disorder). Both adults and adolescents
who use ecstasy are more likely than other drug users to be polydrug
users and to have other drug use disorders19, 20.

Phencyclidine Intoxication Diagnostic Criteria a. Recent use of
phencyclidine (or a pharmacologically similar substance). b. Clinically
significant problematic behavioral changes (e.g., belligerence,
assaultiveness, impulsiveness, unpredictability, psychomotor agitation,
impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after,
phencyclidine use. c. Within 1 hour, two (or more) of the following
signs or symptoms: Note: When the drug is smoked, "snorted," or used
intravenously, the onset may be particularly rapid. 1. Vertical or
horizontal nystagmus. 2. Hypertension or tachycardia. 3. Numbness or
diminished responsiveness to pain. 4. Ataxia. 5. Dysarthria. 6. Muscle
rigidity.

7. Seizures or coma. 8. Hyperacusis. d. The signs or symptoms are not
attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained
by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another
substance. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid phencyclidine use disorder. If a
mild phencyclidine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F16.129, and if a moderate or severe phencyclidine use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F16.229. If there is no comorbid
phencyclidine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F16.929. Note: In
addition to the section "Functional Consequences of Phencyclidine
Intoxication," see the corresponding section in phencyclidine use
disorder.

Diagnostic Features Phencyclidine intoxication reflects the clinically
significant behavioral changes that occur shortly after ingestion of
this substance (or a pharmacologically similar substance). The most
common clinical presentations of phencyclidine intoxication include
disorientation, confusion without hallucinations, hallucinations or
delusions, a catatoniclike syndrome, and coma of varying severity4. The
intoxication typically lasts for several hours but, depending on the
type of clinical presentation and whether other drugs besides
phencyclidine were consumed, may last for several days or longer4.

Prevalence Use of phencyclidine or related substances may be taken as an
estimate of the prevalence of intoxication. Approximately 2.5% of the
population reports having ever used phencyclidine6. Among high school
students, 2.3% of 12th graders report ever using phencyclidine, with 57%
having used in the past 12 months3. This represents an increase from
prior to 2011. Past-year use of ketamine, which is assessed separately
from other substances, has remained stable over time, with about 1.7% of
12th graders reporting use.

Diagnostic Markers Laboratory testing may be useful, as phencyclidine is
detectable in urine for up to 8 days following use, although the levels
are only weakly associated with an individual's clinical presentation
and may therefore not be useful for case management. Creatine
phosphokinase and aspartate aminotransferase levels may be elevated.

Functional Consequences Intoxication

of

Phencyclidine

Phencyclidine intoxication produces extensive cardiovascular and
neurological (e.g., seizures, dystonias, dyskinesias, catalepsy,
hypothermia or hyperthermia) toxicity.

Differential Diagnosis In particular, in the absence of intact reality
testing (i.e., without insight into any perceptual abnormalities), an
additional diagnosis of phencyclidineinduced psychotic disorder should
be considered. Other substance intoxication. Phencyclidine intoxication
should be differentiated from intoxication due to other substances,
including other hallucinogens; amphetamine, cocaine, or other
stimulants; and anticholinergics, as well as withdrawal from
benzodiazepines2. Nystagmus and bizarre and violent behavior may
distinguish intoxication due to phencyclidine from that due to other
substances1, 5. Toxicological tests may be useful in making this
distinction, since phencyclidine is detectable in urine for up to 8 days
after use. However, there is a weak correlation between quantitative
toxicology levels of phencyclidine and clinical presentation that
diminishes the utility of the laboratory findings for patient
management1, 2, 5. Other conditions. Other conditions to be considered
include schizophrenia, depression, withdrawal from other drugs (e.g.,
sedatives, alcohol), certain metabolic disorders like hypoglycemia and
hyponatremia, central nervous system tumors, seizure disorders, sepsis,
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and vascular insults2.

Other Hallucinogen Intoxication Diagnostic Criteria a. Recent use of a
hallucinogen (other than phencyclidine). b. Clinically significant
problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., marked anxiety or
depression, ideas of reference, fear of "losing one's mind," paranoid
ideation, impaired judgment) that developed during, or shortly after,
hallucinogen use. c. Perceptual changes occurring in a state of full
wakefulness and alertness (e.g., subjective intensification of
perceptions, depersonalization, derealization, illusions,
hallucinations, synesthesias) that developed during, or shortly after,
hallucinogen use.

d. Two (or more) of the following signs developing during, or shortly
after, hallucinogen use: 1. Pupillary dilation. 2. Tachycardia. 3.
Sweating. 4. Palpitations. 5. Blurring of vision. 6. Tremors. 7.
Incoordination. e. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another
medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder, including intoxication with another substance. Coding note:
The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether there
is a comorbid hallucinogen use disorder. If a mild hallucinogen use
disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F16.129, and if a moderate
or severe hallucinogen use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is
F16.229. If there is no comorbid hallucinogen use disorder, then the
ICD-10-CM code is F16.929. Note: For information on Associated Features
Supporting Diagnosis and Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues, see the
corresponding sections in other hallucinogen use disorder.

Diagnostic Features Other hallucinogen intoxication reflects the
clinically significant behavioral or psychological changes that occur
shortly after ingestion of a hallucinogen. Depending on the specific
hallucinogen, the intoxication may last only minutes (e.g., for salvia)
or several hours or longer (e.g., for LSD \[lysergic acid diethylamide\]
or MDMA \[3,4methylenedioxymethamphetamine\]).

Prevalence

The prevalence of other hallucinogen intoxication may be estimated by
use of those substances. In the United States, 1.8% of individuals age
12 years or older report using hallucinogens in the past year. Use is
more prevalent among younger individuals, with 3.1% of 12- to
17-year-olds and 7.1% of 18- to 25-year-olds using hallucinogens in the
past year, compared with only 0.7% of individuals age 26 years or
older5. Twelve-month prevalence for hallucinogen use is more common in
males (2.4%) than in females (1.2%), and even more so among 18- to
25-year-olds (9.2% for males vs. 5.0% for females). In contrast, among
individuals ages 12--17 years, there are no gender differences (3.1% for
both genders). These figures may be used as proxy estimates for
gender-related differences in the prevalence of other hallucinogen
intoxication.

Suicide Risk Other hallucinogen intoxication may lead to increased
suicidality, although suicide is rare among users of hallucinogens3, 4.

Functional Consequences of Other Hallucinogen Intoxication Other
hallucinogen intoxication can have serious consequences. The perceptual
disturbances and impaired judgment associated with other hallucinogen
intoxication can result in injuries or fatalities from automobile
crashes, physical fights, or unintentional self-injury (e.g., attempts
to "fly" from high places). Environmental factors and the personality
and expectations of the individual using the hallucinogen may contribute
to the nature of and severity of hallucinogen intoxication. Continued
use of hallucinogens, particularly MDMA, has also been linked with
neurotoxic effects1.

Differential Diagnosis Other substance intoxication. Other hallucinogen
intoxication should be differentiated from intoxication with
amphetamines, cocaine, or other stimulants; anticholinergics; inhalants;
and phencyclidine. Toxicological tests are useful in making this
distinction, and determining the route of administration may also be
useful.

Other conditions. Other disorders and conditions to be considered
include schizophrenia, depression, withdrawal from other drugs (e.g.,
sedatives, alcohol), certain metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia),
seizure disorders, tumors of the central nervous system, and vascular
insults2. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. Other
hallucinogen intoxication is distinguished from hallucinogen persisting
perception disorder because the symptoms in the latter continue
episodically or continuously for weeks (or longer) after the most recent
intoxication. Other hallucinogen-induced disorders. Other hallucinogen
intoxication is distinguished from the other hallucinogen-induced
disorders (e.g., hallucinogen-induced anxiety disorder, with onset
during intoxication) because the symptoms in these latter disorders
predominate the clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant
independent clinical attention.

Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

292.89 (F16.983)

a.  Following cessation of use of a hallucinogen, the reexperiencing of
    one or more of the perceptual symptoms that were experienced while
    intoxicated with the hallucinogen (e.g., geometric hallucinations,
    false perceptions of movement in the peripheral visual fields,
    flashes of color, intensified colors, trails of images of moving
    objects, positive afterimages, halos around objects, macropsia and
    micropsia).
b.  The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress or
    impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
    functioning.
c.  The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition
    (e.g., anatomical lesions and infections of the brain, visual
    epilepsies) and are not better explained by another mental disorder
    (e.g., delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, schizophrenia) or
    hypnopompic hallucinations.

Diagnostic Features The hallmark of hallucinogen persisting perception
disorder is the reexperiencing, when the individual is sober, of the
perceptual disturbances that were experienced while the individual was
intoxicated with the hallucinogen (Criterion A). The symptoms may
include any perceptual perturbations, but visual disturbances tend to be
predominant4. Typical of the abnormal visual perceptions are geometric
hallucinations, false perceptions of movement in the peripheral visual
fields, flashes of color, intensified colors, trails of images of moving
objects (i.e., images left suspended in the path of a moving object as
seen in stroboscopic photography), perceptions of entire objects,
positive afterimages (i.e., a same-colored or complementary-colored
"shadow" of an object remaining after removal of the object), halos
around objects, or misperception of images as too large (macropsia) or
too small (micropsia). Duration of the visual disturbances may be
episodic or nearly continuous and must cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other

important areas of functioning (Criterion B). The disturbances may last
for weeks, months, or years. Other explanations for the disturbances
(e.g., brain lesions, preexisting psychosis, seizure disorders, migraine
aura without headaches) must be ruled out (Criterion C). Hallucinogen
persisting perception disorder occurs primarily after LSD (lysergic acid
diethylamide) use, but not exclusively3. There does not appear to be a
strong correlation between hallucinogen persisting perception disorder
and number of occasions of hallucinogen use, with some instances of
hallucinogen persisting perception disorder occurring in individuals
with minimal exposure to hallucinogens. Some instances of hallucinogen
persisting perception disorder may be triggered by use of other
substances (e.g., cannabis or alcohol) or in adaptation to dark
environments1.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Reality testing remains intact
in individuals with hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (i.e.,
the individual is aware that the disturbance is linked to the effect of
the drug). If this is not the case, another disorder might better
explain the abnormal perceptions.

Prevalence Prevalence estimates of hallucinogen persisting perception
disorder are unknown. Initial prevalence estimates of the disorder among
individuals who use hallucinogens is approximately 4.2%2.

Development and Course Little is known about the development of
hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. Its course, as suggested by
its name, is persistent, lasting for weeks, months, or even years in
certain individuals.

Risk and Prognostic Factors There is little evidence regarding risk
factors for hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, although
genetic factors have been suggested as a possible explanation underlying
the susceptibility to LSD effects in this condition1.

Functional Consequences of Persisting Perception Disorder

Hallucinogen

Although hallucinogen persisting perception disorder remains a chronic
condition in some cases, many individuals with the disorder are able to
suppress the disturbances and continue to function normally1.

Differential Diagnosis Conditions to be ruled out include schizophrenia,
other drug effects, neurodegenerative disorders, stroke, brain tumors,
infections, and head trauma3. Neuroimaging results in hallucinogen
persisting perception disorder cases are typically negative. As noted
earlier, reality testing remains intact (i.e., the individual is aware
that the disturbance is linked to the effect of the drug); if this is
not the case, another disorder (e.g., psychotic disorder, another
medical condition) might better explain the abnormal perceptions.

Comorbidity Common comorbid mental disorders accompanying hallucinogen
persisting perception disorder are panic disorder, alcohol use disorder,
and major depressive disorder3.

Other Phencyclidine-Induced Disorders Other phencyclidine-induced
disorders are described in other chapters of the manual with disorders
with which they share phenomenology (see the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters):
phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and
Other Psychotic Disorders"); phencyclidine-induced bipolar disorder
("Bipolar and Related Disorders"); phencyclidine-induced depressive
disorder ("Depressive Disorders"); and phencyclidine-induced anxiety
disorder ("Anxiety Disorders"). For phencyclidine-induced intoxication
delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter
"Neurocognitive Disorders." These phencyclidine-induced disorders are
diagnosed instead of phencyclidine intoxication only when the symptoms
are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

Other Hallucinogen-Induced Disorders The following other
hallucinogen-induced disorders are described in other chapters of the
manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters): other
hallucinogen--induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and
Other Psychotic Disorders"); other hallucinogen--induced bipolar
disorder ("Bipolar and Related Disorders"); other hallucinogen--induced
depressive disorder ("Depressive Disorders"); and other
hallucinogen--induced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety Disorders"). For other
hallucinogen intoxication delirium, see the criteria and discussion of
delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders." These
hallucinogeninduced disorders are diagnosed instead of other
hallucinogen intoxication only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe
to warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Phencyclidine-Related Disorder 292.9 (F16.99) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
phencyclidine-related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or

impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific phencyclidinerelated disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

Unspecified Hallucinogen-Related Disorder 292.9 (F16.99) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
hallucinogen-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific hallucinogenrelated disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

Inhalant-Related Disorders Inhalant Use Disorder Inhalant Intoxication
Other Inhalant-Induced Disorders Unspecified Inhalant-Related Disorder

Inhalant Use Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A problematic pattern of
use of a hydrocarbon-based inhalant substance leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12month period: 1. The inhalant substance
is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was
intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut
down or control use of the inhalant substance.

3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the
inhalant substance, use it, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or
a strong desire or urge to use the inhalant substance. 5. Recurrent use
of the inhalant substance resulting in a failure to fulfill major role
obligations at work, school, or home. 6. Continued use of the inhalant
substance despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal
problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of its use. 7. Important
social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced
because of use of the inhalant substance. 8. Recurrent use of the
inhalant substance in situations in which it is physically hazardous. 9.
Use of the inhalant substance is continued despite knowledge of having a
persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely
to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance. 10. Tolerance, as
defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased
amounts of the inhalant substance to achieve intoxication or desired
effect. b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same
amount of the inhalant substance. Specify the particular inhalant: When
possible, the particular substance involved should be named (e.g.,
"solvent use disorder"). Specify if: In early remission: After full
criteria for inhalant use disorder were previously met, none of the
criteria for inhalant use disorder have been met for at least 3 months
but for less than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4,
"Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the inhalant substance," may
be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria for inhalant use
disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for inhalant use
disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the

exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
the inhalant substance," may be met). Specify if: In a controlled
environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in
an environment where access to inhalant substances is restricted. Coding
based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an inhalant
intoxication or another inhalant-induced mental disorder is also
present, do not use the codes below for inhalant use disorder. Instead,
the comorbid inhalant use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of
the inhalant-induced disorder code (see the coding note for inhalant
intoxication or a specific inhalant-induced mental disorder). For
example, if there is comorbid inhalant-induced depressive disorder and
inhalant use disorder, only the inhalant-induced depressive disorder
code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid
inhalant use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F18.14 for mild
inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced depressive disorder or
F18.24 for a moderate or severe inhalant use disorder with
inhalant-induced depressive disorder. Specify current severity: 305.90
(F18.10) Mild: Presence of 2--3 symptoms. 304.60 (F18.20) Moderate:
Presence of 4--5 symptoms. 304.60 (F18.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more
symptoms.

Specifiers This manual recognizes volatile hydrocarbon use meeting the
above diagnostic criteria as inhalant use disorder. Volatile
hydrocarbons are toxic gases from glues, fuels, paints, and other
volatile compounds. When possible, the particular substance involved
should be named (e.g., "toluene use disorder"). However, most compounds
that are inhaled are a mixture of several substances that can produce
psychoactive effects, and it is often difficult to ascertain the exact
substance responsible for the disorder. Unless there is clear evidence
that a single, unmixed substance has been used, the general term
inhalant should be used in recording the diagnosis. Disorders

arising from inhalation of nitrous oxide or of amyl-, butyl-, or
isobutylnitrite are considered as other (or unknown) substance use
disorder. "In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier
of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units. The severity of
individuals' inhalant use disorder is assessed by the number of
diagnostic criteria endorsed. Changing severity of individuals' inhalant
use disorder across time is reflected by reductions in the frequency
(e.g., days used per month) and/or dose (e.g., tubes of glue per day)
used, as assessed by the individual's self-report, report of others,
clinician's observations, and biological testing (when practical).

Diagnostic Features Features of inhalant use disorder include repeated
use of an inhalant substance despite the individual's knowing that the
substance is causing serious problems for the individual (Criterion A9).
Those problems are reflected in the diagnostic criteria. Missing work or
school or inability to perform typical responsibilities at work or
school (Criterion A5), and continued use of the inhalant substance even
though it causes arguments with family or friends, fights, and other
social or interpersonal problems (Criterion A6), may be seen in inhalant
use disorder. Limiting family contact, work or school obligations, or
recreational activities (e.g., sports, games, hobbies) may also occur
(Criterion A7). Use of inhalants when driving or operating dangerous
equipment (Criterion A8) is also seen. Tolerance (Criterion A10) and
mild withdrawal are each reported by about 10% of individuals who use
inhalants, and a few individuals use inhalants to avoid withdrawal13.
However, because the withdrawal symptoms are mild9, this manual neither
recognizes a diagnosis of inhalant withdrawal nor counts withdrawal
complaints as a diagnostic criterion for inhalant use disorder.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

A diagnosis of inhalant use disorder is supported by recurring episodes
of intoxication with negative results in standard drug screens (which do
not detect inhalants); possession, or lingering odors, of inhalant
substances; peri-oral or peri-nasal "glue-sniffer's rash"; association
with other individuals known to use inhalants; membership in groups with
prevalent inhalant use (e.g., some native or aboriginal communities,
homeless children in street gangs); easy access to certain inhalant
substances; paraphernalia possession; presence of the disorder's
characteristic medical complications (e.g., brain white matter
pathology, rhabdomyolysis); and the presence of multiple substance use
disorders20. Inhalant use and inhalant use disorder are associated with
past suicide attempts, especially among adults reporting previous
episodes of low mood or anhedonia1, 5.

Prevalence About 0.4% of Americans ages 12--17 years have a pattern of
use that meets criteria for inhalant use disorder in the past 12
months17. Among those youths, the prevalence is highest in Native
Americans and lowest in African Americans. Prevalence falls to about
0.1% among Americans ages 18--29 years, and only 0.02% when all
Americans 18 years or older are considered, with almost no females and a
preponderance of European Americans. Of course, in isolated subgroups,
prevalence may differ considerably from these overall rates.

Development and Course About 10% of 13-year-old American children report
having used inhalants at least once; that percentage remains stable
through age 17 years16. Among those 12- to 17-year-olds who use
inhalants, the more-used substances include glue, shoe polish, or
toluene; gasoline or lighter fluid; or spray paints17. Only 0.4% of 12-
to 17-year-olds progress to inhalant use disorder; those youths tend to
exhibit multiple other problems19. The declining prevalence of inhalant
use disorder after adolescence indicates that this disorder usually
remits in early adulthood. Volatile hydrocarbon use disorder is rare in
prepubertal children, most common in adolescents and young adults, and
uncommon in older persons. Calls to poison-control centers for
"intentional abuse" of inhalants peak

with calls involving individuals at age 14 years7. Of adolescents who
use inhalants, perhaps one-fifth develop inhalant use disorder11, a few
die from inhalant-related accidents, or "sudden sniffing death" 12. But
the disorder apparently remits in many individuals after adolescence.
Prevalence declines dramatically among individuals in their 20s. Those
with inhalant use disorder extending into adulthood often have severe
problems: substance use disorders, antisocial personality disorder, and
suicidal ideation with attempts5.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Predictors of progression
from nonuse of inhalants, to use, to inhalant use disorder include
comorbid non-inhalant substance use disorders and either conduct
disorder or antisocial personality disorder. Other predictors are
earlier onset of inhalant use and prior use of mental health services3,
5, 19. Environmental. Inhalant gases are widely and legally available,
increasing the risk of misuse. Childhood maltreatment or trauma also is
associated with youthful progression from inhalant non-use to inhalant
use disorder10. Genetic and physiological. Behavioral disinhibition is a
highly heritable general propensity to not constrain behavior in
socially acceptable ways, to break social norms and rules, and to take
dangerous risks, pursuing rewards excessively despite dangers of adverse
consequences. Youths with strong behavioral disinhibition show risk
factors for inhalant use disorder: earlyonset substance use disorder,
multiple substance involvement, and early conduct problems6. Because
behavioral disinhibition is under strong genetic influence, youths in
families with substance and antisocial problems are at elevated risk for
inhalant use disorder11.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Certain native or aboriginal
communities have experienced a high prevalence of inhalant problems2, 8.
Also, in some countries, groups of homeless children in street gangs
have extensive inhalant use problems15.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Although the prevalence of inhalant use disorder is almost identical in
adolescent males and females, the disorder is very rare among adult
females.

Diagnostic Markers Urine, breath, or saliva tests may be valuable for
assessing concurrent use of non-inhalant substances by individuals with
inhalant use disorder. However, technical problems and the considerable
expense of analyses make frequent biological testing for inhalants
themselves impractical14.

Functional Disorder

Consequences

of

Inhalant

Use

Because of inherent toxicity, use of butane or propane is not
infrequently fatal17. Moreover, any inhaled volatile hydrocarbons may
produce "sudden sniffing death" from cardiac arrhythmia14. Fatalities
may occur even on the first inhalant exposure and are not thought to be
dose-related. Volatile hydrocarbon use impairs neurobehavioral function
and causes various neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and
pulmonary problems14. Long-term inhalant users are at increased risk for
tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, depression,
anxiety, bronchitis, asthma, and sinusitis4. Deaths may occur from
respiratory depression, arrhythmias, asphyxiation, aspiration of
vomitus, or accident and injury14.

Differential Diagnosis Inhalant exposure (unintentional) from industrial
or other accidents. This designation is used when findings suggest
repeated or continuous inhalant exposure but the involved individual and
other informants deny any history of purposeful inhalant use. Inhalant
use (intentional), without meeting criteria for inhalant use disorder.
Inhalant use is common among adolescents, but for most of those
individuals, the inhalant use does not meet the diagnostic standard of
two or more Criterion A items for inhalant use disorder in the past
year. Inhalant intoxication, without meeting criteria for inhalant use
disorder. Inhalant intoxication occurs frequently during inhalant use
disorder but also may occur among individuals whose use does not meet

criteria for inhalant use disorder, which requires at least two of the
10 diagnostic criteria in the past year. Inhalant-induced disorders
(i.e., inhalant-induced psychotic disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety
disorder, neurocognitive disorder, other inhalant-induced disorders)
without meeting criteria for inhalant use disorder. Criteria are met for
a psychotic, depressive, anxiety, or major neurocognitive disorder, and
there is evidence from history, physical examination, or laboratory
findings that the deficits are etiologically related to the effects of
inhalant substances. Yet, criteria for inhalant use disorder may not be
met (i.e., fewer than 2 of the 10 criteria were present). Other
substance use disorders, especially those involving sedating substances
(e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates). Inhalant use disorder
commonly co-occurs with other substance use disorders, and the symptoms
of the disorders may be similar and overlapping. To disentangle symptom
patterns, it is helpful to inquire about which symptoms persisted during
periods when some of the substances were not being used. Other toxic,
metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, or infectious disorders impairing
central or peripheral nervous system function. Individuals with inhalant
use disorder may present with symptoms of pernicious anemia, subacute
combined degeneration of the spinal cord, psychosis, major or minor
cognitive disorder, brain atrophy, leukoencephalopathy, and many other
nervous system disorders14. Of course, these disorders also may occur in
the absence of inhalant use disorder. A history of little or no inhalant
use helps to exclude inhalant use disorder as the source of these
problems. Disorders of other organ systems. Individuals with inhalant
use disorder may present with symptoms of hepatic or renal damage,
rhabdomyolysis, methemoglobinemia, or symptoms of other
gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or pulmonary diseases14. A history of
little or no inhalant use helps to exclude inhalant use disorder as the
source of such medical problems.

Comorbidity Individuals with inhalant use disorder receiving clinical
care often have numerous other substance use disorders20. Inhalant use
disorder commonly co-occurs with adolescent conduct disorder and adult
antisocial personality

disorder. Adult inhalant use and inhalant use disorder also are strongly
associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts5.

Inhalant Intoxication Diagnostic Criteria a. Recent intended or
unintended short-term, high-dose exposure to inhalant substances,
including volatile hydrocarbons such as toluene or gasoline. b.
Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes
(e.g., belligerence, assaultiveness, apathy, impaired judgment) that
developed during, or shortly after, exposure to inhalants. c. Two (or
more) of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly
after, inhalant use or exposure: 1. Dizziness. 2. Nystagmus. 3.
Incoordination. 4. Slurred speech. 5. Unsteady gait. 6. Lethargy. 7.
Depressed reflexes. 8. Psychomotor retardation. 9. Tremor. 10.
Generalized muscle weakness. 11. Blurred vision or diplopia. 12. Stupor
or coma.

13. Euphoria. d. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another
medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder, including intoxication with another substance. Coding note:
The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether there
is a comorbid inhalant use disorder. If a mild inhalant use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F18.129, and if a moderate or severe
inhalant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10CM code is F18.229. If
there is no comorbid inhalant use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is
F18.929. Note: For information on Development and Course, Risk and
Prognostic Factors, Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues, and Diagnostic
Markers, see the corresponding sections in inhalant use disorder.

Diagnostic Features Inhalant intoxication is an inhalant-related,
clinically significant mental disorder that develops during, or
immediately after, intended or unintended inhalation of a volatile
hydrocarbon substance. Volatile hydrocarbons are toxic gases from glues,
fuels, paints, and other volatile compounds. When it is possible to do
so, the particular substance involved should be named (e.g., toluene
intoxication). Among those who do, the intoxication clears within a few
minutes to a few hours after the exposure ends. Thus, inhalant
intoxication usually occurs in brief episodes that may recur.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Inhalant intoxication may be
indicated by evidence of possession, or lingering odors, of inhalant
substances (e.g., glue, paint thinner, gasoline, butane lighters);
apparent intoxication occurring in the age range with the highest
prevalence of inhalant use (12--17 years); and apparent intoxication
with negative results from the standard drug screens that usually fail
to identify inhalants.

Prevalence

The prevalence of actual episodes of inhalant intoxication in the
general population is unknown, but it is probable that most inhalant
users would at some time exhibit use that would meet criteria for
inhalant intoxication disorder. Therefore, the prevalence of inhalant
use and the prevalence of inhalant intoxication disorder are likely
similar. In 2009 and 2010, inhalant use in the past year was reported by
0.8% of all Americans older than 12 years; the prevalence was highest in
younger age groups (3.6% for individuals 12 to 17 years old, and 1.7%
for individuals 18 to 25 years old)2.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Gender differences in the prevalence of
inhalant intoxication in the general population are unknown. However, if
it is assumed that most inhalant users eventually experience inhalant
intoxication, gender differences in the prevalence of inhalant users
likely approximate those in the proportions of males and females
experiencing inhalant intoxication. Regarding gender differences in the
prevalence of inhalant users in the United States, 1% of males older
than 12 years and 0.7% of females older than 12 years have used
inhalants in the previous year, but in the younger age groups more
females than males have used inhalants (e.g., among 12- to 17-year-olds,
3.6% of males and 4.2% of females)3.

Functional Consequences of Inhalant Intoxication Use of inhaled
substances in a closed container, such as a plastic bag over the head,
may lead to unconsciousness, anoxia, and death. Separately, "sudden
sniffing death," likely from cardiac arrhythmia or arrest, may occur
with various volatile inhalants. The enhanced toxicity of certain
volatile inhalants, such as butane or propane, also causes fatalities1.
Although inhalant intoxication itself is of short duration, it may
produce persisting medical and neurological problems, especially if the
intoxications are frequent.

Differential Diagnosis Inhalant exposure, without meeting the criteria
for inhalant intoxication disorder. The individual intentionally or
unintentionally

inhaled substances, but the dose was insufficient for the diagnostic
criteria for inhalant use disorder to be met. Intoxication and other
substance/medication-induced disorders from other substances, especially
from sedating substances (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates).
These disorders may have similar signs and symptoms, but the
intoxication is attributable to other intoxicants that may be identified
via a toxicology screen. Differentiating the source of the intoxication
may involve discerning evidence of inhalant exposure as described for
inhalant use disorder. A diagnosis of inhalant intoxication may be
suggested by possession, or lingering odors, of inhalant substances
(e.g., glue, paint thinner, gasoline, butane lighters,); paraphernalia
possession (e.g., rags or bags for concentrating glue fumes); perioral
or perinasal "glue-sniffer's rash"; reports from family or friends that
the intoxicated individual possesses or uses inhalants; apparent
intoxication despite negative results on standard drug screens (which
usually fail to identify inhalants); apparent intoxication occurring in
that age range with the highest prevalence of inhalant use (12--17
years); association with others known to use inhalants; membership in
certain small communities with prevalent inhalant use (e.g., some native
or aboriginal communities, homeless street children and adolescents); or
unusual access to certain inhalant substances. Other inhalant-related
disorders. Episodes of inhalant intoxication do occur during, but are
not identical with, other inhalant-related disorders. Those
inhalant-related disorders are recognized by their respective diagnostic
criteria: inhalant use disorder, inhalant-induced neurocognitive
disorder, inhalant-induced psychotic disorder, inhalant-induced
depressive disorder, inhalant-induced anxiety disorder, and other
inhalant-induced disorders. Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic,
neoplastic, or infectious disorders that impair brain function and
cognition. Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may
produce the clinically significant behavioral or psychological changes
(e.g., belligerence, assaultiveness, apathy, impaired judgment) that
also characterize inhalant intoxication.

Other Inhalant-Induced Disorders The following inhalant-induced
disorders are described in other chapters of the manual with disorders
with which they share phenomenology (see the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters):
inhalantinduced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other
Psychotic Disorders"); inhalant-induced depressive disorder ("Depressive
Disorders"); inhalant-induced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety Disorders");
and inhalant-induced major or mild neurocognitive disorder
("Neurocognitive Disorders"). For inhalant intoxication delirium, see
the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive
Disorders." These inhalant-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of
inhalant intoxication only when symptoms are sufficiently severe to
warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Inhalant-Related Disorder

292.9 (F18.99) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of an inhalant-related disorder that cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for any specific inhalantrelated disorder or any of the
disorders in the substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic
class.

Opioid-Related Disorders Opioid Use Disorder Opioid Intoxication Opioid
Withdrawal Other Opioid-Induced Disorders Unspecified Opioid-Related
Disorder

Opioid Use Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A problematic pattern of
opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as
manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period: 1. Opioids are often taken in larger amounts or over a longer
period than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or
unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control opioid use. 3. A great deal
of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the opioid, use the
opioid, or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong desire or
urge to use opioids. 5. Recurrent opioid use resulting in a failure to
fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home.

6. Continued opioid use despite having persistent or recurrent social or
interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of opioids.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of opioid use. 8. Recurrent opioid use in
situations in which it is physically hazardous. 9. Continued opioid use
despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or
psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated
by the substance. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of opioids to achieve
intoxication or desired effect. b. A markedly diminished effect with
continued use of the same amount of an opioid. Note: This criterion is
not considered to be met for those taking opioids solely under
appropriate medical supervision. 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either
of the following: a. The characteristic opioid withdrawal syndrome
(refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for opioid withdrawal,
pp. 547--548). b. Opioids (or a closely related substance) are taken to
relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Note: This criterion is not
considered to be met for those individuals taking opioids solely under
appropriate medical supervision. Specify if: In early remission: After
full criteria for opioid use disorder were previously met, none of the
criteria for opioid use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but
for less than 12 months (with the

exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
opioids," may be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria for
opioid use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for opioid
use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or
longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use opioids," may be met). Specify if: On maintenance
therapy: This additional specifier is used if the individual is taking a
prescribed agonist medication such as methadone or buprenorphine and
none of the criteria for opioid use disorder have been met for that
class of medication (except tolerance to, or withdrawal from, the
agonist). This category also applies to those individuals being
maintained on a partial agonist, an agonist/antagonist, or a full
antagonist such as oral naltrexone or depot naltrexone. In a controlled
environment: This additional specifier is used if the individual is in
an environment where access to opioids is restricted. Coding based on
current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an opioid intoxication,
opioid withdrawal, or another opioid-induced mental disorder is also
present, do not use the codes below for opioid use disorder. Instead,
the comorbid opioid use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of
the opioid-induced disorder code (see the coding note for opioid
intoxication, opioid withdrawal, or a specific opioid-induced mental
disorder). For example, if there is comorbid opioid-induced depressive
disorder and opioid use disorder, only the opioid-induced depressive
disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the
comorbid opioid use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F11.14 for
mild opioid use disorder with opioid-induced depressive disorder or
F11.24 for a moderate or severe opioid use disorder with opioid-induced
depressive disorder. Specify current severity: 305.50 (F11.10) Mild:
Presence of 2--3 symptoms. 304.00 (F11.20) Moderate: Presence of 4--5
symptoms. 304.00 (F11.20) Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers The "on maintenance therapy" specifier applies as a further
specifier of remission if the individual is both in remission and
receiving maintenance therapy. "In a controlled environment" applies as
a further specifier of remission if the individual is both in remission
and in a controlled environment (i.e., in early remission in a
controlled environment or in sustained remission in a controlled
environment). Examples of these environments are closely supervised and
substance-free jails, therapeutic communities, and locked hospital
units. Changing severity across time in an individual is also reflected
by reductions in the frequency (e.g., days of use per month) and/or dose
(e.g., injections or number of pills) of an opioid, as assessed by the
individual's self-report, report of knowledgeable others, clinician's
observations, and biological testing.

Diagnostic Features Opioid use disorder includes signs and symptoms that
reflect compulsive, prolonged self-administration of opioid substances
that are used for no legitimate medical purpose or, if another medical
condition is present that requires opioid treatment, that are used in
doses greatly in excess of the amount needed for that medical condition.
(For example, an individual prescribed analgesic opioids for pain relief
at adequate dosing will use significantly more than prescribed and not
only because of persistent pain.) Individuals with opioid use disorder
tend to develop such regular patterns of compulsive drug use that daily
activities are planned around obtaining and administering opioids.
Opioids are usually purchased on the illegal market but may also be
obtained from physicians by falsifying or exaggerating general medical
problems or by receiving simultaneous prescriptions from several
physicians. Health care professionals with opioid use disorder will
often obtain opioids by writing prescriptions for themselves or by
diverting opioids that have been prescribed for patients or from
pharmacy supplies. Most individuals with opioid use disorder have
significant levels of tolerance and will experience withdrawal on abrupt
discontinuation of opioid substances. Individuals with opioid use
disorder often develop conditioned responses to drug-related stimuli
(e.g., craving on seeing any heroin powder--like substance)---a
phenomenon that occurs with most drugs

that cause intense psychological changes. These responses probably
contribute to relapse, are difficult to extinguish, and typically
persist long after detoxification is completed7.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Opioid use disorder can be
associated with a history of drug-related crimes (e.g., possession or
distribution of drugs, forgery, burglary, robbery, larceny, receiving
stolen goods). Among health care professionals and individuals who have
ready access to controlled substances, there is often a different
pattern of illegal activities involving problems with state licensing
boards, professional staffs of hospitals, or other administrative
agencies. Marital difficulties (including divorce), unemployment, and
irregular employment are often associated with opioid use disorder at
all socioeconomic levels.

Prevalence The 12-month prevalence of opioid use disorder is
approximately 0.37% among adults age 18 years and older in the community
population2. This may be an underestimate because of the large number of
incarcerated individuals with opioid use disorders3. Rates are higher in
males than in females (0.49% vs. 0.26%), with the male-to-female ratio
typically being 1.5:1 for opioids other than heroin (i.e., available by
prescription) and 3:1 for heroin. Female adolescents may have a higher
likelihood of developing opioid use disorders14. The prevalence
decreases with age, with the prevalence highest (0.82%) among adults age
29 years or younger, and decreasing to 0.09% among adults age 65 years
and older. Among adults, the prevalence of opioid use disorder is lower
among African Americans at 0.18% and overrepresented among Native
Americans at 1.25%. It is close to average among whites (0.38%), Asian
or Pacific Islanders (0.35%), and Hispanics (0.39%)14. Among individuals
in the United States ages 12--17 years, the overall 12month prevalence
of opioid use disorder in the community population is approximately
1.0%, but the prevalence of heroin use disorder is less than 0.1%. By
contrast, analgesic use disorder is prevalent in about 1.0% of those
ages 12--17 years, speaking to the importance of opioid analgesics as a
group of substances with significant health consequences12.

The 12-month prevalence of problem opioid use in European countries in
the community population ages 15--64 years is between 0.1% and 0.8%. The
average prevalence of problem opioid use in the European Union and
Norway is between 0.36% and 0.44%5.

Development and Course Opioid use disorder can begin at any age, but
problems associated with opioid use are most commonly first observed in
the late teens or early 20s. Once opioid use disorder develops, it
usually continues over a period of many years, even though brief periods
of abstinence are frequent. In treated populations, relapse following
abstinence is common. Even though relapses do occur, and while some
long-term mortality rates may be as high as 2% per year, about 20%--30%
of individuals with opioid use disorder achieve long-term abstinence. An
exception concerns that of military service personnel who became
dependent on opioids in Vietnam; over 90% of this population who had
been dependent on opioids during deployment in Vietnam achieved
abstinence after they returned, but they experienced increased rates of
alcohol or amphetamine use disorder as well as increased suicidality10.
Increasing age is associated with a decrease in prevalence as a result
of early mortality and the remission of symptoms after age 40 years
(i.e., "maturing out"). However, many individuals continue have
presentations that meet opioid use disorder criteria for decades8.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. The risk for
opioid use disorder can be related to individual, family, peer, and
social environmental factors9, 13, but within these domains, genetic
factors play a particularly important role both directly and indirectly.
For instance, impulsivity and novelty seeking are individual
temperaments that relate to the propensity to develop a substance use
disorder but may themselves be genetically determined. Peer factors may
relate to genetic predisposition in terms of how an individual selects
his or her environment.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues

Despite small variations regarding individual criterion items, opioid
use disorder diagnostic criteria perform equally well across most
race/ethnicity groups. Individuals from ethnic minority populations
living in economically deprived areas have been overrepresented among
individuals with opioid use disorder. However, over time, opioid use
disorder is seen more often among white middle-class individuals,
especially females, suggesting that differences in use reflect the
availability of opioid drugs and that other social factors may impact
prevalence. Medical personnel who have ready access to opioids may be at
increased risk for opioid use disorder.

Diagnostic Markers Routine urine toxicology test results are often
positive for opioid drugs in individuals with opioid use disorder. Urine
test results remain positive for most opioids (e.g., heroin, morphine,
codeine, oxycodone, propoxyphene) for 12--36 hours after administration.
Fentanyl is not detected by standard urine tests but can be identified
by more specialized procedures for several days. Methadone,
buprenorphine (or buprenorphine/naloxone combination), and LAAM
(L-alpha-acetylmethadol) have to be specifically tested for and will not
cause a positive result on routine tests for opiates. They can be
detected for several days up to more than 1 week. Laboratory evidence of
the presence of other substances (e.g., cocaine, marijuana, alcohol,
amphetamines, benzodiazepines) is common. Screening test results for
hepatitis A, B, and C virus are positive in as many as 80%--90% of
injection opioid users, either for hepatitis antigen (signifying active
infection) or for hepatitis antibody (signifying past infection). HIV is
prevalent in injection opioid users as well. Mildly elevated liver
function test results are common, either as a result of resolving
hepatitis or from toxic injury to the liver due to contaminants that
have been mixed with the injected opioid. Subtle changes in cortisol
secretion patterns and body temperature regulation have been observed
for up to 6 months following opioid detoxification.

Suicide Risk Similar to the risk generally observed for all substance
use disorders, opioid use disorder is associated with a heightened risk
for suicide attempts and completed suicides. Particularly notable are
both accidental and deliberate opioid overdoses. Some suicide risk
factors overlap with risk factors for an opioid use disorder. In
addition, repeated opioid intoxication or withdrawal

may be associated with severe depressions that, although temporary, can
be intense enough to lead to suicide attempts and completed suicides.
Available data suggest that nonfatal accidental opioid overdose (which
is common) and attempted suicide are distinct clinically significant
problems that should not be mistaken for each other.

Functional Consequences of Opioid Use Disorder Opioid use is associated
with a lack of mucous membrane secretions, causing dry mouth and nose.
Slowing of gastrointestinal activity and a decrease in gut motility can
produce severe constipation. Visual acuity may be impaired as a result
of pupillary constriction with acute administration. In individuals who
inject opioids, sclerosed veins ("tracks") and puncture marks on the
lower portions of the upper extremities are common. Veins sometimes
become so severely sclerosed that peripheral edema develops, and
individuals switch to injecting in veins in the legs, neck, or groin.
When these veins become unusable, individuals often inject directly into
their subcutaneous tissue ("skin-popping"), resulting in cellulitis,
abscesses, and circular-appearing scars from healed skin lesions.
Tetanus and Clostridium botulinum infections are relatively rare but
extremely serious consequences of injecting opioids, especially with
contaminated needles. Infections may also occur in other organs and
include bacterial endocarditis, hepatitis, and HIV infection. Hepatitis
C infections, for example, may occur in up to 90% of persons who inject
opioids. In addition, the prevalence of HIV infection can be high among
individuals who inject drugs, a large proportion of whom are individuals
with opioid use disorder. HIV infection rates have been reported to be
as high as 60% among heroin users with opioid use disorder in some areas
of the United States or the Russian Federation. However, the incidence
may also be 10% or less in other areas, especially those where access to
clean injection material and paraphernalia is facilitated6. Tuberculosis
is a particularly serious problem among individuals who use drugs
intravenously, especially those who are dependent on heroin; infection
is usually asymptomatic and evident only by the presence of a positive
tuberculin skin test. However, many cases of active tuberculosis have
been found, especially among those who are infected with HIV. These
individuals often have a newly acquired infection but also are likely to

experience reactivation of a prior infection because of impaired immune
function. Individuals who sniff heroin or other opioids into the nose
("snorting") often develop irritation of the nasal mucosa, sometimes
accompanied by perforation of the nasal septum. Difficulties in sexual
functioning are common. Males often experience erectile dysfunction
during intoxication or chronic use. Females commonly have disturbances
of reproductive function and irregular menses. In relation to infections
such as cellulitis, hepatitis, HIV infection, tuberculosis, and
endocarditis, opioid use disorder is associated with a mortality rate as
high as 1.5%--2% per year. Death most often results from overdose,
accidents, injuries, AIDS, or other general medical complications.
Accidents and injuries due to violence that is associated with buying or
selling drugs are common. In some areas, violence accounts for more
opioid-related deaths than overdose or HIV infection. Physiological
dependence on opioids may occur in about half of the infants born to
females with opioid use disorder; this can produce a severe withdrawal
syndrome requiring medical treatment. Although low birth weight is also
seen in children of mothers with opioid use disorder, it is usually not
marked and is generally not associated with serious adverse
consequences.

Differential Diagnosis Opioid-induced mental disorders. Opioid-induced
disorders occur frequently in individuals with opioid use disorder.
Opioid-induced disorders may be characterized by symptoms (e.g.,
depressed mood) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., persistent
depressive disorder \[dysthymia\] vs. opioid-induced depressive
disorder, with depressive features, with onset during intoxication).
Opioids are less likely to produce symptoms of mental disturbance than
are most other drugs of abuse. Opioid intoxication and opioid withdrawal
are distinguished from the other opioid-induced disorders (e.g.,
opioid-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication)
because the symptoms in these latter disorders predominate the clinical
presentation and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical
attention. Other substance intoxication. Alcohol intoxication and
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication can cause a clinical
picture that

resembles that for opioid intoxication. A diagnosis of alcohol or
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication can usually be made based
on the absence of pupillary constriction or the lack of a response to
naloxone challenge. In some cases, intoxication may be due both to
opioids and to alcohol or other sedatives. In these cases, the naloxone
challenge will not reverse all of the sedative effects. Other withdrawal
disorders. The anxiety and restlessness associated with opioid
withdrawal resemble symptoms seen in sedative-hypnotic withdrawal.
However, opioid withdrawal is also accompanied by rhinorrhea,
lacrimation, and pupillary dilation, which are not seen in sedative-type
withdrawal. Dilated pupils are also seen in hallucinogen intoxication
and stimulant intoxication. However, other signs or symptoms of opioid
withdrawal, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps,
rhinorrhea, or lacrimation, are not present.

Comorbidity The most common medical conditions associated with opioid
use disorder are viral (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus) and bacterial
infections, particularly among users of opioids by injection. These
infections are less common in opioid use disorder with prescription
opioids. Opioid use disorder is often associated with other substance
use disorders, especially those involving tobacco, alcohol, cannabis,
stimulants, and benzodiazepines, which are often taken to reduce
symptoms of opioid withdrawal or craving for opioids, or to enhance the
effects of administered opioids. Individuals with opioid use disorder
are at risk for the development of mild to moderate depression that
meets symptomatic and duration criteria for persistent depressive
disorder (dysthymia) or, in some cases, for major depressive disorder1.
These symptoms may represent an opioid-induced depressive disorder or an
exacerbation of a preexisting primary depressive disorder. Periods of
depression are especially common during chronic intoxication or in
association with physical or psychosocial stressors that are related to
the opioid use disorder. Insomnia is common, especially during
withdrawal. Antisocial personality disorder is much more common in
individuals with opioid use disorder than in the general population1.
Posttraumatic stress disorder is also seen with increased frequency11. A
history of conduct

disorder in childhood or adolescence has been identified as a
significant risk factor for substance-related disorders, especially
opioid use disorder.

Opioid Intoxication Diagnostic Criteria a. Recent use of an opioid. b.
Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes
(e.g., initial euphoria followed by apathy, dysphoria,

psychomotor agitation or retardation, impaired judgment) that developed
during, or shortly after, opioid use. c. Pupillary constriction (or
pupillary dilation due to anoxia from severe overdose) and one (or more)
of the following signs or symptoms developing during, or shortly after,
opioid use: 1. Drowsiness or coma. 2. Slurred speech. 3. Impairment in
attention or memory. d. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to
another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder, including intoxication with another substance. Specify if:
With perceptual disturbances: This specifier may be noted in the rare
instance in which hallucinations with intact reality testing or
auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur in the absence of a
delirium. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether or not there is a comorbid opioid use disorder and
whether or not there are perceptual disturbances. For opioid
intoxication without perceptual disturbances: If a mild opioid use
disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.129, and if a moderate
or severe opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10CM code is F11.229.
If there is no comorbid opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is
F11.929. For opioid intoxication with perceptual disturbances: If a mild
opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F11.122, and if a
moderate or severe opioid use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10CM code is
F11.222. If there is no comorbid opioid use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM
code is F11.922.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of opioid intoxication is the
presence of clinically significant problematic behavioral or
psychological changes (e.g., initial euphoria followed by apathy,
dysphoria, psychomotor agitation or

retardation, impaired judgment) that develop during, or shortly after,
opioid use (Criteria A and B)1. Intoxication is accompanied by pupillary
constriction (unless there has been a severe overdose with consequent
anoxia and pupillary dilation) and one or more of the following signs:
drowsiness (described as being "on the nod"), slurred speech, and
impairment in attention or memory (Criterion C); drowsiness may progress
to coma. Individuals with opioid intoxication may demonstrate
inattention to the environment, even to the point of ignoring
potentially harmful events. The signs or symptoms must not be
attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained
by another mental disorder (Criterion D).

Differential Diagnosis Other substance intoxication. Alcohol
intoxication and sedativehypnotic intoxication can cause a clinical
picture that resembles opioid intoxication. A diagnosis of alcohol or
sedative-hypnotic intoxication can usually be made based on the absence
of pupillary constriction or the lack of a response to a naloxone
challenge. In some cases, intoxication may be due both to opioids and to
alcohol or other sedatives. In these cases, the naloxone challenge will
not reverse all of the sedative effects. Other opioid-related disorders.
Opioid intoxication is distinguished from the other opioid-induced
disorders (e.g., opioid-induced depressive disorder, with onset during
intoxication) because the symptoms in the latter disorders predominate
in the clinical presentation and meet full criteria for the relevant
disorder.

J Med 367(2):146--155, 2012 22784117

Opioid Withdrawal Diagnostic Criteria a. Presence of either of the
following:

292.0 (F11.23)

1. Cessation of (or reduction in) opioid use that has been heavy and
prolonged (i.e., several weeks or longer). 2. Administration of an
opioid antagonist after a period of opioid use. b. Three (or more) of
the following developing within minutes to several days after Criterion
A: 1. Dysphoric mood. 2. Nausea or vomiting. 3. Muscle aches. 4.
Lacrimation or rhinorrhea. 5. Pupillary dilation, piloerection, or
sweating. 6. Diarrhea. 7. Yawning. 8. Fever. 9. Insomnia. c. The signs
or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning. d. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another
medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for opioid
withdrawal is F11.23. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the
comorbid presence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder,
reflecting the fact that opioid withdrawal can only occur in the
presence of a moderate or severe opioid use disorder. It is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild opioid use disorder with opioid
withdrawal.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of opioid withdrawal is the
presence of a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops after the
cessation of (or reduction in)

opioid use that has been heavy and prolonged (Criterion A1). The
withdrawal syndrome can also be precipitated by administration of an
opioid antagonist (e.g., naloxone or naltrexone) after a period of
opioid use (Criterion A2). This may also occur after administration of
an opioid partial agonist such as buprenorphine to a person currently
using a full opioid agonist. Opioid withdrawal is characterized by a
pattern of signs and symptoms that are opposite to the acute agonist
effects. The first of these are subjective and consist of complaints of
anxiety, restlessness, and an "achy feeling" that is often located in
the back and legs, along with irritability and increased sensitivity to
pain. Three or more of the following must be present to make a diagnosis
of opioid withdrawal: dysphoric mood; nausea or vomiting; muscle aches;
lacrimation or rhinorrhea; pupillary dilation, piloerection, or
increased sweating; diarrhea; yawning; fever; and insomnia (Criterion
B). Piloerection and fever are associated with more severe withdrawal
and are not often seen in routine clinical practice because individuals
with opioid use disorder usually obtain substances before withdrawal
becomes that far advanced. These symptoms of opioid withdrawal must
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The
symptoms must not be attributable to another medical condition and are
not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D). Meeting
diagnostic criteria for opioid withdrawal alone is not sufficient for a
diagnosis of opioid use disorder, but concurrent symptoms of craving and
drug-seeking behavior are suggestive of comorbid opioid use disorder.
ICD10-CM codes only allow a diagnosis of opioid withdrawal in the
presence of comorbid moderate to severe opioid use disorder. The speed
and severity of withdrawal associated with opioids depend on the
half-life of the opioid used. Most individuals who are physiologically
dependent on short-acting drugs such as heroin begin to have withdrawal
symptoms within 6--12 hours after the last dose. Symptoms may take 2--4
days to emerge in the case of longer-acting drugs such as methadone,
LAAM (L-alpha-acetylmethadol), or buprenorphine. Acute withdrawal
symptoms for a short-acting opioid such as heroin usually peak within
1--3 days and gradually subside over a period of 5--7 days. Less acute
withdrawal symptoms can last for weeks to months. These more chronic
symptoms include anxiety, dysphoria, anhedonia, and insomnia.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Males with opioid withdrawal
may experience piloerection, sweating, and spontaneous ejaculations
while awake. Opioid withdrawal is distinct from opioid use disorder and
does not necessarily occur in the presence of the drug-seeking behavior
associated with opioid use disorder. Opioid withdrawal may occur in any
individual after cessation of repeated use of an opioid, whether in the
setting of medical management of pain, during opioid agonist therapy for
opioid use disorder, in the context of private recreational use, or
following attempts to self-treat symptoms of mental disorders with
opioids.

Prevalence Among individuals from various clinical settings, opioid
withdrawal occurred in 60% of individuals who had used heroin at least
once in the prior 12 months1.

Development and Course Opioid withdrawal is typical in the course of an
opioid use disorder. It can be part of an escalating pattern in which an
opioid is used to reduce withdrawal symptoms, in turn leading to more
withdrawal at a later time. For persons with an established opioid use
disorder, withdrawal and attempts to relieve withdrawal are typical2.

Differential Diagnosis Other withdrawal disorders. The anxiety and
restlessness associated with opioid withdrawal resemble symptoms seen in
sedative-hypnotic withdrawal. However, opioid withdrawal is also
accompanied by rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and pupillary dilation, which
are not seen in sedative-type withdrawal. Other substance intoxication.
Dilated pupils are also seen in hallucinogen intoxication and stimulant
intoxication. However, other signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal,
such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, rhinorrhea, and
lacrimation, are not present. Other opioid-induced disorders. Opioid
withdrawal is distinguished from the other opioid-induced disorders
(e.g., opioid-induced depressive

disorder, with onset during withdrawal) because the symptoms in these
latter disorders are in excess of those usually associated with opioid
withdrawal and meet full criteria for the relevant disorder.

Other Opioid-Induced Disorders The following opioid-induced disorders
are described in other chapters of the manual with disorders with which
they share phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced mental
disorders in these chapters): opioidinduced depressive disorder
("Depressive Disorders"); opioid-induced anxiety disorder ("Anxiety
Disorders"); opioid-induced sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake Disorders"); and
opioid-induced sexual dysfunction ("Sexual Dysfunctions"). For opioid
intoxication delirium and opioid withdrawal delirium, see the criteria
and discussion of delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders."
These opioid-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of opioid
intoxication or opioid withdrawal only when the symptoms are
sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Opioid-Related Disorder 292.9 (F11.99) This category applies
to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an opioid-related
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any specific
opioid-related disorder or any of the disorders in the substance-related
and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic
Intoxication Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal Other
Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-Induced Disorders Unspecified
Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-Related Disorder

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A
problematic pattern of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least
two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period: 1. Sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics are often taken in larger amounts or over a
longer period than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or
unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use. 3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary
to obtain the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic; use the sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic; or recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a
strong desire or urge to use the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic. 5.
Recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use resulting in a failure
to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g.,
repeated absences from work or poor work performance related to
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use; sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-related absences, suspensions, or expulsions from school;
neglect of children or household). 6. Continued sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use despite having persistent or recurrent social or
interpersonal problems caused

or exacerbated by the effects of sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics
(e.g., arguments with a spouse about consequences of intoxication;
physical fights). 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational
activities are given up or reduced because of sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use. 8. Recurrent sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use in
situations in which it is physically hazardous (e.g., driving an
automobile or operating a machine when impaired by sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic use). 9. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use is
continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical
or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
exacerbated by the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic. 10. Tolerance, as
defined by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased
amounts of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic to achieve intoxication
or desired effect. b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of
the same amount of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic. Note: This
criterion is not considered to be met for individuals taking sedatives,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics under medical supervision. 11. Withdrawal, as
manifested by either of the following: a. The characteristic withdrawal
syndrome for sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics (refer to Criteria A
and B of the criteria set for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal, pp. 557--558). b. Sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics (or a
closely related substance, such as alcohol) are taken to relieve or
avoid withdrawal symptoms. Note: This criterion is not considered to be
met for individuals taking sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics under
medical supervision.

Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder were previously met, none of the
criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder have been
met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the
exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic," may be met). In sustained
remission: After full criteria for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder have been met at any time during a
period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4,
"Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic," may be met). Specify if: In a controlled environment: This
additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment
where access to sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics is restricted.
Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal; or another sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolyticinduced mental disorder is also present, do not use the codes
below for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. Instead the
comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is indicated in
the 4th character of the sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced
disorder (see the coding note for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; or specific
sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced mental disorder). For
example, if there is comorbid sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder and sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder, only the sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder code is given with the 4th
character indicating whether the comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F13.14 for mild
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative-,
hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder or F13.24 for a
moderate or severe

sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative-,
hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced depressive disorder. Specify current
severity: 305.40 (F13.10) Mild: Presence of 2--3 symptoms. 304.10
(F13.20) Moderate: Presence of 4--5 symptoms. 304.10 (F13.20) Severe:
Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers "In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier
of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Diagnostic Features Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances include
benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine-like drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zaleplon),
carbamates (e.g., glutethimide, meprobamate), barbiturates (e.g.,
secobarbital), and barbiturate-like hypnotics (e.g., glutethimide,
methaqualone). This class of substances includes all prescription
sleeping medications and almost all prescription antianxiety
medications. Nonbenzodiazepine antianxiety agents (e.g., buspirone,
gepirone) are not included in this class because they do not appear to
be associated with significant misuse. Like alcohol, these agents are
brain depressants and can produce similar substance/medication-induced
and substance use disorders. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
substances are available both by prescription and illegally. Some
individuals who obtain these substances by prescription will develop a
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, while others who misuse
these substances or use them for intoxication will not develop a use
disorder. In particular, sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics with rapid
onset and/or short to intermediate lengths of action may be taken for
intoxication purposes, although longer acting substances in this class
may be taken for intoxication as well8.

Craving (Criterion A4), either while using or during a period of
abstinence, is a typical feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder. Misuse of substances from this class may occur on its own
or in conjunction with use of other substances. For example, individuals
may use intoxicating doses of sedatives or benzodiazepines to "come
down" from cocaine or amphetamines or use high doses of benzodiazepines
in combination with methadone to "boost" its effects6. Repeated absences
or poor work performance, school absences, suspensions or expulsions,
and neglect of children or household (Criterion A5) may be related to
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, as may the continued use
of the substances despite arguments with a spouse about consequences of
intoxication or despite physical fights (Criterion A6). Limiting contact
with family or friends, avoiding work or school, or stopping
participation in hobbies, sports, or games (Criterion A7) and recurrent
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use when driving an automobile or
operating a machine when impaired by sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use (Criterion A8) are also seen in sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder. Very significant levels of tolerance and withdrawal can
develop to the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic. There may be evidence
of tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of a diagnosis of a sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder in an individual who has abruptly
discontinued use of benzodiazepines that were taken for long periods of
time at prescribed and therapeutic doses11. In these cases, an
additional diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder
is made only if other criteria are met. That is, sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic medications may be prescribed for appropriate medical
purposes, and depending on the dose regimen, these drugs may then
produce tolerance and withdrawal. If these drugs are prescribed or
recommended for appropriate medical purposes, and if they are used as
prescribed, the resulting tolerance or withdrawal does not meet the
criteria for diagnosing a substance use disorder. However, it is
necessary to determine whether the drugs were appropriately prescribed
and used (e.g., falsifying medical symptoms to obtain the medication;
using more medication than prescribed; obtaining the medication from
several doctors without informing them of the others' involvement).
Given the unidimensional nature of the symptoms of sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic use disorder5, severity is based on the number of criteria

endorsed.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder is often associated with other substance use
disorders (e.g., alcohol, cannabis, opioid, stimulant use disorders).
Sedatives are often used to alleviate the unwanted effects of these
other substances. With repeated use of the substance, tolerance develops
to the sedative effects, and a progressively higher dose is used.
However, tolerance to brain stem depressant effects develops much more
slowly, and as the individual takes more substance to achieve euphoria
or other desired effects, there may be a sudden onset of respiratory
depression and hypotension, which may result in death. Intense or
repeated sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication may be
associated with severe depression that, although temporary, can lead to
suicide attempt and completed suicide.

Prevalence The 12-month prevalences of DSM-IV sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder are estimated to be 0.3% among 12- to
17-year-olds and 0.2% among adults age 18 years and older3, 12. Rates of
DSM-IV sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder are slightly
greater among adult males (0.3%) than among adult females, but for 12-
to 17-year-olds, the rate for females (0.4%) exceeds that for males
(0.2%). The 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder decreases as a function of age and is greatest
among 18- to 29-year-olds (0.5%) and lowest among individuals 65 years
and older (0.04%). Twelve-month prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder varies across racial/ethnic subgroups of the
U.S. population3, 12. For 12- to 17-year-olds, rates are greatest among
whites (0.3%) relative to African Americans (0.2%), Hispanics (0.2%),
Native Americans (0.1%), and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
(0.1%). Among adults, 12month prevalence is greatest among Native
Americans and Alaska Natives (0.8%), with rates of approximately 0.2%
among African Americans, whites, and Hispanics and 0.1% among Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders.

Development and Course The usual course of sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder involves individuals in their teens or 20s who
escalate their occasional use of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
agents to the point at which they develop problems that meet criteria
for a diagnosis8. This pattern may be especially likely among
individuals who have other substance use disorders (e.g., alcohol,
opioids, stimulants). An initial pattern of intermittent use socially
(e.g., at parties) can lead to daily use and high levels of tolerance.
Once this occurs, an increasing level of interpersonal difficulties, as
well as increasingly severe episodes of cognitive dysfunction and
physiological withdrawal, can be expected. The second and less
frequently observed clinical course begins with an individual who
originally obtained the medication by prescription from a physician,
usually for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, or somatic complaints.
As either tolerance or a need for higher doses of the medication
develops, there is a gradual increase in the dose and frequency of
selfadministration. The individual is likely to continue to justify use
on the basis of his or her original symptoms of anxiety or insomnia, but
substanceseeking behavior becomes more prominent, and the individual may
seek out multiple physicians to obtain sufficient supplies of the
medication. Tolerance can reach high levels, and withdrawal (including
seizures and withdrawal delirium) may occur. As with many substance use
disorders, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder generally has
an onset during adolescence or early adult life. There is an increased
risk for misuse and problems from many psychoactive substances as
individuals age8. In particular, cognitive impairment increases as a
side effect with age, and the metabolism of sedatives, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics decreases with age among older individuals. Both acute and
chronic toxic effects of these substances, especially effects on
cognition, memory, and motor coordination, are likely to increase with
age as a consequence of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic age-related
changes. Individuals with major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) are
more likely to develop intoxication and impaired physiological
functioning at lower doses. Deliberate intoxication to achieve a "high"
is most likely to be observed in teenagers and individuals in their
20s8. Problems associated with

sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are also seen in individuals in
their 40s and older who escalate the dose of prescribed medications. In
older individuals, intoxication can resemble a progressive dementia.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Impulsivity and novelty
seeking are individual temperaments that relate to the propensity to
develop a substance use disorder but may themselves be genetically
determined. Environmental. Since sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics
are all pharmaceuticals, a key risk factor relates to availability of
the substances. In the United States, the historical patterns of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic misuse relate to the broad prescribing
patterns. For instance, a marked decrease in prescription of
barbiturates was associated with an increase in benzodiazepine
prescribing. Peer factors may relate to genetic predisposition in terms
of how individuals select their environment. Other individuals at
heightened risk might include those with alcohol use disorder who may
receive repeated prescriptions in response to their complaints of
alcohol-related anxiety or insomnia. Genetic and physiological. As for
other substance use disorders, the risk for sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder can be related to individual, family, peer,
social, and environmental factors7, 13. Within these domains, genetic
factors play a particularly important role both directly and indirectly.
Overall, across development, genetic factors seem to play a larger role
in the onset of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder as
individuals age through puberty into adult life.

Course modifiers Early onset of use is associated with greater
likelihood for developing a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
disorder9.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues There are marked variations in
prescription patterns (and availability) of this class of substances in
different countries, which may lead to variations in prevalence of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorders.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Females may be at higher risk than males for prescription drug misuse of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances.

Diagnostic Markers Almost all sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
substances can be identified through laboratory evaluations of urine or
blood (the latter of which can quantify the amounts of these agents in
the body). Urine tests are likely to remain positive for up to
approximately 1 week after the use of long-acting substances, such as
diazepam or flurazepam8.

Functional Consequences of Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Use
Disorder The social and interpersonal consequences of sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder mimic those of alcohol in terms of
the potential for disinhibited behavior8. Accidents, interpersonal
difficulties (such as arguments or fights), and interference with work
or school performance are all common outcomes. Physical examination is
likely to reveal evidence of a mild decrease in most aspects of
autonomic nervous system functioning, including a slower pulse, a
slightly decreased respiratory rate, and a slight drop in blood pressure
(most likely to occur with postural changes). At high doses, sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic substances can be lethal, particularly when
mixed with alcohol, although the lethal dosage varies considerably among
the specific substances. Overdoses may be associated with a
deterioration in vital signs that signals an impending medical emergency
(e.g., respiratory arrest from barbiturates). There may be consequences
of trauma (e.g., internal bleeding or a subdural hematoma) from
accidents that occur while intoxicated. Intravenous use of these
substances can result in medical complications related to the use of
contaminated needles (e.g., hepatitis and HIV). Acute intoxication can
result in accidental injuries and automobile accidents. For elderly
individuals, even short-term use of these sedating medications at
prescribed doses can be associated with an increased risk for cognitive
problems and falls. The disinhibiting effects of these agents, like
alcohol, may potentially contribute to overly aggressive behavior, with
subsequent interpersonal and legal problems. Accidental or deliberate
overdoses, similar to those observed for alcohol use disorder or
repeated

alcohol intoxication, can occur. In contrast to their wide margin of
safety when used alone, benzodiazepines taken in combination with
alcohol can be particularly dangerous, and accidental overdoses are
reported commonly. Accidental overdoses have also been reported in
individuals who deliberately misuse barbiturates and other
nonbenzodiazepine sedatives (e.g., methaqualone), but since these agents
are much less available than the benzodiazepines, the frequency of
overdosing is low in most settings.

Differential Diagnosis Other mental disorders or medical conditions.
Individuals with sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders
may present with symptoms (e.g., anxiety) that resemble primary mental
disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder vs. sedative-, hypnotic-,
or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal).
The slurred speech, incoordination, and other associated features
characteristic of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication could
be the result of another medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis) or
of a prior head trauma (e.g., a subdural hematoma). Alcohol use
disorder. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder must be
differentiated from alcohol use disorder. Clinically appropriate use of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications. Individuals may continue
to take benzodiazepine medication according to a physician's direction
for a legitimate medical indication over extended periods of time. Even
if physiological signs of tolerance or withdrawal are manifested, many
of these individuals do not develop symptoms that meet the criteria for
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder because they are not
preoccupied with obtaining the substance and its use does not interfere
with their performance of usual social or occupational roles11.

Comorbidity Nonmedical use of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic agents
is associated with alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder, and,
generally, illicit drug use1. There may also be an overlap between
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and antisocial
personality disorder2, depressive,

bipolar, and anxiety disorders1, 4, and other substance use disorders,
such as alcohol use disorder and illicit drug use disorders10.
Antisocial behavior and antisocial personality disorder are especially
associated with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder when the
substances are obtained illegally.

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication Diagnostic Criteria a.
Recent use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic. b. Clinically
significant maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes (e.g.,
inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired
judgment) that developed during, or shortly after, sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic use. c. One (or more) of the following signs or symptoms
developing during, or shortly after, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use: 1. Slurred speech. 2. Incoordination.

3. Unsteady gait. 4. Nystagmus. 5. Impairment in cognition (e.g.,
attention, memory). 6. Stupor or coma. d. The signs or symptoms are not
attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained
by another mental disorder, including intoxication with another
substance. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code
depends on whether there is a comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
use disorder. If a mild sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder
is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F13.129, and if a moderate or severe
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10CM
code is F13.229. If there is no comorbid sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F13.929. Note: For

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues; Diagnostic Markers; Functional
Consequences of Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Intoxication; and
Comorbidity, see the corresponding sections in sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic use disorder.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic intoxication1 is the presence of clinically significant
maladaptive behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., inappropriate
sexual or aggressive behavior, mood lability, impaired judgment,
impaired social or occupational functioning) that develop during, or
shortly after, use of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic (Criteria A
and B). As with other brain depressants, such as alcohol, these
behaviors may be accompanied by slurred speech, incoordination (at
levels that can interfere with driving abilities and with performing
usual activities to the point of causing falls or automobile accidents),
an unsteady gait, nystagmus, impairment in cognition (e.g., attentional
or memory problems), and stupor or coma (Criterion C). Memory impairment
is a prominent feature of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication
and is most often characterized by an anterograde amnesia that resembles
"alcoholic

blackouts," which can be disturbing to the individual. The symptoms must
not be attributable to another medical condition and are not better
explained by another mental disorder (Criterion D). Intoxication may
occur in individuals who are receiving these substances by prescription,
are borrowing the medication from friends or relatives, or are
deliberately taking the substance to achieve intoxication.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Associated features include
taking more medication than prescribed, taking multiple different
medications, or mixing sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic agents with
alcohol, which can markedly increase the effects of these agents.

Prevalence The prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
intoxication in the general population is unclear. However, it is
probable that most nonmedical users of sedatives, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics would at some time have signs or symptoms that meet criteria
for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication; if so, then the
prevalence of nonmedical sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use in the
general population may be similar to the prevalence of sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication. For example, tranquilizers are
used nonmedically by 2.2% of Americans older than 12 years2.

Differential Diagnosis Alcohol use disorders. Since the clinical
presentations may be identical, distinguishing sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic intoxication from alcohol use disorders requires evidence for
recent ingestion of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic medications by
self-report, informant report, or toxicological testing. Many
individuals who misuse sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may also
misuse alcohol and other substances, and so multiple intoxication
diagnoses are possible. Alcohol intoxication. Alcohol intoxication may
be distinguished from sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication by
the smell of alcohol on the breath. Otherwise, the features of the two
disorders may be similar.

Other sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders. Sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication is distinguished from the other
sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders (e.g., sedative-,
hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during
withdrawal) because the symptoms in the latter disorders predominate in
the clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant clinical
attention. Neurocognitive disorders. In situations of cognitive
impairment, traumatic brain injury, and delirium from other causes,
sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may be intoxicating at quite low
dosages. The differential diagnosis in these complex settings is based
on the predominant syndrome. An additional diagnosis of sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication may be appropriate even if the
substance has been ingested at a low dosage in the setting of these
other (or similar) co-occurring conditions.

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal Diagnostic Criteria a.
Cessation of (or reduction in) sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
that has been prolonged. b. Two (or more) of the following, developing
within several hours to a few days after the cessation of (or reduction
in) sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use described in Criterion A: 1.
Autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., sweating or pulse rate greater than 100
bpm). 2. Hand tremor.

3. Insomnia. 4. Nausea or vomiting. 5. Transient visual, tactile, or
auditory hallucinations or illusions. 6. Psychomotor agitation. 7.
Anxiety. 8. Grand mal seizures. c. The signs or symptoms in Criterion B
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning. d. The signs or
symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or
withdrawal from another substance. Specify if: With perceptual
disturbances: This specifier may be noted when hallucinations with
intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or tactile illusions occur
in the absence of a delirium. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0.
The ICD-10-CM code for sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal
depends on whether or not there is a comorbid moderate or severe
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and whether or not there
are perceptual disturbances. For sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal without perceptual disturbances, the ICD-10-CM code is
F13.239. For sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal with
perceptual disturbances, the ICD-10-CM code is F13.232. Note that the
ICD-10-CM codes indicate the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder, reflecting the fact that
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal can only occur in the
presence of a moderate or severe sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder with sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal. Note: For information on Development and Course;
Risk and Prognostic Factors; Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues;
Functional Consequences of

Sedative, Hypnotic, or Anxiolytic Withdrawal; and Comorbidity, see the
corresponding sections in sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use
disorder.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal is the presence of a characteristic syndrome that
develops after a marked decrease in or cessation of intake after several
weeks or more of regular use (Criteria A and B). This withdrawal
syndrome is characterized by two or more symptoms (similar to alcohol
withdrawal) that include autonomic hyperactivity (e.g., increases in
heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, or body temperature, along
with sweating); a tremor of the hands; insomnia; nausea, sometimes
accompanied by vomiting; anxiety; and psychomotor agitation. A grand mal
seizure may occur in perhaps as many as 20%--30% of individuals
undergoing untreated withdrawal from these substances. In severe
withdrawal, visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations or illusions can
occur but are usually in the context of a delirium. If the individual's
reality testing is intact (i.e., he or she knows the substance is
causing the hallucinations) and the illusions occur in a clear
sensorium, the specifier "with perceptual disturbances" can be noted.
When hallucinations occur in the absence of intact reality testing, a
diagnosis of substance/medicationinduced psychotic disorder should be
considered. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to
another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder (e.g., alcohol withdrawal or generalized anxiety disorder)
(Criterion D). Relief of withdrawal symptoms with administration of any
sedative-hypnotic agent would support a diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic,
or anxiolytic withdrawal.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The timing and severity of the
withdrawal syndrome will differ depending on the specific substance and
its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. For example, withdrawal from
shorter-acting substances that are rapidly absorbed and that have no
active metabolites (e.g., triazolam) can begin within hours after the
substance is stopped; withdrawal from substances with long-acting
metabolites (e.g., diazepam) may not begin for 1--2 days or longer. The
withdrawal syndrome produced by substances in this class may

be characterized by the development of a delirium that can be
lifethreatening. There may be evidence of tolerance and withdrawal in
the absence of a diagnosis of a substance use disorder in an individual
who has abruptly discontinued benzodiazepines that were taken for long
periods of time at prescribed and therapeutic doses. However, ICD-10-CM
codes only allow a diagnosis of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal in the presence of comorbid moderate to severe sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. The time course of the withdrawal
syndrome is generally predicted by the half-life of the substance.
Medications whose actions typically last about 10 hours or less (e.g.,
lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam) produce withdrawal symptoms within 6--8
hours of decreasing blood levels that peak in intensity on the second
day and improve markedly by the fourth or fifth day. For substances with
longer half-lives (e.g., diazepam), symptoms may not develop for more
than 1 week, peak in intensity during the second week, and decrease
markedly during the third or fourth week. There may be additional
longer-term symptoms at a much lower level of intensity that persist for
several months. The longer the substance has been taken and the higher
the dosages used, the more likely it is that there will be severe
withdrawal. However, withdrawal has been reported with as little as 15
mg of diazepam (or its equivalent in other benzodiazepines) when taken
daily for several months. Doses of approximately 40 mg of diazepam (or
its equivalent) daily are more likely to produce clinically relevant
withdrawal symptoms, and even higher doses (e.g., 100 mg of diazepam)
are more likely to be followed by withdrawal seizures or delirium.
Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal delirium is characterized
by disturbances in consciousness and cognition, with visual, tactile, or
auditory hallucinations. When present, sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal delirium should be diagnosed instead of withdrawal.

Prevalence The prevalence of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal is unclear.

Diagnostic Markers Seizures and autonomic instability in the setting of
a history of prolonged exposure to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
medications suggest a high

likelihood of sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal.

Differential Diagnosis Other medical disorders. The symptoms of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal may be mimicked by other
medical conditions (e.g., hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis). If
seizures are a feature of the sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal, the differential diagnosis includes the various causes of
seizures (e.g., infections, head injury, poisonings). Essential tremor.
Essential tremor, a disorder that frequently runs in families, may
erroneously suggest the tremulousness associated with sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal. Alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol
withdrawal produces a syndrome very similar to that of sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal. Other sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced disorders. Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
withdrawal is distinguished from the other sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced disorders (e.g., sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal)
because the symptoms in the latter disorders predominate in the clinical
presentation and are severe enough to warrant clinical attention.
Anxiety disorders. Recurrence or worsening of an underlying anxiety
disorder produces a syndrome similar to sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal. Withdrawal would be suspected with an abrupt
reduction in the dosage of a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic
medication. When a taper is under way, distinguishing the withdrawal
syndrome from the underlying anxiety disorder can be difficult1, 2. As
with alcohol, lingering withdrawal symptoms (e.g., anxiety, moodiness,
and trouble sleeping) can be mistaken for
non-substance/medication-induced anxiety or depressive disorders (e.g.,
generalized anxiety disorder).

Other Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or Anxiolytic-Induced Disorders The
following sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders are
described in other chapters of the manual with disorders with which they
share phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced mental
disorders in these chapters): sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other
Psychotic Disorders"); sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced
bipolar disorder ("Bipolar and Related Disorders"); sedative-,
hypnotic-, or anxiolyticinduced depressive disorder ("Depressive
Disorders"); sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced anxiety
disorder ("Anxiety Disorders"); sedative-, hypnotic-, or
anxiolytic-induced sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake Disorders"); sedative-,
hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced sexual dysfunction ("Sexual
Dysfunctions"); and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced major or
mild neurocognitive disorder ("Neurocognitive Disorders"). For sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication delirium and sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and discussion of
delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders." These sedative-,
hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-induced disorders are diagnosed instead of
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic intoxication or sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to
warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Sedative-, Hypnotic-, or AnxiolyticRelated Disorder 292.9
(F13.99) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of a sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-related disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any

specific sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-related disorder or any of
the disorders in the substance-related and addictive disorders
diagnostic class.

Stimulant-Related Disorders Stimulant Use Disorder Stimulant
Intoxication Stimulant Withdrawal Other Stimulant-Induced Disorders
Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder

Stimulant Use Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A pattern of
amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant use leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least
two of the following, occurring within a 12month period: 1. The
stimulant is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than
was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to
cut down or control stimulant use. 3. A great deal of time is spent in
activities necessary to obtain the stimulant, use the stimulant, or
recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
the stimulant. 5. Recurrent stimulant use resulting in a failure to
fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. 6. Continued
stimulant use despite having persistent or recurrent social or
interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the
stimulant. 7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities
are given up or reduced because of stimulant use. 8. Recurrent stimulant
use in situations in which it is physically hazardous.

9. Stimulant use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent
or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have
been caused or exacerbated by the stimulant. 10. Tolerance, as defined
by either of the following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of
the stimulant to achieve intoxication or desired effect. b. A markedly
diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the
stimulant. Note: This criterion is not considered to be met for those
taking stimulant medications solely under appropriate medical
supervision, such as medications for attentiondeficit/hyperactivity
disorder or narcolepsy. 11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the
following: a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the stimulant
(refer to Criteria A and B of the criteria set for stimulant withdrawal,
p. 569). b. The stimulant (or a closely related substance) is taken to
relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Note: This criterion is not
considered to be met for those taking stimulant medications solely under
appropriate medical supervision, such as medications for
attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder or narcolepsy. Specify if: In
early remission: After full criteria for stimulant use disorder were
previously met, none of the criteria for stimulant use disorder have
been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months (with the
exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
the stimulant," may be met). In sustained remission: After full criteria
for stimulant use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for
stimulant use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12
months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a
strong desire or urge to use the stimulant," may be met).

Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is
used if the individual is in an environment where access to stimulants
is restricted. Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM
codes: If an amphetamine intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or
another amphetamine-induced mental disorder is also present, do not use
the codes below for amphetamine use disorder. Instead, the comorbid
amphetamine use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the
amphetamine-induced disorder code (see the coding note for amphetamine
intoxication, amphetamine withdrawal, or a specific amphetamine-induced
mental disorder). For example, if there is comorbid amphetamine-type or
other stimulant-induced depressive disorder and amphetamine-type or
other stimulant use disorder, only the amphetaminetype or other
stimulant-induced depressive disorder code is given, with the 4th
character indicating whether the comorbid amphetamine-type or other
stimulant use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F15.14 for mild
amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disorder with amphetamine-type
or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder or F15.24 for a moderate
or severe amphetamine-type or other stimulant use disorder with
amphetamine-type or other stimulant-induced depressive disorder.
Similarly, if there is comorbid cocaine-induced depressive disorder and
cocaine use disorder, only the cocaine-induced depressive disorder code
is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid cocaine
use disorder is mild, moderate, or severe: F14.14 for mild cocaine use
disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder or F14.24 for a
moderate or severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive
disorder. Specify current severity: Mild: Presence of 2--3 symptoms.
305.70 (F15.10) Amphetamine-type substance 305.60 (F14.10) Cocaine
305.70 (F15.10) Other or unspecified stimulant Moderate: Presence of
4--5 symptoms. 304.40 (F15.20) Amphetamine-type substance 304.20
(F14.20) Cocaine 304.40 (F15.20) Other or unspecified stimulant

Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms. 304.40 (F15.20) Amphetamine-type
substance 304.20 (F14.20) Cocaine 304.40 (F15.20) Other or unspecified
stimulant

Specifiers "In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier
of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Diagnostic Features The amphetamine and amphetamine-type stimulants
include substances with a substituted-phenylethylamine structure, such
as amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine. Also included
are those substances that are structurally different but have similar
effects, such as methylphenidate. These substances are usually taken
orally or intravenously, although methamphetamine is also taken by the
nasal route. In addition to the synthetic amphetamine-type compounds,
there are naturally occurring, plant-derived stimulants such as khât.
Amphetamines and other stimulants may be obtained by prescription for
the treatment of obesity, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and
narcolepsy. Consequently, prescribed stimulants may be diverted into the
illegal market. The effects of amphetamines and amphetamine-like drugs
are similar to those of cocaine, such that the criteria for stimulant
use disorder are presented here as a single disorder with the ability to
specify the particular stimulant used by the individual. Cocaine may be
consumed in several preparations (e.g., coca leaves, coca paste, cocaine
hydrochloride, and cocaine alkaloids such as freebase and crack) that
differ in potency because of varying levels of purity and speed of
onset. However, in all forms of the substance, cocaine is the active
ingredient. Cocaine hydrochloride powder is usually "snorted" through
the nostrils or dissolved in water and injected intravenously.

Individuals exposed to amphetamine-type stimulants or cocaine can
develop stimulant use disorder as rapidly as 1 week, although the onset
is not always this rapid. Regardless of the route of administration,
tolerance occurs with repeated use. Withdrawal symptoms, particularly
hypersomnia, increased appetite, and dysphoria, can occur and can
enhance craving. Most individuals with stimulant use disorder have
experienced tolerance or withdrawal. Use patterns and course are similar
for disorders involving amphetaminetype stimulants and cocaine, as both
substances are potent central nervous system stimulants with similar
psychoactive and sympathomimetic effects. Amphetamine-type stimulants
are longer acting than cocaine and thus are used fewer times per day3.
Usage may be chronic or episodic, with binges punctuated by brief
non-use periods. Aggressive or violent behavior is common when high
doses are smoked, ingested, or administered intravenously. Intense
temporary anxiety resembling panic disorder or generalized anxiety
disorder, as well as paranoid ideation and psychotic episodes that
resemble schizophrenia, is seen with high-dose use. Withdrawal states
are associated with temporary but intense depressive symptoms that can
resemble a major depressive episode13, the depressive symptoms usually
resolve within 1 week14. Tolerance to amphetamine-type stimulants
develops and leads to escalation of the dose. Conversely, some users of
amphetamine-type stimulants develop sensitization, characterized by
enhanced effects.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis When injected or smoked,
stimulants typically produce an instant feeling of well-being,
confidence, and euphoria. Dramatic behavioral changes can rapidly
develop with stimulant use disorder. Chaotic behavior, social isolation,
aggressive behavior, and sexual dysfunction can result from longterm
stimulant use disorder. Individuals with acute intoxication may present
with rambling speech, headache, transient ideas of reference, and
tinnitus. There may be paranoid ideation, auditory hallucinations in a
clear sensorium, and tactile hallucinations, which the individual
usually recognizes as drug effects. Threats or acting out of aggressive
behavior may occur. Depression, suicidal ideation, irritability,
anhedonia, emotional lability, or disturbances

in attention and concentration commonly occur during withdrawal. Mental
disturbances associated with cocaine use usually resolve hours to days
after cessation of use but can persist for 1 month. Physiological
changes during stimulant withdrawal are opposite to those of the
intoxication phase, sometimes including bradycardia12. Temporary
depressive symptoms may meet symptomatic and duration criteria for major
depressive episode. Histories consistent with repeated panic attacks,
social anxiety disorder (social phobia)--like behavior, and generalized
anxiety--like syndromes are common, as are eating disorders. One extreme
instance of stimulant toxicity is stimulant-induced psychotic disorder,
a disorder that resembles schizophrenia, with delusions and
hallucinations. Individuals with stimulant use disorder often develop
conditioned responses to drug-related stimuli (e.g., craving on seeing
any white powderlike substance). These responses contribute to relapse,
are difficult to extinguish, and persist after detoxification.
Depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation or behavior can occur and are
generally the most serious problems seen during stimulant withdrawal.

Prevalence Stimulant use disorder: amphetamine-type stimulants.
Estimated 12month prevalence of amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder
in the United States is 0.2% among 12- to 17-year-olds and 0.2% among
individuals 18 years and older24. Rates are similar among adult males
and females (0.2%), but among 12- to 17-year-olds, the rate for females
(0.3%) is greater than that for males (0.1%). Intravenous stimulant use
has a male-to-female ratio of 3:1 or 4:1, but rates are more balanced
among non-injecting users, with males representing 54% of primary
treatment admissions. Twelve-month prevalence is greater among 18- to
29-year-olds (0.4%) compared with 45to 64-year-olds (0.1%). For 12- to
17-year-olds, rates are highest among whites and African Americans
(0.3%) compared with Hispanics (0.1%) and Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders (0.01%), with amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder
virtually absent among Native Americans. Among adults, rates are highest
among Native Americans and Alaska Natives (0.6%) compared with whites
(0.2%) and Hispanics (0.2%), with amphetamine-type stimulant use
disorder virtually absent among African Americans and Asian Americans
and Pacific Islanders. Past-year

nonprescribed use of prescription stimulants occurred among 5%--9% of
children through high school, with 5%--35% of college-age persons
reporting past-year use26. Stimulant use disorder: cocaine. Estimated
12-month prevalence of cocaine use disorder in the United States is 0.2%
among 12- to 17-year-olds and 0.3% among individuals 18 years and
older24. Rates are higher among males (0.4%) than among females (0.1%).
Rates are highest among 18- to 29-year-olds (0.6%) and lowest among 45-
to 64-year-olds (0.1%). Among adults, rates are greater among Native
Americans (0.8%) compared with African Americans (0.4%), Hispanics
(0.3%), whites (0.2%), and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.1%).
In contrast, for 12- to 17-year-olds, rates are similar among Hispanics
(0.2%), whites (0.2%), and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (0.2%);
and lower among African Americans (0.02%); with cocaine use disorder
virtually absent among Native Americans and Alaska Natives.

Development and Course Stimulant use disorders occur throughout all
levels of society and are more common among individuals ages 12--25
years compared with individuals 26 years and older22. First regular use
among individuals in treatment occurs, on average, at approximately age
23 years7. For primary methamphetamine--primary treatment admissions,
the average age is 31 years22. Some individuals begin stimulant use to
control weight or to improve performance in school, work, or athletics.
This includes obtaining medications such as methylphenidate or
amphetamine salts prescribed to others for the treatment of
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Stimulant use disorder can
develop rapidly with intravenous or smoked administration; among primary
admissions for amphetamine-type stimulant use, 66% reported smoking, 18%
reported injecting, and 10% reported snorting23. Patterns of stimulant
administration include episodic or daily (or almost daily) use. Episodic
use tends to be separated by 2 or more days of non-use (e.g., intense
use over a weekend or on one or more weekdays). "Binges" involve
continuous high-dose use over hours or days and are often associated
with physical dependence. Binges usually terminate only when

stimulant supplies are depleted or exhaustion ensues. Chronic daily use
may involve high or low doses, often with an increase in dose over time.
Stimulant smoking and intravenous use are associated with rapid
progression to severe-level stimulant use disorder, often occurring over
weeks to months. Intranasal use of cocaine and oral use of
amphetaminetype stimulants result in more gradual progression occurring
over months to years. With continuing use, there is a diminution of
pleasurable effects due to tolerance and an increase in dysphoric
effects.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Comorbid bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use
disorders are risk factors for developing stimulant use disorder and for
relapse to cocaine use in treatment samples15. Also, impulsivity and
similar personality traits may affect treatment outcomes. Childhood
conduct disorder and adult antisocial personality disorder are
associated with the later development of stimulantrelated disorders.
Environmental. Predictors of cocaine use among teenagers include
prenatal cocaine exposure, postnatal cocaine use by parents, and
exposure to community violence during childhood5. For youths, especially
females, risk factors include living in an unstable home environment,
having a psychiatric condition, and associating with dealers and
users17.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Stimulant use--attendant disorders
affect all racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, age, and gender groups.
Diagnostic issues may be related to societal consequences (e.g., arrest,
school suspensions, employment suspension). Despite small variations,
cocaine and other stimulant use disorder diagnostic criteria perform
equally across gender and race/ethnicity groups1, 18, 27, 28. Chronic
use of cocaine impairs cardiac left ventricular function in African
Americans16. Approximately 66% of individuals admitted for primary
methamphetamine/amphetamine-related disorders are nonHispanic white,
followed by 21% of Hispanic origin, 3% Asian and Pacific Islander, and
3% non-Hispanic black23.

Diagnostic Markers Benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, typically
remains in the urine for 1--3 days after a single dose and may be
present for 7--12 days in individuals using repeated high doses. Mildly
elevated liver function tests can be present in cocaine injectors or
users with concomitant alcohol use. There are no neurobiological markers
of diagnostic utility. Discontinuation of chronic cocaine use may be
associated with electroencephalographic changes, suggesting persistent
abnormalities10, alterations in secretion patterns of prolactin; and
downregulation of dopamine receptors. Short-half-life amphetamine-type
stimulants (MDMA \[3,4methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine\],
methamphetamine) can be detected for 1--3 days, and possibly up to 4
days depending on dosage and metabolism. Hair samples can be used to
detect presence of amphetaminetype stimulants for up to 90 days. Other
laboratory findings, as well as physical findings and other medical
conditions (e.g., weight loss, malnutrition; poor hygiene), are similar
for both cocaine and amphetaminetype stimulant use disorder.

Functional Disorder

Consequences

of

Stimulant

Use

Various medical conditions may occur depending on the route of
administration. Intranasal users often develop sinusitis, irritation,
bleeding of the nasal mucosa, and a perforated nasal septum. Individuals
who smoke the drugs are at increased risk for respiratory problems
(e.g., coughing, bronchitis, and pneumonitis). Injectors have puncture
marks and "tracks," most commonly on their forearms. Risk of HIV
infection increases with frequent intravenous injections and unsafe
sexual activity. Other sexually transmitted diseases, hepatitis, and
tuberculosis and other lung infections are also seen. Weight loss and
malnutrition are common4. Chest pain may be a common symptom during
stimulant intoxication19. Myocardial infarction, palpitations and
arrhythmias, sudden death from respiratory or cardiac arrest, and stroke
have been associated with stimulant use among young and otherwise
healthy individuals. Seizures can occur with stimulant use. Pneumothorax
can result from performing Valsalva-like maneuvers done to better absorb
inhaled smoke8. Traumatic injuries due to

violent behavior are common among individuals trafficking drugs. Cocaine
use is associated with irregularities in placental blood flow, abruptio
placentae, premature labor and delivery, and an increased prevalence of
infants with very low birth weights. Individuals with stimulant use
disorder may become involved in theft, prostitution, or drug dealing in
order to acquire drugs or money for drugs. Neurocognitive impairment is
common among methamphetamine users13, 20, 25. Oral health problems
include "meth mouth" with gum disease, tooth decay, and mouth sores
related to the toxic effects of smoking the drug and to bruxism while
intoxicated21. Adverse pulmonary effects appear to be less common for
amphetamine-type stimulants because they are smoked fewer times per day.
Emergency department visits are common for stimulantrelated mental
disorder symptoms, injury, skin infections, and dental pathology6.

Differential Diagnosis Primary mental disorders. Stimulant-induced
disorders may resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., major depressive
disorder) (for discussion of this differential diagnosis, see "Stimulant
Withdrawal"). The mental disturbances resulting from the effects of
stimulants should be distinguished from the symptoms of schizophrenia;
depressive and bipolar disorders; generalized anxiety disorder; and
panic disorder. Phencyclidine intoxication. Intoxication with
phencyclidine ("PCP" or "angel dust") or synthetic "designer drugs" such
as mephedrone (known by different names, including "bath salts") may
cause a similar clinical picture and can only be distinguished from
stimulant intoxication by the presence of cocaine or amphetamine-type
substance metabolites in a urine or plasma sample. Stimulant
intoxication and withdrawal. Stimulant intoxication and withdrawal are
distinguished from the other stimulant-induced disorders (e.g., anxiety
disorder, with onset during intoxication) because the symptoms in the
latter disorders predominate the clinical presentation and are severe
enough to warrant independent clinical attention.

Comorbidity

Stimulant-related disorders often co-occur with other substance use
disorders, especially those involving substances with sedative
properties, which are often taken to reduce insomnia, nervousness, and
other unpleasant side effects. Cocaine users often use alcohol, while
amphetamine-type stimulant users often use cannabis. Stimulant use
disorder may be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder,
antisocial personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, and gambling disorder. Cardiopulmonary problems are often
present in individuals seeking treatment for cocaine-related problems,
with chest pain being the most common9, 19. Medical problems occur in
response to adulterants used as "cutting" agents. Cocaine users who
ingest cocaine cut with levamisole, an antimicrobial and veterinary
medication, may experience agranulocytosis and febrile neutropenia2, 11.

weakness, respiratory depression, chest pain, or cardiac arrhythmias. 9.
Confusion, seizures, dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma. d. The signs or
symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not
better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication with
another substance. Specify the specific intoxicant (i.e.,
amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant). Specify if:

With perceptual disturbances: This specifier may be noted when
hallucinations with intact reality testing or auditory, visual, or
tactile illusions occur in the absence of a delirium. Coding note: The
ICD-9-CM code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether the
stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant; whether there
is a comorbid amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder; and
whether or not there are perceptual disturbances. For amphetamine,
cocaine, or other stimulant intoxication, without perceptual
disturbances: If a mild amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.129, and if a moderate or severe
amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM
code is F15.229. If there is no comorbid amphetamine or other stimulant
use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F15.929. Similarly, if a mild
cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.129, and if
a moderate or severe cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM
code is F14.229. If there is no comorbid cocaine use disorder, then the
ICD-10-CM code is F14.929. For amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant
intoxication, with perceptual disturbances: If a mild amphetamine or
other stimulant use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.122,
and if a moderate or severe amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder
is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F15.222. If there is no comorbid
amphetamine or other stimulant use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is
F15.922. Similarly, if a mild cocaine use disorder is comorbid, the
ICD-10-CM code is F14.122, and if a moderate or severe cocaine use
disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F14.222. If there is no
comorbid cocaine use disorder, then the ICD-10-CM code is F14.922.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of stimulant intoxication,
related to amphetamine-type stimulants and cocaine, is the presence of
clinically significant behavioral or psychological changes that develop
during, or shortly after, use of stimulants (Criteria A and B). Auditory
hallucinations may be prominent, as may paranoid ideation, and these
symptoms must be distinguished from an

independent psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. Stimulant
intoxication usually begins with a "high" feeling and includes one or
more of the following: euphoria with enhanced vigor, gregariousness,
hyperactivity, restlessness, hypervigilance, interpersonal sensitivity,
talkativeness, anxiety, tension, alertness, grandiosity, stereotyped and
repetitive behavior, anger, impaired judgment, and, in the case of
chronic intoxication, affective blunting with fatigue or sadness and
social withdrawal. These behavioral and psychological changes are
accompanied by two or more of the following signs and symptoms that
develop during or shortly after stimulant use: tachycardia or
bradycardia; pupillary dilation; elevated or lowered blood pressure;
perspiration or chills; nausea or vomiting; evidence of weight loss;
psychomotor agitation or retardation; muscular weakness, respiratory
depression, chest pain, or cardiac arrhythmias; and confusion, seizures,
dyskinesias, dystonias, or coma (Criterion C). Intoxication, either
acute or chronic, is often associated with impaired social or
occupational functioning. Severe intoxication can lead to convulsions,
cardiac arrhythmias, hyperpyrexia, and death. For the diagnosis of
stimulant intoxication to be made, the symptoms must not be attributable
to another medical condition and not better explained by another mental
disorder (Criterion D). While stimulant intoxication occurs in
individuals with stimulant use disorders, intoxication is not a
criterion for stimulant use disorder, which is confirmed by the presence
of two of the 11 diagnostic criteria for use disorder.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The magnitude and direction of
the behavioral and physiological changes depend on many variables,
including the dose used and the characteristics of the individual using
the substance or the context (e.g., tolerance, rate of absorption,
chronicity of use, context in which it is taken). Stimulant effects such
as euphoria, increased pulse and blood pressure, and psychomotor
activity are most commonly seen. Depressant effects such as sadness,
bradycardia, decreased blood pressure, and decreased psychomotor
activity are less common and generally emerge only with chronic
high-dose use.

Differential Diagnosis

Stimulant-induced disorders. Stimulant intoxication is distinguished
from the other stimulant-induced disorders (e.g., stimulant-induced
depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, anxiety
disorder) because the severity of the intoxication symptoms exceeds that
associated with the stimulant-induced disorders, and the symptoms
warrant independent clinical attention. Stimulant intoxication delirium
would be distinguished by a disturbance in level of awareness and change
in cognition. Other mental disorders. Salient mental disturbances
associated with stimulant intoxication should be distinguished from the
symptoms of schizophrenia, paranoid type; bipolar and depressive
disorders; generalized anxiety disorder; and panic disorder as described
in DSM-5.

Stimulant Withdrawal Diagnostic Criteria a. Cessation of (or reduction
in) prolonged amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant
use. b. Dysphoric mood and two (or more) of the following physiological
changes, developing within a few hours to several days after Criterion
A: 1. Fatigue. 2. Vivid, unpleasant dreams. 3. Insomnia or hypersomnia.
4. Increased appetite. 5. Psychomotor retardation or agitation. c. The
signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant distress
or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning. d. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another
medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance.

Specify the specific substance that causes the withdrawal syndrome
(i.e., amphetamine-type substance, cocaine, or other stimulant). Coding
note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether
the stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant. The
ICD-10-CM code for amphetamine or an other stimulant withdrawal is
F15.23, and the ICD-10-CM for cocaine withdrawal is F14.23. Note that
the ICD-10-CM code indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate or
severe amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder, reflecting
the fact that amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal can
only occur in the presence of a moderate or severe amphetamine, cocaine,
or other stimulant use disorder. It is not permissible to code a
comorbid mild amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant use disorder with
amphetamine, cocaine, or other stimulant withdrawal.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of stimulant withdrawal is the
presence of a characteristic withdrawal syndrome that develops within a
few hours to several days after the cessation of (or marked reduction
in) stimulant use (generally high dose) that has been prolonged
(Criterion A). The withdrawal syndrome is characterized by the
development of dysphoric mood accompanied by two or more of the
following physiological changes: fatigue, vivid and unpleasant dreams,
insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite, and psychomotor retardation
or agitation (Criterion B). Bradycardia is often present and is a
reliable measure of stimulant withdrawal1, 2, 3. Anhedonia and drug
craving can often be present but are not part of the diagnostic
criteria. These symptoms cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning (Criterion C). The symptoms must not be attributable to
another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental
disorder (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Acute withdrawal symptoms ("a
crash") are often seen after periods of repetitive high-dose use ("runs"
or "binges"). These periods are

characterized by intense and unpleasant feelings of lassitude and
depression and increased appetite, generally requiring several days of
rest and recuperation. Depressive symptoms with suicidal ideation or
behavior can occur and are generally the most serious problems seen
during "crashing" or other forms of stimulant withdrawal. The majority
of individuals with stimulant use disorder experience a withdrawal
syndrome at some point, and virtually all individuals with the disorder
report tolerance.

Differential Diagnosis Stimulant use disorder and other
stimulant-induced disorders. Stimulant withdrawal is distinguished from
stimulant use disorder and from the other stimulant-induced disorders
(e.g., stimulantinduced intoxication delirium, depressive disorder,
bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, anxiety disorder, sexual
dysfunction, sleep disorder) because the symptoms of withdrawal
predominate the clinical presentation and are severe enough to warrant
independent clinical attention.

Other Stimulant-Induced Disorders The following stimulant-induced
disorders (which include amphetamine-, cocaine-, and other
stimulant--induced disorders) are described in other chapters of the
manual with disorders with which they share phenomenology (see the
substance/medication-induced mental disorders in these chapters):
stimulant-induced psychotic disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other
Psychotic Disorders"); stimulant-induced bipolar

disorder ("Bipolar and Related Disorders"); stimulant-induced depressive
disorder ("Depressive Disorders"); stimulant-induced anxiety disorder
("Anxiety Disorders"); stimulant-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder
("Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders"); stimulant-induced sleep
disorder ("Sleep-Wake Disorders"); and stimulant-induced sexual
dysfunction ("Sexual Dysfunctions"). For stimulant intoxication
delirium, see the criteria and discussion of delirium in the chapter
"Neurocognitive Disorders." These stimulant-induced disorders are
diagnosed instead of stimulant intoxication or stimulant withdrawal only
when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent
clinical attention.

Unspecified Stimulant-Related Disorder

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a stimulant-related disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific stimulantrelated disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class. Coding note:
The ICD-9-CM code is 292.9. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether the
stimulant is an amphetamine, cocaine, or another stimulant. The
ICD-10-CM code for an unspecified amphetamine- or other stimulantrelated
disorder is F15.99. The ICD-10-CM code for an unspecified
cocaine-related disorder is F14.99.

Tobacco-Related Disorders Tobacco Use Disorder Tobacco Withdrawal Other
Tobacco-Induced Disorders Unspecified Tobacco-Related Disorder

Tobacco Use Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A problematic pattern of
tobacco use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as
manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month
period: 1. Tobacco is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer
period than was intended. 2. There is a persistent desire or
unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control tobacco use. 3. A great deal
of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain or use tobacco. 4.
Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco. 5. Recurrent tobacco
use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,
school, or home (e.g., interference with work). 6. Continued tobacco use
despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems
caused or exacerbated by the effects of tobacco (e.g., arguments with
others about tobacco use). 7. Important social, occupational, or
recreational activities are given up or reduced because of tobacco use.
8. Recurrent tobacco use in situations in which it is physically
hazardous (e.g., smoking in bed). 9. Tobacco use is continued despite
knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological
problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by tobacco.
10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A need for
markedly increased amounts of tobacco to achieve the desired effect. b.
A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of
tobacco.

11. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: a. The
characteristic withdrawal syndrome for tobacco (refer to Criteria A and
B of the criteria set for tobacco withdrawal). b. Tobacco (or a closely
related substance, such as nicotine) is taken to relieve or avoid
withdrawal symptoms. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria
for tobacco use disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for
tobacco use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less
than 12 months (with the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a
strong desire or urge to use tobacco," may be met). In sustained
remission: After full criteria for tobacco use disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for tobacco use disorder have been met at any
time during a period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that
Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco," may
be met). Specify if: On maintenance therapy: The individual is taking a
long-term maintenance medication, such as nicotine replacement
medication, and no criteria for tobacco use disorder have been met for
that class of medication (except tolerance to, or withdrawal from, the
nicotine replacement medication). In a controlled environment: This
additional specifier is used if the individual is in an environment
where access to tobacco is restricted. Coding based on current severity:
Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If a tobacco withdrawal or tobacco-induced
sleep disorder is also present, do not use the codes below for tobacco
use disorder. Instead, the comorbid tobacco use disorder is indicated in
the 4th character of the tobaccoinduced disorder code (see the coding
note for tobacco withdrawal or tobacco-induced sleep disorder). For
example, if there is comorbid tobacco-induced sleep disorder and tobacco
use disorder, only the tobacco-induced sleep disorder code is given,
with the 4th character indicating whether the comorbid tobacco use
disorder is moderate or severe: F17.208 for moderate or severe tobacco
use disorder with

tobacco-induced sleep disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid
mild tobacco use disorder with a tobacco-induced sleep disorder. Specify
current severity: 305.1 (Z72.0) Mild: Presence of 2--3 symptoms. 305.1
(F17.200) Moderate: Presence of 4--5 symptoms. 305.1 (F17.200) Severe:
Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers "On maintenance therapy" applies as a further specifier to
individuals being maintained on other tobacco cessation medication
(e.g., bupropion, varenicline) and as a further specifier of remission
if the individual is both in remission and on maintenance therapy. "In a
controlled environment" applies as a further specifier of remission if
the individual is both in remission and in a controlled environment
(i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in sustained
remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these environments
are closely supervised and substance-free jails, therapeutic
communities, and locked hospital units.

Diagnostic Features Tobacco use disorder is common among individuals who
use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco daily8 and is uncommon among
individuals who do not use tobacco daily or who use nicotine
medications15. Tolerance to tobacco is exemplified by the disappearance
of nausea and dizziness after repeated intake and with a more intense
effect of tobacco the first time it is used during the day. Cessation of
tobacco use can produce a well-defined withdrawal syndrome6. Many
individuals with tobacco use disorder use tobacco to relieve or to avoid
withdrawal symptoms (e.g., after being in a situation where use is
restricted). Many individuals who use tobacco have tobacco-related
physical symptoms or diseases and continue to smoke. The large majority
report craving when they do not smoke for several hours6. Spending
excessive time using tobacco can be exemplified by chainsmoking (i.e.,
smoking one cigarette after another with no time between cigarettes).
Because tobacco sources are readily and legally available, and because
nicotine intoxication is very rare, spending a great deal of time
attempting to procure tobacco or recovering from its effects is
uncommon.

Giving up important social, occupational, or recreational activities can
occur when an individual forgoes an activity because it occurs in
tobacco use--restricted areas. Use of tobacco rarely results in failure
to fulfill major role obligations (e.g., interference with work,
interference with home obligations), but persistent social or
interpersonal problems (e.g., having arguments with others about tobacco
use, avoiding social situations because of others' disapproval of
tobacco use) or use that is physically hazardous (e.g., smoking in bed,
smoking around flammable chemicals) occur at an intermediate prevalence.
Although these criteria are less often endorsed by tobacco users, if
endorsed, they can indicate a more severe disorder16.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Smoking within 30 minutes of
waking, smoking daily, smoking more cigarettes per day, and waking at
night to smoke are associated with tobacco use disorder1, 13.
Environmental cues can evoke craving and withdrawal. Serious medical
conditions, such as lung and other cancers, cardiac and pulmonary
disease, perinatal problems, cough, shortness of breath, and accelerated
skin aging, often occur12.

Prevalence Cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product4,
representing over 90% of tobacco/nicotine use. In the United States, 57%
of adults have never been smokers, 22% are former smokers, and 21% are
current smokers2. Approximately 20% of current U.S. smokers are nondaily
smokers2. The prevalence of smokeless tobacco use is less than 5%, and
the prevalence of tobacco use in pipes and cigars is less than 1%4.
DSM-IV nicotine dependence criteria can be used to estimate the
prevalence of tobacco use disorder, but since they are a subset of
tobacco use disorder criteria, the prevalence of tobacco use disorder
will be somewhat greater. The 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV nicotine
dependence in the United States is 13% among adults age 18 years and
older5. Rates are similar among adult males (14%) and females (12%) and
decline in age from 17% among 18- to 29-year-olds to 4% among
individuals age 65 years and older1. The prevalence of current nicotine
dependence is greater among Native American and Alaska Natives (23%)
than among whites (14%) but is less among African Americans (10%),

Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (6%), and Hispanics (6%)5. The
prevalence among current daily smokers is approximately 50%8. In many
developing nations, the prevalence of smoking is much greater in males
than in females, but this is not the case in developed nations18.
However, there often is a lag in the demographic transition such that
smoking increases in females at a later time18.

Development and Course The majority of U.S. adolescents experiment with
tobacco use, and by age 18 years, about 20% smoke at least monthly. Most
of these individuals become daily tobacco users4. Initiation of smoking
after age 21 years is rare. In general, some of the tobacco use disorder
criteria symptoms occur soon after beginning tobacco use3, and many
individuals' pattern of use meets current tobacco use disorder criteria
by late adolescence4. More than 80% of individuals who use tobacco
attempt to quit at some time, but 60% relapse within 1 week and less
than 5% remain abstinent for life7. However, most individuals who use
tobacco make multiple attempts such that onehalf of tobacco users
eventually abstain4. Individuals who use tobacco who do quit usually do
not do so until after age 30 years. Although nondaily smoking in the
United States was previously rare, it has become more prevalent in the
last decade, especially among younger individuals who use tobacco.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Individuals with
externalizing personality traits are more likely to initiate tobacco
use20. Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or conduct
disorder, and adults with depressive, bipolar, anxiety, personality,
psychotic, or other substance use disorders, are at higher risk of
starting and continuing tobacco use and of tobacco use disorder20.
Environmental. Individuals with low incomes and low educational levels
are more likely to initiate tobacco use and are less likely to stop4.
Genetic and physiological. Genetic factors contribute to the onset of
tobacco use, the continuation of tobacco use, and the development of
tobacco use disorder, with a degree of heritability equivalent to that
observed with other substance use disorders (i.e., about 50%)11. Some of

this risk is specific to tobacco, and some is common with the
vulnerability to developing any substance use disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Cultures and subcultures vary widely
in their acceptance of the use of tobacco. The prevalence of tobacco use
declined in the United States from the 1960s through the 1990s, but this
decrease has been less evident in African American and Hispanic
populations4. Also, smoking in developing countries is more prevalent
than in developed nations18. The degree to which these cultural
differences are due to income, education, and tobacco control activities
in a country is unclear4, 19. Non-Hispanic white smokers appear to be
more likely to develop tobacco use disorder than are smokers4. Some
ethnic differences may be biologically based10. African American males
tend to have higher nicotine blood levels for a given number of
cigarettes, and this might contribute to greater difficulty in quitting.
Also, the speed of nicotine metabolism is significantly different for
whites compared with African Americans and can vary by genotypes
associated with ethnicities.

Diagnostic Markers Carbon monoxide in the breath, and nicotine and its
metabolite cotinine in blood, saliva, or urine, can be used to measure
the extent of current tobacco or nicotine use; however, these are only
weakly related to tobacco use disorder17.

Functional Consequences of Tobacco Use Disorder Medical consequences of
tobacco use often begin when tobacco users are in their 40s and usually
become progressively more debilitating over time12. One-half of smokers
who do not stop using tobacco will die early from a tobacco-related
illness, and smoking-related morbidity occurs in more than one-half of
tobacco users. Most medical conditions result from exposure to carbon
monoxide, tars, and other non-nicotine components of tobacco. The major
predictor of reversibility is duration of smoking. Secondhand smoke
increases the risk of heart disease and cancer by 30%. Long-term use of
nicotine medications does not appear to cause medical harm14.

Comorbidity The most common medical diseases from smoking are
cardiovascular illnesses, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
cancers12. Smoking also increases perinatal problems, such as low birth
weight and miscarriage12. The most common psychiatric comorbidities are
alcohol/substance, depressive, bipolar, anxiety, personality, and
attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorders20. In individuals with current
tobacco use disorder, the prevalence of current alcohol, drug, anxiety,
depressive, bipolar, and personality disorders ranges from 22% to 32%5.
Nicotinedependent smokers are 2.7--8.1 times more likely to have these
disorders than nondependent smokers, never-smokers, or ex-smokers.

Tobacco Withdrawal Diagnostic Criteria

292.0 (F17.203)

a.  Daily use of tobacco for at least several weeks.
b.  Abrupt cessation of tobacco use, or reduction in the amount of
    tobacco used, followed within 24 hours by four (or more) of the
    following signs or symptoms:

<!-- -->

1.  Irritability, frustration, or anger.
2.  Anxiety.
3.  Difficulty concentrating.
4.  Increased appetite.
5.  Restlessness.
6.  Depressed mood.
7.  Insomnia.

<!-- -->

c.  The signs or symptoms in Criterion B cause clinically significant
    distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important
    areas of functioning.
d.  The signs or symptoms are not attributed to another medical
    condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
    including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. Coding
    note: The ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for tobacco
    withdrawal is F17.203. Note that the ICD-10-CM code indicates the
    comorbid presence of a moderate or severe tobacco use disorder,
    reflecting the fact that tobacco withdrawal can only occur in the
    presence of a moderate or severe tobacco use disorder. It is not
    permissible to code a comorbid mild tobacco use disorder with
    tobacco withdrawal.

Diagnostic Features

Withdrawal symptoms impair the ability to stop tobacco use. The symptoms
after abstinence from tobacco are in large part due to nicotine
deprivation. Symptoms are much more intense among individuals who smoke
cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco than among those who use nicotine
medications. This difference in symptom intensity is likely due to the
more rapid onset and higher levels of nicotine with cigarette smoking.
Tobacco withdrawal is common among daily tobacco users who stop or
reduce but can also occur among nondaily users. Typically, heart rate
decreases by 5--12 beats per minute in the first few days after stopping
smoking, and weight increases an average of 4--7 lb (2--3 kg) over the
first year after stopping smoking. Tobacco withdrawal can produce
clinically significant mood changes and functional impairment.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Craving for sweet or sugary
foods and impaired performance on tasks requiring vigilance are
associated with tobacco withdrawal3. Abstinence can increase
constipation, coughing, dizziness, dreaming/nightmares, nausea, and sore
throat. Smoking increases the metabolism of many medications used to
treat mental disorders; thus, cessation of smoking can increase the
blood levels of these medications, and this can produce clinically
significant outcomes4. This effect appears to be due not to nicotine but
rather to other compounds in tobacco.

Prevalence Approximately 50% of tobacco users who quit for 2 or more
days will have symptoms that meet criteria for tobacco withdrawal3. The
most commonly endorsed signs and symptoms are anxiety, irritability, and
difficulty concentrating. The least commonly endorsed symptoms are
depression and insomnia.

Development and Course Tobacco withdrawal usually begins within 24 hours
of stopping or cutting down on tobacco use, peaks at 2--3 days after
abstinence, and lasts 2--3 weeks3. Tobacco withdrawal symptoms can occur
among adolescent tobacco users, even prior to daily tobacco use1.
Prolonged symptoms beyond 1 month are uncommon.

Diagnostic Markers Carbon monoxide in the breath, and nicotine and its
metabolite cotinine in blood, saliva, or urine, can be used to measure
the extent of tobacco or nicotine use but are only weakly related to
tobacco withdrawal7.

Functional Consequences of Tobacco Withdrawal Abstinence from cigarettes
can cause clinically significant distress3. Withdrawal impairs the
ability to stop or control tobacco use. Whether tobacco withdrawal can
prompt a new mental disorder or recurrence of a mental disorder is
debatable6, but if this occurs, it would be in a small minority of
tobacco users.

Differential Diagnosis The symptoms of tobacco withdrawal overlap with
those of other substance withdrawal syndromes (e.g., alcohol withdrawal;
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; stimulant withdrawal;
caffeine withdrawal; opioid withdrawal); caffeine intoxication; anxiety,
depressive, bipolar, and sleep disorders; and medication-induced
akathisia2. Admission to smoke-free inpatient units or voluntary smoking
cessation can induce withdrawal symptoms that mimic, intensify, or
disguise other disorders or adverse effects of medications used to treat
mental disorders (e.g., irritability thought to be due to alcohol
withdrawal could be due to tobacco withdrawal). Reduction in symptoms
with the use of nicotine medications confirms the diagnosis.

Other Tobacco-Induced Disorders Tobacco-induced sleep disorder is
discussed in the chapter "Sleep-Wake Disorders" (see
"Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder").

Unspecified Tobacco-Related Disorder 292.9 (F17.209) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
tobacco-related disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
specific tobaccorelated disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related and addictive disorders diagnostic class.

Other (or Unknown) Substance--Related Disorders Other (or Unknown)
Substance Use Disorder Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication Other
(or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal Other (or Unknown) Substance--Induced
Disorders Unspecified Other (or Unknown) Substance--Related Disorder

Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. A
problematic pattern of use of an intoxicating substance not able to be
classified within the alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogen
(phencyclidine and others); inhalant; opioid; sedative, hypnotic, or
anxiolytic; stimulant; or tobacco categories and leading to clinically
significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the
following, occurring within a 12-month period: 1. The substance is often
taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. 2.
There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or
control use of the substance. 3. A great deal of time is spent in
activities necessary to obtain the substance, use the substance, or
recover from its effects. 4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use
the substance. 5. Recurrent use of the substance resulting in a failure
to fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home. 6. Continued
use of the substance despite having persistent or recurrent social or
interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of its use.
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given
up or reduced because of use of the substance.

8. Recurrent use of the substance in situations in which it is
physically hazardous. 9. Use of the substance is continued despite
knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological
problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the
substance. 10. Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: a. A
need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve
intoxication or desired effect. b. A markedly diminished effect with
continued use of the same amount of the substance. 11. Withdrawal, as
manifested by either of the following: a. The characteristic withdrawal
syndrome for other (or unknown) substance (refer to Criteria A and B of
the criteria sets for other \[or unknown\] substance withdrawal,
p. 583). b. The substance (or a closely related substance) is taken to
relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. Specify if: In early remission:
After full criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder were
previously met, none of the criteria for other (or unknown) substance
use disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12
months (with the exception that Criterion A4, "Craving, or a strong
desire or urge to use the substance," may be met). In sustained
remission: After full criteria for other (or unknown) substance use
disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for other (or
unknown) substance use disorder have been met at any time during a
period of 12 months or longer (with the exception that Criterion A4,
"Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance," may be met).
Specify if: In a controlled environment: This additional specifier is
used if the individual is in an environment where access to the
substance is restricted.

Coding based on current severity: Note for ICD-10-CM codes: If an other
(or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or unknown) substance
withdrawal, or another other (or unknown) substance--induced mental
disorder is present, do not use the codes below for other (or unknown)
substance use disorder. Instead, the comorbid other (or unknown)
substance use disorder is indicated in the 4th character of the other
(or unknown) substance--induced disorder code (see the coding note for
other (or unknown) substance intoxication, other (or unknown) substance
withdrawal, or specific other (or unknown) substance--induced mental
disorder). For example, if there is comorbid other (or unknown)
substance--induced depressive disorder and other (or unknown) substance
use disorder, only the other (or unknown) substance--induced depressive
disorder code is given, with the 4th character indicating whether the
comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder is mild, moderate, or
severe: F19.14 for other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other
(or unknown) substance--induced depressive disorder or F19.24 for a
moderate or severe other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other
(or unknown) substance--induced depressive disorder. Specify current
severity: 305.90 (F19.10) Mild: Presence of 2--3 symptoms. 304.90
(F19.20) Moderate: Presence of 4--5 symptoms. 304.90 (F19.20) Severe:
Presence of 6 or more symptoms.

Specifiers "In a controlled environment" applies as a further specifier
of remission if the individual is both in remission and in a controlled
environment (i.e., in early remission in a controlled environment or in
sustained remission in a controlled environment). Examples of these
environments are closely supervised and substance-free jails,
therapeutic communities, and locked hospital units.

Diagnostic Features The diagnostic class other (or unknown) substance
use and related disorders comprises substance-related disorders
unrelated to alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; hallucinogens (phencyclidine
and others); inhalants; opioids;

sedative, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants (including amphetamine
and cocaine); or tobacco. Such substances include anabolic steroids9,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; cortisol; antiparkinsonian
medications6, antihistamines; nitrous oxide; amyl-, butyl-, or
isobutylnitrites17, betel nut7, which is chewed in many cultures to
produce mild euphoria and a floating sensation; kava (from a South
Pacific pepper plant), which produces sedation, incoordination, weight
loss, mild hepatitis, and lung abnormalities; or cathinones (including
khât plant agents and synthetic chemical derivatives) that produce
stimulant effects10. Unknown substancerelated disorders are associated
with unidentified substances, such as intoxications in which the
individual cannot identify the ingested drug, or substance use disorders
involving either new, black market drugs not yet identified or familiar
drugs illegally sold under false names. Other (or unknown) substance use
disorder is a mental disorder in which repeated use of an other or
unknown substance typically continues, despite the individual's knowing
that the substance is causing serious problems for the individual. Those
problems are reflected in the diagnostic criteria. When the substance is
known, it should be reflected in the name of the disorder upon coding
(e.g., nitrous oxide use disorder).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis A diagnosis of other (or
unknown) substance use disorder is supported by the individual's
statement that the substance involved is not among the nine classes
listed in this chapter; by recurring episodes of intoxication with
negative results in standard drug screens (which may not detect new or
rarely used substances); or by the presence of symptoms characteristic
of an unidentified substance that has newly appeared in the individual's
community. Because of increased access to nitrous oxide ("laughing
gas"), membership in certain populations is associated with diagnosis of
nitrous oxide use disorder. The role of this gas as an anesthetic agent
leads to misuse by some medical and dental professionals3. Its use as a
propellant for commercial products (e.g., whipped cream dispensers)
contributes to misuse by food service workers. With recent widespread
availability of the substance in "whippet" cartridges for use in home
whipped cream dispensers, nitrous oxide misuse by adolescents and young
adults is

significant16, especially among those who also inhale volatile
hydrocarbons. Some continuously using individuals, inhaling from as many
as 240 whippets per day, may present with serious medical complications
and mental conditions, including myeloneuropathy1, spinal cord subacute
combined degeneration4, peripheral neuropathy13, and psychosis15. These
conditions are also associated with a diagnosis of nitrous oxide use
disorder. Use of amyl-, butyl-, and isobutyl nitrite gases has been
observed among homosexual men5, 8, 11 and some adolescents, especially
those with conduct disorder17. Membership in these populations may be
associated with a diagnosis of amyl-, butyl-, or isobutyl-nitrite use
disorder. However, it has not been determined that these substances
produce a substance use disorder14. Despite tolerance12, these gases may
not alter behavior through central effects2, and they may be used only
for their peripheral effects. Substance use disorders generally are
associated with elevated risks of suicide, but there is no evidence of
unique risk factors for suicide with other (or unknown) substance use
disorder.

Prevalence Based on extremely limited data, the prevalence of other (or
unknown) substance use disorder is likely lower than that of use
disorders involving the nine substance classes in this chapter.

Development and Course No single pattern of development or course
characterizes the pharmacologically varied other (or unknown) substance
use disorders. Often unknown substance use disorders will be
reclassified when the unknown substance eventually is identified.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Risk and prognostic factors for other (or
unknown) substance use disorders are thought to be similar to those for
most substance use disorders and include the presence of any other
substance use disorders, conduct disorder, or antisocial personality
disorder in the individual or the individual's family; early onset of
substance problems; easy availability of the substance in the
individual's environment; childhood maltreatment or trauma; and evidence
of limited early self-control and behavioral disinhibition.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Certain cultures may be associated
with other (or unknown) substance use disorders involving specific
indigenous substances within the cultural region, such as betel nut.

Diagnostic Markers Urine, breath, or saliva tests may correctly identify
a commonly used substance falsely sold as a novel product. However,
routine clinical tests usually cannot identify truly unusual or new
substances, which may require testing in specialized laboratories.

Differential Diagnosis Use of other or unknown substances without
meeting criteria for other (or unknown) substance use disorder. Use of
unknown substances is not rare among adolescents, but most use does not
meet the diagnostic standard of two or more criteria for other (or
unknown) substance use disorder in the past year. Substance use
disorders. Other (or unknown) substance use disorder may co-occur with
various substance use disorders, and the symptoms of the disorders may
be similar and overlapping. To disentangle symptom patterns, it is
helpful to inquire about which symptoms persisted during periods when
some of the substances were not being used. Other (or unknown)
substance/medication-induced disorder. This diagnosis should be
differentiated from instances when the individual's symptoms meet full
criteria for one of the following disorders, and that disorder is caused
by an other or unknown substance: delirium, major or mild neurocognitive
disorder, psychotic disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder,
sexual dysfunction, or sleep disorder. Other medical conditions.
Individuals with substance use disorders, including other (or unknown)
substance use disorder, may present with symptoms of many medical
disorders. These disorders also may occur in the absence of other (or
unknown) substance use disorder. A history of little or no use of other
or unknown substances helps to exclude other (or unknown) substance use
disorder as the source of these problems.

Comorbidity Substance use disorders, including other (or unknown)
substance use disorder, are commonly comorbid with one another, with
adolescent conduct disorder and adult antisocial personality disorder,
and with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.

Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication Diagnostic Criteria a. The
development of a reversible substance-specific syndrome attributable to
recent ingestion of (or exposure to) a substance that is not listed
elsewhere or is unknown. b. Clinically significant problematic
behavioral or psychological changes that are attributable to the effect
of the substance on the central nervous system (e.g., impaired motor
coordination, psychomotor agitation or retardation, euphoria, anxiety,
belligerence,

mood lability, cognitive impairment, impaired judgment, social
withdrawal) and develop during, or shortly after, use of the substance.
c. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including intoxication with another substance. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM
code is 292.89. The ICD-10-CM code depends on whether there is a
comorbid other (or unknown) substance use disorder involving the same
substance. If a mild other (or unknown) substance use disorder is
comorbid, the ICD-10-CM code is F19.129, and if a moderate or severe
other (or unknown) substance use disorder is comorbid, the ICD-10-CM
code is F19.229. If there is no comorbid other (or unknown) substance
use disorder involving the same substance, then the ICD-10-CM code is
F19.929. Note: For information on Risk and Prognostic Factors,
Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues, and Diagnostic Markers, see the
corresponding sections in other (or unknown) substance use disorder.

Diagnostic Features Other (or unknown) substance intoxication is a
clinically significant mental disorder that develops during, or
immediately after, use of either a) a substance not elsewhere addressed
in this chapter (i.e., alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; phencyclidine and
other hallucinogens; inhalants; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics; stimulants; or tobacco) or b) an unknown substance. If the
substance is known, it should be reflected in the name of the disorder
upon coding. Application of the diagnostic criteria for other (or
unknown) substance intoxication is very challenging. Criterion A
requires development of a reversible "substance-specific syndrome," but
if the substance is unknown, that syndrome usually will be unknown. To
resolve this conflict, clinicians may ask the individual or obtain
collateral history as to whether the individual has experienced a
similar episode after using substances with the same "street" name or
from the same source. Similarly, hospital emergency departments
sometimes recognize over a few days numerous presentations of a severe,
unfamiliar intoxication syndrome from a newly available, previously
unknown substance. Because of the great variety of intoxicating

substances, Criterion B can provide only broad examples of signs and
symptoms from some intoxications, with no threshold for the number of
symptoms required for a diagnosis; clinical judgment guides those
decisions. Criterion C requires ruling out other medical conditions,
mental disorders, or intoxications.

Prevalence The prevalence of other (or unknown) substance intoxication
is unknown.

Development and Course Intoxications usually appear and then peak
minutes to hours after use of the substance, but the onset and course
vary with the substance and the route of administration. Generally,
substances used by pulmonary inhalation and intravenous injection have
the most rapid onset of action, while those ingested by mouth and
requiring metabolism to an active product are much slower. (For example,
after ingestion of certain mushrooms, the first signs of an eventually
fatal intoxication may not appear for a few days.) Intoxication effects
usually resolve within hours to a very few days. However, the body may
completely eliminate an anesthetic gas such as nitrous oxide just
minutes after use ends. At the other extreme, some "hitand-run"
intoxicating substances poison systems, leaving permanent impairments.
For example, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine), a
contaminating by-product in the synthesis of a certain opioid, kills
dopaminergic cells and induces permanent parkinsonism in users who
sought opioid intoxication1.

Functional Consequences of Other (or Unknown) Substance Intoxication
Impairment from intoxication with any substance may have serious
consequences, including dysfunction at work, social indiscretions,
problems in interpersonal relationships, failure to fulfill role
obligations, traffic accidents, fighting, high-risk behaviors (i.e.,
having unprotected sex), and substance or medication overdose. The
pattern of consequences will vary with the particular substance.

Differential Diagnosis

Use of other or unknown substance, without meeting criteria for other
(or unknown) substance intoxication. The individual used an other or
unknown substance(s), but the dose was insufficient to produce symptoms
that meet the diagnostic criteria required for the diagnosis. Substance
intoxication or other substance/medication-induced disorders. Familiar
substances may be sold in the black market as novel products, and
individuals may experience intoxication from those substances. History,
toxicology screens, or chemical testing of the substance itself may help
to identify it. Different types of other (or unknown) substance--related
disorders. Episodes of other (or unknown) substance intoxication may
occur during, but are distinct from, other (or unknown) substance use
disorder, unspecified other (or unknown) substance--related disorder,
and other (or unknown) substance--induced disorders. Other toxic,
metabolic, traumatic, neoplastic, vascular, or infectious disorders that
impair brain function and cognition. Numerous neurological and other
medical conditions may produce rapid onset of signs and symptoms
mimicking those of intoxications, including the examples in Criterion B.
Paradoxically, drug withdrawals also must be ruled out, because, for
example, lethargy may indicate withdrawal from one drug or intoxication
with another drug.

Comorbidity As with all substance-related disorders, adolescent conduct
disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use
disorders tend to cooccur with other (or unknown) substance
intoxication.

Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal Diagnostic Criteria

292.0 (F19.239)

a. Cessation of (or reduction in) use of a substance that has been heavy
and prolonged. b. The development of a substance-specific syndrome
shortly after the cessation of (or reduction in) substance use. c. The
substance-specific syndrome causes clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning. d. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical
condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder,
including withdrawal from another substance. e. The substance involved
cannot be classified under any of the other substance categories
(alcohol; caffeine; cannabis; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or
anxiolytics; stimulants; or tobacco) or is unknown. Coding note: The
ICD-9-CM code is 292.0. The ICD-10-CM code for other (or unknown)
substance withdrawal is F19.239. Note that the ICD10-CM code indicates
the comorbid presence of a moderate or severe other (or unknown)
substance use disorder. It is not permissible to code a comorbid mild
other (or unknown) substance use disorder with other (or unknown)
substance withdrawal. Note: For information on Risk and Prognostic
Factors and Diagnostic Markers, see the corresponding sections in other
(or unknown) substance use disorder.

Diagnostic Features Other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is a
clinically significant mental disorder that develops during, or within a
few hours to days after, reducing or terminating dosing with a substance
(Criteria A and B). Although recent dose reduction or termination
usually is clear in the history, other diagnostic procedures are very
challenging if the drug is unknown. Criterion B requires development of
a "substance-specific syndrome" (i.e., the individual's signs and
symptoms must correspond with the known withdrawal syndrome for the
recently stopped drug)---a requirement that rarely can be met with an
unknown substance. Consequently, clinical judgment must guide such
decisions when information is this limited.

Criterion D requires ruling out other medical conditions, mental
disorders, or withdrawals from familiar substances. When the substance
is known, it should be reflected in the name of the disorder upon coding
(e.g., betel nut withdrawal).

Prevalence The prevalence of other (or unknown) substance withdrawal is
unknown.

Development and Course Withdrawal signs commonly appear some hours after
use of the substance is terminated, but the onset and course vary
greatly, depending on the dose typically used by the person and the rate
of elimination of the specific substance from the body. At peak
severity, withdrawal symptoms from some substances involve only moderate
levels of discomfort, whereas withdrawal from other substances may be
fatal. Withdrawal-associated dysphoria often motivates relapse to
substance use. Withdrawal symptoms slowly abate over days, weeks, or
months, depending on the particular drug and doses to which the
individual became tolerant.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Culture-related issues in diagnosis
will vary with the particular substance.

Functional Consequences of Other (or Unknown) Substance Withdrawal
Withdrawal from any substance may have serious consequences, including
physical signs and symptoms (e.g., malaise, vital sign changes,
abdominal distress, headache), intense drug craving, anxiety,
depression, agitation, psychotic symptoms, or cognitive impairments.
These consequences may lead to problems such as dysfunction at work,
problems in interpersonal relationships, failure to fulfill role
obligations, traffic accidents, fighting, high-risk behavior (e.g.,
having unprotected sex), suicide attempts, and substance or medication
overdose. The pattern of consequences will vary with the particular
substance.

Differential Diagnosis

Dose reduction after extended dosing, but not meeting the criteria for
other (or unknown) substance withdrawal. The individual used other (or
unknown) substances, but the dose that was used was insufficient to
produce symptoms that meet the criteria required for the diagnosis.
Substance withdrawal or other substance/medication-induced disorders.
Familiar substances may be sold in the black market as novel products,
and individuals may experience withdrawal when discontinuing those
substances. History, toxicology screens, or chemical testing of the
substance itself may help to identify it. Different types of other (or
unknown) substance--related disorders. Episodes of other (or unknown)
substance withdrawal may occur during, but are distinct from, other (or
unknown) substance use disorder, unspecified other (or unknown)
substance--related disorder, and unspecified other (or unknown)
substance--induced disorders. Other toxic, metabolic, traumatic,
neoplastic, vascular, or infectious disorders that impair brain function
and cognition. Numerous neurological and other medical conditions may
produce rapid onset of signs and symptoms mimicking those of
withdrawals. Paradoxically, drug intoxications also must be ruled out,
because, for example, lethargy may indicate withdrawal from one drug or
intoxication with another drug.

Comorbidity As with all substance-related disorders, adolescent conduct
disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder, and other substance use
disorders likely cooccur with other (or unknown) substance withdrawal.

Other (or Unknown) Substance--Induced Disorders Because the category of
other or unknown substances is inherently illdefined, the extent and
range of induced disorders are uncertain. Nevertheless, other (or
unknown) substance--induced disorders are possible and are described in
other chapters of the manual with disorders with which they share
phenomenology (see the substance/medication-induced mental disorders in
these chapters): other (or unknown) substance--induced psychotic
disorder ("Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic

Disorders"); other (or unknown substance--induced bipolar disorder
("Bipolar and Related Disorders"); other (or unknown) substance--induced
depressive disorder ("Depressive Disorders"); other (or unknown)
substance--induced anxiety disorders ("Anxiety Disorders"); other (or
unknown) substance--induced obsessive-compulsive disorder
("ObsessiveCompulsive and Related Disorders"); other (or unknown)
substance-- induced sleep disorder ("Sleep-Wake Disorders"); other (or
unknown) substance--induced sexual dysfunction ("Sexual Dysfunctions");
and other (or unknown) substance/medication--induced major or mild
neurocognitive disorder ("Neurocognitive Disorders"). For other (or
unknown) substance-- induced intoxication delirium and other (or
unknown) substance--induced withdrawal delirium, see the criteria and
discussion of delirium in the chapter "Neurocognitive Disorders." These
other (or unknown) substance-- induced disorders are diagnosed instead
of other (or unknown) substance intoxication or other (or unknown)
substance withdrawal only when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to
warrant independent clinical attention.

Unspecified Other (or Unknown) Substance-- Related Disorder 292.9
(F19.99) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of an other (or unknown) substance--related disorder that
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any specific other (or unknown)
substance--related disorder or any of the disorders in the
substance-related disorders diagnostic class.

Non-Substance-Related Disorders Gambling Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

312.31 (F63.0)

a. Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the
individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month
period: 1. Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to
achieve the desired excitement. 2. Is restless or irritable when
attempting to cut down or stop gambling. 3. Has made repeated
unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. 4. Is often
preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving
past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture,
thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). 5. Often gambles

After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even
("chasing" one's losses). 7. Lies to conceal the extent of involvement

more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of
gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing
continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years.
Specify if:

In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were
previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met
for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained
remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously
met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a
period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4--5
criteria met. Moderate: 6--7 criteria met. Severe: 8--9 criteria met.
Note: Although some behavioral conditions that do not involve ingestion
of substances have similarities to substance-related disorders, only one
disorder---gambling disorder---has sufficient data to be included in
this section.

Specifiers Severity is based on the number of criteria endorsed.
Individuals with mild gambling disorder may exhibit only 4--5 of the
criteria, with the most frequently endorsed criteria usually related to
preoccupation with gambling and "chasing" losses3, 7. Individuals with
moderately severe gambling disorder exhibit more of the criteria (i.e.,
6--7). Individuals with the most severe form will exhibit all or most of
the nine criteria (i.e., 8--9). Jeopardizing relationships or career
opportunities due to gambling and relying on others to provide money for
gambling losses are typically the least often endorsed criteria and most
often occur among those with more severe gambling disorder3, 7.
Furthermore, individuals presenting for treatment of gambling disorder
typically have moderate to severe forms of the disorder17, 19.

Diagnostic Features Gambling involves risking something of value in the
hopes of obtaining something of greater value. In many cultures,
individuals gamble on games and events, and most do so without
experiencing problems. However, some individuals develop substantial
impairment related to their gambling behaviors. The essential feature of
gambling disorder is persistent and

recurrent maladaptive gambling behavior that disrupts personal, family,
and/or vocational pursuits (Criterion A). Gambling disorder is defined
as a cluster of four or more of the symptoms listed in Criterion A
occurring at any time in the same 12-month period. A pattern of "chasing
one's losses" may develop, with an urgent need to keep gambling (often
with the placing of larger bets or the taking of greater risks) to undo
a loss or series of losses. The individual may abandon his or her
gambling strategy and try to win back losses all at once. Although many
gamblers may "chase" for short periods of time, it is the frequent, and
often long-term, "chase" that is characteristic of gambling disorder
(Criterion A6). Individuals may lie to family members, therapists, or
others to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling; these
instances of deceit may also include, but are not limited to, covering
up illegal behaviors such as forgery, fraud, theft, or embezzlement to
obtain money with which to gamble (Criterion A7). Individuals may also
engage in "bailout" behavior, turning to family or others for help with
a desperate financial situation that was caused by gambling (Criterion
A9).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Distortions in thinking (e.g.,
denial, superstitions, a sense of power and control over the outcome of
chance events, overconfidence) may be present in individuals with
gambling disorder30. Many individuals with gambling disorder believe
that money is both the cause of and the solution to their problems. Some
individuals with gambling disorder are impulsive, competitive,
energetic, restless, and easily bored; they may be overly concerned with
the approval of others and may be generous to the point of extravagance
when winning. Other individuals with gambling disorder are depressed and
lonely, and they may gamble when feeling helpless, guilty, or
depressed11. Up to half of individuals in treatment for gambling
disorder have suicidal ideation, and about 17% have attempted suicide15.

Prevalence The past-year prevalence rate of gambling disorder is about
0.2%--0.3% in the general population7, 9, 16. In the general population,
the lifetime prevalence rate is about 0.4%--1.0%7, 9, 16, 29. For
females, the lifetime prevalence rate of gambling disorder is about
0.2%, and for males it is

about 0.6%3. The lifetime prevalence of pathological gambling among
African Americans is about 0.9%, among whites about 0.4%, and among
Hispanics about 0.3%1.

Development and Course The onset of gambling disorder can occur during
adolescence or young adulthood, but in other individuals it manifests
during middle or even older adulthood. Generally, gambling disorder
develops over the course of years, although the progression appears to
be more rapid in females than in males25. Most individuals who develop a
gambling disorder evidence a pattern of gambling that gradually
increases in both frequency and amount of wagering5, 9. Certainly,
milder forms can develop into more severe cases. Most individuals with
gambling disorder report that one or two types of gambling are most
problematic for them17, although some individuals participate in many
forms of gambling. Individuals are likely to engage in certain types of
gambling (e.g., buying scratch tickets daily) more frequently than
others (e.g., playing slot machines or blackjack at the casino weekly).
Frequency of gambling can be related more to the type of gambling than
to the severity of the overall gambling disorder. For example,
purchasing a single scratch ticket each day may not be problematic,
while less frequent casino, sports, or card gambling may be part of a
gambling disorder14. Similarly, amounts of money spent wagering are not
in themselves indicative of gambling disorder. Some individuals can
wager thousands of dollars per month and not have a problem with
gambling, while others may wager much smaller amounts but experience
substantial gambling-related difficulties27. Gambling patterns may be
regular or episodic, and gambling disorder can be persistent or in
remission8, 19, 24. Gambling can increase during periods of stress or
depression and during periods of substance use or abstinence. There may
be periods of heavy gambling and severe problems, times of total
abstinence, and periods of nonproblematic gambling. Gambling disorder is
sometimes associated with spontaneous, long-term remissions.
Nevertheless, some individuals underestimate their vulnerability to
develop gambling disorder or to return to gambling disorder following
remission. When in a period of remission, they may incorrectly assume
that they will

have no problem regulating gambling and that they may gamble on some
forms nonproblematically, only to experience a return to gambling
disorder. Early expression of gambling disorder is more common among
males than among females2, 25. Individuals who begin gambling in youth
often do so with family members or friends10. Development of early-life
gambling disorder appears to be associated with impulsivity and
substance abuse23. Many high school and college students who develop
gambling disorder grow out of the disorder over time, although it
remains a lifelong problem for some22. Mid- and later-life onset of
gambling disorder is more common among females than among males3, 25.
There are age and gender variations in the type of gambling activities
and the prevalence rates of gambling disorder. Gambling disorder is more
common among younger and middle-age persons than among older adults7, 9.
Among adolescents and young adults, the disorder is more prevalent in
males than in females2. Younger individuals prefer different forms of
gambling (e.g., sports betting), while older adults are more likely to
develop problems with slot machine and bingo gambling14. Although the
proportions of individuals who seek treatment for gambling disorder are
low across all age groups19, younger individuals are especially unlikely
to present for treatment. Males are more likely to begin gambling
earlier in life and to have a younger age at onset of gambling disorder
than females, who are more likely to begin gambling later in life and to
develop gambling disorder in a shorter time frame25. Females with
gambling disorder are more likely than males with gambling disorder to
have depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders25. Females also have a
later age at onset of the disorder and seek treatment sooner25, although
rates of treatment seeking are low (\<10%) among individuals with
gambling disorder regardless of gender3, 19.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Gambling that begins in
childhood or early adolescence is associated with increased rates of
gambling disorder4. Gambling disorder also appears to aggregate with
antisocial personality disorder21, depressive and bipolar disorders18,
and other substance use disorders9, 16, particularly with alcohol
disorders20.

Genetic and physiological. Gambling disorder can aggregate in families,
and this effect appears to relate to both environmental and genetic
factors. Gambling problems are more frequent in monozygotic than in
dizygotic twins6. Gambling disorder is also more prevalent among
first-degree relatives of individuals with moderate to severe alcohol
use disorder than among the general population20.

Course modifiers Many individuals, including adolescents and young
adults, are likely to resolve their problems with gambling disorder over
time, although a strong predictor of future gambling problems is prior
gambling problems22.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Individuals from specific cultures and
races/ethnicities are more likely to participate in some types of
gambling activities than others (e.g., pai gow, cockfights, blackjack,
horse racing). Prevalence rates of gambling disorder are higher among
African Americans than among European Americans, with rates for Hispanic
Americans similar to those of European Americans1. Indigenous
populations have high prevalence rates of gambling disorder26, 28.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Males develop gambling disorder at
higher rates than females, although this gender gap may be narrowing.
Males tend to wager on different forms of gambling than females, with
cards, sports, and horse race gambling more prevalent among males, and
slot machine and bingo gambling more common among females14.

Functional Consequences of Gambling Disorder Areas of psychosocial,
health, and mental health functioning may be adversely affected by
gambling disorder. Specifically, individuals with gambling disorder may,
because of their involvement with gambling, jeopardize or lose important
relationships with family members or friends. Such problems may occur
from repeatedly lying to others to cover up the extent of gambling or
from requesting money that is used for gambling or to pay off gambling
debts. Employment or educational activities may likewise

be adversely impacted by gambling disorder; absenteeism or poor work or
school performance can occur with gambling disorder, as individuals may
gamble during work or school hours or be preoccupied with gambling or
its adverse consequence when they should be working or studying.
Individuals with gambling disorder have poor general health and utilize
medical services at high rates13.

Differential Diagnosis Nondisordered gambling. Gambling disorder must be
distinguished from professional and social gambling. In professional
gambling, risks are limited and discipline is central. Social gambling
typically occurs with friends or colleagues and lasts for a limited
period of time, with acceptable losses. Some individuals can experience
problems associated with gambling (e.g., short-term chasing behavior and
loss of control) that do not meet the full criteria for gambling
disorder. Manic episode. Loss of judgment and excessive gambling may
occur during a manic episode. An additional diagnosis of gambling
disorder should be given only if the gambling behavior is not better
explained by manic episodes (e.g., a history of maladaptive gambling
behavior at times other than during a manic episode). Alternatively, an
individual with gambling disorder may, during a period of gambling,
exhibit behavior that resembles a manic episode, but once the individual
is away from the gambling, these manic-like features dissipate.
Personality disorders. Problems with gambling may occur in individuals
with antisocial personality disorder and other personality disorders. If
the criteria are met for both disorders, both can be diagnosed. Other
medical conditions. Some patients taking dopaminergic medications (e.g.,
for Parkinson's disease) may experience urges to gamble. If such
symptoms dissipate when dopaminergic medications are reduced in dosage
or ceased, then a diagnosis of gambling disorder would not be indicated.

Comorbidity Gambling disorder is associated with poor general health12,
13. In addition, some specific medical diagnoses, such as tachycardia
and angina, are more

common among individuals with gambling disorder than in the general
population, even when other substance use disorders, including tobacco
use disorder, are controlled for13. Individuals with gambling disorder
have high rates of comorbidity with other mental disorders, such as
substance use disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and
personality disorders9, 16. In some individuals, other mental disorders
may precede gambling disorder and be either absent or present during the
manifestation of gambling disorder. Gambling disorder may also occur
prior to the onset of other mental disorders, especially anxiety
disorders and substance use disorders9.

Neurocognitive Disorders The neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) (referred
to in DSM-IV as "Dementia, Delirium, Amnestic, and Other Cognitive
Disorders") begin with delirium, followed by the syndromes of major NCD,
mild NCD, and their etiological subtypes. The major or mild NCD subtypes
are NCD due to Alzheimer's disease; vascular NCD; NCD with Lewy bodies;
NCD due to Parkinson's disease; frontotemporal NCD; NCD due to traumatic
brain injury; NCD due to HIV infection; substance/medication-induced
NCD; NCD due to Huntington's disease; NCD due to prion disease; NCD due
to another medical condition; NCD due to multiple etiologies; and
unspecified NCD. The NCD category encompasses the group of disorders in
which the primary clinical deficit is in cognitive function, and that
are acquired rather than developmental. Although cognitive deficits are
present in many if not all mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia,
bipolar disorders), only disorders whose core features are cognitive are
included in the NCD category. The NCDs are those in which impaired
cognition has not been present since birth or very early life, and thus
represents a decline from a previously attained level of functioning.
The NCDs are unique among DSM-5 categories in that these are syndromes
for which the underlying pathology, and frequently the etiology as well,
can potentially be determined. The various underlying disease entities
have all been the subject of extensive research, clinical experience,
and expert consensus on diagnostic criteria. The DSM-5 criteria for
these disorders have been developed in close consultation with the
expert groups for each of the disease entities and align as closely as
possible with the current consensus criteria for each of them. The
potential utility of biomarkers is also discussed in relation to
diagnosis. Dementia is subsumed under the newly named entity major
neurocognitive disorder, although the term dementia is not precluded
from use in the etiological subtypes in which that term is standard.
Furthermore, DSM-5 recognizes a less severe level of cognitive
impairment, mild neurocognitive disorder, which can also be a focus of
care, and which in DSM-IV was subsumed under "Cognitive Disorder Not
Otherwise Specified." Diagnostic criteria are provided for both these
syndromic entities, followed by diagnostic criteria for the different
etiological subtypes. Several of the NCDs frequently coexist with one
another, and their relationships may be multiply characterized under
different chapter subheadings, including "Differential Diagnosis" (e.g.,
NCD due to Alzheimer's disease vs. vascular NCD), "Risk and Prognostic
Factors" (e.g.,

vascular pathology increasing the clinical expression of Alzheimer's
disease), and/or "Comorbidity" (e.g., mixed Alzheimer's
disease--vascular pathology). The term dementia is retained in DSM-5 for
continuity and may be used in settings where physicians and patients are
accustomed to this term. Although dementia is the customary term for
disorders like the degenerative dementias that usually affect older
adults, the term neurocognitive disorder is widely used and often
preferred for conditions affecting younger individuals, such as
impairment secondary to traumatic brain injury or HIV infection.
Furthermore, the major NCD definition is somewhat broader than the term
dementia, in that individuals with substantial decline in a single
domain can receive this diagnosis, most notably the DSM-IV category of
"Amnestic Disorder," which would now be diagnosed as major NCD due to
another medical condition and for which the term dementia would not be
used.

Neurocognitive Domains The criteria for the various NCDs are all based
on defined cognitive domains. Table 1 provides for each of the key
domains a working definition, examples of symptoms or observations
regarding impairments in everyday activities, and examples of
assessments. The domains thus defined, along with guidelines for
clinical thresholds, form the basis on which the NCDs, their levels, and
their subtypes may be diagnosed. TABLE 1 Neurocognitive domains

without regard to family or friends. Makes decisions without regard to
safety (e.g., inappropriate clothing for weather or social setting).
Typically, has little insight into these changes. Mild: Has subtle
changes in behavior or attitude, often described as a change in
personality, such as

less ability to recognize social cues or read facial expressions,
decreased empathy, increased extraversion or introversion, decreased
inhibition, or subtle or episodic apathy or restlessness.

Delirium Diagnostic Criteria a. A disturbance in attention (i.e.,
reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention) and
awareness (reduced orientation to the environment). b. The disturbance
develops over a short period of time (usually hours to a few days),
represents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and tends to
fluctuate in severity during the course of a day. c. An additional
disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation,
language, visuospatial ability, or perception). d. The disturbances in
Criteria A and C are not better explained by another preexisting,
established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder and do not occur in the
context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma. e. There
is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory
findings that the disturbance is a direct physiological consequence of
another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal (i.e.,
due to a drug of abuse or to a medication), or exposure to a toxin, or
is due to multiple etiologies. Specify whether: Substance intoxication
delirium: This diagnosis should be made instead of substance
intoxication when the symptoms in Criteria A and C predominate in the
clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant
clinical attention. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for
the \[specific substance\] intoxication delirium are indicated in the
table below. Note that

the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid
substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a
mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance intoxication
delirium, the 4th position character is "1," and the clinician should
record "mild \[substance\] use disorder" before the substance
intoxication delirium (e.g., "mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine
intoxication delirium"). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder
is comorbid with the substance intoxication delirium, the 4th position
character is "2," and the clinician should record "moderate
\[substance\] use disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use disorder,"
depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If
there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a onetime heavy
use of the substance), then the 4th position character is "9," and the
clinician should record only the substance intoxication delirium.

Substance withdrawal delirium: This diagnosis should be made instead of
substance withdrawal when the symptoms in Criteria A and C predominate
in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant
clinical attention. Code \[specific substance\] withdrawal delirium:
291.0 (F10.231) alcohol; 292.0 (F11.23) opioid; 292.0 (F13.231)
sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic; 292.0 (F19.231) other (or unknown)
substance/medication.

Medication-induced delirium: This diagnosis applies when the symptoms in
Criteria A and C arise as a side effect of a medication taken as
prescribed. Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for \[specific
medication\]-induced delirium is 292.81. The ICD-10-CM code depends on
the type of medication. If the medication is an opioid taken as
prescribed, the code is F11.921. If the medication is a sedative,
hypnotic, or anxiolytic taken as prescribed, the code is F13.921. If the
medication is an amphetamine-type or other stimulant taken as
prescribed, the code is F15.921. For medications that do not fit into
any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone) and in cases in which a
substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class
of substance is unknown, the code is F19.921. 293.0 (F05) Delirium due
to another medical condition: There is evidence from the history,
physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is
attributable to the physiological consequences of another medical
condition. Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition
in the name of the delirium (e.g., 293.0 \[F05\] delirium due to hepatic
encephalopathy). The other medical condition should also be coded and
listed separately immediately before the delirium due to another medical
condition (e.g., 572.2 \[K72.90\] hepatic encephalopathy; 293.0 \[F05\]
delirium due to hepatic encephalopathy). 293.0 (F05) Delirium due to
multiple etiologies: There is evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings that the delirium has more than one
etiology (e.g., more than one etiological medical condition; another
medical condition plus substance intoxication or medication side
effect). Coding note: Use multiple separate codes reflecting specific
delirium etiologies (e.g., 572.2 \[K72.90\] hepatic encephalopathy,
293.0 \[F05\] delirium due to hepatic failure; 291.0 \[F10.231\] alcohol
withdrawal delirium). Note that the etiological medical condition both
appears as a separate code that precedes the delirium code and is
substituted into the delirium due to another medical condition rubric.
Specify if: Acute: Lasting a few hours or days. Persistent: Lasting
weeks or months. Specify if: Hyperactive: The individual has a
hyperactive level of psychomotor activity that may be accompanied by
mood lability, agitation, and/or refusal to cooperate with medical care.
Hypoactive: The individual has a hypoactive level of psychomotor
activity that may be accompanied by sluggishness and lethargy that
approaches stupor.

Mixed level of activity: The individual has a normal level of
psychomotor activity even though attention and awareness are disturbed.
Also includes individuals whose activity level rapidly fluctuates.

Recording Procedures Substance intoxication delirium ICD-9-CM. The name
of the substance/medication intoxication delirium begins with the
specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be
causing the delirium. The diagnostic code is selected from the table
included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For
substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
dexamethasone), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in
cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the course
(i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of
psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of
activity). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10CM, which combine
the substance/medication intoxication delirium and substance use
disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is
given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of acute
hyperactive intoxication delirium occurring in a man with a severe
cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.81 cocaine intoxication
delirium, acute, hyperactive. An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe
cocaine use disorder is also given. If the intoxication delirium occurs
without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy
use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted
(e.g., 292.81 phencyclidine intoxication delirium, acute, hypoactive).
ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication intoxication delirium
begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that
is presumed to be causing the delirium. The diagnostic code is selected
from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug
class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For
substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g.,
dexamethasone), the code for "other substance" should be used; and in
cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the
specific class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance"
should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid
substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word
"with," followed by the name of the substance intoxication delirium,
followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent), followed by the
specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i.e., hyperactive,
hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute
hyperactive

intoxication delirium occurring in a man with a severe cocaine use
disorder, the diagnosis is F14.221 severe cocaine use disorder with
cocaine intoxication delirium, acute, hyperactive. A separate diagnosis
of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the
intoxication delirium occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder
(e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying
substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.921 phencyclidine
intoxication delirium, acute, hypoactive).

Substance withdrawal delirium ICD-9-CM. The name of the
substance/medication withdrawal delirium begins with the specific
substance (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the withdrawal
delirium. The diagnostic code is selected from substance-specific codes
included in the coding note included in the criteria set. The name of
the disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent),
followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity
(i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). Unlike the
recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the
substance/medication withdrawal delirium and substance use disorder into
a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the
substance use disorder. For example, in the case of acute hyperactive
withdrawal delirium occurring in a man with a severe alcohol use
disorder, the diagnosis is 291.0 alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute,
hyperactive. An additional diagnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use
disorder is also given. ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication
withdrawal delirium begins with the specific substance (e.g., alcohol)
that is presumed to be causing the withdrawal delirium. The diagnostic
code is selected from substance-specific codes included in the coding
note included in the criteria set. When recording the name of the
disorder, the comorbid moderate or severe substance use disorder (if
any) is listed first, followed by the word "with," followed by the
substance withdrawal delirium, followed by the course (i.e., acute,
persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor
activity (i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For
example, in the case of acute hyperactive withdrawal delirium occurring
in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10.231
severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute,
hyperactive. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use
disorder is not given. Medication-induced delirium. The name of the
medication-induced delirium begins with the specific substance (e.g.,
dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delirium. The name of
the disorder is followed by the course (i.e., acute, persistent),
followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity
(i.e., hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example,
in the case of acute hyperactive medication-induced delirium occurring
in a man using dexamethasone

as prescribed, the diagnosis is 292.81 (F19.921) dexamethasone-induced
delirium, acute, hyperactive.

Specifiers Regarding course, in hospital settings, delirium usually
lasts about 1 week, but some symptoms often persist even after
individuals are discharged from the hospital. Individuals with delirium
may rapidly switch between hyperactive and hypoactive states. The
hyperactive state may be more common or more frequently recognized3 and
often is associated with medication side effects and drug withdrawal.
The hypoactive state may be more frequent in older adults.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of delirium is a disturbance
of attention or awareness that is accompanied by a change in baseline
cognition that cannot be better explained by a preexisting or evolving
neurocognitive disorder (NCD). The disturbance in attention (Criterion
A) is manifested by reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift
attention. Questions must be repeated because the individual's attention
wanders, or the individual may perseverate with an answer to a previous
question rather than appropriately shift attention. The individual is
easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli. The disturbance in awareness is
manifested by a reduced orientation to the environment or at times even
to oneself5. The disturbance develops over a short period of time,
usually hours to a few days, and tends to fluctuate during the course of
the day, often with worsening in the evening and night when external
orienting stimuli decrease (Criterion B). There is evidence from the
history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the
disturbance is a physiological consequence of an underlying medical
condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, use of a medication, or
a toxin exposure, or a combination of these factors (Criterion E). The
etiology should be coded according to the etiologically appropriate
subtype (i.e., substance or medication intoxication, substance
withdrawal, another medical condition, or multiple etiologies). Delirium
often occurs in the context of an underlying NCD6, 9. The impaired brain
function of individuals with mild and major NCD renders them more
vulnerable to delirium. There is an accompanying change in at least one
other area that may include memory and learning (particularly recent
memory), disorientation (particularly to time and place), alteration in
language, or perceptual distortion or a perceptualmotor disturbance
(Criterion C). The perceptual disturbances accompanying delirium include
misinterpretations, illusions, or hallucinations; these disturbances are
typically visual, but may occur in other modalities as well, and range
from simple and uniform to highly complex. Normal attention/arousal,
delirium, and coma lie on a continuum, with coma defined as the lack of
any response to verbal

stimuli. The ability to evaluate cognition to diagnose delirium depends
on there being a level of arousal sufficient for response to verbal
stimulation; hence, delirium should not be diagnosed in the context of
coma (Criterion D). Many noncomatose patients have a reduced level of
arousal. Those patients who show only minimal responses to verbal
stimulation are incapable of engaging with attempts at standardized
testing or even interview. This inability to engage should be classified
as severe inattention. Low-arousal states (of acute onset) should be
recognized as indicating severe inattention and cognitive change, and
hence delirium. They are clinically indistinguishable from delirium
diagnosed on the basis of inattention or cognitive change elicited
through cognitive testing and interview.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Delirium is often associated
with a disturbance in the sleep-wake cycle. This disturbance can include
daytime sleepiness, nighttime agitation, difficulty falling asleep,
excessive sleepiness throughout the day, or wakefulness throughout the
night. In some cases, complete reversal of the night-day sleep-wake
cycle can occur. Sleep-wake cycle disturbances are very common in
delirium and have been proposed as a core criterion for the diagnosis10.
The individual with delirium may exhibit emotional disturbances, such as
anxiety, fear, depression, irritability, anger, euphoria, and apathy10.
There may be rapid and unpredictable shifts from one emotional state to
another. The disturbed emotional state may also be evident in calling
out, screaming, cursing, muttering, moaning, or making other sounds.
These behaviors are especially prevalent at night and under conditions
in which stimulation and environmental cues are lacking.

Prevalence The prevalence of delirium is highest among hospitalized
older individuals and varies depending on the individuals'
characteristics, setting of care, and sensitivity of the detection
method. The prevalence of delirium in the community overall is low
(1%--2%)9 but increases with age, rising to 14% among individuals older
than 85 years. The prevalence is 10%--30% in older individuals
presenting to emergency departments, where the delirium often indicates
a medical illness9. The prevalence of delirium when individuals are
admitted to the hospital ranges from 14% to 24%, and estimates of the
incidence of delirium arising during hospitalization range from 6% to
56% in general hospital populations1, 8. Delirium occurs in 15%--53% of
older individuals postoperatively1 and in 70%--87% of those in intensive
care11. Delirium occurs in up to 60% of individuals in nursing homes or
post--acute care settings2 and in up to 83% of all individuals at the
end of life4.

Development and Course

While the majority of individuals with delirium have a full recovery
with or without treatment, early recognition and intervention usually
shortens the duration of the delirium12. Delirium may progress to
stupor, coma, seizures, or death, particularly if the underlying cause
remains untreated. Mortality among hospitalized individuals with
delirium is high, and as many as 40% of individuals with delirium,
particularly those with malignancies and other significant underlying
medical illness, die within a year after diagnosis9.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Delirium may be increased in
the context of functional impairment, immobility, a history of falls,
low levels of activity, and use of drugs and medications with
psychoactive properties (particularly alcohol and anticholinergics).
Genetic and physiological. Both major and mild NCDs can increase the
risk for delirium and complicate the course. Older individuals are
especially susceptible to delirium compared with younger adults.
Susceptibility to delirium in infancy and through childhood may be
greater than in early and middle adulthood. In childhood, delirium may
be related to febrile illnesses and certain medications (e.g.,
anticholinergics).

Diagnostic Markers In addition to laboratory findings characteristic of
underlying medical conditions (or intoxication or withdrawal states),
there is often generalized slowing on electroencephalography, and fast
activity is occasionally found (e.g., in some cases of alcohol
withdrawal delirium). However, electroencephalography is insufficiently
sensitive and specific for diagnostic use8.

Functional Consequences of Delirium Delirium itself is associated with
increased functional decline and risk of institutional placement.
Hospitalized individuals 65 years or older with delirium have three
times the risk of nursing home placement and about three times the
functional decline as hospitalized patients without delirium at both
discharge and 3 months postdischarge.

Differential Diagnosis Psychotic disorders and bipolar and depressive
disorders with psychotic features. Delirium that is characterized by
vivid hallucinations, delusions, language disturbances, and agitation
must be distinguished from brief psychotic

disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and other psychotic
disorders, as well as from bipolar and depressive disorders with
psychotic features. Acute stress disorder. Delirium associated with
fear, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, such as depersonalization,
must be distinguished from acute stress disorder, which is precipitated
by exposure to a severely traumatic event. Malingering and factitious
disorder. Delirium can be distinguished from these disorders on the
basis of the often atypical presentation in malingering and factitious
disorder and the absence of another medical condition or substance that
is etiologically related to the apparent cognitive disturbance. Other
neurocognitive disorders. The most common differential diagnostic issue
when evaluating confusion in older adults is disentangling symptoms of
delirium and dementia6, 7. The clinician must determine whether the
individual has delirium; a delirium superimposed on a preexisting NCD,
such as that due to Alzheimer's disease; or an NCD without delirium. The
traditional distinction between delirium and dementia according to
acuteness of onset and temporal course is particularly difficult in
those elderly individuals who had a prior NCD that may not have been
recognized, or who develop persistent cognitive impairment following an
episode of delirium.

Other Specified Delirium 780.09 (R41.0) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of delirium that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for delirium or any of the disorders in the neurocognitive
disorders diagnostic class. The other specified delirium category is
used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the
specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for
delirium or any specific neurocognitive disorder. This is done by
recording "other specified delirium" followed by the specific reason
(e.g., "attenuated delirium syndrome"). An example of a presentation
that can be specified using the "other specified" designation is the
following: Attenuated delirium syndrome: This syndrome applies in cases
of delirium in which the severity of cognitive impairment falls short of
that required for the diagnosis, or in which some, but not all,
diagnostic criteria for delirium are met.

Unspecified Delirium 780.09 (R41.0) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of delirium that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for delirium or any of the disorders in the neurocognitive
disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified delirium category is used in
situations in which the clinician

chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for
delirium, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient
information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room
settings).

Major and Mild Neurocognitive Disorders Major Neurocognitive Disorder
Diagnostic Criteria a. Evidence of significant cognitive decline from a
previous level of performance in one or more cognitive domains (complex
attention, executive function, learning and memory, language,
perceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on: 1. Concern of the
individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician that there has
been a significant decline in cognitive function; and 2. A substantial
impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by
standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another
quantified clinical assessment. b. The cognitive deficits interfere with
independence in everyday activities (i.e., at a minimum, requiring
assistance with complex instrumental activities of daily living such as
paying bills or managing medications). c. The cognitive deficits do not
occur exclusively in the context of a delirium. d. The cognitive
deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g.,
major depressive disorder, schizophrenia). Specify whether due to:

dressing). Severe: Fully dependent.

Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a. Evidence of modest
cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or more
cognitive domains (complex attention, executive function, learning and
memory, language, perceptual-motor, or social cognition) based on: 1.
Concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician
that there has been a mild decline in cognitive function; and 2. A
modest impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by
standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another
quantified clinical assessment. b. The cognitive deficits do not
interfere with capacity for independence in everyday activities (i.e.,
complex instrumental activities of daily living such as paying bills or
managing medications are preserved, but greater effort, compensatory
strategies, or accommodation may be required).

c. The cognitive deficits do not occur exclusively in the context of a
delirium. d. The cognitive deficits are not better explained by another
mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, schizophrenia).

medical etiologies listed above, code 331.83 (G31.84). Do not use
additional codes for the presumed etiological medical conditions. For
substance/medication-induced mild neurocognitive disorder, code based on
type of substance; see "Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild
Neurocognitive Disorder." For unspecified mild neurocognitive disorder,
code 799.59 (R41.9). Specify: Without behavioral disturbance: If the
cognitive disturbance is not accompanied by any clinically significant
behavioral disturbance. With behavioral disturbance (specify
disturbance): If the cognitive disturbance is accompanied by a
clinically significant behavioral disturbance (e.g., psychotic symptoms,
mood disturbance, agitation, apathy, or other behavioral symptoms).

Subtypes Major and mild neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) are primarily
subtyped according to the known or presumed etiological/pathological
entity or entities underlying the cognitive decline. These subtypes are
distinguished on the basis of a combination of time course,
characteristic domains affected, and associated symptoms. For certain
etiological subtypes, the diagnosis depends substantially on the
presence of a potentially causative entity, such as Parkinson's or
Huntington's disease, or a

traumatic brain injury or stroke in the appropriate time period. For
other etiological subtypes (generally the neurodegenerative diseases
like Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and Lewy
body disease), the diagnosis is based primarily on the cognitive,
behavioral, and functional symptoms. Typically, the differentiation
among these syndromes that lack an independently recognized etiological
entity is clearer at the level of major NCD than at the level of mild
NCD, but sometimes characteristic symptoms and associated features are
present at the mild level as well. NCDs are frequently managed by
clinicians in multiple disciplines. For many subtypes, multidisciplinary
international expert groups have developed specialized consensus
criteria based on clinicopathological correlation with underlying brain
pathology1, 6, 7. The subtype criteria here have been harmonized with
those expert criteria.

Specifiers Evidence for distinct behavioral features in NCDs has been
recognized, particularly in the areas of psychotic symptoms and
depression5. Psychotic features are common in many NCDs, particularly at
the mild-to-moderate stage of major NCDs due to Alzheimer's disease,
Lewy body disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Paranoia and
other delusions are common features, and often a persecutory theme may
be a prominent aspect of delusional ideation. In contrast to psychotic
disorders with onset in earlier life (e.g., schizophrenia), disorganized
speech and disorganized behavior are not characteristic of psychosis in
NCDs. Hallucinations may occur in any modality, although visual
hallucinations are more common in NCDs than in depressive, bipolar, or
psychotic disorders. Mood disturbances, including depression, anxiety,
and elation, may occur. Depression is common early in the course
(including at the mild NCD level) of NCD due to Alzheimer's disease and
Parkinson's disease, while elation may occur more commonly in
frontotemporal lobar degeneration. When a full affective syndrome
meeting diagnostic criteria for a depressive or bipolar disorder is
present, that diagnosis should be coded as well. Mood symptoms are
increasingly recognized to be a significant feature in the earliest
stages of mild NCDs such that clinical recognition and intervention may
be important. Agitation is common in a wide variety of NCDs,
particularly in major NCD of moderate to severe severity, and often
occurs in the setting of confusion or frustration. It may arise as
combative behaviors, particularly in the context of resisting caregiving
duties such as bathing and dressing. Agitation is characterized as
disruptive motor or vocal activity and tends to occur with advanced
stages of cognitive impairment across all of the NCDs.

Individuals with NCD can present with a wide variety of behavioral
symptoms that are the focus of treatment. Sleep disturbance is a common
symptom that can create a need for clinical attention and may include
symptoms of insomnia, hypersomnia, and circadian rhythm disturbances.
Apathy is common in mild and mild major NCD. It is observed particularly
in NCD due to Alzheimer's disease and may be a prominent feature of NCD
due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Apathy is typically
characterized by diminished motivation and reduced goal-directed
behavior accompanied by decreased emotional responsiveness. Symptoms of
apathy may manifest early in the course of NCDs when a loss of
motivation to pursue daily activities or hobbies may be observed. Other
important behavioral symptoms include wandering, disinhibition,
hyperphagia, and hoarding. Some of these symptoms are characteristic of
specific disorders, as discussed in the relevant sections. When more
than one behavioral disturbance is observed, each type should be noted
in writing with the specifier "with behavioral symptoms."

Diagnostic Features Major and mild NCDs exist on a spectrum of cognitive
and functional impairment. Major NCD corresponds to the condition
referred to in DSM-IV as dementia, retained as an alternative in this
volume. The core feature of NCDs is acquired cognitive decline in one or
more cognitive domains (Criterion A) based on both 1) a concern about
cognition on the part of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or
the clinician, and 2) performance on an objective assessment that falls
below the expected level or that has been observed to decline over time.
Both a concern and objective evidence are required because they are
complementary. When there is an exclusive focus on objective testing, a
disorder may go undiagnosed in highfunctioning individuals whose
currently "normal" performance actually represents a substantial decline
in abilities, or an illness may be incorrectly diagnosed in individuals
whose currently "low" performance does not represent a change from their
own baseline or is a result of extraneous factors like test conditions
or a passing illness. Alternatively, excessive focus on subjective
symptoms may fail to diagnose illness in individuals with poor insight,
or whose informants deny or fail to notice their symptoms, or it may be
overly sensitive in the so-called worried well. A cognitive concern
differs from a complaint in that it may or may not be voiced
spontaneously. Rather, it may need to be elicited by careful questioning
about specific symptoms that commonly occur in individuals with
cognitive deficits (see Table 1 in the introduction to this chapter).
For example, memory concerns include difficulty remembering a short
grocery list or keeping track of the plot of a television program;
executive concerns include difficulty resuming a task when interrupted,
organizing tax records, or planning a holiday meal. At the mild NCD

level, the individual is likely to describe these tasks as being more
difficult or as requiring extra time or effort or compensatory
strategies. At the major NCD level, such tasks may only be completed
with assistance or may be abandoned altogether. At the mild NCD level,
individuals and their families may not notice such symptoms or may view
them as normal, particularly in the elderly; thus, careful history
taking is of paramount importance. The difficulties must represent
changes rather than lifelong patterns: the individual or informant may
clarify this issue, or the clinician can infer change from prior
experience with the patient or from occupational or other clues. It is
also critical to determine that the difficulties are related to
cognitive loss rather than to motor or sensory limitations.
Neuropsychological testing, with performance compared with norms
appropriate to the patient's age, educational attainment, and cultural
background, is part of the standard evaluation of NCDs and is
particularly critical in the evaluation of mild NCD. For major NCD,
performance is typically 2 or more standard deviations below appropriate
norms (3rd percentile or below). For mild NCD, performance typically
lies in the 1--2 standard deviation range (between the 3rd and 16th
percentiles). However, neuropsychological testing is not available in
all settings, and neuropsychological thresholds are sensitive to the
specific test(s) and norms employed, as well as to test conditions,
sensory limitations, and intercurrent illness. A variety of brief
office-based or "bedside" assessments, as described in Table 1, can also
supply objective data in settings where such testing is unavailable or
infeasible. In any case, as with cognitive concerns, objective
performance must be interpreted in light of the individual's prior
performance. Optimally, this information would be available from a prior
administration of the same test, but often it must be inferred based on
appropriate norms, along with the individual's educational history,
occupation, and other factors. Norms are more challenging to interpret
in individuals with very high or very low levels of education and in
individuals being tested outside their own language or cultural
background. Criterion B relates to the individual's level of
independence in everyday functioning. Individuals with major NCD will
have impairment of sufficient severity so as to interfere with
independence, such that others will have to take over tasks that the
individuals were previously able to complete on their own. Individuals
with mild NCD will have preserved independence, although there may be
subtle interference with function or a report that tasks require more
effort or take more time than previously. The distinction between major
and mild NCD is inherently arbitrary, and the disorders exist along a
continuum. Precise thresholds are therefore difficult to determine.
Careful history taking, observation, and integration with other findings
are required, and the implications of diagnosis should be considered
when an individual's clinical manifestations lie at a boundary.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Typically the associated
features that support a diagnosis of major or mild NCD will be specific
to the etiological subtype (e.g., neuroleptic sensitivity and visual
hallucinations in NCD due to Lewy body disease). Diagnostic features
specific to each of the subtypes are found in the relevant sections.

Prevalence The prevalence of NCD varies widely by age and by etiological
subtype. Overall prevalence estimates are generally only available for
older populations. Among individuals older than 60 years, prevalence
increases steeply with age, so prevalence estimates are more accurate
for narrow age bands than for broad categories such as "over 65" (where
the mean age can vary greatly with the life expectancy of the given
population). For those etiological subtypes occurring across the
lifespan, prevalence estimates for NCD are likely to be available, if at
all, only as the fraction of individuals who develop NCD among those
with the relevant condition (e.g., traumatic brain injury, HIV
infection). Overall prevalence estimates for dementia (which is largely
congruent with major NCD) are approximately 1%--2% at age 65 years and
as high as 30% by age 85 years2. The prevalence of mild NCD is very
sensitive to the definition of the disorder, particularly in community
settings, where evaluations are less detailed. In addition, in contrast
with clinical settings, where cognitive concern must be high to seek and
locate care, there may be a less clear decline from baseline
functioning. Estimates of the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment
(which is substantially congruent with mild NCD) among older individuals
are fairly variable, ranging from 2% to 10% at age 65 and 5% to 25% by
age 858.

Development and Course The course of NCD varies across etiological
subtypes, and this variation can be useful in differential diagnosis.
Some subtypes (e.g., those related to traumatic brain injury or stroke)
typically begin at a specific time and (at least after initial symptoms
related to inflammation or swelling subside) remain static. Others may
fluctuate over time (although if this occurs, the possibility of
delirium superimposed on NCD should be considered). NCDs due to
neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal
lobar degeneration typically are marked by insidious onset and gradual
progression, and the pattern of onset of cognitive deficits and
associated features helps to distinguish among them. NCDs with onset in
childhood and adolescence may have broad repercussions for social and
intellectual development, and in this setting intellectual disability
(intellectual developmental disorder) and/or other neurodevelopmental
disorders may also be diagnosed to capture the full diagnostic picture
and ensure the provision

of a broad range of services. In older individuals, NCDs often occur in
the setting of medical illnesses, frailty, and sensory loss, which
complicate the clinical picture for diagnosis and treatment. When
cognitive loss occurs in youth to midlife, individuals and families are
likely to seek care. NCDs are typically easiest to identify at younger
ages, although in some settings malingering or other factitious
disorders may be a concern. Very late in life, cognitive symptoms may
not cause concern or may go unnoticed. In late life, mild NCD must also
be distinguished from the more modest deficits associated with "normal
aging," although a substantial fraction of what has been ascribed to
normal aging likely represents prodromal phases of various NCDs9. In
addition, it becomes harder to recognize mild NCD with age because of
the increasing prevalence of medical illness and sensory deficits. It
becomes harder to differentiate among subtypes with age because there
are multiple potential sources of neurocognitive decline.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Risk factors vary not only by etiological
subtype but also by age at onset within etiological subtypes. Some
subtypes are distributed throughout the lifespan, whereas others occur
exclusively or primarily in late life. Even within the NCDs of aging,
the relative prevalence varies with age: Alzheimer's disease is uncommon
before age 60 years, and the prevalence increases steeply thereafter,
while the overall less common frontotemporal lobar degeneration has
earlier onset and represents a progressively smaller fraction of NCDs
with age. Genetic and physiological. The strongest risk factor for major
and mild NCDs is age, primarily because age increases the risk of
neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease. Female gender is
associated with higher prevalence of dementia overall, and especially
Alzheimer's disease, but this difference is largely, if not wholly,
attributable to greater longevity in females4.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Individuals' and families' level of
awareness and concern about neurocognitive symptoms may vary across
ethnic and occupational groups. Neurocognitive symptoms are more likely
to be noticed, particularly at the mild level, in individuals who engage
in complex occupational, domestic, or recreational activities. In
addition, norms for neuropsychological testing tend to be available only
for broad populations, and thus they may not be easily applicable to
individuals with less than high school education or those being
evaluated outside their primary language or culture.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Like age, culture, and occupation, gender issues may affect the level of
concern and awareness of cognitive symptoms. In addition, for late-life
NCDs, females are likely to be older, to have more medical comorbidity,
and to live alone, which can complicate evaluation and treatment. In
addition, there are gender differences in the frequency of some of the
etiological subtypes.

Diagnostic Markers In addition to a careful history, neuropsychological
assessments are the key measures for diagnosis of NCDs, particularly at
the mild level, where functional changes are minimal and symptoms more
subtle. Ideally, individuals will be referred for formal
neuropsychological testing, which will provide a quantitative assessment
of all relevant domains and thus help with diagnosis; provide guidance
to the family on areas where the individual may require more support;
and serve as a benchmark for further decline or response to therapies.
When such testing is unavailable or not feasible, the brief assessments
in Table 1 can provide insight into each domain. More global brief
mental status tests may be helpful but may be insensitive, particularly
to modest changes in a single domain or in those with high premorbid
abilities, and may be overly sensitive in those with low premorbid
abilities. In distinguishing among etiological subtypes, additional
diagnostic markers may come into play, particularly neuroimaging studies
such as magnetic resonance imaging scans and positron emission
tomography scans. In addition, specific markers may be involved in the
assessment of specific subtypes and may become more important as
additional research findings accumulate over time, as discussed in the
relevant sections.

Functional Consequences Neurocognitive Disorders

of

Major

and

Mild

By definition, major and mild NCDs affect functioning, given the central
role of cognition in human life. Thus, the criteria for the disorders,
and the threshold for differentiating mild from major NCD, are based in
part on functional assessment. Within major NCD there is a broad range
of functional impairment, as implemented in the severity specifiers. In
addition, the specific functions that are compromised can help identify
the cognitive domains affected, particularly when neuropsychological
testing is not available or is difficult to interpret.

Differential Diagnosis Normal cognition. The differential diagnosis
between normal cognition and mild NCD, as between mild and major NCD, is
challenging because the boundaries are inherently arbitrary. Careful
history taking and objective assessment are critical to

these distinctions. A longitudinal evaluation using quantified
assessments may be key in detecting mild NCD. Delirium. Both mild and
major NCD may be difficult to distinguish from a persistent delirium,
which can co-occur. Careful assessment of attention and arousal will
help to make the distinction. Major depressive disorder. The distinction
between mild NCD and major depressive disorder, which may co-occur with
NCD, can also be challenging. Specific patterns of cognitive deficits
may be helpful. For example, consistent memory and executive function
deficits are typical of Alzheimer's disease, whereas nonspecific or more
variable performance is seen in major depression. Alternatively,
treatment of the depressive disorder with repeated observation over time
may be required to make the diagnosis. Specific learning disorder and
other neurodevelopmental disorders. A careful clarification of the
individual's baseline status will help distinguish an NCD from a
specific learning disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders.
Additional issues may enter the differential for specific etiological
subtypes, as described in the relevant sections.

Comorbidity NCDs are common in older individuals and thus often co-occur
with a wide variety of age-related diseases that may complicate
diagnosis or treatment. Most notable of these is delirium, for which NCD
increases the risk. In older individuals, a delirium during
hospitalization is, in many cases, the first time that an NCD is
noticed, although a careful history will often reveal evidence of
earlier decline. Mixed NCDs are also common in older individuals, as
many etiological entities increase in prevalence with age. In younger
individuals, NCD often co-occurs with neurodevelopmental disorders; for
example, a head injury in a preschool child may also lead to significant
developmental and learning issues. Additional comorbidity of NCD is
often related to the etiological subtype, as discussed in the relevant
sections.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease
Diagnostic Criteria a. The criteria are met for major or mild
neurocognitive disorder. b. There is insidious onset and gradual
progression of impairment in one or more cognitive domains (for major
neurocognitive disorder, at least two domains must be impaired).
c. Criteria are met for either probable or possible Alzheimer's disease
as follows: For major neurocognitive disorder: Probable Alzheimer's
disease is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise,
possible Alzheimer's disease should be diagnosed. 1. Evidence of a
causative Alzheimer's disease genetic mutation from family history or
genetic testing.

2. All three of the following are present: a. Clear evidence of decline
in memory and learning and at least one other cognitive domain (based on
detailed history or serial neuropsychological testing). b. Steadily
progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended plateaus.
c. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other
neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease, or another neurological,
mental, or systemic disease or condition likely contributing to
cognitive decline). For mild neurocognitive disorder: Probable
Alzheimer's disease is diagnosed if there is evidence of a causative
Alzheimer's disease genetic mutation from either genetic testing or
family history. Possible Alzheimer's disease is diagnosed if there is no
evidence of a causative Alzheimer's disease genetic mutation from either
genetic testing or family history, and all three of the following are
present: 1. Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning. 2.
Steadily progressive, gradual decline in cognition, without extended
plateaus. 3. No evidence of mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other
neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease, or another neurological or
systemic disease or condition likely contributing to cognitive decline).
d. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease,
another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or
another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Coding note: For
major neurocognitive disorder due to probable Alzheimer's disease, with
behavioral disturbance, code first 331.0 (G30.9) Alzheimer's disease,
followed by 294.11 (F02.81). For major neurocognitive disorder due to
probable Alzheimer's disease, without behavioral disturbance, code first
331.0 (G30.9) Alzheimer's disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80). For

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease, code 331.83
(G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for Alzheimer's disease.
Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in
writing.)

Diagnostic Features Beyond the neurocognitive disorder (NCD) syndrome
(Criterion A), the core features of major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's
disease include an insidious onset and gradual progression of cognitive
and behavioral symptoms (Criterion B)1, 8. The typical presentation is
amnestic (i.e., with impairment in memory and learning). Unusual
nonamnestic presentations, particularly visuospatial and logopenic
aphasic variants, also exist. At the mild NCD phase, Alzheimer's disease
manifests typically with impairment in memory and learning, sometimes
accompanied by deficits in executive function. At the major NCD phase,
visuoconstructional/perceptual-motor ability and language will also be
impaired, particularly when the NCD is moderate to severe. Social
cognition tends to be preserved until late in the course of the disease.
A level of diagnostic certainty must be specified denoting Alzheimer's
disease as the "probable" or "possible" etiology (Criterion C). Probable
Alzheimer's disease is diagnosed in both major and mild NCD if there is
evidence of a causative Alzheimer's disease gene, either from genetic
testing or from an autosomal dominant family history coupled with
autopsy confirmation or a genetic test in an affected family member. For
major NCD, a typical clinical picture, without extended plateaus or
evidence of mixed etiology, can also be diagnosed as due to probable
Alzheimer's disease. For mild NCD, given the lesser degree of certainty
that the deficits will progress, these features are only sufficient for
a possible Alzheimer's etiology. If the etiology appears mixed, mild NCD
due to multiple etiologies should be diagnosed. In any case, for both
mild and major NCD due to Alzheimer's disease, the clinical features
must not suggest another primary etiology for the NCD (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis In specialty clinical settings,
approximately 80% of individuals with major NCD due to Alzheimer's
disease have behavioral and psychological manifestations; these features
are also frequent at the mild NCD stage of impairment2. These symptoms
are as or more distressing than cognitive manifestations and are
frequently the reason that health care is sought. At the mild NCD stage
or the mildest level of major NCD, depression and/or apathy are often
seen. With moderately severe major NCD, psychotic features,
irritability, agitation, combativeness, and wandering are common. Late
in the illness, gait disturbance, dysphagia, incontinence, myoclonus,
and seizures are observed.

Prevalence The prevalence of overall dementia (major NCD) rises steeply
with age. In highincome countries, it ranges from 5% to 10% in the
seventh decade to at least 25% thereafter5. U.S. census data estimates
suggest that approximately 7% of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's
disease are between ages 65 and 74 years, 53% are between ages 75 and 84
years, and 40% are 85 years and older6. The percentage of dementias
attributable to Alzheimer's disease ranges from about 60% to over 90%,
depending on the setting and diagnostic criteria. Mild NCD due to
Alzheimer's disease is likely to represent a substantial fraction of
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well4, 9.

Development and Course Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease
progresses gradually, sometimes with brief plateaus, through severe
dementia to death. The mean duration of survival after diagnosis is
approximately 10 years10, reflecting the advanced age of the majority of
individuals rather than the course of the disease; some individuals can
live with the disease for as long as 20 years. Late-stage individuals
are eventually mute and bedbound. Death most commonly results from
aspiration in those who survive through the full course. In mild NCD due
to Alzheimer's disease, impairments increase over time, and functional
status gradually declines until symptoms reach the threshold for the
diagnosis of major NCD. The onset of symptoms is usually in the eighth
and ninth decades; early-onset forms seen in the fifth and sixth decades
are often related to known causative mutations. Symptoms and pathology
do not differ markedly at different onset ages. However, younger
individuals are more likely to survive the full course of the disease,
while older individuals are more likely to have numerous medical
comorbidities that affect the course and management of the illness.
Diagnostic complexity is higher in older adults because of the increased
likelihood of comorbid medical illness and mixed pathology.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Traumatic brain injury
increases risk for major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease. Genetic
and physiological. Age is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's
disease. The genetic susceptibility polymorphism apolipoprotein E4
increases risk and decreases age at onset, particularly in homozygous
individuals. There are also extremely rare causative Alzheimer's disease
genes3. Individuals with Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) develop
Alzheimer's disease if they survive to midlife. Multiple vascular risk
factors influence risk for Alzheimer's disease and may act by

increasing cerebrovascular pathology or also through direct effects on
Alzheimer pathology11.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Detection of an NCD may be more
difficult in cultural and socioeconomic settings where memory loss is
considered normal in old age, where older adults face fewer cognitive
demands in everyday life, or where very low educational levels pose
greater challenges to objective cognitive assessment.

Diagnostic Markers Cortical atrophy, amyloid-predominant neuritic
plaques, and tau-predominant neurofibrillary tangles are hallmarks of
the pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and may be confirmed
via postmortem histopathological examination. For early-onset cases with
autosomal dominant inheritance, a mutation in one of the known causative
Alzheimer's disease genes---amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin
1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2)---may be involved, and genetic
testing for such mutations is commercially available, at least for
PSEN1. Apolipoprotein E4 cannot serve as a diagnostic marker because it
is only a risk factor and neither necessary nor sufficient for disease
occurrence. Since amyloid beta-42 deposition in the brain occurs early
in the pathophysiological cascade, amyloid-based diagnostic tests such
as amyloid imaging on brain positron emission tomography (PET) scans and
reduced levels of amyloid beta-42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may
have diagnostic value. Signs of neuronal injury, such as hippocampal and
temporoparietal cortical atrophy on a magnetic resonance image scan,
temporoparietal hypometabolism on a fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan, and
evidence for elevated total tau and phospho-tau levels in CSF7, provide
evidence of neuronal damage but are less specific for Alzheimer's
disease. At present, these biomarkers are not fully validated, and many
are available only in tertiary care settings. However, some of them,
along with novel biomarkers, will likely move into wider clinical
practice in the coming years.

Functional Consequences of Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to
Alzheimer's Disease The prominence of memory loss can cause significant
difficulties relatively early in the course. Social cognition (and thus
social functioning) and procedural memory (e.g., dancing, playing
musical instruments) may be relatively preserved for extended periods.

Differential Diagnosis

Other neurocognitive disorders. Major and mild NCDs due to other
neurodegenerative processes (e.g., Lewy body disease, frontotemporal
lobar degeneration) share the insidious onset and gradual decline caused
by Alzheimer's disease but have distinctive core features of their own.
In major or mild vascular NCD, there is typically history of stroke
temporally related to the onset of cognitive impairment, and infarcts or
white matter hyperintensities are judged sufficient to account for the
clinical picture. However, particularly when there is no clear history
of stepwise decline, major or mild vascular NCD can share many clinical
features with Alzheimer's disease. Other concurrent, active neurological
or systemic illness. Other neurological or systemic illness should be
considered if there is an appropriate temporal relationship and severity
to account for the clinical picture. At the mild NCD level, it may be
difficult to distinguish an Alzheimer's disease etiology from that of
another medical condition (e.g., thyroid disorders, vitamin B12
deficiency). Major depressive disorder. Particularly at the mild NCD
level, the differential diagnosis also includes major depression. The
presence of depression may be associated with reduced daily functioning
and poor concentration that may resemble an NCD, but improvement with
treatment of depression may be useful in making the distinction.

Comorbidity Most individuals with Alzheimer's disease are elderly and
have multiple medical conditions that can complicate diagnosis and
influence the clinical course. Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's
disease commonly co-occurs with cerebrovascular disease, which
contributes to the clinical picture. When a comorbid condition
contributes to the NCD in an individual with Alzheimer's disease, then
NCD due to multiple etiologies should be diagnosed.

    frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code
    first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11
    (F02.81). For major neurocognitive disorder due to probable

    not use the additional code for frontotemporal

disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be
indicated in writing.)

Diagnostic Features Major or mild frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder
(NCD) comprises a number of syndromic variants characterized by the
progressive development of behavioral and personality change and/or
language impairment. The behavioral variant and three language variants
(semantic, agrammatic/nonfluent, and logopenic) exhibit distinct
patterns of brain atrophy and some distinctive neuropathology. The
criteria must be met for either the behavioral or the language variant
to make the diagnosis, but many individuals present with features of
both. Individuals with behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal
NCD present with varying degrees of apathy or disinhibition9. They may
lose interest in socialization, self-care, and personal
responsibilities, or display socially inappropriate behaviors. Insight
is usually impaired, and this often delays medical consultation. The
first referral is often to a psychiatrist. Individuals may develop
changes in social style, and in religious and political beliefs, with
repetitive movements, hoarding, changes in eating behavior, and
hyperorality8. In later stages, loss of sphincter control may occur.
Cognitive decline is less prominent, and formal testing may show
relatively few deficits in the early stages. Common neurocognitive
symptoms are lack of planning and organization, distractibility, and
poor judgment. Deficits in executive function, such as poor performance
on tests of mental flexibility, abstract reasoning, and response
inhibition, are present, but learning and memory are relatively spared,
and perceptual-motor abilities are almost always preserved in the early
stages. Individuals with language-variant major or mild frontotemporal
NCD present with primary progressive aphasia with gradual onset6, with
three subtypes commonly described: semantic variant,
agrammatic/nonfluent variant, and logopenic variant2, 4, and each
variant has distinctive features and corresponding neuropathology.
"Probable" is distinguished from "possible" frontotemporal NCD by the
presence of causative genetic factors (e.g., mutations in the gene
coding for microtubuleassociated protein tau) or by the presence of
distinctive atrophy or reduced activity in frontotemporal regions on
structural or functional imaging.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Extrapyramidal features may be
prominent in some cases, with an overlap with syndromes such as
progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration.

Features of motor neuron disease may be present in some cases (e.g.,
muscle atrophy, weakness). A subset of individuals develop visual
hallucinations.

Prevalence Major or mild frontotemporal NCD is a common cause of
early-onset NCD in individuals younger than 65 years. Population
prevalence estimates are in the range of 2--10 per 100,0005, 10.
Approximately 20%--25% of cases of frontotemporal NCD occur in
individuals older than 65 years. Frontotemporal NCD accounts for about
5% of all cases of dementia in unselected autopsy series8. Prevalence
estimates of behavioral variant and semantic language variant are higher
among males, and prevalence estimates of nonfluent language variant are
higher among females.

Development and Course Individuals with major or mild frontotemporal NCD
commonly present in the sixth decade of life, although the age at onset
varies from the third to the ninth decades8. The disease is gradually
progressive, with median survival being 6--11 years after symptom onset
and 3--4 years after diagnosis. Survival is shorter and decline is
faster in major or mild frontotemporal NCD than in typical Alzheimer's
disease.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Approximately 40%
of individuals with major or mild frontotemporal NCD have a family
history of early-onset NCD, and approximately 10% show an autosomal
dominant inheritance pattern. A number of genetic factors have been
identified, such as mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule
associated protein tau (MAPT), the granulin gene (GRN), and the C9ORF72
gene. A number of families with causative mutations have been identified
(see the section "Diagnostic Markers" for this disorder), but many
individuals with known familial transmission do not have a known
mutation. The presence of motor neuron disease is associated with a more
rapid deterioration.

Diagnostic Markers Computed tomography (CT) or structural magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) may show distinct patterns of atrophy. In
behavioral-variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD, both frontal lobes
(especially the medial frontal lobes) and the anterior temporal lobes
are atrophic. In semantic language--variant major or mild frontotemporal
NCD, the middle, inferior, and anterior temporal lobes are atrophic
bilaterally but asymmetrically, with the left side usually being more
affected. Nonfluent language--variant major or mild frontotemporal NCD
is associated with predominantly left posterior frontal-insular atrophy.
The logopenic variant of major or mild frontotemporal NCD is associated
with predominantly left posterior

perisylvian or parietal atrophy2, 4. Functional imaging demonstrates
hypoperfusion and/or cortical hypometabolism in the corresponding brain
regions, which may be present in the early stages in the absence of
structural abnormality. Emerging biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease
(e.g., cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta and tau levels, and amyloid
imaging) may help in the differential diagnosis, but the distinction
from Alzheimer's disease can remain difficult (the logopenic variant is
in fact often a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease). In familial cases
of frontotemporal NCD, the identification of genetic mutations may help
confirm the diagnosis. Mutations associated with frontotemporal NCD
include the genes encoding microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and
granulin (GRN), C9ORF72, transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43
kDa (TDP-43, or TARDBP), valosin-containing protein (VCP), chromatin
modifying protein 2B (CHMP2B), and fused in sarcoma protein (FUS).

Functional Consequences of Major Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder

or

Mild

Because of the relative early age at onset of the disorder, the disorder
oftens affects workplace and family life. Because of the involvement of
language and/or behavior, function is often more severely impaired
relatively early in the course. For individuals with the behavioral
variant, prior to diagnostic clarification there may be significant
family disruption, legal involvement, and problems in the workplace
because of socially inappropriate behaviors. The functional impairment
due to behavioral change and language dysfunction, which can include
hyperorality, impulsive wandering, and other dishinhibited behaviors,
may far exceed that due to the cognitive disturbance and may lead to
nursing home placement or institutionalization. These behaviors can be
severely disruptive, even in structured care settings, particularly when
the individuals are otherwise healthy, nonfrail, and free of other
medical comorbidities.

Differential Diagnosis Other neurocognitive disorders. Other
neurodegenerative diseases may be distinguished from major or mild
frontotemporal NCD by their characteristic features. In major or mild
NCD due to Alzheimer's disease, decline in learning and memory is an
early feature. However, 10%--30% of patients presenting with a syndrome
suggestive of major or mild frontotemporal NCD are found at autopsy to
have Alzheimer's disease pathology. This occurs more frequently in
individuals who present with progressive dysexecutive syndromes in the
absence of behavioral changes or movement disorder or in those with the
logopenic variant3, 7. In major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies, core and
suggestive features of Lewy bodies must be present. In major or mild NCD
due to Parkinson's disease,

spontaneous parkinsonism emerges well before the cognitive decline. In
major or mild vascular NCD, depending on affected brain regions, there
may also be loss of executive ability and behavioral changes such as
apathy, and this disorder should be considered in the differential
diagnosis. However, history of a cerebrovascular event is temporally
related to the onset of cognitive impairment in major or mild vascular
NCD, and neuroimaging reveals infarctions or white matter lesions
sufficient to account for the clinical picture. Other neurological
conditions. Major or mild frontotemporal NCD overlaps with progressive
supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and motor neuron disease
clinically as well as pathologically. Progressive supranuclear palsy is
characterized by supranuclear gaze palsies and axial-predominant
parkinsonism. Pseudobulbar signs may be present, and retropulsion is
often prominent. Neurocognitive assessment shows psychomotor slowing,
poor working memory, and executive dysfunction. Corticobasal
degeneration presents with asymmetric rigidity, limb apraxia, postural
instability, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, and cortical sensory
loss. Many individuals with behavioral-variant major or mild
frontotemporal NCD show features of motor neuron disease, which tend to
be mixed upper and predominantly lower motor neuron disease. Other
mental disorders and medical conditions. Behavioral-variant major or
mild frontotemporal NCD may be mistaken for a primary mental disorder,
such as major depression, bipolar disorders, or schizophrenia, and
individuals with this variant often present initially to psychiatry.
Over time, the development of progressive neurocognitive difficulties
will help to make the distinction. A careful medical evaluation will
help to exclude treatable causes of NCDs, such as metabolic
disturbances, nutritional deficiencies, and infections.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder With Lewy Bodies Diagnostic
Criteria a. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive
disorder. b. The disorder has an insidious onset and gradual
progression. c. The disorder meets a combination of core diagnostic
features and suggestive diagnostic features for either probable or
possible neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies. For probable major or
mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, the individual has two
core features, or one suggestive feature with one or more core features.
For possible major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies, the
individual has only one core feature, or one or more suggestive
features. 1. Core diagnostic features: a. Fluctuating cognition with
pronounced variations in attention and alertness. b. Recurrent visual
hallucinations that are well formed and detailed. c. Spontaneous
features of parkinsonism, with onset subsequent to the development of
cognitive decline.

2. Suggestive diagnostic features: a. Meets criteria for rapid eye
movement sleep behavior disorder. b. Severe neuroleptic sensitivity.
d. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease,
another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or
another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Coding note: For
major neurocognitive disorder with probable Lewy bodies, with behavioral
disturbance, code first 331.82 (G31.83) Lewy body disease, followed by
294.11 (F02.81). For major neurocognitive disorder with probable Lewy
bodies, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.82 (G31.83) Lewy
body disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80). For major neurocognitive
disorder with possible Lewy bodies, with behavioral disturbance, code
first 331.82 (G31.83) Lewy body disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81).
For major neurocognitive disorder with possible Lewy bodies, without
behavioral disturbance, code first 331.82 (G31.83) Lewy body disease,
followed by 294.10 (F02.80). For mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy
bodies, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for
Lewy body disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should
still be indicated in writing.)

Diagnostic Features Major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy
bodies (NCDLB), in the case of major neurocognitive disorder (NCD),
corresponds to the condition known as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)4.
The disorder includes not only progressive cognitive impairment (with
early changes in complex attention and executive function rather than
learning and memory) but also recurrent complex visual hallucinations;
and concurrent symptoms of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior
disorder (which can be a very early manifestation); as well as
hallucinations in other sensory modalities, depression, and delusions.
The symptoms fluctuate in a pattern that can resemble a delirium, but no
adequate underlying cause can be found4, 5, 8. The variable presentation
of NCDLB symptoms reduces the likelihood of all symptoms being observed
in a brief clinic visit and necessitates a thorough assessment of
caregiver observations. The use of assessment scales specifically
designed to assess fluctuation may aid in diagnosis. Another core
feature is spontaneous parkinsonism, which must begin after the onset of
cognitive decline; by convention, major cognitive deficits are observed
at least 1 year before the motor symptoms. The parkinsonism must also be
distinguished from neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal signs. Accurate
diagnosis is essential to safe

treatment planning, as up to 50% of individuals with NCDLB have severe
sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs, and these medications should be used
with extreme caution in managing the psychotic manifestations3. The
diagnosis of mild NCDLB is appropriate for individuals who present with
the core or suggestive features at a stage when cognitive or functional
impairments are not of sufficient severity to fulfill criteria for major
NCD. However, as for all mild NCDs, there will often be insufficient
evidence to justify any single etiology, and use of the unspecified
diagnosis is most appropriate.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with NCDLB
frequently experience repeated falls and syncope and transient episodes
of unexplained loss of consciousness. Autonomic dysfunction, such as
orthostatic hypotension and urinary incontinence, may be observed.
Auditory and other nonvisual hallucinations are common, as are
systematized delusions, delusional misidentification, and depression8.

Prevalence The few population-based prevalence estimates for NCDLB
available range from 0.1% to 5% of the general elderly population, and
from 1.7% to 30.5% of all dementia cases10. In brain bank (autopsy)
series, the pathological lesions known as Lewy bodies are present in
20%--35% of cases of dementia1. The male-to-female ratio is
approximately 1.5:1.

Development and Course NCDLB is a gradually progressive disorder with
insidious onset. However, there is often a prodromal history of
confusional episodes (delirium) of acute onset, often precipitated by
illness or surgery. The distinction between NCDLB, in which Lewy bodies
are primarily cortical in location, and major or mild NCD due to
Parkinson's disease, in which the pathology is primarily in the basal
ganglia, is the order in which the cognitive and motor symptoms emerge2.
In NCDLB, the cognitive decline is manifested early in the course of
illness, at least a year before the onset of motor symptoms (see the
section "Differential Diagnosis" for this disorder). Disease course may
be characterized by occasional plateaus but eventually progresses
through severe dementia to death. Average duration of survival is 5--7
years in clinical series7. Onset of symptoms is typically observed from
the sixth through the ninth decades of life, with most cases having
their onset when affected individuals are in their mid-70s8.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Genetic and physiological. Familial aggregation may occur, and several
risk genes have been identified8, but in most cases of NCDLB, there is
no family history.

Diagnostic Markers The underlying neurodegenerative disease is primarily
a synucleinopathy due to alpha-synuclein misfolding and aggregation.
Cognitive testing beyond the use of a brief screening instrument may be
necessary to define deficits clearly. Assessment scales developed to
measure fluctuation can be useful. The associated condition REM sleep
behavior disorder may be diagnosed through a formal sleep study or
identified by questioning the patient or informant about relevant
symptoms. Neuroleptic sensitivity (challenge) is not recommended as a
diagnostic marker but raises suspicion of NCDLB if it occurs. A
diagnostically suggestive feature is low striatal dopamine transporter
uptake on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron
emission tomography (PET) scan. Other clinically useful markers
potentially include relative preservation of medial temporal structures
on computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan;
reduced striatal dopamine transporter uptake on SPECT/PET scan;
generalized low uptake on SPECT/PET perfusion scan with reduced
occipital activity; abnormal (low uptake) MIBG myocardial scintigraphy
suggesting sympathetic denervation; and prominent slow-wave activity on
the electroencephalogram with temporal lobe transient waves6, 8.

Functional Consequences of Major or Neurocognitive Disorder With Lewy
Bodies

Mild

Individuals with NCDLB are more functionally impaired than would be
expected for their cognitive deficits when contrasted to individuals
with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. This
is largely a result of motor and autonomic impairments, which cause
problems with toileting, transferring, and eating9. Sleep disorders and
prominent psychiatric symptoms may also add to functional difficulties.
Consequently, the quality of life of individuals with NCDLB is often
significantly worse than that of individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

Differential Diagnosis Major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to
Parkinson's disease. A key differentiating feature in clinical diagnosis
is the temporal sequence in which the parkinsonism and the NCD appear.
For NCD due to Parkinson's disease, the individual must develop
cognitive decline in the context of established Parkinson's disease; by
convention, the decline should not reach the stage of major NCD until at
least 1 year after Parkinson's is diagnosed. If less than a year has
passed since the

onset of motor symptoms, the diagnosis is NCDLB2, 7, 8. This distinction
is clearer at the major NCD level than at the mild NCD level. The timing
and sequence of parkinsonism and mild NCD may be more difficult to
determine because the onset and clinical presentation can be ambiguous,
and unspecified mild NCD should be diagnosed if the other core and
suggestive features are absent.

Comorbidity Lewy body pathology frequently coexists with Alzheimer's
disease and cerebrovascular disease pathology, particularly among the
oldest age groups. In Alzheimer's disease, there is concomitant
synuclein pathology in 60% of cases (if amygdala-restricted cases are
included)8. In general, there is a higher rate of Lewy body pathology in
individuals with dementia than in older individuals without dementia.

Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder Diagnostic Criteria a.
The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. b. The
clinical features are consistent with a vascular etiology, as suggested
by either of the following: 1. Onset of the cognitive deficits is
temporally related to one or more cerebrovascular events. 2. Evidence
for decline is prominent in complex attention (including processing
speed) and frontal-executive function. c. There is evidence of the
presence of cerebrovascular disease from history, physical examination,
and/or neuroimaging considered sufficient to account for the
neurocognitive deficits. d. The symptoms are not better explained by
another brain disease or systemic disorder. Probable vascular
neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if one of the following is present;
otherwise possible vascular neurocognitive disorder should be
diagnosed: 1. Clinical criteria are supported by neuroimaging evidence
of significant parenchymal injury attributed to cerebrovascular disease
(neuroimagingsupported). 2. The neurocognitive syndrome is temporally
related to one or more documented cerebrovascular events. 3. Both
clinical and genetic (e.g., cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy
with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) evidence of
cerebrovascular disease is present. Possible vascular neurocognitive
disorder is diagnosed if the clinical criteria are met but neuroimaging
is not available and the temporal relationship of the

neurocognitive syndrome with one or more cerebrovascular events is not
established. Coding note: For major neurocognitive disorder probably due
to vascular disease, with behavioral disturbance, code 290.40 (F01.51).
For major neurocognitive disorder probably due to vascular disease,
without behavioral disturbance, code 290.40 (F01.50). An additional
medical code for the vascular disease is not needed. For major
neurocognitive disorder possibly due to vascular disease, with
behavioral disturbance, code 290.40 (F01.51). For major neurocognitive
disorder possibly due to vascular disease, without behavioral
disturbance, code 290.40 (F01.50). An additional medical code for the
vascular disease is not needed. For mild vascular neurocognitive
disorder, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use an additional code for
the vascular disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should
still be indicated in writing.)

Diagnostic Features The diagnosis of major or mild vascular
neurocognitive disorder (NCD) requires the establishment of an NCD
(Criterion A) and the determination that cerebrovascular disease is the
dominant if not exclusive pathology that accounts for the cognitive
deficits (Criteria B and C). Vascular etiology may range from large
vessel stroke to microvascular disease; the presentation is therefore
very heterogeneous, stemming from the types of vascular lesions and
their extent and location6. The lesions may be focal, multifocal, or
diffuse and occur in various combinations2. Many individuals with major
or mild vascular NCD present with multiple infarctions, with an acute
stepwise or fluctuating decline in cognition, and intervening periods of
stability and even some improvement1. Others may have gradual onset with
slow progression, a rapid development of deficits followed by relative
stability, or another complex presentation. Major or mild vascular NCD
with a gradual onset and slow progression is generally due to small
vessel disease leading to lesions in the white matter, basal ganglia,
and/or thalamus. The gradual progression in these cases is often
punctuated by acute events that leave subtle neurological deficits. The
cognitive deficits in these cases can be attributed to disruption of
cortical-subcortical circuits, and complex attention, particularly speed
of information processing, and executive ability are likely to be
affected7. Assessing for the presence of sufficient cerebrovascular
disease relies on history, physical examination, and neuroimaging
(Criterion C). Etiological certainty requires the demonstration of
abnormalities on neuroimaging. The lack of neuroimaging can result in
significant diagnostic inaccuracy by overlooking "silent" brain
infarction and white matter lesions. However, if the neurocognitive
impairment is temporally

associated with one or more well-documented strokes, a probable
diagnosis can be made in the absence of neuroimaging. Clinical evidence
of cerebrovascular disease includes documented history of stroke, with
cognitive decline temporally associated with the event, or physical
signs consistent with stroke (e.g., hemiparesis; pseudobulbar syndrome,
visual field defect). Neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\]
or computed tomography \[CT\]) evidence of cerebrovascular disease
comprises one or more of the following: one or more large vessel
infarcts or hemorrhages, a strategically placed single infarct or
hemorrhage (e.g., in angular gyrus, thalamus, basal forebrain), two or
more lacunar infarcts outside the brain stem, or extensive and confluent
white matter lesions. The latter is often termed small vessel disease or
subcortical ischemic changes on clinical neuroimaging evaluations. For
mild vascular NCD, history of a single stroke or extensive white matter
disease is generally sufficient. For major vascular NCD, two or more
strokes, a strategically placed stroke, or a combination of white matter
disease and one or more lacunes is generally necessary. The disorder
must not be better explained by another disorder. For example, prominent
memory deficit early in the course might suggest Alzheimer's disease,
early and prominent parkinsonian features would suggest Parkinson's
disease, and a close association between onset and depression would
suggest depression.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis A neurological assessment often
reveals history of stroke and/or transient ischemic episodes, and signs
indicative of brain infarctions. Also commonly associated are
personality and mood changes, abulia, depression, and emotional
lability. The development of late-onset depressive symptoms accompanied
by psychomotor slowing and executive dysfunction is a common
presentation among older adults with progressive small vessel ischemic
disease ("vascular depression").

Prevalence Major or mild vascular NCD is the second most common cause of
NCD after Alzheimer's disease5. In the United States, population
prevalence estimates for vascular dementia range from 0.2% in the 65--70
years age group to 16% in individuals 80 years and older. Within 3
months following stroke, 20%--30% of individuals are diagnosed with
dementia. In neuropathology series, the prevalence of vascular dementia
increases from 13% at age 70 years to 44.6% at age 90 years or older, in
comparison with Alzheimer's disease (23.6%--51%) and combined vascular
dementia and Alzheimer's disease (2%--46.4%)3. Higher prevalence has
been reported in African Americans compared with Caucasians, and in East
Asian countries (e.g., Japan, China). Prevalence is higher in males than
in females4.

Development and Course Major or mild vascular NCD can occur at any age,
although the prevalence increases exponentially after age 65 years. In
older individuals, additional pathologies may partly account for the
neurocognitive deficits. The course may vary from acute onset with
partial improvement to stepwise decline to progressive decline, with
fluctuations and plateaus of varying durations. Pure subcortical major
or mild vascular NCD can have a slowly progressive course that simulates
major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. The neurocognitive outcomes
of vascular brain injury are influenced by neuroplasticity factors such
as education, physical exercise, and mental activity. Genetic and
physiological. The major risk factors for major or mild vascular NCD are
the same as those for cerebrovascular disease, including hypertension,
diabetes, smoking, obesity, high cholesterol levels, high homocysteine
levels, other risk factors for atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis,
atrial fibrillation, and other conditions increasing the risk of
cerebral emboli. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is an important risk factor
in which amyloid deposits occur within arterial vessels. Another key
risk factor is the hereditary condition cerebral autosomal dominant
arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, or
CADASIL.

Diagnostic Markers Structural neuroimaging, using MRI or CT, has an
important role in the diagnostic process. There are no other established
biomarkers of major or mild vascular NCD.

Functional Consequences of Major or Mild Vascular Neurocognitive
Disorder Major or mild vascular NCD is commonly associated with physical
deficits that cause additional disability.

Differential Diagnosis Other neurocognitive disorders. Since incidental
brain infarctions and white matter lesions are common in older
individuals, it is important to consider other possible etiologies when
an NCD is present. A history of memory deficit early in the course, and
progressive worsening of memory, language, executive function, and
perceptual-motor abilities in the absence of corresponding focal lesions
on brain imaging, are suggestive of Alzheimer's disease as the primary
diagnosis. Potential biomarkers currently being validated for
Alzheimer's disease, such as cerebrospinal

fluid levels of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau, and amyloid
imaging, may prove to be helpful in the differential diagnosis. NCD with
Lewy bodies is distinguished from major or mild vascular NCD by its core
features of fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, and
spontaneous parkinsonism. While deficits in executive function and
language occur in major or mild vascular NCD, the insidious onset and
gradual progression of behavioral features or language impairment are
characteristic of frontotemporal NCD and are not typical of vascular
etiology. Other medical conditions. A diagnosis of major or mild
vascular NCD is not made if other diseases (e.g., brain tumor, multiple
sclerosis, encephalitis, toxic or metabolic disorders) are present and
are of sufficient severity to account for the cognitive impairment.
Other mental disorders. A diagnosis of major or mild vascular NCD is
inappropriate if the symptoms can be entirely attributed to delirium,
although delirium may sometimes be superimposed on a preexisting major
or mild vascular NCD, in which case both diagnoses can be made. If the
criteria for major depressive disorder are met and the cognitive
impairment is temporally related to the likely onset of the depression,
major or mild vascular NCD should not be diagnosed. However, if the NCD
preceded the development of the depression, or the severity of the
cognitive impairment is out of proportion to the severity of the
depression, both should be diagnosed.

Comorbidity Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease commonly
co-occurs with major or mild vascular NCD, in which case both diagnoses
should be made. Major or mild vascular NCD and depression frequently
co-occur.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury
Diagnostic Criteria a. The criteria are met for major or mild
neurocognitive disorder. b. There is evidence of a traumatic brain
injury---that is, an impact to the head or other mechanisms of rapid
movement or displacement of the brain within the skull, with one or more
of the following: 1. Loss of consciousness. 2. Posttraumatic amnesia. 3.
Disorientation and confusion. 4. Neurological signs (e.g., neuroimaging
demonstrating injury; a new onset of seizures; a marked worsening of a
preexisting seizure disorder; visual field cuts; anosmia; hemiparesis).
c. The neurocognitive disorder presents immediately after the occurrence
of the traumatic brain injury or immediately after recovery of
consciousness and persists past the acute post-injury period. Coding
note: For major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury,
with behavioral disturbance: For ICD-9-CM, first code 907.0 late effect
of intracranial injury without skull fracture, followed by 294.11 major
neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, with behavioral
disturbance. For ICD-10-CM, first code S06.2X9S diffuse traumatic brain
injury with loss of consciousness of unspecified duration, sequela;
followed by F02.81 major neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain
injury, with behavioral disturbance. For major neurocognitive disorder
due to traumatic brain injury, without behavioral disturbance: For
ICD-9-CM, first code 907.0 late effect of intracranial injury without
skull fracture, followed by 294.10 major neurocognitive disorder due to
traumatic brain injury, without behavioral disturbance. For ICD-10-CM,

first code S06.2X9S diffuse traumatic brain injury with loss of
consciousness of unspecified duration, sequela; followed by F02.80 major
neurocognitive disorder due to traumatic brain injury, without
behavioral disturbance. For mild neurocognitive disorder due to
traumatic brain injury, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the
additional code for traumatic brain injury. Behavioral disturbance
cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Specifiers Rate the severity of the neurocognitive disorder (NCD), not
the underlying traumatic brain injury (see the section "Development and
Course" for this disorder).

Diagnostic Features Major or mild NCD due to traumatic brain injury
(TBI) is caused by an impact to the head, or other mechanisms of rapid
movement or displacement of the brain within the skull, as can happen
with blast injuries7. Traumatic brain injury is defined as brain trauma
with specific characteristics that include at least one of the
following: loss of consciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, disorientation
and confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological signs (e.g.,
positive neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked worsening of
a preexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia, hemiparesis)
(Criterion B). To be attributable to TBI, the NCD must present either
immediately after the brain injury occurs or immediately after the
individual recovers consciousness after the injury and persist past the
acute post-injury period (Criterion C). The cognitive presentation is
variable. Difficulties in the domains of complex attention, executive
ability, learning, and memory are common as well as slowing in speed of
information processing and disturbances in social cognition. In more
severe TBI in which there is brain contusion, intracranial hemorrhage,
or penetrating injury, there may be additional neurocognitive deficits,
such as aphasia, neglect, and constructional dyspraxia.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Major or mild NCD due to TBI
may be accompanied by disturbances in emotional function (e.g.,
irritability, easy frustration, tension and anxiety, affective
lability); personality changes (e.g., disinhibition, apathy,
suspiciousness, aggression); physical disturbances (e.g., headache,
fatigue, sleep disorders, vertigo or dizziness, tinnitus or hyperacusis,
photosensitivity, anosmia, reduced tolerance to psychotropic
medications); and, particularly in more severe TBI, neurological
symptoms and signs (e.g., seizures, hemiparesis, visual disturbances,
cranial nerve deficits) and evidence of orthopedic injuries.

Prevalence In the United States, 1.7 million TBIs occur annually,
resulting in 1.4 million emergency department visits, 275,000
hospitalizations, and 52,000 deaths. About 2% of the population lives
with TBI-associated disability. Males account for 59% of TBIs in the
United States. The most common etiologies of TBI in the United States
are falls, vehicular accidents, and being struck on the head. Collisions
and blows to the head that occur in the course of contact sports are
increasingly recognized as sources of mild TBI, with a concern that
repeated mild TBI may have cumulatively persisting sequelae4.

Development and Course The severity of a TBI is rated at the time of
injury/initial assessment as mild, moderate, or severe according to the
thresholds in Table 2. TABLE 2 Severity ratings for traumatic brain
injury Injury characteristic

Mild TBI

Loss of consciousness

\<30 min

Moderate Severe TBI TBI

30 \>24 minutes-- hours 24 hours Posttraumatic amnesia \<24 hours 24
hours--7 \>7 days days Disorientation and confusion at initial 13--15
(not below 9--12 3--8 assessment (Glasgow Coma Scale Score) 13 at 30
minutes) The severity rating of the TBI itself does not necessarily
correspond to the severity of the resulting NCD. The course of recovery
from TBI is variable, depending not only on the specifics of the injury
but also on cofactors, such as age, prior history of brain damage, or
substance abuse, that may favor or impede recovery. Neurobehavioral
symptoms tend to be most severe in the immediate aftermath of the TBI.
Except in the case of severe TBI, the typical course is that of complete
or substantial improvement in associated neurocognitive, neurological,
and psychiatric symptoms and signs. Neurocognitive symptoms associated
with mild TBI tend to resolve within days to weeks after the injury with
complete resolution typical by 3 months2, 6. Other symptoms that may
potentially co-occur with the neurological symptoms (e.g., depression,
irritability, fatigue, headache, photosensitivity, sleep

disturbance) also tend to resolve in the weeks following mild TBI.
Substantial subsequent deterioration in these areas should trigger
consideration of additional diagnoses5, 8. However, repeated mild TBI
may be associated with persisting neurocognitive disturbance4. With
moderate and severe TBI, in addition to persistence of neurocognitive
deficits, there may be associated neurophysiological, emotional, and
behavioral complications2. These include seizures (particularly in the
first year), photosensitivity, hyperacusis, irritability, aggression,
depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue, apathy, inability to resume
occupational and social functioning at pre-injury level, and
deterioration in interpersonal relationships. Moderate and severe TBI
have been associated with increased risk of depression, aggression, and
possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The
features of persisting major or mild NCD due to TBI will vary by age,
specifics of the injury, and cofactors. Persisting TBI-related
impairment in an infant or child may be reflected in delays in reaching
developmental milestones (e.g., language acquisition), worse academic
performance, and possibly impaired social development. Among older
teenagers and adults, persisting symptoms may include various
neurocognitive deficits, irritability, hypersensitivity to light and
sound, easy fatigability, and mood changes, including depression,
anxiety, hostility, or apathy. In older individuals with depleted
cognitive reserve, mild TBI is more likely to result in incomplete
recoveries.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Risk factors for traumatic brain injury.
Traumatic brain injury rates vary by age, with the highest prevalence
among individuals younger than 4 years, older adolescents, and
individuals older than 65 years. Falls are the most common cause of TBI,
with motor vehicle accidents being second. Sports concussions are
frequent causes of TBI in older children, teenagers, and young adults.
Risk factors for neurocognitive disorder after traumatic brain injury.
Repeated concussions can lead to persistent NCD and neuropathological
evidence of traumatic encephalopathy1. Co-occurring intoxication with a
substance may increase the severity of a TBI from a motor vehicle
accident, but whether intoxication at the time of injury worsens
neurocognitive outcome is unknown. Course modifiers. Mild TBI generally
resolves within a few weeks to months6, although resolution may be
delayed or incomplete in the context of repeated TBI. Worse outcome from
moderate to severe TBI is associated with older age (older than 40
years) and initial clinical parameters, such as low Glasgow Coma Scale
score; worse motor function; pupillary nonreactivity; and computed
tomography

(CT) evidence of brain injury (e.g., petechial hemorrhages, subarachnoid
hemorrhage, midline shift, obliteration of third ventricle).

Diagnostic Markers Beyond neuropsychological testing, CT scanning may
reveal petechial hemorrhages, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or evidence of
contusion. Magnetic resonance image scanning may also reveal
hyperintensities suggestive of microhemorrhages.

Functional Consequences of Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to
Traumatic Brain Injury With mild NCD due to TBI, individuals may report
reduced cognitive efficiency, difficulty concentrating, and lessened
ability to perform usual activities. With major NCD due to TBI, an
individual may have difficulty in independent living and selfcare.
Prominent neuromotor features, such as severe incoordination, ataxia,
and motor slowing, may be present in major NCD due to TBI and may add to
functional difficulties. Individuals with TBI histories report more
depressive symptoms, and these can amplify cognitive complaints and
worsen functional outcome3. Additionally, loss of emotional control,
including aggressive or inappropriate affect and apathy, may be present
after more severe TBI with greater neurocognitive impairment. These
features may compound difficulties with independent living and
self-care.

Differential Diagnosis In some instances, severity of neurocognitive
symptoms may appear to be inconsistent with the severity of the TBI.
After previously undetected neurological complications (e.g., chronic
hematoma) are excluded, the possibility of diagnoses such as somatic
symptom disorder or factitious disorder need to be considered.
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can co-occur with the NCD and have
overlapping symptoms (e.g., difficulty concentrating, depressed mood,
aggressive behavioral disinhibition).

Comorbidity Among individuals with substance use disorders, the
neurocognitive effects of the substance contribute to or compound the
TBI-associated neurocognitive change. Some symptoms associated with TBI
may overlap with symptoms found in cases of PTSD, and the two disorders
may co-occur, especially in military populations.

Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder
Diagnostic Criteria a. The criteria are met for major or mild
neurocognitive disorder. b. The neurocognitive impairments do not occur
exclusively during the course of a delirium and persist beyond the usual
duration of intoxication and acute withdrawal. c. The involved substance
or medication and duration and extent of use are capable of producing
the neurocognitive impairment.

d. The temporal course of the neurocognitive deficits is consistent with
the timing of substance or medication use and abstinence (e.g., the
deficits remain stable or improve after a period of abstinence). e. The
neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition
or is not better explained by another mental disorder. Coding note: The
ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the \[specific
substance/medication\]-induced neurocognitive disorders are indicated in
the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not
there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of
substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the
substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position character is
"1," and the clinician should record "mild \[substance\] use disorder"
before the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder (e.g., "mild
inhalant use disorder with inhalant-induced major neurocognitive
disorder"). If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid
with the substance-induced neurocognitive disorder, the 4th position
character is "2," and the clinician should record "moderate
\[substance\] use disorder" or "severe \[substance\] use disorder,"
depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder. If
there is no comorbid substance use disorder, then the 4th position
character is "9," and the clinician should record only the
substance-induced neurocognitive disorder. For some classes of
substances (i.e., alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics), it is not
permissible to code a comorbid mild substance use disorder with a
substance-induced neurocognitive disorder; only a comorbid moderate or
severe substance use disorder, or no substance use disorder, can be
diagnosed. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be
indicated in writing. ICD-10-CM ICD-9- With use CM disorder, mild

Recording Procedures ICD-9-CM. The name of the
substance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder begins with the
specific substance/medication (e.g., alcohol) that is presumed to be
causing the neurocognitive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected
from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug
class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code
for "other substance" should be used; and in cases in which a substance
is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of
substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance" should be used.
The name of the disorder (i.e., \[specific substance\]-induced major
neurocognitive disorder or \[specific substance\]-induced mild
neurocognitive disorder) is followed by the type in the case of alcohol
(i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type, amnesticconfabulatory type),
followed by specification of duration (i.e., persistent). Unlike the
recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the
substance/medicationinduced disorder and substance use disorder into a
single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the
substance use disorder. For example, in the case of persistent
amnestic-confabulatory symptoms in a man with a severe alcohol use
disorder, the diagnosis is 291.1 alcohol-induced major neurocognitive
disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent. An additional
diagnosis of 303.90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given. If the
substance/medication-induced neurocognitive disorder occurs without a
comorbid substance use disorder (e.g.,

after a sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use
disorder is noted (e.g., 292.82 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive
disorder). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced
neurocognitive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g.,
alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the neurocognitive symptoms. The
diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set,
which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid
substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the
classes, the code for "other substance" should be used; and in cases in
which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific
class of substance is unknown, the category "unknown substance" should
be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance
use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word "with,"
followed by the name of the disorder (i.e., \[specific
substance\]-induced major neurocognitive disorder or \[specific
substance\]-induced mild neurocognitive disorder), followed by the type
in the case of alcohol (i.e., nonamnestic-confabulatory type,
amnestic-confabulatory type), followed by specification of duration
(i.e., persistent). For example, in the case of persistent
amnestic-confabulatory symptoms in a man with a severe alcohol use
disorder, the diagnosis is F10.26 severe alcohol use disorder with
alcoholinduced major neurocognitive disorder, amnestic-confabulatory
type, persistent. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol
use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced neurocognitive
disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a
sporadic heavy use of inhalants), no accompanying substance use disorder
is noted (e.g., F18.988 inhalant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder).

Diagnostic Features Substance/medication-induced major or mild NCD is
characterized by neurocognitive impairments that persist beyond the
usual duration of intoxication and acute withdrawal (Criterion B).
Initially, these manifestations can reflect slow recovery of brain
functions from a period of prolonged substance use, and improvements in
neurocognitive as well as brain imaging indicators may be seen over many
months5, 7, 9. If the disorder continues for an extended period,
persistent should be specified. The given substance and its use must be
known to be capable of causing the observed impairments (Criterion C).
While nonspecific decrements in a range of cognitive abilities can occur
with nearly any substance of abuse and a variety of medications, some
patterns occur more frequently with selected drug classes. For example,
NCD due to sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic drugs (e.g.,
benzodiazepines, barbiturates) may show greater disturbances in memory
than in other cognitive functions. NCD induced by alcohol frequently
manifests with a combination of impairments in executive-function and
memory and learning domains. The temporal course of the
substance-induced NCD must be consistent

with that of use of the given substance (Criterion D). In
alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory (Korsakoff's) NCD, the features
include prominent amnesia (severe difficulty learning new information
with rapid forgetting) and a tendency to confabulate. These
manifestations may co-occur with signs of thiamine encephalopathy
(Wernicke's encephalopathy) with associated features such as nystagmus
and ataxia. Ophthalmoplegia of Wernicke's encephalopathy is typically
characterized by a lateral gaze paralysis. In addition to or independent
of the more common neurocognitive symptoms related to methamphetamine
use (e.g., difficulties with learning and memory; executive function),
methamphetamine use can also be associated with evidence of vascular
injury (e.g., focal weakness, unilateral incoordination, asymmetrical
reflexes). The most common neurocognitive profile approximates that seen
in vascular NCD.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Intermediate-duration NCD
induced by drugs with central nervous system depressant effects may
manifest with added symptoms of increased irritability, anxiety, sleep
disturbance, and dysphoria. Intermediate-duration NCD induced by
stimulant drugs may manifest with rebound depression, hypersomnia, and
apathy. In severe forms of substance/medication-induced major NCD (e.g.,
associated with long-term alcohol use), there may be prominent
neuromotor features, such as incoordination, ataxia, and motor slowing.
There may also be loss of emotional control, including aggressive or
inappropriate affect, or apathy.

Prevalence The prevalence of these conditions is not known. Prevalence
figures for substance abuse are available, and
substance/medication-induced major or mild NCDs are more likely in those
who are older, have longer use, and have other risk factors such as
nutritional deficits11. For alcohol abuse, the rate of mild NCD of
intermediate duration is approximately 30%--40% in the first 2 months of
abstinence9. Mild NCD may persist, particularly in those who do not
achieve stable abstinence until after age 50 years. Major NCD is rare
and may result from concomitant nutritional deficits, as in
alcohol-induced amnestic confabulatory NCD. For individuals quitting
cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids, phencyclidine, and sedative,
hypnotics, or anxiolytics4, substance/medication-induced mild NCD of
intermediate duration may occur in one-third or more, and there is some
evidence that these substances may also be associated with persistent
mild NCD2. Major NCD associated with these substances is rare, if it
occurs at all. In the case of methamphetamine, cerebrovascular disease
can also occur, resulting in diffuse or

focal brain injury that can be of mild or major neurocognitive levels.
Solvent exposure has been linked to both major and mild NCD of both
intermediate and persistent duration3. The presence of NCD induced by
cannabis and various hallucinogens is controversial. With cannabis,
intoxication is accompanied by various neurocognitive disturbances, but
these tend to clear with abstinence6, 8.

Development and Course Substance use disorders tend to commence during
adolescence and peak in the 20s and 30s. Although longer history of
severe substance use disorder is associated with greater likelihood of
NCD, the relationships are not straightforward, with substantial and
even complete recovery of neurocognitive functions being common among
individuals who achieve stable abstinence prior to age 50 years.
Substance/medication-induced major or mild NCD is most likely to become
persistent in individuals who continue abuse of substances past age 50
years, presumably because of a combination of lessened neural plasticity
and beginnings of other age-related brain changes. Earlier commencement
of abuse, particularly of alcohol, may lead to defects in later neural
development (e.g., later stages of maturation of frontal circuitries),
which may have effects on social cognition as well as other
neurocognitive abilities. For alcohol-induced NCD, there may be an
additive effect of aging and alcohol-induced brain injury.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Risk factors for
substance/medication-induced NCDs include older age, longer use, and
persistent use past age 50 years. In addition, for alcohol-induced NCD,
longterm nutritional deficiencies, liver disease, vascular risk factors,
and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease may contribute to risk.

Diagnostic Markers Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of individuals with
chronic alcohol abuse frequently reveals cortical thinning, white matter
loss, and enlargement of sulci and ventricles. While neuroimaging
abnormalities are more common in those with NCDs, it is possible to
observe NCDs without neuroimaging abnormalities, and vice versa.
Specialized techniques (e.g., diffusion tensor imaging) may reveal
damage to specific white matter tracts. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy
may reveal reduction in N-acetylaspartate, and increase in markers of
inflammation (e.g., myoinositol) or white matter injury (e.g., choline).
Many of these brain imaging changes and neurocognitive manifestations
reverse following successful abstinence. In individuals with
methamphetamine use disorder, MRI may also reveal hyperintensities
suggestive of microhemorrhages or larger areas of infarction.

Functional Consequences of Substance/MedicationInduced Major or Mild
Neurocognitive Disorder The functional consequences of
substance/medication-induced mild NCD are sometimes augmented by reduced
cognitive efficiency and difficulty concentrating beyond that seen in
many other NCDs. In addition, at both major and mild levels,
substance/medication-induced NCDs may have associated motor syndromes
that increase the level of functional impairment.

Differential Diagnosis Individuals with substance use disorders,
substance intoxication, and substance withdrawal are at increased risk
for other conditions that may independently, or through a compounding
effect, result in neurocognitive disturbance. These include history of
traumatic brain injury and infections that can accompany substance use
disorder (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Therefore, presence
of substance/medication-induced major or mild NCD should be
differentiated from NCDs arising outside the context of substance use,
intoxication, and withdrawal, including these accompanying conditions
(e.g., traumatic brain injury).

Comorbidity Substance use disorders, substance intoxication, and
substance withdrawal are highly comorbid with other mental disorders1.
Comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder, psychotic disorders, depressive
and bipolar disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders can contribute
to neurocognitive impairment in substance users. Traumatic brain injury
occurs more frequently with substance use, complicating efforts to
determine the etiology of NCD in such cases2, 12. Severe, long-term
alcohol use disorder can be associated with major organ system disease,
including cerebrovascular disease and cirrhosis. Amphetamine-induced NCD
may be accompanied by major or mild vascular NCD, also secondary to
amphetamine use.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV Infection Diagnostic
Criteria a. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive
disorder. b. There is documented infection with human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV).

c. The neurocognitive disorder is not better explained by non-HIV
conditions, including secondary brain diseases such as progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy or cryptococcal meningitis. d. The
neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another medical condition
and is not better explained by a mental disorder. Coding note: For major
neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, with behavioral
disturbance, code first 042 (B20) HIV infection, followed by 294.11
(F02.81) major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, with
behavioral disturbance. For major neurocognitive disorder due to HIV
infection, without behavioral disturbance, code first 042 (B20) HIV
infection, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) major neurocognitive disorder due
to HIV infection, without behavioral disturbance. For mild
neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection, code 331.83 (G31.84).
(Note: Do not use the additional code for HIV infection. Behavioral
disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Diagnostic Features HIV disease is caused by infection with human
immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), which is acquired through
exposure to bodily fluids of an infected person through injection drug
use, unprotected sexual contact, or accidental or iatrogenic exposure
(e.g., contaminated blood supply, needle puncture injury to medical
personnel). HIV infects several types of cells, most particularly immune
cells. Over time, the infection can cause severe depletion of "T-helper"
(CD4) lymphocytes, resulting in severe immunocompromise, often leading
to opportunistic infections and neoplasms. This advanced form of HIV
infection is termed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Diagnosis of HIV is confirmed by established laboratory methods such as
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV antibody with Western blot
confirmation and/or polymerase chain reaction--based assays for HIV.
Some individuals with HIV infection develop an NCD, which generally
shows a "subcortical pattern" with prominently impaired executive
function, slowing of processing speed, problems with more demanding
attentional tasks, and difficulty in learning new information, but fewer
problems with recall of learned information. In major NCD, slowing may
be prominent. Language difficulties, such as aphasia, are uncommon,
although reductions in fluency may be observed. HIV pathogenic processes
can affect any part of the brain; therefore, other patterns are
possible1, 4.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

Major or mild NCD due to HIV infection is usually more prevalent in
individuals with prior episodes of severe immunosuppression, high viral
loads in the cerebrospinal fluid, and indicators of advanced HIV disease
such as anemia and hypoalbuminemia. Individuals with advanced NCD may
experience prominent neuromotor features such as severe incoordination,
ataxia, and motor slowing. There may be loss of emotional control,
including aggressive or inappropriate affect or apathy.

Prevalence Depending on stage of HIV disease, approximately one-third to
over one-half of HIV-infected individuals have at least mild
neurocognitive disturbance, but some of these disturbances may not meet
the full criteria for mild NCD. An estimated 25% of individuals with HIV
will have signs and symptoms that meet criteria for mild NCD, and in
fewer than 5% would criteria for major NCD be met2.

Development and Course An NCD due to HIV infection can resolve, improve,
slowly worsen, or have a fluctuating course. Rapid progression to
profound neurocognitive impairment is uncommon in the context of
currently available combination antiviral treatment; consequently, an
abrupt change in mental status in an individual with HIV may prompt an
evaluation of other medical sources for the cognitive change, including
secondary infections. Because HIV infection preferentially affects
subcortical regions over the course of illness, including deep white
matter, the progression of the disorder follows a "subcortical" pattern.
Since HIV can affect a variety of brain regions, and the illness can
take on many different trajectories depending on associated
comorbidities and consequences of HIV, the overall course of an NCD due
to HIV infection has considerable heterogeneity. A subcortical
neurocognitive profile may interact with age over the life course, when
psychomotor slowing and motor impairments such as slowed gait may occur
as a consequence of other agerelated conditions so that the overall
progression may appear more pronounced in later life. In developed
countries, HIV disease is primarily a condition of adults, with
acquisition via risky behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex, injection drug
use) beginning in late adolescence and peaking during young and middle
adulthood. In developing countries, particularly sub-Saharan Africa,
where HIV testing and antiretroviral treatments for pregnant women are
not readily available, perinatal transmission is common. The NCD in such
infants and children may present primarily as neurodevelopmental delay.
As individuals treated for HIV survive into older age, additive and
interactive neurocognitive effects of HIV and aging, including other
NCDs (e.g., due to Alzheimer's disease, due to Parkinson's disease), are
possible.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Risk and prognostic factors for HIV
infection. Risk factors for HIV infection include injection drug use,
unprotected sex, and unprotected blood supply and other iatrogenic
factors. Risk and prognostic factors for major or mild neurocognitive
disorder due to HIV infection. Paradoxically, NCD due to HIV infection
has not declined significantly with the advent of combined
antiretroviral therapy, although the most severe presentations
(consistent with the diagnosis of major NCD) have decreased sharply2.
Contributory factors may include inadequate control of HIV in the
central nervous system (CNS), the evolution of drug-resistant viral
strains, the effects of chronic long-term systemic and brain
inflammation, and the effects of comorbid factors such as aging, drug
abuse, past history of CNS trauma, and co-infections, such as with the
hepatitis C virus. Chronic exposure to antiretroviral drugs also raises
the possibility of neurotoxicity, although this has not been
definitively established3.

Diagnostic Markers Serum HIV testing is required for the diagnosis. In
addition, HIV characterization of the cerebrospinal fluid may be helpful
if it reveals a disproportionately high viral load in cerebrospinal
fluid versus in the plasma. Neuroimaging (i.e., magnetic resonance
imaging \[MRI\]) may reveal reduction in total brain volume, cortical
thinning, reduction in white matter volume, and patchy areas of abnormal
white matter (hyperintensities). MRI or lumbar puncture may be helpful
to exclude a specific medical condition such as cryptococcus infection
or herpes encephalitis that may contribute to CNS changes in the context
of AIDS. Specialized techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging may
reveal damage to specific white matter tracts.

Functional Consequences of Major or Neurocognitive Disorder Due to HIV
Infection

Mild

Functional consequences of major or mild NCD due to HIV infection are
variable across individuals. Thus, impaired executive abilities and
slowed information processing may substantially interfere with the
complex disease management decisions required for adherence to the
combined antiretroviral therapy regimen. The likelihood of comorbid
disease may further create functional challenges.

Differential Diagnosis In the presence of comorbidities, such as other
infections (e.g., hepatitis C virus, syphilis), drug abuse (e.g.,
methamphetamine abuse), or prior head injury or neurodevelopmental
conditions, major or mild NCD due to HIV infection can be

diagnosed provided there is evidence that infection with HIV has
worsened any NCDs due to such preexisting or comorbid conditions. Among
older adults, onset of neurocognitive decline related to cerebrovascular
disease or neurodegeneration (e.g., major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's
disease) may need to be differentiated. In general, stable, fluctuating
(without progression) or improving neurocognitive status would favor an
HIV etiology, whereas steady or stepwise deterioration would suggest
neurodegenerative or vascular etiology. Because more severe
immunodeficiency can result in opportunistic infections of the brain
(e.g., toxoplasmosis; cryptococcosis) and neoplasia (e.g., CNS
lymphoma), sudden onset of an NCD or sudden worsening of that disorder
demands active investigation of non-HIV etiologies.

Comorbidity HIV disease is accompanied by chronic systemic and
neuro-inflammation that can be associated with cerebrovascular disease
and metabolic syndrome. These complications can be part of the
pathogenesis of major or mild NCD due to HIV infection. HIV frequently
co-occurs with conditions such as substance use disorders when the
substance has been injected and other sexually transmitted disorders.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Prion Disease Diagnostic
Criteria a. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive
disorder. b. There is insidious onset, and rapid progression of
impairment is common.

c. There are motor features of prion disease, such as myoclonus or
ataxia, or biomarker evidence. d. The neurocognitive disorder is not
attributable to another medical condition and is not better explained by
another mental disorder. Coding note: For major neurocognitive disorder
due to prion disease, with behavioral disturbance, code first 046.79
(A81.9) prion disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) major neurocognitive
disorder due to prion disease, with behavioral disturbance. For major
neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease, without behavioral
disturbance, code first 046.79 (A81.9) prion disease, followed by 294.10
(F02.80) major neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease, without
behavioral disturbance. For mild neurocognitive disorder due to prion
disease, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for
prion disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still
be indicated in writing.)

Diagnostic Features The classification of major or mild neurocognitive
disorder (NCD) due to prion disease includes NCDs due to a group of
subacute spongiform encephalopathies (including Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, kuru,
Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, and fatal insomnia) caused by
transmissible agents known as prions. The most common type is sporadic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, typically referred to as Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD). Variant CJD is much rarer and is associated with
transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also called "mad cow
disease." 4 Typically, individuals with CJD present with neurocognitive
deficits, ataxia, and abnormal movements such as myoclonus, chorea, or
dystonia; a startle reflex is also common. Typically, the history
reveals rapid progression to major NCD over as little as 6 months, and
thus the disorder is typically seen only at the major level. However,
many individuals with the disorder may have atypical presentations, and
the disease can be confirmed only by biopsy or at autopsy. Individuals
with variant CJD may present with a greater preponderance of psychiatric
symptoms, characterized a by low mood, withdrawal, and anxiety3. Prion
disease is typically not diagnosed without at least one of the
characteristic biomarker features: recognized lesions on magnetic
resonance imaging with DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) or FLAIR
(fluidattenuated inversion recovery), tau or 14-3-3 protein in
cerebrospinal fluid, characteristic triphasic waves on
electroencephalogram, or, for rare familial forms, family history or
genetic testing.

Prevalence

The annual incidence of sporadic CJD is approximately one or two cases
per million people5. Prevalence is unknown but very low given the short
survival.

Development and Course Prion disease may develop at any age in
adults---the peak age for the sporadic CJD is approximately 67
years---although it has been reported to occur in individuals spanning
the teenage years to late life. Prodromal symptoms of prion disease may
include fatigue, anxiety, problems with appetite or sleeping, or
difficulties with concentration. After several weeks, these symptoms may
be followed by incoordination, altered vision, or abnormal gait or other
movements that may be myoclonic, choreoathetoid, or ballistic, along
with a rapidly progressive dementia. The disease typically progresses
very rapidly to the major level of impairment over several months. More
rarely, it can progress over 2 years and appear similar in its course to
other NCDs.

Risk Factors and Prognosis Environmental. Cross-species transmission of
prion infections, with agents that are closely related to the human
form, has been demonstrated (e.g., the outbreak of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy inducing variant CJD in the United Kingdom during the
mid-1990s). Transmission by corneal transplantation and by human growth
factor injection has been documented, and anecdotal cases of
transmission to health care workers have been reported. Genetic and
physiological. There is a genetic component in up to 15% of cases,
associated with an autosomal dominant mutation1.

Diagnostic Markers Prion disease can be definitively confirmed only by
biopsy or at autopsy. Although there are no distinctive findings on
cerebrospinal fluid analysis across the prion diseases, reliable
biomarkers are being developed and include 14-3-3 protein (particularly
for sporadic CJD) as well as tau protein2. Magnetic resonance brain
imaging is currently considered the most sensitive diagnostic test when
DWI is performed, with the most common finding being multifocal gray
matter hyperintensities in subcortical and cortical regions6. In some
individuals, the electroencephalogram reveals periodic sharp, often
triphasic and synchronous discharges at a rate of 0.5--2 Hz at some
point during the course of the disorder.

Differential Diagnosis Other major neurocognitive disorders. Major NCD
due to prion disease may appear similar in its course to other NCDs, but
prion diseases are typically

distinguished by their rapid progression and prominent cerebellar and
motor symptoms.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Parkinson's Disease
Diagnostic Criteria a. The criteria are met for major or mild
neurocognitive disorder. b. The disturbance occurs in the setting of
established Parkinson's disease. c. There is insidious onset and gradual
progression of impairment. d. The neurocognitive disorder is not
attributable to another medical condition and is not better explained by
another mental disorder. Major or mild neurocognitive disorder probably
due to Parkinson's disease should be diagnosed if 1 and 2 are both met.
Major or mild neurocognitive disorder possibly due to Parkinson's
disease should be diagnosed if 1 or 2 is met: 1. There is no evidence of
mixed etiology (i.e., absence of other neurodegenerative or
cerebrovascular disease or another neurological, mental,

or systemic disease or condition likely contributing to cognitive
decline). 2. The Parkinson's disease clearly precedes the onset of the
neurocognitive disorder. Coding note: For major neurocognitive disorder
probably due to Parkinson's disease, with behavioral disturbance, code
first 332.0 (G20) Parkinson's disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81). For
major neurocognitive disorder probably due to Parkinson's disease,
without behavioral disturbance, code first 332.0 (G20) Parkinson's
disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80). For major neurocognitive disorder
possibly due to Parkinson's disease, with behavioral disturbance, code
first 332.0 (G20) Parkinson's disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81). For
major neurocognitive disorder possibly due to Parkinson's disease,
without behavioral disturbance, code first 332.0 (G20) Parkinson's
disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80). For mild neurocognitive disorder
due to Parkinson's disease, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the
additional code for Parkinson's disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot
be coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of major or mild
neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Parkinson's disease is cognitive
decline following the onset of Parkinson's disease4, 5, 6. The
disturbance must occur in the setting of established Parkinson's disease
(Criterion B), and deficits must have developed gradually (Criterion C).
The NCD is viewed as probably due to Parkinson's disease when there is
no evidence of another disorder that might be contributing to the
cognitive decline and when the Parkinson's disease clearly precedes
onset of the NCD. The NCD is considered possibly due to Parkinson's
disease either when there is no evidence of another disorder that might
be contributing to the cognitive decline or when the Parkinson's disease
precedes onset of the NCD, but not both.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Frequently present features
include apathy, depressed mood, anxious mood, hallucinations, delusions,
personality changes, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and
excessive daytime sleepiness.

Prevalence The prevalence of Parkinson's disease in the United States
steadily increases with age from approximately 0.5% between ages 65 and
69 to 3% at age 85 years and older. Parkinson's disease is more common
in males than in females3, 7. Among

individuals with Parkinson's disease, as many as 75% will develop a
major NCD sometime in the course of their disease1, 2. The prevalence of
mild NCD in Parkinson's disease has been estimated at 27%6.

Development and Course Onset of Parkinson's disease is typically between
the sixth and ninth decades of life, with most expression in the early
60s. Mild NCD often develops relatively early in the course of
Parkinson's disease, whereas major impairment typically does not occur
until late.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Risk factors for Parkinson's
disease include exposure to herbicides and pesticides. Genetic and
physiological. Potential risk factors for NCD among individuals with
Parkinson's disease include older age at disease onset and increasing
duration of disease.

Diagnostic Markers Neuropsychological testing, with a focus on tests
that do not rely on motor function, is critical in detecting the core
cognitive deficits, particularly at the mild NCD phase. Structural
neuroimaging and dopamine transporter scans, such as DaT scans, may
differentiate Lewy body--related dementias (Parkinson's and dementia
with Lewy bodies) from non--Lewy body--related dementias (e.g.,
Alzheimer's disease) and can sometimes be helpful in the evaluation of
major or mild NCD due to Parkinson's disease.

Differential Diagnosis Major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy
bodies. This distinction is based substantially on the timing and
sequence of motor and cognitive symptoms. For NCD to be attributed to
Parkinson's disease, the motor and other symptoms of Parkinson's disease
must be present well before (by convention, at least 1 year prior)
cognitive decline has reached the level of major NCD, whereas in major
or mild NCD with Lewy bodies, cognitive symptoms begin shortly before,
or concurrent with, motor symptoms. For mild NCD, the timing is harder
to establish because the diagnosis itself is less clear and the two
disorders exist on a continuum. Unless Parkinson's disease has been
established for some time prior to the onset of cognitive decline, or
typical features of major or mild NCD with Lewy bodies are present, it
is preferable to diagnose unspecified mild NCD.

Major or mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease. The
motor features are the key to distinguishing major or mild NCD due to
Parkinson's disease from major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer's disease.
However, the two disorders can co-occur. Major or mild vascular
neurocognitive disorder. Major or mild vascular NCD may present with
parkinsonian features such as psychomotor slowing that may occur as a
consequence of subcortical small vessel disease. However, the
parkinsonian features typically are not sufficient for a diagnosis of
Parkinson's disease, and the course of the NCD usually has a clear
association with cerebrovascular changes. Neurocognitive disorder due to
another medical condition (e.g., neurodegenerative disorders). When a
diagnosis of major or mild NCD due to Parkinson's disease is being
considered, the distinction must also be made from other brain
disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal
degeneration, multiple system atrophy, tumors, and hydrocephalus.
Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism can
occur in individuals with other NCDs, particularly when
dopamine-blocking drugs are prescribed for the behavioral manifestations
of such disorders Other medical conditions. Delirium and NCDs due to
side effects of dopamineblocking drugs and other medical conditions
(e.g., sedation or impaired cognition, severe hypothyroidism, B12
deficiency) must also be ruled out.

Comorbidity Parkinson's disease may coexist with Alzheimer's disease and
cerebrovascular disease, especially in older individuals. The
compounding of multiple pathological features may diminish the
functional abilities of individuals with Parkinson's disease. Motor
symptoms and frequent co-occurrence of depression or apathy can make
functional impairment worse.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Huntington's Disease
Diagnostic Criteria a. The criteria are met for major or mild
neurocognitive disorder. b. There is insidious onset and gradual
progression. c. There is clinically established Huntington's disease, or
risk for Huntington's disease based on family history or genetic
testing. d. The neurocognitive disorder is not attributable to another
medical condition and is not better explained by another mental
disorder. Coding note: For major neurocognitive disorder due to
Huntington's disease, with behavioral disturbance, code first 333.4
(G10) Huntington's disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) major
neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington's disease, with behavioral
disturbance. For major neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington's
disease, without behavioral disturbance, code first 333.4 (G10)
Huntington's disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) major neurocognitive
disorder due to Huntington's disease, without behavioral disturbance.
For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Huntington's disease, code
331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for Huntington's
disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be
indicated in writing.)

Diagnostic Features Progressive cognitive impairment is a core feature
of Huntington's disease, with early changes in executive function (i.e.,
processing speed, organization, and

planning) rather than learning and memory. Cognitive and associated
behavioral changes often precede the emergence of the typical motor
abnormalities of bradykinesia (i.e., slowing of voluntary movement) and
chorea (i.e., involuntary jerking movements). A diagnosis of definite
Huntington's disease is given in the presence of unequivocal,
extrapyramidal motor abnormalities in an individual with either a family
history of Huntington's disease or genetic testing showing a CAG
trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene, located on chromosome 4.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Depression, irritability,
anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and apathy are frequently, and
psychosis more rarely, associated with Huntington's disease and often
precede the onset of motor symptoms2.

Prevalence Neurocognitive deficits are an eventual outcome of
Huntington's disease; the worldwide prevalence is estimated to be 2.7
per 100,000. The prevalence of Huntington's disease in North America,
Europe, and Australia is 5.7 per 100,000, with a much lower prevalence
of 0.40 per 100,000 in Asia7.

Development and Course The average age at diagnosis of Huntington's
disease is approximately 40 years, although this varies widely3. Age at
onset is inversely correlated with CAG expansion length5. Juvenile
Huntington's disease (onset before age 20) may present more commonly
with bradykinesia, dystonia, and rigidity than with the choreic
movements characteristic of the adult-onset disorder. The disease is
gradually progressive, with median survival approximately 15 years after
motor symptom diagnosis8. Phenotypic expression of Huntington's disease
varies by presence of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms.
Psychiatric and cognitive abnormalities can predate the motor
abnormality by at least 15 years2, 9. Initial symptoms requiring care
often include irritabity, anxiety, or depressed mood. Other behavioral
disturbances may include pronounced apathy, disinhibition, impulsivity,
and impaired insight, with apathy often becoming more progressive over
time10. Early movement symptoms may involve the appearance of
fidgetiness of the extremities as well as mild apraxia (i.e., difficulty
with purposeful movements), particularly with fine motor tasks. As the
disorder progresses, other motor problems include impaired gait (ataxia)
and postural instability. Motor impairment eventually affects speech
production (dysarthria) such that the speech becomes very difficult to
understand, which may result in significant distress resulting from the
communication barrier in the context of comparatively intact cognition.
Advanced

motor disease severely affects gait with progressive ataxia. Eventually
individuals become nonambulatory. End-stage motor disease impairs motor
control of eating and swallowing, typically a major contributor to the
death of the individual from aspiration pneumonia.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. The genetic basis
of Huntington's disease is a fully penetrant autosomal dominant
expansion of the CAG trinucleotide, often called a CAG repeat in the
huntingtin gene. A repeat length of 36 or more is invariably associated
with Huntington's disease, with longer repeat lengths associated with
early age at onset. A CAG repeat length of 36 or more is invariably
associated with Huntington's disease4.

Diagnostic Markers Genetic testing is the primary laboratory test for
the determination of Huntington's disease, which is an autosomal
dominant disorder with complete penetrance. The trinucleotide CAG is
observed to have a repeat expansion in the gene that encodes huntingtin
protein on chromosome 4. A diagnosis of Huntington's disease is not made
in the presence of the gene expansion alone, but the diagnosis is made
only after symptoms become manifest. Some individuals with a positive
family history request genetic testing in a presymptomatic stage.
Associated features may also include neuroimaging changes; volume loss
in the basal ganglia, particularly the caudate nucleus and putamen, is
well known to occur and progresses over the course of illness. Other
structural and functional changes have been observed in brain imaging
but remain research measures.

Functional Consequences of Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to
Huntington's Disease In the prodromal phase of illness and at early
diagnosis, occupational decline is most common, with most individuals
reporting some loss of ability to engage in their typical work. The
emotional, behavioral, and cognitive aspects of Huntington's disease,
such as disinhibition and personality changes, are highly associated
with functional decline1. Cognitive deficits that contribute most to
functional decline may include speed of processing, initiation, and
attention rather than memory impairment6. Given that Huntington's
disease onset occurs in productive years of life, it may have a very
disruptive effect on performance in the work setting as well as social
and family life. As the disease progresses, disability from problems
such as impaired gait, dysarthria, and impulsive or irritable behaviors
may substantially add to the level of impairment and daily care needs,
over and above the care needs

attributable to the cognitive decline. Severe choreic movements may
substantially interfere with provision of care such as bathing,
dressing, and toileting.

Differential Diagnosis Other mental disorders. Early symptoms of
Huntington's disease may include instability of mood, irritability, or
compulsive behaviors that may suggest another mental disorder. However,
genetic testing or the development of motor symptoms will distinguish
the presence of Huntington's disease. Other neurocognitive disorders.
The early symptoms of Huntington's disease, particularly symptoms of
executive dysfunction and impaired psychomotor speed, may resemble other
neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), such as major or mild vascular NCD.
Other movement disorders. Huntington's disease must also be
differentiated from other disorders or conditions associated with
chorea, such as Wilson's disease, drug-induced tardive dyskinesia,
Sydenham's chorea, systemic lupus erythematosus, or senile chorea.
Rarely, individuals may present with a course similar to that of
Huntington's disease but without positive genetic testing; this is
considered to be a Huntington's disease phenocopy that results from a
variety of potential genetic factors11.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition
Diagnostic Criteria a. The criteria are met for major or mild
neurocognitive disorder. b. There is evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings that the neurocognitive disorder is
the pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition. c. The
cognitive deficits are not better explained by another mental disorder
or another specific neurocognitive disorder (e.g., Alzheimer's disease,
HIV infection). Coding note: For major neurocognitive disorder due to
another medical condition, with behavioral disturbance, code first the
other medical condition, followed by the major neurocognitive disorder
due to another medical condition, with behavioral disturbance (e.g., 340
\[G35\] multiple sclerosis, 294.11 \[F02.81\] major neurocognitive
disorder due to multiple sclerosis, with behavioral disturbance). For
major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, without
behavioral disturbance, code first the other medical condition, followed
by the major neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition,
without behavioral disturbance (e.g., 340 \[G35\] multiple sclerosis,
294.10 \[F02.80\] major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple
sclerosis, without behavioral disturbance).

For mild neurocognitive disorder due to another medical condition, code
331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the additional code for the other
medical condition. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should
still be indicated in writing.)

Diagnostic Features A number of other medical conditions can cause
neurocognitive disorders (NCDs). These conditions include structural
lesions (e.g., primary or secondary brain tumors, subdural hematoma,
slowly progressive or normal-pressure hydrocephalus), hypoxia related to
hypoperfusion from heart failure, endocrine conditions (e.g.,
hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypoglycemia), nutritional conditions
(e.g., deficiencies of thiamine or niacin), other infectious conditions
(e.g., neurosyphilis, cryptococcosis), immune disorders (e.g., temporal
arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus), hepatic or renal failure,
metabolic conditions (e.g., Kufs' disease, adrenoleukodystrophy,
metachromatic leukodystrophy, other storage diseases of adulthood and
childhood), and other neurological conditions (e.g., epilepsy, multiple
sclerosis). Unusual causes of central nervous system injury, such as
electrical shock or intracranial radiation, are generally evident from
the history. The temporal association between the onset or exacerbation
of the medical condition and the development of the cognitive deficit
offers the greatest support that the NCD is induced by the medical
condition. Diagnostic certainty regarding this relationship may be
increased if the neurocognitive deficits ameliorate partially or
stabilize in the context of treatment of the medical condition.

Development and Course Typically the course of the NCD progresses in a
manner that is commensurate with progression of the underlying medical
disorder. In circumstances where the medical disorder is treatable
(e.g., hypothyroidism), the neurocognitive deficit may improve or at
least not progress. When the medical condition has a deteriorative
course (e.g., secondary progressive multiple sclerosis), the
neurocognitive deficits will progress along with the temporal course of
illness.

Diagnostic Markers Associated physical examination and laboratory
findings and other clinical features depend on the nature and severity
of the medical condition.

Differential Diagnosis Other major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The
presence of an attributable medical condition does not entirely exclude
the possibility of another major or mild NCD. If cognitive deficits
persist following successful treatment of an associated

medical condition, then another etiology may be responsible for the
cognitive decline.

Major or Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Multiple Etiologies
Diagnostic Criteria a. The criteria are met for major or mild
neurocognitive disorder. b. There is evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings that the neurocognitive disorder is
the pathophysiological consequence of more than one etiological process,
excluding substances (e.g., neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's
disease with subsequent development of vascular neurocognitive
disorder). Note: Please refer to the diagnostic criteria for the various
neurocognitive disorders due to specific medical conditions for guidance
on establishing the particular etiologies. c. The cognitive deficits are
not better explained by another mental disorder and do not occur
exclusively during the course of a delirium. Coding note: For major
neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, with behavioral
disturbance, code 294.11 (F02.81); for major neurocognitive disorder due
to multiple etiologies, without behavioral disturbance, code 294.10
(F02.80). All of the etiological medical conditions (with the exception
of vascular disease) should be coded and listed separately immediately
before major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies (e.g.,
331.0 \[G30.9\] Alzheimer's disease; 331.82 \[G31.83\] Lewy body
disease; 294.11 \[F02.81\] major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple
etiologies, with behavioral disturbance). When a cerebrovascular
etiology is contributing to the neurocognitive disorder, the diagnosis
of vascular neurocognitive disorder should be listed in addition to
major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies. For example,
for a presentation of major neurocognitive disorder due to both
Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease, with behavioral disturbance,
code the following: 331.0 (G30.9) Alzheimer's disease; 294.11 (F02.81)
major neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies, with
behavioral disturbance; 290.40 (F01.51) major vascular neurocognitive
disorder, with behavioral disturbance. For mild neurocognitive disorder
due to multiple etiologies, code 331.83 (G31.84). (Note: Do not use the
additional codes for the etiologies. Behavioral disturbance cannot be
coded but should still be indicated in writing.)

This category is included to cover the clinical presentation of a
neurocognitive disorder (NCD) for which there is evidence that multiple
medical conditions have played a probable role in the development of the
NCD. In addition to evidence indicative of the presence of multiple
medical conditions that are known to cause NCD (i.e., findings from the
history and physical examination, and laboratory findings), it may be
helpful to refer to the diagnostic criteria and text for the various
medical etiologies (e.g., NCD due to Parkinson's disease) for more
information on establishing the etiological connection for that
particular medical condition.

Unspecified Neurocognitive Disorder 799.59 (R41.9) This category applies
to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a neurocognitive
disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders
in the neurocognitive disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified
neurocognitive disorder category is used in situations in which the
precise etiology cannot be determined with sufficient certainty to make
an etiological attribution. Coding note: For unspecified major or mild
neurocognitive disorder, code 799.59 (R41.9). (Note: Do not use
additional codes for any presumed etiological medical conditions.
Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but may be indicated in writing.)

Personality Disorders This chapter begins with a general definition of
personality disorder that applies to each of the 10 specific personality
disorders. A personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner
experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of
the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in
adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to
distress or impairment. With any ongoing review process, especially one
of this complexity, different viewpoints emerge, and an effort was made
to accommodate them. Thus, personality disorders are included in both
Sections II and III. The material in Section II represents an update of
text associated with the same criteria found in DSM-IV-TR, whereas
Section III includes the proposed research model for personality
disorder diagnosis and conceptualization developed by the DSM-5
Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group. As this field evolves,
it is hoped that both versions will serve clinical practice and research
initiatives, respectively. The following personality disorders are
included in this chapter. Paranoid personality disorder is a pattern of
distrust and suspiciousness such that others' motives are interpreted as
malevolent. Schizoid personality disorder is a pattern of detachment
from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional
expression. Schizotypal personality disorder is a pattern of acute
discomfort in close relationships, cognitive or perceptual distortions,
and eccentricities of behavior. Antisocial personality disorder is a
pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others.
Borderline personality disorder is a pattern of instability in
interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked

impulsivity. Histrionic personality disorder is a pattern of excessive
emotionality and attention seeking. Narcissistic personality disorder is
a pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy.
Avoidant personality disorder is a pattern of social inhibition,
feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation.
Dependent personality disorder is a pattern of submissive and clinging
behavior related to an excessive need to be taken care of.
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a pattern of preoccupation
with orderliness, perfectionism, and control. Personality change due to
another medical condition is a persistent personality disturbance that
is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a medical
condition (e.g., frontal lobe lesion). Other specified personality
disorder and unspecified personality disorder is a category provided for
two situations: 1) the individual's personality pattern meets the
general criteria for a personality disorder, and traits of several
different personality disorders are present, but the criteria for any
specific personality disorder are not met; or 2) the individual's
personality pattern meets the general criteria for a personality
disorder, but the individual is considered to have a personality
disorder that is not included in the DSM-5 classification (e.g.,
passive-aggressive personality disorder). The personality disorders are
grouped into three clusters based on descriptive similarities. Cluster A
includes paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders.
Individuals with these disorders often appear odd or eccentric. Cluster
B includes antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic
personality disorders. Individuals with these disorders often appear
dramatic, emotional, or erratic. Cluster C includes avoidant, dependent,
and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Individuals with these
disorders often appear anxious or fearful. It should be noted that this
clustering system, although useful in some research and educational
situations, has serious limitations and has not been consistently
validated.

Moreover, individuals frequently present with co-occurring personality
disorders from different clusters. Prevalence estimates for the
different clusters suggest 5.7% for disorders in Cluster A, 1.5% for
disorders in Cluster B, 6.0% for disorders in Cluster C, and 9.1% for
any personality disorder, indicating frequent co-occurrence of disorders
from different clusters2. Data from the 2001--2002 National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions suggest that
approximately 15% of U.S. adults have at least one personality
disorder1.

Dimensional Models for Personality Disorders The diagnostic approach
used in this manual represents the categorical perspective that
personality disorders are qualitatively distinct clinical syndromes. An
alternative to the categorical approach is the dimensional perspective
that personality disorders represent maladaptive variants of personality
traits that merge imperceptibly into normality and into one another. See
Section III for a full description of a dimensional model for
personality disorders. The DSM-IV personality disorder clusters (i.e.,
oddeccentric, dramatic-emotional, and anxious-fearful) may also be
viewed as dimensions representing spectra of personality dysfunction on
a continuum with other mental disorders. The alternative dimensional
models have much in common and together appear to cover the important
areas of personality dysfunction. Their integration, clinical utility,
and relationship with the personality disorder diagnostic categories and
various aspects of personality dysfunction are under active
investigation.

General Personality Disorder

Criteria a. An enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that
deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture.
This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1.
Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people,
and events). 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, appropriateness
of emotional response).

lability,

and

3.  Interpersonal functioning.
4.  Impulse control.

<!-- -->

b.  The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad
    range of personal and social situations.
c.  The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or
    impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
    functioning.
d.  The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be
    traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood.
e.  The enduring pattern is not better explained as a manifestation or
    consequence of another mental disorder.
f.  The enduring pattern is not attributable to the physiological
    effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or
    another medical condition (e.g., head trauma).

Diagnostic Features Personality traits are enduring patterns of
perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and oneself
that are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal contexts. Only
when personality traits are inflexible and maladaptive and cause
significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they
constitute personality disorders. The essential feature of a personality
disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that
deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture and
is manifested in at least two of the following areas:

cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning, or impulse control
(Criterion A). This enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across
a broad range of personal and social situations (Criterion B) and leads
to clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The
pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back
at least to adolescence or early adulthood (Criterion D). The pattern is
not better explained as a manifestation or consequence of another mental
disorder (Criterion E) and is not attributable to the physiological
effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure to
a toxin) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma) (Criterion F).
Specific diagnostic criteria are also provided for each of the
personality disorders included in this chapter. The diagnosis of
personality disorders requires an evaluation of the individual's
long-term patterns of functioning, and the particular personality
features must be evident by early adulthood. The personality traits that
define these disorders must also be distinguished from characteristics
that emerge in response to specific situational stressors or more
transient mental states (e.g., bipolar, depressive, or anxiety
disorders; substance intoxication). The clinician should assess the
stability of personality traits over time and across different
situations. Although a single interview with the individual is sometimes
sufficient for making the diagnosis, it is often necessary to conduct
more than one interview and to space these over time. Assessment can
also be complicated by the fact that the characteristics that define a
personality disorder may not be considered problematic by the individual
(i.e., the traits are often ego-syntonic). To help overcome this
difficulty, supplementary information from other informants may be
helpful.

Development and Course The features of a personality disorder usually
become recognizable during adolescence or early adult life. By
definition, a personality disorder is an enduring pattern of thinking,
feeling, and behaving that is relatively stable over time. Some types of
personality disorder (notably, antisocial and borderline personality
disorders) tend to become less evident or to remit with age, whereas
this appears to be less true for some other types (e.g.,
obsessive-compulsive and schizotypal personality disorders).

Personality disorder categories may be applied with children or
adolescents in those relatively unusual instances in which the
individual's particular maladaptive personality traits appear to be
pervasive, persistent, and unlikely to be limited to a particular
developmental stage or another mental disorder. It should be recognized
that the traits of a personality disorder that appear in childhood will
often not persist unchanged into adult life. For a personality disorder
to be diagnosed in an individual younger than 18 years, the features
must have been present for at least 1 year. The one exception to this is
antisocial personality disorder, which cannot be diagnosed in
individuals younger than 18 years. Although, by definition, a
personality disorder requires an onset no later than early adulthood,
individuals may not come to clinical attention until relatively late in
life. A personality disorder may be exacerbated following the loss of
significant supporting persons (e.g., a spouse) or previously
stabilizing social situations (e.g., a job). However, the development of
a change in personality in middle adulthood or later life warrants a
thorough evaluation to determine the possible presence of a personality
change due to another medical condition or an unrecognized substance use
disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Judgments about personality
functioning must take into account the individual's ethnic, cultural,
and social background. Personality disorders should not be confused with
problems associated with acculturation following immigration or with the
expression of habits, customs, or religious and political values
professed by the individual's culture of origin. It is useful for the
clinician, especially when evaluating someone from a different
background, to obtain additional information from informants who are
familiar with the person's cultural background.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Certain personality disorders (e.g.,
antisocial personality disorder) are diagnosed more frequently in males.
Others (e.g., borderline, histrionic, and dependent personality
disorders) are diagnosed more frequently in females. Although these
differences in prevalence probably reflect real gender differences in
the presence of such patterns, clinicians must be cautious not to
overdiagnose or underdiagnose certain personality disorders in females

or in males because of social stereotypes about typical gender roles and
behaviors.

Differential Diagnosis Other mental disorders and personality traits.
Many of the specific criteria for the personality disorders describe
features (e.g., suspiciousness, dependency, insensitivity) that are also
characteristic of episodes of other mental disorders. A personality
disorder should be diagnosed only when the defining characteristics
appeared before early adulthood, are typical of the individual's
long-term functioning, and do not occur exclusively during an episode of
another mental disorder. It may be particularly difficult (and not
particularly useful) to distinguish personality disorders from
persistent mental disorders such as persistent depressive disorder that
have an early onset and an enduring, relatively stable course. Some
personality disorders may have a "spectrum" relationship to other mental
disorders (e.g., schizotypal personality disorder with schizophrenia;
avoidant personality disorder with social anxiety disorder \[social
phobia\]) based on phenomenological or biological similarities or
familial aggregation. Personality disorders must be distinguished from
personality traits that do not reach the threshold for a personality
disorder. Personality traits are diagnosed as a personality disorder
only when they are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause
significant functional impairment or subjective distress. Psychotic
disorders. For the three personality disorders that may be related to
the psychotic disorders (i.e., paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal),
there is an exclusion criterion stating that the pattern of behavior
must not have occurred exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a
bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features, or another
psychotic disorder. When an individual has a persistent mental disorder
(e.g., schizophrenia) that was preceded by a preexisting personality
disorder, the personality disorder should also be recorded, followed by
"premorbid" in parentheses. Anxiety and depressive disorders. The
clinician must be cautious in diagnosing personality disorders during an
episode of a depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder, because these
conditions may have cross-sectional symptom features that mimic
personality traits and may make it more

difficult to evaluate retrospectively the individual's long-term
patterns of functioning. Posttraumatic stress disorder. When personality
changes emerge and persist after an individual has been exposed to
extreme stress, a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder should be
considered. Substance use disorders. When an individual has a substance
use disorder, it is important not to make a personality disorder
diagnosis based solely on behaviors that are consequences of substance
intoxication or withdrawal or that are associated with activities in the
service of sustaining substance use (e.g., antisocial behavior).
Personality change due to another medical condition. When enduring
changes in personality arise as a result of the physiological effects of
another medical condition (e.g., brain tumor), a diagnosis of
personality change due to another medical condition should be
considered.

schizophrenia, add "premorbid," i.e., "paranoid personality disorder
(premorbid)."

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of paranoid personality
disorder is a pattern of pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others
such that their motives are interpreted as malevolent. This pattern
begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.
Individuals with this disorder assume that other people will exploit,
harm, or deceive them, even if no evidence exists to support this
expectation (Criterion A1). They suspect on the basis of little or no
evidence that others are plotting against them and may attack them
suddenly, at any time and without reason. They often feel that they have
been deeply and irreversibly injured by another person or persons even
when there is no objective evidence for this. They are preoccupied with
unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of their friends
and associates, whose actions are minutely scrutinized for evidence of
hostile intentions (Criterion A2). Any perceived deviation from
trustworthiness or loyalty serves to support their underlying
assumptions. They are so amazed when a friend or associate shows loyalty
that they cannot trust or believe it. If they get into trouble, they
expect that friends and associates will either attack or ignore them.
Individuals with paranoid personality disorder are reluctant to confide
in or become close to others because they fear that the information they
share

will be used against them (Criterion A3). They may refuse to answer
personal questions, saying that the information is "nobody's business."
They read hidden meanings that are demeaning and threatening into benign
remarks or events (Criterion A4). For example, an individual with this
disorder may misinterpret an honest mistake by a store clerk as a
deliberate attempt to shortchange, or view a casual humorous remark by a
co-worker as a serious character attack. Compliments are often
misinterpreted (e.g., a compliment on a new acquisition is
misinterpreted as a criticism for selfishness; a compliment on an
accomplishment is misinterpreted as an attempt to coerce more and better
performance). They may view an offer of help as a criticism that they
are not doing well enough on their own. Individuals with this disorder
persistently bear grudges and are unwilling to forgive the insults,
injuries, or slights that they think they have received (Criterion A5).
Minor slights arouse major hostility, and the hostile feelings persist
for a long time. Because they are constantly vigilant to the harmful
intentions of others, they very often feel that their character or
reputation has been attacked or that they have been slighted in some
other way. They are quick to counterattack and react with anger to
perceived insults (Criterion A6). Individuals with this disorder may be
pathologically jealous, often suspecting that their spouse or sexual
partner is unfaithful without any adequate justification (Criterion A7).
They may gather trivial and circumstantial "evidence" to support their
jealous beliefs. They want to maintain complete control of intimate
relationships to avoid being betrayed and may constantly question and
challenge the whereabouts, actions, intentions, and fidelity of their
spouse or partner. Paranoid personality disorder should not be diagnosed
if the pattern of behavior occurs exclusively during the course of
schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive disorder with psychotic
features, or another psychotic disorder, or if it is attributable to the
physiological effects of a neurological (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy)
or another medical condition (Criterion B).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with paranoid
personality disorder are generally difficult to get along with and often
have problems with close relationships. Their excessive suspiciousness
and hostility may be expressed in overt argumentativeness, in recurrent
complaining, or by quiet, apparently hostile

aloofness. Because they are hypervigilant for potential threats, they
may act in a guarded, secretive, or devious manner and appear to be
"cold" and lacking in tender feelings. Although they may appear to be
objective, rational, and unemotional, they more often display a labile
range of affect, with hostile, stubborn, and sarcastic expressions
predominating. Their combative and suspicious nature may elicit a
hostile response in others, which then serves to confirm their original
expectations. Because individuals with paranoid personality disorder
lack trust in others, they have an excessive need to be self-sufficient
and a strong sense of autonomy. They also need to have a high degree of
control over those around them. They are often rigid, critical of
others, and unable to collaborate, although they have great difficulty
accepting criticism themselves. They may blame others for their own
shortcomings. Because of their quickness to counterattack in response to
the threats they perceive around them, they may be litigious and
frequently become involved in legal disputes. Individuals with this
disorder seek to confirm their preconceived negative notions regarding
people or situations they encounter, attributing malevolent motivations
to others that are projections of their own fears. They may exhibit
thinly hidden, unrealistic grandiose fantasies, are often attuned to
issues of power and rank, and tend to develop negative stereotypes of
others, particularly those from population groups distinct from their
own. Attracted by simplistic formulations of the world, they are often
wary of ambiguous situations. They may be perceived as "fanatics" and
form tightly knit "cults" or groups with others who share their paranoid
belief systems. Particularly in response to stress, individuals with
this disorder may experience very brief psychotic episodes (lasting
minutes to hours). In some instances, paranoid personality disorder may
appear as the premorbid antecedent of delusional disorder or
schizophrenia. Individuals with paranoid personality disorder may
develop major depressive disorder and may be at increased risk for
agoraphobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Alcohol and other
substance use disorders frequently occur. The most common co-occurring
personality disorders appear to be schizotypal, schizoid, narcissistic,
avoidant, and borderline.

Prevalence

A prevalence estimate for paranoid personality based on a probability
subsample from Part II of the National Comorbidity Survey Replication
suggests a prevalence of 2.3%2, while the National Epidemiologic Survey
on Alcohol and Related Conditions data suggest a prevalence of paranoid
personality disorder of 4.4%1.

Development and Course Paranoid personality disorder may be first
apparent in childhood and adolescence with solitariness, poor peer
relationships, social anxiety, underachievement in school,
hypersensitivity, peculiar thoughts and language, and idiosyncratic
fantasies. These children may appear to be "odd" or "eccentric" and
attract teasing. In clinical samples, this disorder appears to be more
commonly diagnosed in males.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. There is some
evidence for an increased prevalence of paranoid personality disorder in
relatives of probands with schizophrenia and for a more specific
familial relationship with delusional disorder, persecutory type.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Some behaviors that are influenced by
sociocultural contexts or specific life circumstances may be erroneously
labeled paranoid and may even be reinforced by the process of clinical
evaluation. Members of minority groups, immigrants, political and
economic refugees, or individuals of different ethnic backgrounds may
display guarded or defensive behaviors because of unfamiliarity (e.g.,
language barriers or lack of knowledge of rules and regulations) or in
response to the perceived neglect or indifference of the majority
society. These behaviors can, in turn, generate anger and frustration in
those who deal with these individuals, thus setting up a vicious cycle
of mutual mistrust, which should not be confused with paranoid
personality disorder. Some ethnic groups also display culturally related
behaviors that can be misinterpreted as paranoid.

Differential Diagnosis

Other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms. Paranoid personality
disorder can be distinguished from delusional disorder, persecutory
type; schizophrenia; and a bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic
features because these disorders are all characterized by a period of
persistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and hallucinations). For
an additional diagnosis of paranoid personality disorder to be given,
the personality disorder must have been present before the onset of
psychotic symptoms and must persist when the psychotic symptoms are in
remission. When an individual has another persistent mental disorder
(e.g., schizophrenia) that was preceded by paranoid personality
disorder, paranoid personality disorder should also be recorded,
followed by "premorbid" in parentheses. Personality change due to
another medical condition. Paranoid personality disorder must be
distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition,
in which the traits that emerge are attributable to the direct effects
of another medical condition on the central nervous system. Substance
use disorders. Paranoid personality disorder must be distinguished from
symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.
Paranoid traits associated with physical handicaps. The disorder must
also be distinguished from paranoid traits associated with the
development of physical handicaps (e.g., a hearing impairment). Other
personality disorders and personality traits. Other personality
disorders may be confused with paranoid personality disorder because
they have certain features in common. It is therefore important to
distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their
characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in
addition to paranoid personality disorder, all can be diagnosed.
Paranoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder share
the traits of suspiciousness, interpersonal aloofness, and paranoid
ideation, but schizotypal personality disorder also includes symptoms
such as magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, and odd
thinking and speech. Individuals with behaviors that meet criteria for
schizoid personality disorder are often perceived as strange, eccentric,
cold, and aloof, but they do not usually have prominent paranoid
ideation. The tendency of individuals with paranoid personality

disorder to react to minor stimuli with anger is also seen in borderline
and histrionic personality disorders. However, these disorders are not
necessarily associated with pervasive suspiciousness. People with
avoidant personality disorder may also be reluctant to confide in
others, but more from fear of being embarrassed or found inadequate than
from fear of others' malicious intent. Although antisocial behavior may
be present in some individuals with paranoid personality disorder, it is
not usually motivated by a desire for personal gain or to exploit others
as in antisocial personality disorder, but rather is more often
attributable to a desire for revenge. Individuals with narcissistic
personality disorder may occasionally display suspiciousness, social
withdrawal, or alienation, but this derives primarily from fears of
having their imperfections or flaws revealed. Paranoid traits may be
adaptive, particularly in threatening environments. Paranoid personality
disorder should be diagnosed only when these traits are inflexible,
maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment
or subjective distress.

Schizoid Personality Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

301.20 (F60.1)

a.  A pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a
    restricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal
    settings, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of
    contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Neither desires nor enjoys close relationships, including being part
    of a family.

2. Almost always chooses solitary activities. 3. Has little, if any,
interest in having sexual experiences with another person. 4. Takes
pleasure in few, if any, activities. 5. Lacks close friends or
confidants other than first-degree relatives. 6. Appears indifferent to
the praise or criticism of others. 7. Shows emotional coldness,
detachment, or flattened affectivity. b. Does not occur exclusively
during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or depressive
disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder, or autism
spectrum disorder and is not attributable to the physiological effects
of another medical condition. Note: If criteria are met prior to the
onset of schizophrenia, add "premorbid," i.e., "schizoid personality
disorder (premorbid)."

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of schizoid personality
disorder is a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships
and a restricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal
settings. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a
variety of contexts. Individuals with schizoid personality disorder
appear to lack a desire for intimacy, seem indifferent to opportunities
to develop close relationships, and do not seem to derive much
satisfaction from being part of a family or other social group
(Criterion A1). They prefer spending time by themselves, rather than
being with other people. They often appear to be socially isolated or
"loners" and almost always choose solitary activities or hobbies that do
not include interaction with others (Criterion A2). They prefer
mechanical or abstract tasks, such as computer or mathematical games.
They may have very little interest in having sexual experiences with
another person (Criterion A3) and take pleasure in few, if any,
activities (Criterion A4). There is usually a reduced experience of
pleasure from sensory, bodily, or interpersonal experiences, such as
walking on a beach at sunset or having

sex. These individuals have no close friends or confidants, except
possibly a first-degree relative (Criterion A5). Individuals with
schizoid personality disorder often seem indifferent to the approval or
criticism of others and do not appear to be bothered by what others may
think of them (Criterion A6). They may be oblivious to the normal
subtleties of social interaction and often do not respond appropriately
to social cues so that they seem socially inept or superficial and
self-absorbed. They usually display a "bland" exterior without visible
emotional reactivity and rarely reciprocate gestures or facial
expressions, such as smiles or nods (Criterion A7). They claim that they
rarely experience strong emotions such as anger and joy. They often
display a constricted affect and appear cold and aloof. However, in
those very unusual circumstances in which these individuals become at
least temporarily comfortable in revealing themselves, they may
acknowledge having painful feelings, particularly related to social
interactions. Schizoid personality disorder should not be diagnosed if
the pattern of behavior occurs exclusively during the course of
schizophrenia, a bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features,
another psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder, or if it is
attributable to the physiological effects of a neurological (e.g.,
temporal lobe epilepsy) or another medical condition (Criterion B).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with schizoid
personality disorder may have particular difficulty expressing anger,
even in response to direct provocation, which contributes to the
impression that they lack emotion. Their lives sometimes seem
directionless, and they may appear to "drift" in their goals. Such
individuals often react passively to adverse circumstances and have
difficulty responding appropriately to important life events. Because of
their lack of social skills and lack of desire for sexual experiences,
individuals with this disorder have few friendships, date infrequently,
and often do not marry. Occupational functioning may be impaired,
particularly if interpersonal involvement is required, but individuals
with this disorder may do well when they work under conditions of social
isolation. Particularly in response to stress, individuals with this
disorder may experience very brief psychotic episodes (lasting minutes
to hours). In some instances, schizoid personality disorder may appear
as the premorbid antecedent of delusional

disorder or schizophrenia. Individuals with this disorder may sometimes
develop major depressive disorder. Schizoid personality disorder most
often co-occurs with schizotypal, paranoid, and avoidant personality
disorders.

Prevalence Schizoid personality disorder is uncommon in clinical
settings. A prevalence estimate for schizoid personality based on a
probability subsample from Part II of the National Comorbidity Survey
Replication suggests a prevalence of 4.9%2. Data from the 2001--2002
National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions suggest
a prevalence of 3.1%1.

Development and Course Schizoid personality disorder may be first
apparent in childhood and adolescence with solitariness, poor peer
relationships, and underachievement in school, which mark these children
or adolescents as different and make them subject to teasing.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Schizoid
personality disorder may have increased prevalence in the relatives of
individuals with schizophrenia or schizotypal personality disorder.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Individuals from a variety of cultural
backgrounds sometimes exhibit defensive behaviors and interpersonal
styles that may be erroneously labeled as "schizoid." For example, those
who have moved from rural to metropolitan environments may react with
"emotional freezing" that may last for several months and manifest as
solitary activities, constricted affect, and other deficits in
communication. Immigrants from other countries are sometimes mistakenly
perceived as cold, hostile, or indifferent.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Schizoid personality disorder is
diagnosed slightly more often in males and may cause more impairment in
them.

Differential Diagnosis Other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms.
Schizoid personality disorder can be distinguished from delusional
disorder, schizophrenia, and a bipolar or depressive disorder with
psychotic features because these disorders are all characterized by a
period of persistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and
hallucinations). To give an additional diagnosis of schizoid personality
disorder, the personality disorder must have been present before the
onset of psychotic symptoms and must persist when the psychotic symptoms
are in remission. When an individual has a persistent psychotic disorder
(e.g., schizophrenia) that was preceded by schizoid personality
disorder, schizoid personality disorder should also be recorded,
followed by "premorbid" in parentheses. Autism spectrum disorder. There
may be great difficulty differentiating individuals with schizoid
personality disorder from those with milder forms of autism spectrum
disorder, which may be differentiated by more severely impaired social
interaction and stereotyped behaviors and interests. Personality change
due to another medical condition. Schizoid personality disorder must be
distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition,
in which the traits that emerge are attributable to the effects of
another medical condition on the central nervous system. Substance use
disorders. Schizoid personality disorder must also be distinguished from
symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.
Other personality disorders and personality traits. Other personality
disorders may be confused with schizoid personality disorder because
they have certain features in common. It is, therefore, important to
distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their
characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in
addition to schizoid personality disorder, all can be diagnosed.
Although characteristics of social isolation and restricted affectivity
are common to schizoid, schizotypal, and paranoid personality disorders,
schizoid personality disorder can be distinguished from schizotypal
personality disorder by the lack of cognitive and perceptual distortions
and from paranoid personality disorder by the lack of suspiciousness and
paranoid ideation. The social isolation of schizoid

personality disorder can be distinguished from that of avoidant
personality disorder, which is attributable to fear of being embarrassed
or found inadequate and excessive anticipation of rejection. In
contrast, people with schizoid personality disorder have a more
pervasive detachment and limited desire for social intimacy. Individuals
with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may also show an apparent
social detachment stemming from devotion to work and discomfort with
emotions, but they do have an underlying capacity for intimacy.
Individuals who are "loners" may display personality traits that might
be considered schizoid. Only when these traits are inflexible and
maladaptive and cause significant functional impairment or subjective
distress do they constitute schizoid personality disorder.

Schizotypal Personality Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

301.22 (F21)

a.  A pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by
    acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships
    as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities
    of behavior, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety
    of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:

<!-- -->

1.  Ideas of reference (excluding delusions of reference).
2.  Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is
    inconsistent with subcultural norms (e.g., superstitiousness, belief
    in clairvoyance, telepathy, or "sixth sense"; in children and
    adolescents, bizarre fantasies or preoccupations).

3. Unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily illusions. 4. Odd
thinking and speech (e.g., vague, circumstantial, metaphorical,
overelaborate, or stereotyped). 5. Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation.
6. Inappropriate or constricted affect. 7. Behavior or appearance that
is odd, eccentric, or peculiar. 8. Lack of close friends or confidants
other than first-degree relatives. 9. Excessive social anxiety that does
not diminish with familiarity and tends to be associated with paranoid
fears rather than negative judgments about self. b. Does not occur
exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar disorder or
depressive disorder with psychotic features, another psychotic disorder,
or autism spectrum disorder. Note: If criteria are met prior to the
onset of schizophrenia, add "premorbid," e.g., "schizotypal personality
disorder (premorbid)."

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of schizotypal personality
disorder is a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits
marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close
relationships as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and
eccentricities of behavior. This pattern begins by early adulthood and
is present in a variety of contexts. Individuals with schizotypal
personality disorder often have ideas of reference (i.e., incorrect
interpretations of casual incidents and external events as having a
particular and unusual meaning specifically for the person) (Criterion
A1). These should be distinguished from delusions of reference, in which
the beliefs are held with delusional conviction. These individuals may
be superstitious or preoccupied with paranormal phenomena that are
outside the norms of their subculture (Criterion A2). They may feel that
they have special powers to sense events before they happen or to read
others' thoughts. They may believe that they have magical control over
others, which can be implemented directly (e.g.,

believing that their spouse's taking the dog out for a walk is the
direct result of thinking an hour earlier it should be done) or
indirectly through compliance with magical rituals (e.g., walking past a
specific object three times to avoid a certain harmful outcome).
Perceptual alterations may be present (e.g., sensing that another person
is present or hearing a voice murmuring his or her name) (Criterion A3).
Their speech may include unusual or idiosyncratic phrasing and
construction. It is often loose, digressive, or vague, but without
actual derailment or incoherence (Criterion A4). Responses can be either
overly concrete or overly abstract, and words or concepts are sometimes
applied in unusual ways (e.g., the individual may state that he or she
was not "talkable" at work). Individuals with this disorder are often
suspicious and may have paranoid ideation (e.g., believing their
colleagues at work are intent on undermining their reputation with the
boss) (Criterion A5). They are usually not able to negotiate the full
range of affects and interpersonal cuing required for successful
relationships and thus often appear to interact with others in an
inappropriate, stiff, or constricted fashion (Criterion A6). These
individuals are often considered to be odd or eccentric because of
unusual mannerisms, an often unkempt manner of dress that does not quite
"fit together," and inattention to the usual social conventions (e.g.,
the individual may avoid eye contact, wear clothes that are ink stained
and ill-fitting, and be unable to join in the give-and-take banter of
co-workers) (Criterion A7). Individuals with schizotypal personality
disorder experience interpersonal relatedness as problematic and are
uncomfortable relating to other people. Although they may express
unhappiness about their lack of relationships, their behavior suggests a
decreased desire for intimate contacts. As a result, they usually have
no or few close friends or confidants other than a firstdegree relative
(Criterion A8). They are anxious in social situations, particularly
those involving unfamiliar people (Criterion A9). They will interact
with other individuals when they have to but prefer to keep to
themselves because they feel that they are different and just do not
"fit in." Their social anxiety does not easily abate, even when they
spend more time in the setting or become more familiar with the other
people, because their anxiety tends to be associated with suspiciousness
regarding others' motivations. For example, when attending a dinner
party, the individual with schizotypal personality disorder will not
become more relaxed as time goes on, but rather may become increasingly
tense and suspicious.

Schizotypal personality disorder should not be diagnosed if the pattern
of behavior occurs exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a
bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features, another
psychotic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder (Criterion B).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with schizotypal
personality disorder often seek treatment for the associated symptoms of
anxiety or depression rather than for the personality disorder features
per se. Particularly in response to stress, individuals with this
disorder may experience transient psychotic episodes (lasting minutes to
hours), although they usually are insufficient in duration to warrant an
additional diagnosis such as brief psychotic disorder or
schizophreniform disorder. In some cases, clinically significant
psychotic symptoms may develop that meet criteria for brief psychotic
disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or
schizophrenia. Over half may have a history of at least one major
depressive episode. From 30% to 50% of individuals diagnosed with this
disorder have a concurrent diagnosis of major depressive disorder when
admitted to a clinical setting. There is considerable co-occurrence with
schizoid, paranoid, avoidant, and borderline personality disorders.

Prevalence In community studies of schizotypal personality disorder,
reported rates range from 0.6% in Norwegian samples to 4.6% in a U.S.
community sample1. The prevalence of schizotypal personality disorder in
clinical populations seems to be infrequent (0%--1.9%), with a higher
estimated prevalence in the general population (3.9%) found in the
National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions2.

Development and Course Schizotypal personality disorder has a relatively
stable course, with only a small proportion of individuals going on to
develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. Schizotypal
personality disorder may be first apparent in childhood and adolescence
with solitariness, poor peer relationships, social anxiety,
underachievement in school, hypersensitivity,

peculiar thoughts and language, and bizarre fantasies. These children
may appear "odd" or "eccentric" and attract teasing.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Schizotypal
personality disorder appears to aggregate familially and is more
prevalent among the first-degree biological relatives of individuals
with schizophrenia than among the general population. There may also be
a modest increase in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in the
relatives of probands with schizotypal personality disorder.

Cultural-Related Diagnostic Issues Cognitive and perceptual distortions
must be evaluated in the context of the individual's cultural milieu.
Pervasive culturally determined characteristics, particularly those
regarding religious beliefs and rituals, can appear to be schizotypal to
the uninformed outsider (e.g., voodoo, speaking in tongues, life beyond
death, shamanism, mind reading, sixth sense, evil eye, magical beliefs
related to health and illness).

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Schizotypal personality disorder may be
slightly more common in males.

Differential Diagnosis Other mental disorders with psychotic symptoms.
Schizotypal personality disorder can be distinguished from delusional
disorder, schizophrenia, and a bipolar or depressive disorder with
psychotic features because these disorders are all characterized by a
period of persistent psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions and
hallucinations). To give an additional diagnosis of schizotypal
personality disorder, the personality disorder must have been present
before the onset of psychotic symptoms and persist when the psychotic
symptoms are in remission. When an individual has a persistent psychotic
disorder (e.g., schizophrenia) that was preceded by schizotypal
personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder should also be
recorded, followed by "premorbid" in parentheses.

Neurodevelopmental disorders. There may be great difficulty
differentiating children with schizotypal personality disorder from the
heterogeneous group of solitary, odd children whose behavior is
characterized by marked social isolation, eccentricity, or peculiarities
of language and whose diagnoses would probably include milder forms of
autism spectrum disorder or language communication disorders.
Communication disorders may be differentiated by the primacy and
severity of the disorder in language and by the characteristic features
of impaired language found in a specialized language assessment. Milder
forms of autism spectrum disorder are differentiated by the even greater
lack of social awareness and emotional reciprocity and stereotyped
behaviors and interests. Personality change due to another medical
condition. Schizotypal personality disorder must be distinguished from
personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits
that emerge are attributable to the effects of another medical condition
on the central nervous system. Substance use disorders. Schizotypal
personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may
develop in association with persistent substance use. Other personality
disorders and personality traits. Other personality disorders may be
confused with schizotypal personality disorder because they have certain
features in common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among
these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features.
However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria
for one or more personality disorders in addition to schizotypal
personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Although paranoid and
schizoid personality disorders may also be characterized by social
detachment and restricted affect, schizotypal personality disorder can
be distinguished from these two diagnoses by the presence of cognitive
or perceptual distortions and marked eccentricity or oddness. Close
relationships are limited in both schizotypal personality disorder and
avoidant personality disorder; however, in avoidant personality disorder
an active desire for relationships is constrained by a fear of
rejection, whereas in schizotypal personality disorder there is a lack
of desire for relationships and persistent detachment. Individuals with
narcissistic personality disorder may also display suspiciousness,
social withdrawal, or alienation, but in

narcissistic personality disorder these qualities derive primarily from
fears of having imperfections or flaws revealed. Individuals with
borderline personality disorder may also have transient, psychotic-like
symptoms, but these are usually more closely related to affective shifts
in response to stress (e.g., intense anger, anxiety, disappointment) and
are usually more dissociative (e.g., derealization, depersonalization).
In contrast, individuals with schizotypal personality disorder are more
likely to have enduring psychotic-like symptoms that may worsen under
stress but are less likely to be invariably associated with pronounced
affective symptoms. Although social isolation may occur in borderline
personality disorder, it is usually secondary to repeated interpersonal
failures due to angry outbursts and frequent mood shifts, rather than a
result of a persistent lack of social contacts and desire for intimacy.
Furthermore, individuals with schizotypal personality disorder do not
usually demonstrate the impulsive or manipulative behaviors of the
individual with borderline personality disorder. However, there is a
high rate of co-occurrence between the two disorders, so that making
such distinctions is not always feasible. Schizotypal features during
adolescence may be reflective of transient emotional turmoil, rather
than an enduring personality disorder.

Cluster B Personality Disorders Antisocial Personality Disorder
Diagnostic Criteria

301.7 (F60.2)

a. A pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of
others, occurring since age 15 years, as indicated by three (or more) of
the following: 1. Failure to conform to social norms with respect to
lawful behaviors, as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are
grounds for arrest. 2. Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying,
use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure. 3.
Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead. 4. Irritability and
aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assaults. 5.
Reckless disregard for safety of self or others. 6. Consistent
irresponsibility, as indicated by repeated failure to sustain consistent
work behavior or honor financial obligations. 7. Lack of remorse, as
indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt,
mistreated, or stolen from another. b. The individual is at least age 18
years. c. There is evidence of conduct disorder with onset before age 15
years. d. The occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively
during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of antisocial personality
disorder is a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the
rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and
continues into adulthood. This pattern has also been referred to as
psychopathy, sociopathy, or dyssocial personality disorder. Because
deceit and manipulation are central features of antisocial personality
disorder, it may be especially helpful to integrate information acquired
from systematic clinical assessment with information collected from
collateral sources. For this diagnosis to be given, the individual must
be at least age 18 years (Criterion B) and must have had a history of
some symptoms of conduct

disorder before age 15 years (Criterion C). Conduct disorder involves a
repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights
of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated.
The specific behaviors characteristic of conduct disorder fall into one
of four categories: aggression to people and animals, destruction of
property, deceitfulness or theft, or serious violation of rules. The
pattern of antisocial behavior continues into adulthood. Individuals
with antisocial personality disorder fail to conform to social norms
with respect to lawful behavior (Criterion A1). They may repeatedly
perform acts that are grounds for arrest (whether they are arrested or
not), such as destroying property, harassing others, stealing, or
pursuing illegal occupations. Persons with this disorder disregard the
wishes, rights, or feelings of others. They are frequently deceitful and
manipulative in order to gain personal profit or pleasure (e.g., to
obtain money, sex, or power) (Criterion A2). They may repeatedly lie,
use an alias, con others, or malinger. A pattern of impulsivity may be
manifested by a failure to plan ahead (Criterion A3). Decisions are made
on the spur of the moment, without forethought and without consideration
for the consequences to self or others; this may lead to sudden changes
of jobs, residences, or relationships. Individuals with antisocial
personality disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and may
repeatedly get into physical fights or commit acts of physical assault
(including spouse beating or child beating) (Criterion A4). (Aggressive
acts that are required to defend oneself or someone else are not
considered to be evidence for this item.) These individuals also display
a reckless disregard for the safety of themselves or others (Criterion
A5). This may be evidenced in their driving behavior (i.e., recurrent
speeding, driving while intoxicated, multiple accidents). They may
engage in sexual behavior or substance use that has a high risk for
harmful consequences. They may neglect or fail to care for a child in a
way that puts the child in danger. Individuals with antisocial
personality disorder also tend to be consistently and extremely
irresponsible (Criterion A6). Irresponsible work behavior may be
indicated by significant periods of unemployment despite available job
opportunities, or by abandonment of several jobs without a realistic
plan for getting another job. There may also be a pattern of repeated
absences from work that are not explained by illness either in
themselves or in their family. Financial irresponsibility is indicated
by acts

such as defaulting on debts, failing to provide child support, or
failing to support other dependents on a regular basis. Individuals with
antisocial personality disorder show little remorse for the consequences
of their acts (Criterion A7). They may be indifferent to, or provide a
superficial rationalization for, having hurt, mistreated, or stolen from
someone (e.g., "life's unfair," "losers deserve to lose"). These
individuals may blame the victims for being foolish, helpless, or
deserving their fate (e.g., "he had it coming anyway"); they may
minimize the harmful consequences of their actions; or they may simply
indicate complete indifference. They generally fail to compensate or
make amends for their behavior. They may believe that everyone is out to
"help number one" and that one should stop at nothing to avoid being
pushed around. The antisocial behavior must not occur exclusively during
the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (Criterion D).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with antisocial
personality disorder frequently lack empathy and tend to be callous,
cynical, and contemptuous of the feelings, rights, and sufferings of
others. They may have an inflated and arrogant self-appraisal (e.g.,
feel that ordinary work is beneath them or lack a realistic concern
about their current problems or their future) and may be excessively
opinionated, self-assured, or cocky. They may display a glib,
superficial charm and can be quite voluble and verbally facile (e.g.,
using technical terms or jargon that might impress someone who is
unfamiliar with the topic). Lack of empathy, inflated self-appraisal,
and superficial charm are features that have been commonly included in
traditional conceptions of psychopathy that may be particularly
distinguishing of the disorder and more predictive of recidivism in
prison or forensic settings, where criminal, delinquent, or aggressive
acts are likely to be nonspecific. These individuals may also be
irresponsible and exploitative in their sexual relationships. They may
have a history of many sexual partners and may never have sustained a
monogamous relationship. They may be irresponsible as parents, as
evidenced by malnutrition of a child, an illness in the child resulting
from a lack of minimal hygiene, a child's dependence on neighbors or
nonresident relatives for food or shelter, a failure to arrange for a
caretaker for a young child when the individual is away from home, or
repeated squandering of money required for household necessities. These

individuals may receive dishonorable discharges from the armed services,
may fail to be self-supporting, may become impoverished or even
homeless, or may spend many years in penal institutions. Individuals
with antisocial personality disorder are more likely than people in the
general population to die prematurely by violent means (e.g., suicide,
accidents, homicides). Individuals with antisocial personality disorder
may also experience dysphoria, including complaints of tension,
inability to tolerate boredom, and depressed mood. They may have
associated anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use
disorders, somatic symptom disorder, gambling disorder, and other
disorders of impulse control. Individuals with antisocial personality
disorder also often have personality features that meet criteria for
other personality disorders, particularly borderline, histrionic, and
narcissistic personality disorders. The likelihood of developing
antisocial personality disorder in adult life is increased if the
individual experienced childhood onset of conduct disorder (before age
10 years) and accompanying attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
Child abuse or neglect, unstable or erratic parenting, or inconsistent
parental discipline may increase the likelihood that conduct disorder
will evolve into antisocial personality disorder.

Prevalence Twelve-month prevalence rates of antisocial personality
disorder, using criteria from previous DSMs, are between 0.2% and 3.3%2,
3, 5. The highest prevalence of antisocial personality disorder (greater
than 70%) is among most severe samples of males with alcohol use
disorder1 and from substance abuse clinics, prisons, or other forensic
settings4. Prevalence is higher in samples affected by adverse
socioeconomic (i.e., poverty) or sociocultural (i.e., migration)
factors.

Development and Course Antisocial personality disorder has a chronic
course but may become less evident or remit as the individual grows
older, particularly by the fourth decade of life. Although this
remission tends to be particularly evident with respect to engaging in
criminal behavior, there is likely to be a decrease in

the full spectrum of antisocial behaviors and substance use. By
definition, antisocial personality cannot be diagnosed before age 18
years.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Antisocial
personality disorder is more common among the first-degree biological
relatives of those with the disorder than in the general population. The
risk to biological relatives of females with the disorder tends to be
higher than the risk to biological relatives of males with the disorder.
Biological relatives of individuals with this disorder are also at
increased risk for somatic symptom disorder and substance use disorders.
Within a family that has a member with antisocial personality disorder,
males more often have antisocial personality disorder and substance use
disorders, whereas females more often have somatic symptom disorder.
However, in such families, there is an increase in prevalence of all of
these disorders in both males and females compared with the general
population. Adoption studies indicate that both genetic and
environmental factors contribute to the risk of developing antisocial
personality disorder. Both adopted and biological children of parents
with antisocial personality disorder have an increased risk of
developing antisocial personality disorder, somatic symptom disorder,
and substance use disorders. Adopted-away children resemble their
biological parents more than their adoptive parents, but the adoptive
family environment influences the risk of developing a personality
disorder and related psychopathology.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Antisocial personality disorder
appears to be associated with low socioeconomic status and urban
settings. Concerns have been raised that the diagnosis may at times be
misapplied to individuals in settings in which seemingly antisocial
behavior may be part of a protective survival strategy. In assessing
antisocial traits, it is helpful for the clinician to consider the
social and economic context in which the behaviors occur.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Antisocial personality disorder is much
more common in males than in females. There has been some concern that
antisocial personality disorder

may be underdiagnosed in females, particularly because of the emphasis
on aggressive items in the definition of conduct disorder.

Differential Diagnosis The diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder
is not given to individuals younger than 18 years and is given only if
there is a history of some symptoms of conduct disorder before age 15
years. For individuals older than 18 years, a diagnosis of conduct
disorder is given only if the criteria for antisocial personality
disorder are not met. Substance use disorders. When antisocial behavior
in an adult is associated with a substance use disorder, the diagnosis
of antisocial personality disorder is not made unless the signs of
antisocial personality disorder were also present in childhood and have
continued into adulthood. When substance use and antisocial behavior
both began in childhood and continued into adulthood, both a substance
use disorder and antisocial personality disorder should be diagnosed if
the criteria for both are met, even though some antisocial acts may be a
consequence of the substance use disorder (e.g., illegal selling of
drugs, thefts to obtain money for drugs). Schizophrenia and bipolar
disorders. Antisocial behavior that occurs exclusively during the course
of schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder should not be diagnosed as
antisocial personality disorder. Other personality disorders. Other
personality disorders may be confused with antisocial personality
disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore
important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in
their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in
addition to antisocial personality disorder, all can be diagnosed.
Individuals with antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic
personality disorder share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib,
superficial, exploitative, and lack empathy. However, narcissistic
personality disorder does not include characteristics of impulsivity,
aggression, and deceit. In addition, individuals with antisocial
personality disorder may not be as needy of the admiration and envy of
others, and persons with narcissistic personality disorder usually lack
the history of conduct disorder in childhood or criminal behavior in
adulthood. Individuals with antisocial personality disorder and
histrionic personality disorder share a tendency to

be impulsive, superficial, excitement seeking, reckless, seductive, and
manipulative, but persons with histrionic personality disorder tend to
be more exaggerated in their emotions and do not characteristically
engage in antisocial behaviors. Individuals with histrionic and
borderline personality disorders are manipulative to gain nurturance,
whereas those with antisocial personality disorder are manipulative to
gain profit, power, or some other material gratification. Individuals
with antisocial personality disorder tend to be less emotionally
unstable and more aggressive than those with borderline personality
disorder. Although antisocial behavior may be present in some
individuals with paranoid personality disorder, it is not usually
motivated by a desire for personal gain or to exploit others as in
antisocial personality disorder, but rather is more often attributable
to a desire for revenge. Criminal behavior not associated with a
personality disorder. Antisocial personality disorder must be
distinguished from criminal behavior undertaken for gain that is not
accompanied by the personality features characteristic of this disorder.
Only when antisocial personality traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and
persistent and cause significant functional impairment or subjective
distress do they constitute antisocial personality disorder.

Borderline Personality Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

301.83 (F60.3)

A pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships,
self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity, beginning by early
adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or
more) of the following: 1. Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined
abandonment. (Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior
covered in Criterion 5.) 2. A pattern of unstable and intense
interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between
extremes of idealization and devaluation. 3. Identity disturbance:
markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self. 4.
Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging
(e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating).
(Note: Do not include suicidal or self-mutilating behavior covered in
Criterion 5.) 5. Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or
self-mutilating behavior. 6. Affective instability due to a marked
reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or
anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few
days). 7. Chronic feelings of emptiness. 8. Inappropriate, intense anger
or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper,
constant anger, recurrent physical fights). 9. Transient, stress-related
paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of borderline personality disorder is a pervasive
pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and
affects, and marked impulsivity that begins by early adulthood and is
present in a variety of contexts. Individuals with borderline
personality disorder make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined
abandonment (Criterion 1). The perception of impending separation or
rejection, or the loss of external structure, can lead to profound
changes in self-image, affect, cognition, and behavior. These
individuals are very sensitive to environmental circumstances. They
experience intense abandonment fears and inappropriate anger even when
faced with a realistic time-limited separation or when there are
unavoidable changes in plans (e.g., sudden despair in reaction to a
clinician's announcing the end of the hour; panic or fury when someone
important to them is just a few minutes late or must cancel an
appointment). They may believe that this "abandonment" implies they are
"bad." These abandonment fears are related to an intolerance of being
alone and a need to have other people with them. Their frantic efforts
to avoid abandonment may include impulsive actions such as
self-mutilating or suicidal behaviors, which are described separately in
Criterion 5. Individuals with borderline personality disorder have a
pattern of unstable and intense relationships (Criterion 2). They may
idealize potential caregivers or lovers at the first or second meeting,
demand to spend a lot of time together, and share the most intimate
details early in a relationship. However, they may switch quickly from
idealizing other people to devaluing them, feeling that the other person
does not care enough, does not give enough, or is not "there" enough.
These individuals can empathize with and nurture other people, but only
with the expectation that the other person will "be there" in return to
meet their own needs on demand. These individuals are prone to sudden
and dramatic shifts in their view of others, who may alternatively be
seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive. Such shifts often
reflect disillusionment with a caregiver whose nurturing qualities had
been idealized or whose rejection or abandonment is expected. There may
be an identity disturbance characterized by markedly and persistently
unstable self-image or sense of self (Criterion 3). There are sudden and
dramatic shifts in self-image, characterized by shifting goals, values,
and vocational aspirations. There may be sudden changes in opinions and
plans about career, sexual identity, values, and types of

friends. These individuals may suddenly change from the role of a needy
supplicant for help to that of a righteous avenger of past mistreatment.
Although they usually have a self-image that is based on being bad or
evil, individuals with this disorder may at times have feelings that
they do not exist at all. Such experiences usually occur in situations
in which the individual feels a lack of a meaningful relationship,
nurturing, and support. These individuals may show worse performance in
unstructured work or school situations. Individuals with borderline
personality disorder display impulsivity in at least two areas that are
potentially self-damaging (Criterion 4). They may gamble, spend money
irresponsibly, binge eat, abuse substances, engage in unsafe sex, or
drive recklessly. Individuals with this disorder display recurrent
suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior
(Criterion 5). Completed suicide occurs in 8%--10% of such individuals,
and self-mutilative acts (e.g., cutting or burning) and suicide threats
and attempts are very common. Recurrent suicidality is often the reason
that these individuals present for help. These self-destructive acts are
usually precipitated by threats of separation or rejection or by
expectations that the individual assumes increased responsibility.
Self-mutilation may occur during dissociative experiences and often
brings relief by reaffirming the ability to feel or by expiating the
individual's sense of being evil. Individuals with borderline
personality disorder may display affective instability that is due to a
marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria,
irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely
more than a few days) (Criterion 6). The basic dysphoric mood of those
with borderline personality disorder is often disrupted by periods of
anger, panic, or despair and is rarely relieved by periods of well-being
or satisfaction. These episodes may reflect the individual's extreme
reactivity to interpersonal stresses. Individuals with borderline
personality disorder may be troubled by chronic feelings of emptiness
(Criterion 7). Easily bored, they may constantly seek something to do.
Individuals with this disorder frequently express inappropriate, intense
anger or have difficulty controlling their anger (Criterion 8). They may
display extreme sarcasm, enduring bitterness, or verbal outbursts. The
anger is often elicited when a caregiver or lover is seen as neglectful,
withholding, uncaring, or abandoning. Such expressions of anger are
often followed by shame and guilt and contribute to the feeling they
have of being evil. During periods of

extreme stress, transient paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms
(e.g., depersonalization) may occur (Criterion 9), but these are
generally of insufficient severity or duration to warrant an additional
diagnosis. These episodes occur most frequently in response to a real or
imagined abandonment. Symptoms tend to be transient, lasting minutes or
hours. The real or perceived return of the caregiver's nurturance may
result in a remission of symptoms.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with borderline
personality disorder may have a pattern of undermining themselves at the
moment a goal is about to be realized (e.g., dropping out of school just
before graduation; regressing severely after a discussion of how well
therapy is going; destroying a good relationship just when it is clear
that the relationship could last). Some individuals develop
psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, body-image distortions,
ideas of reference, hypnagogic phenomena) during times of stress.
Individuals with this disorder may feel more secure with transitional
objects (i.e., a pet or inanimate possession) than in interpersonal
relationships. Premature death from suicide may occur in individuals
with this disorder, especially in those with co-occurring depressive
disorders or substance use disorders. Physical handicaps may result from
self-inflicted abuse behaviors or failed suicide attempts. Recurrent job
losses, interrupted education, and separation or divorce are common.
Physical and sexual abuse, neglect, hostile conflict, and early parental
loss are more common in the childhood histories of those with borderline
personality disorder. Common co-occurring disorders include depressive
and bipolar disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders
(notably bulimia nervosa), posttraumatic stress disorder, and
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Borderline personality
disorder also frequently co-occurs with the other personality disorders.

Prevalence The median population prevalence of borderline personality
disorder is estimated to be 1.6%5 but may be as high as 5.9%1. The
prevalence of borderline personality disorder is about 6% in primary
care settings, about 10% among individuals seen in outpatient mental
health clinics, and about

20% among psychiatric inpatients2, 3. The prevalence of borderline
personality disorder may decrease in older age groups4.

Development and Course There is considerable variability in the course
of borderline personality disorder. The most common pattern is one of
chronic instability in early adulthood, with episodes of serious
affective and impulsive dyscontrol and high levels of use of health and
mental health resources. The impairment from the disorder and the risk
of suicide are greatest in the young-adult years and gradually wane with
advancing age. Although the tendency toward intense emotions,
impulsivity, and intensity in relationships is often lifelong,
individuals who engage in therapeutic intervention often show
improvement beginning sometime during the first year. During their 30s
and 40s, the majority of individuals with this disorder attain greater
stability in their relationships and vocational functioning. Follow-up
studies of individuals identified through outpatient mental health
clinics indicate that after about 10 years, as many as half of the
individuals no longer have a pattern of behavior that meets full
criteria for borderline personality disorder.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Borderline
personality disorder is about five times more common among first-degree
biological relatives of those with the disorder than in the general
population. There is also an increased familial risk for substance use
disorders, antisocial personality disorder, and depressive or bipolar
disorders.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The pattern of behavior seen in
borderline personality disorder has been identified in many settings
around the world. Adolescents and young adults with identity problems
(especially when accompanied by substance use) may transiently display
behaviors that misleadingly give the impression of borderline
personality disorder. Such situations are characterized by emotional
instability, "existential" dilemmas, uncertainty, anxietyprovoking
choices, conflicts about sexual orientation, and competing social
pressures to decide on careers.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Borderline personality disorder is
diagnosed predominantly (about 75%) in females.

Differential Diagnosis Depressive and bipolar disorders. Borderline
personality disorder often co-occurs with depressive or bipolar
disorders, and when criteria for both are met, both may be diagnosed.
Because the cross-sectional presentation of borderline personality
disorder can be mimicked by an episode of depressive or bipolar
disorder, the clinician should avoid giving an additional diagnosis of
borderline personality disorder based only on crosssectional
presentation without having documented that the pattern of behavior had
an early onset and a long-standing course. Other personality disorders.
Other personality disorders may be confused with borderline personality
disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore
important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in
their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in
addition to borderline personality disorder, all can be diagnosed.
Although histrionic personality disorder can also be characterized by
attention seeking, manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions,
borderline personality disorder is distinguished by selfdestructiveness,
angry disruptions in close relationships, and chronic feelings of deep
emptiness and loneliness. Paranoid ideas or illusions may be present in
both borderline personality disorder and schizotypal personality
disorder, but these symptoms are more transient, interpersonally
reactive, and responsive to external structuring in borderline
personality disorder. Although paranoid personality disorder and
narcissistic personality disorder may also be characterized by an angry
reaction to minor stimuli, the relative stability of self-image, as well
as the relative lack of self-destructiveness, impulsivity, and
abandonment concerns, distinguishes these disorders from borderline
personality disorder. Although antisocial personality disorder and
borderline personality disorder are both characterized by manipulative
behavior, individuals with antisocial personality disorder are
manipulative to gain profit, power, or some other material
gratification, whereas the goal in borderline personality disorder is

directed more toward gaining the concern of caretakers. Both dependent
personality disorder and borderline personality disorder are
characterized by fear of abandonment; however, the individual with
borderline personality disorder reacts to abandonment with feelings of
emotional emptiness, rage, and demands, whereas the individual with
dependent personality disorder reacts with increasing appeasement and
submissiveness and urgently seeks a replacement relationship to provide
caregiving and support. Borderline personality disorder can further be
distinguished from dependent personality disorder by the typical pattern
of unstable and intense relationships. Personality change due to another
medical condition. Borderline personality disorder must be distinguished
from personality change due to another medical condition, in which the
traits that emerge are attributable to the effects of another medical
condition on the central nervous system. Substance use disorders.
Borderline personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms
that may develop in association with persistent substance use. Identity
problems. Borderline personality disorder should be distinguished from
an identity problem, which is reserved for identity concerns related to
a developmental phase (e.g., adolescence) and does not qualify as a
mental disorder.

Histrionic Personality Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

301.50 (F60.4)

A pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking,
beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as
indicated by five (or more) of the following: 1. Is uncomfortable in
situations in which he or she is not the center of attention. 2.
Interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually
seductive or provocative behavior. 3. Displays rapidly shifting and
shallow expression of emotions. 4. Consistently uses physical appearance
to draw attention to self. 5. Has a style of speech that is excessively
impressionistic and lacking in detail. 6. Shows self-dramatization,
theatricality, and exaggerated expression of emotion. 7. Is suggestible
(i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances). 8. Considers
relationships to be more intimate than they actually are.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of histrionic personality
disorder is pervasive and excessive emotionality and attention-seeking
behavior. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present in a
variety of contexts. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder
are uncomfortable or feel unappreciated when they are not the center of
attention (Criterion 1). Often lively and dramatic, they tend to draw
attention to themselves and may initially charm new acquaintances by
their enthusiasm, apparent openness, or flirtatiousness. These qualities
wear thin, however, as these individuals continually demand to be the
center of attention. They commandeer the role

of "the life of the party." If they are not the center of attention,
they may do something dramatic (e.g., make up stories, create a scene)
to draw the focus of attention to themselves. This need is often
apparent in their behavior with a clinician (e.g., being flattering,
bringing gifts, providing dramatic descriptions of physical and
psychological symptoms that are replaced by new symptoms each visit).
The appearance and behavior of individuals with this disorder are often
inappropriately sexually provocative or seductive (Criterion 2). This
behavior not only is directed toward persons in whom the individual has
a sexual or romantic interest but also occurs in a wide variety of
social, occupational, and professional relationships beyond what is
appropriate for the social context. Emotional expression may be shallow
and rapidly shifting (Criterion 3). Individuals with this disorder
consistently use physical appearance to draw attention to themselves
(Criterion 4). They are overly concerned with impressing others by their
appearance and expend an excessive amount of time, energy, and money on
clothes and grooming. They may "fish for compliments" regarding
appearance and may be easily and excessively upset by a critical comment
about how they look or by a photograph that they regard as unflattering.
These individuals have a style of speech that is excessively
impressionistic and lacking in detail (Criterion 5). Strong opinions are
expressed with dramatic flair, but underlying reasons are usually vague
and diffuse, without supporting facts and details. For example, an
individual with histrionic personality disorder may comment that a
certain individual is a wonderful human being, yet be unable to provide
any specific examples of good qualities to support this opinion.
Individuals with this disorder are characterized by self-dramatization,
theatricality, and an exaggerated expression of emotion (Criterion 6).
They may embarrass friends and acquaintances by an excessive public
display of emotions (e.g., embracing casual acquaintances with excessive
ardor, sobbing uncontrollably on minor sentimental occasions, having
temper tantrums). However, their emotions often seem to be turned on and
off too quickly to be deeply felt, which may lead others to accuse the
individual of faking these feelings. Individuals with histrionic
personality disorder have a high degree of suggestibility (Criterion 7).
Their opinions and feelings are easily influenced by others and by
current fads. They may be overly trusting, especially of strong
authority figures whom they see as magically solving

their problems. They have a tendency to play hunches and to adopt
convictions quickly. Individuals with this disorder often consider
relationships more intimate than they actually are, describing almost
every acquaintance as "my dear, dear friend" or referring to physicians
met only once or twice under professional circumstances by their first
names (Criterion 8).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with histrionic
personality disorder may have difficulty achieving emotional intimacy in
romantic or sexual relationships. Without being aware of it, they often
act out a role (e.g., "victim" or "princess") in their relationships to
others. They may seek to control their partner through emotional
manipulation or seductiveness on one level, while displaying a marked
dependency on them at another level. Individuals with this disorder
often have impaired relationships with same-sex friends because their
sexually provocative interpersonal style may seem a threat to their
friends' relationships. These individuals may also alienate friends with
demands for constant attention. They often become depressed and upset
when they are not the center of attention. They may crave novelty,
stimulation, and excitement and have a tendency to become bored with
their usual routine. These individuals are often intolerant of, or
frustrated by, situations that involve delayed gratification, and their
actions are often directed at obtaining immediate satisfaction. Although
they often initiate a job or project with great enthusiasm, their
interest may lag quickly. Longer-term relationships may be neglected to
make way for the excitement of new relationships. The actual risk of
suicide is not known, but clinical experience suggests that individuals
with this disorder are at increased risk for suicidal gestures and
threats to get attention and coerce better caregiving. Histrionic
personality disorder has been associated with higher rates of somatic
symptom disorder, conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom
disorder), and major depressive disorder. Borderline, narcissistic,
antisocial, and dependent personality disorders often co-occur.

Prevalence Data from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on
Alcohol and Related Conditions suggest a prevalence of histrionic
personality of

1.84%1.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Norms for interpersonal behavior,
personal appearance, and emotional expressiveness vary widely across
cultures, genders, and age groups. Before considering the various traits
(e.g., emotionality, seductiveness, dramatic interpersonal style,
novelty seeking, sociability, charm, impressionability, a tendency to
somatization) to be evidence of histrionic personality disorder, it is
important to evaluate whether they cause clinically significant
impairment or distress.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues In clinical settings, this disorder has
been diagnosed more frequently in females; however, the sex ratio is not
significantly different from the sex ratio of females within the
respective clinical setting. In contrast, some studies using structured
assessments report similar prevalence rates among males and females.

Differential Diagnosis Other personality disorders and personality
traits. Other personality disorders may be confused with histrionic
personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is
therefore important to distinguish among these disorders based on
differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual
has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality
disorders in addition to histrionic personality disorder, all can be
diagnosed. Although borderline personality disorder can also be
characterized by attention seeking, manipulative behavior, and rapidly
shifting emotions, it is distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry
disruptions in close relationships, and chronic feelings of deep
emptiness and identity disturbance. Individuals with antisocial
personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder share a
tendency to be impulsive, superficial, excitement seeking, reckless,
seductive, and manipulative, but persons with histrionic personality
disorder tend to be more exaggerated in their emotions and do not
characteristically engage in antisocial behaviors. Individuals with
histrionic personality disorder are manipulative to gain nurturance,
whereas those with antisocial personality disorder are

manipulative to gain profit, power, or some other material
gratification. Although individuals with narcissistic personality
disorder also crave attention from others, they usually want praise for
their "superiority," whereas individuals with histrionic personality
disorder are willing to be viewed as fragile or dependent if this is
instrumental in getting attention. Individuals with narcissistic
personality disorder may exaggerate the intimacy of their relationships
with other people, but they are more apt to emphasize the "VIP" status
or wealth of their friends. In dependent personality disorder, the
individual is excessively dependent on others for praise and guidance,
but is without the flamboyant, exaggerated, emotional features of
individuals with histrionic personality disorder. Many individuals may
display histrionic personality traits. Only when these traits are
inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional
impairment or subjective distress do they constitute histrionic
personality disorder. Personality change due to another medical
condition. Histrionic personality disorder must be distinguished from
personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits
that emerge are attributable to the effects of another medical condition
on the central nervous system. Substance use disorders. The disorder
must also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in association
with persistent substance use.

Narcissistic Personality Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

301.81 (F60.81)

A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for
admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and
present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the
following:

1. Has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates
achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without
commensurate achievements). 2. Is preoccupied with fantasies of
unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love. 3. Believes
that he or she is "special" and unique and can only be understood by, or
should associate with, other special or high-status people (or
institutions). 4. Requires excessive admiration. 5. Has a sense of
entitlement (i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable
treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations). 6. Is
interpersonally exploitative (i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve
his or her own ends). 7. Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or
identify with the feelings and needs of others. 8. Is often envious of
others or believes that others are envious of him or her. 9. Shows
arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of narcissistic personality
disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and
lack of empathy that begins by early adulthood and is present in a
variety of contexts. Individuals with this disorder have a grandiose
sense of self-importance (Criterion 1). They routinely overestimate
their abilities and inflate their accomplishments, often appearing
boastful and pretentious. They may blithely assume that others attribute
the same value to their efforts and may be surprised when the praise
they expect and feel they deserve is not forthcoming. Often implicit in
the inflated judgments of their own accomplishments is an
underestimation (devaluation) of the contributions of others.
Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder are often preoccupied
with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty,

or ideal love (Criterion 2). They may ruminate about "long overdue"
admiration and privilege and compare themselves favorably with famous or
privileged people. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder
believe that they are superior, special, or unique and expect others to
recognize them as such (Criterion 3). They may feel that they can only
be understood by, and should only associate with, other people who are
special or of high status and may attribute "unique," "perfect," or
"gifted" qualities to those with whom they associate. Individuals with
this disorder believe that their needs are special and beyond the ken of
ordinary people. Their own self-esteem is enhanced (i.e., "mirrored") by
the idealized value that they assign to those with whom they associate.
They are likely to insist on having only the "top" person (doctor,
lawyer, hairdresser, instructor) or being affiliated with the "best"
institutions but may devalue the credentials of those who disappoint
them. Individuals with this disorder generally require excessive
admiration (Criterion 4). Their self-esteem is almost invariably very
fragile. They may be preoccupied with how well they are doing and how
favorably they are regarded by others. This often takes the form of a
need for constant attention and admiration. They may expect their
arrival to be greeted with great fanfare and are astonished if others do
not covet their possessions. They may constantly fish for compliments,
often with great charm. A sense of entitlement is evident in these
individuals' unreasonable expectation of especially favorable treatment
(Criterion 5). They expect to be catered to and are puzzled or furious
when this does not happen. For example, they may assume that they do not
have to wait in line and that their priorities are so important that
others should defer to them, and then get irritated when others fail to
assist "in their very important work." This sense of entitlement,
combined with a lack of sensitivity to the wants and needs of others,
may result in the conscious or unwitting exploitation of others
(Criterion 6). They expect to be given whatever they want or feel they
need, no matter what it might mean to others. For example, these
individuals may expect great dedication from others and may overwork
them without regard for the impact on their lives. They tend to form
friendships or romantic relationships only if the other person seems
likely to advance their purposes or otherwise enhance their self-esteem.
They often usurp special privileges

and extra resources that they believe they deserve because they are so
special. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder generally
have a lack of empathy and have difficulty recognizing the desires,
subjective experiences, and feelings of others (Criterion 7). They may
assume that others are totally concerned about their welfare. They tend
to discuss their own concerns in inappropriate and lengthy detail, while
failing to recognize that others also have feelings and needs. They are
often contemptuous and impatient with others who talk about their own
problems and concerns. These individuals may be oblivious to the hurt
their remarks may inflict (e.g., exuberantly telling a former lover that
"I am now in the relationship of a lifetime!"; boasting of health in
front of someone who is sick). When recognized, the needs, desires, or
feelings of others are likely to be viewed disparagingly as signs of
weakness or vulnerability. Those who relate to individuals with
narcissistic personality disorder typically find an emotional coldness
and lack of reciprocal interest. These individuals are often envious of
others or believe that others are envious of them (Criterion 8). They
may begrudge others their successes or possessions, feeling that they
better deserve those achievements, admiration, or privileges. They may
harshly devalue the contributions of others, particularly when those
individuals have received acknowledgment or praise for their
accomplishments. Arrogant, haughty behaviors characterize these
individuals; they often display snobbish, disdainful, or patronizing
attitudes (Criterion 9). For example, an individual with this disorder
may complain about a clumsy waiter's "rudeness" or "stupidity" or
conclude a medical evaluation with a condescending evaluation of the
physician.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Vulnerability in self-esteem
makes individuals with narcissistic personality disorder very sensitive
to "injury" from criticism or defeat. Although they may not show it
outwardly, criticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them
feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow, and empty. They may react with
disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack. Such experiences often lead to
social withdrawal or an appearance of humility that may mask and protect
the grandiosity. Interpersonal relations are typically impaired because
of problems derived from entitlement, the need for admiration, and

the relative disregard for the sensitivities of others. Though
overweening ambition and confidence may lead to high achievement,
performance may be disrupted because of intolerance of criticism or
defeat. Sometimes vocational functioning can be very low, reflecting an
unwillingness to take a risk in competitive or other situations in which
defeat is possible. Sustained feelings of shame or humiliation and the
attendant self-criticism may be associated with social withdrawal,
depressed mood, and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) or major
depressive disorder. In contrast, sustained periods of grandiosity may
be associated with a hypomanic mood. Narcissistic personality disorder
is also associated with anorexia nervosa and substance use disorders
(especially related to cocaine). Histrionic, borderline, antisocial, and
paranoid personality disorders may be associated with narcissistic
personality disorder.

Prevalence Prevalence estimates for narcissistic personality disorder,
based on DSM-IV definitions, range from 0% to 6.2% in community
samples1.

Development and Course Narcissistic traits may be particularly common in
adolescents and do not necessarily indicate that the individual will go
on to have narcissistic personality disorder. Individuals with
narcissistic personality disorder may have special difficulties
adjusting to the onset of physical and occupational limitations that are
inherent in the aging process.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Of those diagnosed with narcissistic
personality disorder, 50%--75% are male.

Differential Diagnosis Other personality disorders and personality
traits. Other personality disorders may be confused with narcissistic
personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It
is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on
differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual
has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality
disorders in addition to

narcissistic personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. The most useful
feature in discriminating narcissistic personality disorder from
histrionic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders, in which
the interactive styles are coquettish, callous, and needy, respectively,
is the grandiosity characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder.
The relative stability of self-image as well as the relative lack of
self-destructiveness, impulsivity, and abandonment concerns also help
distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from borderline
personality disorder. Excessive pride in achievements, a relative lack
of emotional display, and disdain for others' sensitivities help
distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from histrionic
personality disorder. Although individuals with borderline, histrionic,
and narcissistic personality disorders may require much attention, those
with narcissistic personality disorder specifically need that attention
to be admiring. Individuals with antisocial and narcissistic personality
disorders share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib, superficial,
exploitative, and unempathic. However, narcissistic personality disorder
does not necessarily include characteristics of impulsivity, aggression,
and deceit. In addition, individuals with antisocial personality
disorder may not be as needy of the admiration and envy of others, and
persons with narcissistic personality disorder usually lack the history
of conduct disorder in childhood or criminal behavior in adulthood. In
both narcissistic personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder, the individual may profess a commitment to
perfectionism and believe that others cannot do things as well. In
contrast to the accompanying self-criticism of those with
obsessivecompulsive personality disorder, individuals with narcissistic
personality disorder are more likely to believe that they have achieved
perfection. Suspiciousness and social withdrawal usually distinguish
those with schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder from those with
narcissistic personality disorder. When these qualities are present in
individuals with narcissistic personality disorder, they derive
primarily from fears of having imperfections or flaws revealed. Many
highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be
considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible,
maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment
or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic personality
disorder. Mania or hypomania. Grandiosity may emerge as part of manic or
hypomanic episodes, but the association with mood change or functional

impairments helps distinguish these episodes from narcissistic
personality disorder. Substance use disorders. Narcissistic personality
disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in
association with persistent substance use.

Cluster C Personality Disorders Avoidant Personality Disorder Diagnostic
Criteria

301.82 (F60.6)

A pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and
hypersensitivity to negative evaluation, beginning by early adulthood
and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of
the following: 1. Avoids occupational activities that involve
significant interpersonal contact because of fears of criticism,
disapproval, or rejection. 2. Is unwilling to get involved with people
unless certain of being liked. 3. Shows restraint within intimate
relationships because of the fear of being shamed or ridiculed. 4. Is
preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations. 5.
Is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of
inadequacy. 6. Views self as socially inept, personally unappealing, or
inferior to others.

7. Is unusually reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any new
activities because they may prove embarrassing.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of avoidant personality
disorder is a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of
inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation that begins by
early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts. Individuals
with avoidant personality disorder avoid work activities that involve
significant interpersonal contact because of fears of criticism,
disapproval, or rejection (Criterion 1). Offers of job promotions may be
declined because the new responsibilities might result in criticism from
coworkers. These individuals avoid making new friends unless they are
certain they will be liked and accepted without criticism (Criterion 2).
Until they pass stringent tests proving the contrary, other people are
assumed to be critical and disapproving. Individuals with this disorder
will not join in group activities unless there are repeated and generous
offers of support and nurturance. Interpersonal intimacy is often
difficult for these individuals, although they are able to establish
intimate relationships when there is assurance of uncritical acceptance.
They may act with restraint, have difficulty talking about themselves,
and withhold intimate feelings for fear of being exposed, ridiculed, or
shamed (Criterion 3). Because individuals with this disorder are
preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations, they
may have a markedly low threshold for detecting such reactions
(Criterion 4). If someone is even slightly disapproving or critical,
they may feel extremely hurt. They tend to be shy, quiet, inhibited, and
"invisible" because of the fear that any attention would be degrading or
rejecting. They expect that no matter what they say, others will see it
as "wrong," and so they may say nothing at all. They react strongly to
subtle cues that are suggestive of mockery or derision. Despite their
longing to be active participants in social life, they fear placing
their welfare in the hands of others. Individuals with avoidant
personality disorder are inhibited in new interpersonal situations
because they feel inadequate and have low self-esteem (Criterion 5).
Doubts concerning social competence and personal appeal become
especially

manifest in settings involving interactions with strangers. These
individuals believe themselves to be socially inept, personally
unappealing, or inferior to others (Criterion 6). They are unusually
reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any new activities
because these may prove embarrassing (Criterion 7). They are prone to
exaggerate the potential dangers of ordinary situations, and a
restricted lifestyle may result from their need for certainty and
security. Someone with this disorder may cancel a job interview for fear
of being embarrassed by not dressing appropriately. Marginal somatic
symptoms or other problems may become the reason for avoiding new
activities.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with avoidant
personality disorder often vigilantly appraise the movements and
expressions of those with whom they come into contact. Their fearful and
tense demeanor may elicit ridicule and derision from others, which in
turn confirms their self-doubts. These individuals are very anxious
about the possibility that they will react to criticism with blushing or
crying. They are described by others as being "shy," "timid," "lonely,"
and "isolated." The major problems associated with this disorder occur
in social and occupational functioning. The low self-esteem and
hypersensitivity to rejection are associated with restricted
interpersonal contacts. These individuals may become relatively isolated
and usually do not have a large social support network that can help
them weather crises. They desire affection and acceptance and may
fantasize about idealized relationships with others. The avoidant
behaviors can also adversely affect occupational functioning because
these individuals try to avoid the types of social situations that may
be important for meeting the basic demands of the job or for
advancement. Other disorders that are commonly diagnosed with avoidant
personality disorder include depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders,
especially social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Avoidant personality
disorder is often diagnosed with dependent personality disorder, because
individuals with avoidant personality disorder become very attached to
and dependent on those few other people with whom they are friends.
Avoidant personality disorder also tends to be diagnosed with borderline
personality disorder and with the Cluster A personality disorders (i.e.,
paranoid, schizoid, or schizotypal personality disorders).

Prevalence Data from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on
Alcohol and Related Conditions suggest a prevalence of about 2.4% for
avoidant personality disorder1.

Development and Course The avoidant behavior often starts in infancy or
childhood with shyness, isolation, and fear of strangers and new
situations. Although shyness in childhood is a common precursor of
avoidant personality disorder, in most individuals it tends to gradually
dissipate as they get older. In contrast, individuals who go on to
develop avoidant personality disorder may become increasingly shy and
avoidant during adolescence and early adulthood, when social
relationships with new people become especially important. There is some
evidence that in adults, avoidant personality disorder tends to become
less evident or to remit with age. This diagnosis should be used with
great caution in children and adolescents, for whom shy and avoidant
behavior may be developmentally appropriate.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues There may be variation in the degree
to which different cultural and ethnic groups regard diffidence and
avoidance as appropriate. Moreover, avoidant behavior may be the result
of problems in acculturation following immigration.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Avoidant personality disorder appears
to be equally frequent in males and females.

Differential Diagnosis Anxiety disorders. There appears to be a great
deal of overlap between avoidant personality disorder and social anxiety
disorder (social phobia), so much so that they may be alternative
conceptualizations of the same or similar conditions. Avoidance also
characterizes both avoidant personality disorder and agoraphobia, and
they often co-occur.

Other personality disorders and personality traits. Other personality
disorders may be confused with avoidant personality disorder because
they have certain features in common. It is, therefore, important to
distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their
characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in
addition to avoidant personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. Both
avoidant personality disorder and dependent personality disorder are
characterized by feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism,
and a need for reassurance. Although the primary focus of concern in
avoidant personality disorder is avoidance of humiliation and rejection,
in dependent personality disorder the focus is on being taken care of.
However, avoidant personality disorder and dependent personality
disorder are particularly likely to co-occur. Like avoidant personality
disorder, schizoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality
disorder are characterized by social isolation. However, individuals
with avoidant personality disorder want to have relationships with
others and feel their loneliness deeply, whereas those with schizoid or
schizotypal personality disorder may be content with and even prefer
their social isolation. Paranoid personality disorder and avoidant
personality disorder are both characterized by a reluctance to confide
in others. However, in avoidant personality disorder, this reluctance is
attributable more to a fear of being embarrassed or being found
inadequate than to a fear of others' malicious intent. Many individuals
display avoidant personality traits. Only when these traits are
inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional
impairment or subjective distress do they constitute avoidant
personality disorder. Personality change due to another medical
condition. Avoidant personality disorder must be distinguished from
personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits
that emerge are attributable to the effects of another medical condition
on the central nervous system. Substance use disorders. Avoidant
personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may
develop in association with persistent substance use.

Dependent Personality Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

301.6 (F60.7)

A pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to
submissive and clinging behavior and fears of separation, beginning by
early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by
five (or more) of the following: 1. Has difficulty making everyday
decisions without an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from
others. 2. Needs others to assume responsibility for most major areas of
his or her life. 3. Has difficulty expressing disagreement with others
because of fear of loss of support or approval. (Note: Do not include
realistic fears of retribution.) 4. Has difficulty initiating projects
or doing things on his or her own (because of a lack of self-confidence
in judgment or abilities rather than a lack of motivation or energy). 5.
Goes to excessive lengths to obtain nurturance and support from others,
to the point of volunteering to do things that are unpleasant. 6. Feels
uncomfortable or helpless when alone because of exaggerated fears of
being unable to care for himself or herself. 7. Urgently seeks another
relationship as a source of care and support when a close relationship
ends. 8. Is unrealistically preoccupied with fears of being left to take
care of himself or herself.

Diagnostic Features

The essential feature of dependent personality disorder is a pervasive
and excessive need to be taken care of that leads to submissive and
clinging behavior and fears of separation. This pattern begins by early
adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts. The dependent and
submissive behaviors are designed to elicit caregiving and arise from a
self-perception of being unable to function adequately without the help
of others. Individuals with dependent personality disorder have great
difficulty making everyday decisions (e.g., what color shirt to wear to
work or whether to carry an umbrella) without an excessive amount of
advice and reassurance from others (Criterion 1). These individuals tend
to be passive and to allow other people (often a single other person) to
take the initiative and assume responsibility for most major areas of
their lives (Criterion 2). Adults with this disorder typically depend on
a parent or spouse to decide where they should live, what kind of job
they should have, and which neighbors to befriend. Adolescents with this
disorder may allow their parent(s) to decide what they should wear, with
whom they should associate, how they should spend their free time, and
what school or college they should attend. This need for others to
assume responsibility goes beyond age-appropriate and
situation-appropriate requests for assistance from others (e.g., the
specific needs of children, elderly persons, and handicapped persons).
Dependent personality disorder may occur in an individual who has a
serious medical condition or disability, but in such cases the
difficulty in taking responsibility must go beyond what would normally
be associated with that condition or disability. Because they fear
losing support or approval, individuals with dependent personality
disorder often have difficulty expressing disagreement with other
individuals, especially those on whom they are dependent (Criterion 3).
These individuals feel so unable to function alone that they will agree
with things that they feel are wrong rather than risk losing the help of
those to whom they look for guidance. They do not get appropriately
angry at others whose support and nurturance they need for fear of
alienating them. If the individual's concerns regarding the consequences
of expressing disagreement are realistic (e.g., realistic fears of
retribution from an abusive spouse), the behavior should not be
considered to be evidence of dependent personality disorder. Individuals
with this disorder have difficulty initiating projects or doing things
independently (Criterion 4). They lack self-confidence and believe

that they need help to begin and carry through tasks. They will wait for
others to start things because they believe that as a rule others can do
them better. These individuals are convinced that they are incapable of
functioning independently and present themselves as inept and requiring
constant assistance. They are, however, likely to function adequately if
given the assurance that someone else is supervising and approving.
There may be a fear of becoming or appearing to be more competent,
because they may believe that this will lead to abandonment. Because
they rely on others to handle their problems, they often do not learn
the skills of independent living, thus perpetuating dependency.
Individuals with dependent personality disorder may go to excessive
lengths to obtain nurturance and support from others, even to the point
of volunteering for unpleasant tasks if such behavior will bring the
care they need (Criterion 5). They are willing to submit to what others
want, even if the demands are unreasonable. Their need to maintain an
important bond will often result in imbalanced or distorted
relationships. They may make extraordinary self-sacrifices or tolerate
verbal, physical, or sexual abuse. (It should be noted that this
behavior should be considered evidence of dependent personality disorder
only when it can clearly be established that other options are available
to the individual.) Individuals with this disorder feel uncomfortable or
helpless when alone, because of their exaggerated fears of being unable
to care for themselves (Criterion 6). They will "tag along" with
important others just to avoid being alone, even if they are not
interested or involved in what is happening. When a close relationship
ends (e.g., a breakup with a lover; the death of a caregiver),
individuals with dependent personality disorder may urgently seek
another relationship to provide the care and support they need
(Criterion 7). Their belief that they are unable to function in the
absence of a close relationship motivates these individuals to become
quickly and indiscriminately attached to another individual. Individuals
with this disorder are often preoccupied with fears of being left to
care for themselves (Criterion 8). They see themselves as so totally
dependent on the advice and help of an important other person that they
worry about being abandoned by that person when there are no grounds to
justify such fears. To be considered as evidence of this criterion, the
fears must be excessive and unrealistic. For example, an elderly man
with cancer who

moves into his son's household for care is exhibiting dependent behavior
that is appropriate given this person's life circumstances.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals with dependent
personality disorder are often characterized by pessimism and
self-doubt, tend to belittle their abilities and assets, and may
constantly refer to themselves as "stupid." They take criticism and
disapproval as proof of their worthlessness and lose faith in
themselves. They may seek overprotection and dominance from others.
Occupational functioning may be impaired if independent initiative is
required. They may avoid positions of responsibility and become anxious
when faced with decisions. Social relations tend to be limited to those
few people on whom the individual is dependent. There may be an
increased risk of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and
adjustment disorders. Dependent personality disorder often co-occurs
with other personality disorders, especially borderline, avoidant, and
histrionic personality disorders. Chronic physical illness or separation
anxiety disorder in childhood or adolescence may predispose the
individual to the development of this disorder.

Prevalence Data from the 2001--2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on
Alcohol and Related Conditions yielded an estimated prevalence of
dependent personality disorder of 0.49%1, and dependent personality was
estimated, based on a probability subsample from Part II of the National
Comorbidity Survey Replication, to be 0.6%2.

Development and Course This diagnosis should be used with great caution,
if at all, in children and adolescents, for whom dependent behavior may
be developmentally appropriate.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The degree to which dependent
behaviors are considered to be appropriate varies substantially across
different age and sociocultural groups. Age and cultural factors need to
be considered in evaluating the diagnostic threshold

of each criterion. Dependent behavior should be considered
characteristic of the disorder only when it is clearly in excess of the
individual's cultural norms or reflects unrealistic concerns. An
emphasis on passivity, politeness, and deferential treatment is
characteristic of some societies and may be misinterpreted as traits of
dependent personality disorder. Similarly, societies may differentially
foster and discourage dependent behavior in males and females.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues In clinical settings, dependent
personality disorder has been diagnosed more frequently in females,
although some studies report similar prevalence rates among males and
females.

Differential Diagnosis Other mental disorders and medical conditions.
Dependent personality disorder must be distinguished from dependency
arising as a consequence of other mental disorders (e.g., depressive
disorders, panic disorder, agoraphobia) and as a result of other medical
conditions. Other personality disorders and personality traits. Other
personality disorders may be confused with dependent personality
disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore
important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in
their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in
addition to dependent personality disorder, all can be diagnosed.
Although many personality disorders are characterized by dependent
features, dependent personality disorder can be distinguished by its
predominantly submissive, reactive, and clinging behavior. Both
dependent personality disorder and borderline personality disorder are
characterized by fear of abandonment; however, the individual with
borderline personality disorder reacts to abandonment with feelings of
emotional emptiness, rage, and demands, whereas the individual with
dependent personality disorder reacts with increasing appeasement and
submissiveness and urgently seeks a replacement relationship to provide
caregiving and support. Borderline personality disorder can further be
distinguished from dependent personality disorder by a typical pattern
of unstable and intense

relationships. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder, like
those with dependent personality disorder, have a strong need for
reassurance and approval and may appear childlike and clinging. However,
unlike dependent personality disorder, which is characterized by
self-effacing and docile behavior, histrionic personality disorder is
characterized by gregarious flamboyance with active demands for
attention. Both dependent personality disorder and avoidant personality
disorder are characterized by feelings of inadequacy, hypersensitivity
to criticism, and a need for reassurance; however, individuals with
avoidant personality disorder have such a strong fear of humiliation and
rejection that they withdraw until they are certain they will be
accepted. In contrast, individuals with dependent personality disorder
have a pattern of seeking and maintaining connections to important
others, rather than avoiding and withdrawing from relationships. Many
individuals display dependent personality traits. Only when these traits
are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant
functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute
dependent personality disorder. Personality change due to another
medical condition. Dependent personality disorder must be distinguished
from personality change due to another medical condition, in which the
traits that emerge are attributable to the effects of another medical

Dependent personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms
that may develop in association with persistent substance use.

Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder

Diagnostic Criteria

301.4 (F60.5)

A pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism,
and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility,
openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and present in a
variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following: 1.
Is preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or
schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost. 2.
Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion (e.g., is
unable to complete a project because his or her own overly strict
standards are not met). 3. Is excessively devoted to work and
productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships (not
accounted for by obvious economic necessity). 4. Is overconscientious,
scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of morality, ethics, or values
(not accounted for by cultural or religious identification). 5. Is
unable to discard worn-out or worthless objects even when they have no
sentimental value. 6. Is reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with
others unless they submit to exactly his or her way of doing things. 7.
Adopts a miserly spending style toward both self and others; money is
viewed as something to be hoarded for future catastrophes. 8. Shows
rigidity and stubbornness.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder is a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism,
and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility,
openness, and efficiency. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is
present in a variety of contexts. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder attempt to maintain a sense of control through
painstaking attention to rules, trivial

details, procedures, lists, schedules, or form to the extent that the
major point of the activity is lost (Criterion 1). They are excessively
careful and prone to repetition, paying extraordinary attention to
detail and repeatedly checking for possible mistakes. They are oblivious
to the fact that other people tend to become very annoyed at the delays
and inconveniences that result from this behavior. For example, when
such individuals misplace a list of things to be done, they will spend
an inordinate amount of time looking for the list rather than spending a
few moments re-creating it from memory and proceeding to accomplish the
tasks. Time is poorly allocated, and the most important tasks are left
to the last moment. The perfectionism and self-imposed high standards of
performance cause significant dysfunction and distress in these
individuals. They may become so involved in making every detail of a
project absolutely perfect that the project is never finished (Criterion
2). For example, the completion of a written report is delayed by
numerous time-consuming rewrites that all come up short of "perfection."
Deadlines are missed, and aspects of the individual's life that are not
the current focus of activity may fall into disarray. Individuals with
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder display excessive devotion to
work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and
friendships (Criterion 3). This behavior is not accounted for by
economic necessity. They often feel that they do not have time to take
an evening or a weekend day off to go on an outing or to just relax.
They may keep postponing a pleasurable activity, such as a vacation, so
that it may never occur. When they do take time for leisure activities
or vacations, they are very uncomfortable unless they have taken along
something to work on so they do not "waste time." There may be a great
concentration on household chores (e.g., repeated excessive cleaning so
that "one could eat off the floor"). If they spend time with friends, it
is likely to be in some kind of formally organized activity (e.g.,
sports). Hobbies or recreational activities are approached as serious
tasks requiring careful organization and hard work to master. The
emphasis is on perfect performance. These individuals turn play into a
structured task (e.g., correcting an infant for not putting rings on the
post in the right order; telling a toddler to ride his or her tricycle
in a straight line; turning a baseball game into a harsh "lesson").
Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may be
excessively conscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about matters of
morality, ethics, or values (Criterion 4). They may force themselves and

others to follow rigid moral principles and very strict standards of
performance. They may also be mercilessly self-critical about their own
mistakes. Individuals with this disorder are rigidly deferential to
authority and rules and insist on quite literal compliance, with no rule
bending for extenuating circumstances. For example, the individual will
not lend a quarter to a friend who needs one to make a telephone call
because "neither a borrower nor a lender be" or because it would be
"bad" for the person's character. These qualities should not be
accounted for by the individual's cultural or religious identification.
Individuals with this disorder may be unable to discard worn-out or
worthless objects, even when they have no sentimental value (Criterion
5). Often these individuals will admit to being "pack rats." They regard
discarding objects as wasteful because "you never know when you might
need something" and will become upset if someone tries to get rid of the
things they have saved. Their spouses or roommates may complain about
the amount of space taken up by old parts, magazines, broken appliances,
and so on. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
are reluctant to delegate tasks or to work with others (Criterion 6).
They stubbornly and unreasonably insist that everything be done their
way and that people conform to their way of doing things. They often
give very detailed instructions about how things should be done (e.g.,
there is one and only one way to mow the lawn, wash the dishes, build a
doghouse) and are surprised and irritated if others suggest creative
alternatives. At other times they may reject offers of help even when
behind schedule because they believe no one else can do it right.
Individuals with this disorder may be miserly and stingy and maintain a
standard of living far below what they can afford, believing that
spending must be tightly controlled to provide for future catastrophes
(Criterion 7). Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is
characterized by rigidity and stubbornness (Criterion 8). Individuals
with this disorder are so concerned about having things done the one
"correct" way that they have trouble going along with anyone else's
ideas. These individuals plan ahead in meticulous detail and are
unwilling to consider changes. Totally wrapped up in their own
perspective, they have difficulty acknowledging the viewpoints of
others. Friends and colleagues may become frustrated by this constant
rigidity. Even when individuals with obsessive-compulsive personality

disorder recognize that it may be in their interest to compromise, they
may stubbornly refuse to do so, arguing that it is "the principle of the
thing."

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis When rules and established
procedures do not dictate the correct answer, decision making may become
a time-consuming, often painful process. Individuals with
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder may have such difficulty
deciding which tasks take priority or what is the best way of doing some
particular task that they may never get started on anything. They are
prone to become upset or angry in situations in which they are not able
to maintain control of their physical or interpersonal environment,
although the anger is typically not expressed directly. For example, an
individual may be angry when service in a restaurant is poor, but
instead of complaining to the management, the individual ruminates about
how much to leave as a tip. On other occasions, anger may be expressed
with righteous indignation over a seemingly minor matter. Individuals
with this disorder may be especially attentive to their relative status
in dominance-submission relationships and may display excessive
deference to an authority they respect and excessive resistance to
authority they do not respect. Individuals with this disorder usually
express affection in a highly controlled or stilted fashion and may be
very uncomfortable in the presence of others who are emotionally
expressive. Their everyday relationships have a formal and serious
quality, and they may be stiff in situations in which others would smile
and be happy (e.g., greeting a lover at the airport). They carefully
hold themselves back until they are sure that whatever they say will be
perfect. They may be preoccupied with logic and intellect, and
intolerant of affective behavior in others. They often have difficulty
expressing tender feelings, rarely paying compliments. Individuals with
this disorder may experience occupational difficulties and distress,
particularly when confronted with new situations that demand flexibility
and compromise. Individuals with anxiety disorders, including
generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia),
and specific phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have an
increased likelihood of having a personality disturbance that meets
criteria for obsessivecompulsive personality disorder. Even so, it
appears that the majority of individuals with OCD do not have a pattern
of behavior that meets criteria

for this personality disorder. Many of the features of
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder overlap with "type A"
personality characteristics (e.g., preoccupation with work,
competitiveness, time urgency), and these features may be present in
people at risk for myocardial infarction. There may be an association
between obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and depressive and
bipolar disorders and eating disorders.

Prevalence Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is one of the most
prevalent personality disorders in the general population, with
estimated prevalence ranging from 2.1% to 7.9%1, 2, 3.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues In assessing an individual for
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, the clinician should not
include those behaviors that reflect habits, customs, or interpersonal
styles that are culturally sanctioned by the individual's reference
group. Certain cultures place substantial emphasis on work and
productivity; the resulting behaviors in members of those societies need
not be considered indications of obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues In systematic studies,
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder appears to be diagnosed about
twice as often among males.

Differential Diagnosis Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Despite the
similarity in names, OCD is usually easily distinguished from
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder by the presence of true
obsessions and compulsions in OCD. When criteria for both
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and OCD are met, both
diagnoses should be recorded. Hoarding disorder. A diagnosis of hoarding
disorder should be considered especially when hoarding is extreme (e.g.,
accumulated stacks of worthless objects present a fire hazard and make
it difficult for others to walk through the house). When criteria for
both obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and hoarding disorder are
met, both diagnoses should be recorded.

Other personality disorders and personality traits. Other personality
disorders may be confused with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
because they have certain features in common. It is, therefore,
important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in
their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in
addition to obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, all can be
diagnosed. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may also
profess a commitment to perfectionism and believe that others cannot do
things as well, but these individuals are more likely to believe that
they have achieved perfection, whereas those with obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder are usually self-critical. Individuals with
narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder lack generosity but will
indulge themselves, whereas those with obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder adopt a miserly spending style toward both self and others.
Both schizoid personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality
disorder may be characterized by an apparent formality and social
detachment. In obsessivecompulsive personality disorder, this stems from
discomfort with emotions and excessive devotion to work, whereas in
schizoid personality disorder there is a fundamental lack of capacity
for intimacy. Obsessive-compulsive personality traits in moderation may
be especially adaptive, particularly in situations that reward high
performance. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and
persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective
distress do they constitute obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.
Personality change due to another medical condition. Obsessivecompulsive
personality disorder must be distinguished from personality change due
to another medical condition, in which the traits emerge attributable to
the effects of another medical condition on the central nervous system.
Substance use disorders. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder must
also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in association with
persistent substance use.

Other Personality Disorders Personality Change Due to Another Medical
Condition Diagnostic Criteria

310.1 (F07.0)

a.  A persistent personality disturbance that represents a change from
    the individual's previous characteristic personality pattern. Note:
    In children, the disturbance involves a marked deviation from normal
    development or a significant change in the child's usual behavior
    patterns, lasting at least 1 year.
b.  There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or
    laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct
    pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.
c.  The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder
    (including another mental disorder due to another medical
    condition).
d.  The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a
    delirium.
e.  The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment
    in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
    Specify whether: Labile type: If the predominant feature is
    affective lability.

Disinhibited type: If the predominant feature is poor impulse control as
evidenced by sexual indiscretions, etc. Aggressive type: If the
predominant feature is aggressive behavior. Apathetic type: If the
predominant feature is marked apathy and indifference. Paranoid type: If
the predominant feature is suspiciousness or paranoid ideation. Other
type: If the presentation is not characterized by any of the above
subtypes. Combined type: If more than one feature predominates in the
clinical picture. Unspecified type Coding note: Include the name of the
other medical condition (e.g., 310.1 \[F07.0\] personality change due to
temporal lobe epilepsy). The other medical condition should be coded and
listed separately immediately before the personality disorder due to
another medical condition (e.g., 345.40 \[G40.209\] temporal lobe
epilepsy; 310.1 \[F07.0\] personality change due to temporal lobe
epilepsy).

Subtypes The particular personality change can be specified by
indicating the symptom presentation that predominates in the clinical
presentation.

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of a personality change due to
another medical condition is a persistent personality disturbance that
is judged to be due to the direct pathophysiological effects of a
medical condition. The personality disturbance represents a change from
the individual's previous characteristic personality pattern. In
children, this condition may be manifested as a marked deviation from
normal development rather than as a change in a stable personality
pattern (Criterion A). There must be evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory findings that the personality change is the
direct physiological consequence of another medical condition (Criterion
B). The diagnosis is not given if the disturbance is better explained by
another mental disorder (Criterion C).

The diagnosis is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during
the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The disturbance must also cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E). Common
manifestations of the personality change include affective instability,
poor impulse control, outbursts of aggression or rage grossly out of
proportion to any precipitating psychosocial stressor, marked apathy,
suspiciousness, or paranoid ideation. The phenomenology of the change is
indicated using the subtypes listed in the criteria set. An individual
with the disorder is often characterized by others as "not himself \[or
herself\]." Although it shares the term "personality" with the other
personality disorders, this diagnosis is distinct by virtue of its
specific etiology, different phenomenology, and more variable onset and
course. The clinical presentation in a given individual may depend on
the nature and localization of the pathological process. For example,
injury to the frontal lobes may yield symptoms such as lack of judgment
or foresight, facetiousness, disinhibition, and euphoria. Right
hemisphere strokes have often been shown to evoke personality changes in
association with unilateral spatial neglect, anosognosia (i.e.,
inability of the individual to recognize a bodily or functional deficit,
such as the existence of hemiparesis), motor impersistence, and other
neurological deficits.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis A variety of neurological and
other medical conditions may cause personality changes, including
central nervous system neoplasms, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease,
Huntington's disease, epilepsy, infectious conditions with central
nervous system involvement (e.g., HIV), endocrine conditions (e.g.,
hypothyroidism, hypo- and hyperadrenocorticism), and autoimmune
conditions with central nervous system involvement (e.g., systemic lupus
erythematosus). The associated physical examination findings, laboratory
findings, and patterns of prevalence and onset reflect those of the
neurological or other medical condition involved.

Differential Diagnosis Chronic medical conditions associated with pain
and disability. Chronic medical conditions associated with pain and
disability

can also be associated with changes in personality. The diagnosis of
personality change due to another medical condition is given only if a
direct pathophysiological mechanism can be established. This diagnosis
is not given if the change is due to a behavioral or psychological
adjustment or response to another medical condition (e.g., dependent
behaviors that result from a need for the assistance of others following
a severe head trauma, cardiovascular disease, or dementia). Delirium or
major neurocognitive disorder. Personality change is a frequently
associated feature of a delirium or major neurocognitive disorder. A
separate diagnosis of personality change due to another medical
condition is not given if the change occurs exclusively during the
course of a delirium. However, the diagnosis of personality change due
to another medical condition may be given in addition to the diagnosis
of major neurocognitive disorder if the personality change is a
prominent part of the clinical presentation. Another mental disorder due
to another medical condition. The diagnosis of personality change due to
another medical condition is not given if the disturbance is better
explained by another mental disorder due to another medical condition
(e.g., depressive disorder due to brain tumor). Substance use disorders.
Personality changes may also occur in the context of substance use
disorders, especially if the disorder is longstanding. The clinician
should inquire carefully about the nature and extent of substance use.
If the clinician wishes to indicate an etiological relationship between
the personality change and substance use, the unspecified category for
the specific substance (e.g., unspecified stimulantrelated disorder) can
be used. Other mental disorders. Marked personality changes may also be
an associated feature of other mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia;
delusional disorder; depressive and bipolar disorders; other specified
and unspecified disruptive behavior, impulse-control, and conduct
disorders; panic disorder). However, in these disorders, no specific
physiological factor is judged to be etiologically related to the
personality change. Other personality disorders. Personality change due
to another medical condition can be distinguished from a personality
disorder by the

requirement for a clinically significant change from baseline
personality functioning and the presence of a specific etiological
medical condition.

Other Specified Personality Disorder 301.89 (F60.89) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
personality disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the personality disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified personality disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific personality
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified personality
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "mixed personality
features").

Unspecified Personality Disorder 301.9 (F60.9) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a personality disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the personality
disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified personality disorder
category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to
specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific
personality disorder, and includes presentations in which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.

Paraphilic Disorders Paraphilic disorders included in this manual are
voyeuristic disorder (spying on others in private activities),
exhibitionistic disorder (exposing the genitals), frotteuristic disorder
(touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual), sexual
masochism disorder (undergoing humiliation, bondage, or suffering),
sexual sadism disorder (inflicting humiliation, bondage, or suffering),
pedophilic disorder (sexual focus on children), fetishistic disorder
(using nonliving objects or having a highly specific focus on nongenital
body parts), and transvestic disorder (engaging in sexually arousing
cross-dressing). These disorders have traditionally been selected for
specific listing and assignment of explicit diagnostic criteria in DSM
for two main reasons: they are relatively common, in relation to other
paraphilic disorders, and some of them entail actions for their
satisfaction that, because of their noxiousness or potential harm to
others, are classed as criminal offenses. The eight listed disorders do
not exhaust the list of possible paraphilic disorders. Many dozens of
distinct paraphilias have been identified and named, and almost any of
them could, by virtue of its negative consequences for the individual or
for others, rise to the level of a paraphilic disorder. The diagnoses of
the other specified and unspecified paraphilic disorders are therefore
indispensable and will be required in many cases. In this chapter, the
order of presentation of the listed paraphilic disorders generally
corresponds to common classification schemes for these conditions. The
first group of disorders is based on anomalous activity preferences.
These disorders are subdivided into courtship disorders, which resemble
distorted components of human courtship behavior (voyeuristic disorder,
exhibitionistic disorder, and frotteuristic disorder), and algolagnic
disorders, which involve pain and suffering (sexual masochism disorder
and sexual sadism disorder). The second group of disorders is based on
anomalous target preferences. These disorders include one directed at
other humans (pedophilic disorder) and two directed elsewhere
(fetishistic disorder and transvestic disorder).

The term paraphilia denotes any intense and persistent sexual interest
other than sexual interest in genital stimulation or preparatory
fondling with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human
partners. In some circumstances, the criteria "intense and persistent"
may be difficult to apply, such as in the assessment of persons who are
very old or medically ill and who may not have "intense" sexual
interests of any kind. In such circumstances, the term paraphilia may be
defined as any sexual interest greater than or equal to normophilic
sexual interests. There are also specific paraphilias that are generally
better described as preferential sexual interests than as intense sexual
interests. Some paraphilias primarily concern the individual's erotic
activities, and others primarily concern the individual's erotic
targets. Examples of the former would include intense and persistent
interests in spanking, whipping, cutting, binding, or strangulating
another person, or an interest in these activities that equals or
exceeds the individual's interest in copulation or equivalent
interaction with another person. Examples of the latter would include
intense or preferential sexual interest in children, corpses, or
amputees (as a class), as well as intense or preferential interest in
nonhuman animals, such as horses or dogs, or in inanimate objects, such
as shoes or articles made of rubber. A paraphilic disorder is a
paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the
individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal
harm, or risk of harm, to others. A paraphilia is a necessary but not a
sufficient condition for having a paraphilic disorder, and a paraphilia
by itself does not necessarily justify or require clinical intervention.
In the diagnostic criteria set for each of the listed paraphilic
disorders, Criterion A specifies the qualitative nature of the
paraphilia (e.g., an erotic focus on children or on exposing the
genitals to strangers), and Criterion B specifies the negative
consequences of the paraphilia (i.e., distress, impairment, or harm to
others). In keeping with the distinction between paraphilias and
paraphilic disorders, the term diagnosis should be reserved for
individuals who meet both Criteria A and B (i.e., individuals who have a
paraphilic disorder). If an individual meets Criterion A but not
Criterion B for a particular paraphilia---a circumstance that might
arise when a benign paraphilia is discovered during the clinical
investigation of some other condition---then the individual may be said
to have that paraphilia but not a paraphilic disorder.

It is not rare for an individual to manifest two or more paraphilias. In
some cases, the paraphilic foci are closely related and the connection
between the paraphilias is intuitively comprehensible (e.g., foot
fetishism and shoe fetishism). In other cases, the connection between
the paraphilias is not obvious, and the presence of multiple paraphilias
may be coincidental or else related to some generalized vulnerability to
anomalies of psychosexual development. In any event, comorbid diagnoses
of separate paraphilic disorders may be warranted if more than one
paraphilia is causing suffering to the individual or harm to others.
Because of the two-pronged nature of diagnosing paraphilic disorders,
clinician-rated or self-rated measures and severity assessments could
address either the strength of the paraphilia itself or the seriousness
of its consequences. Although the distress and impairment stipulated in
the Criterion B are special in being the immediate or ultimate result of
the paraphilia and not primarily the result of some other factor, the
phenomena of reactive depression, anxiety, guilt, poor work history,
impaired social relations, and so on are not unique in themselves and
may be quantified with multipurpose measures of psychosocial functioning
or quality of life. The most widely applicable framework for assessing
the strength of a paraphilia itself is one in which examinees'
paraphilic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors are evaluated in
relation to their normophilic sexual interests and behaviors. In a
clinical interview or on self-administered questionnaires, examinees can
be asked whether their paraphilic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors
are weaker than, approximately equal to, or stronger than their
normophilic sexual interests and behaviors. This same type of comparison
can be, and usually is, employed in psychophysiological measures of
sexual interest, such as penile plethysmography in males or viewing time
in males and females.

Voyeuristic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.82 (F65.3)

a.  Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
    arousal from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the
    process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity, as manifested
    by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.

b. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting
person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning. c. The individual experiencing the arousal and/or acting
on the urges is at least 18 years of age. Specify if: In a controlled
environment: This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals
living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to engage
in voyeuristic behavior are restricted. In full remission: The
individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person, and
there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or
other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an
uncontrolled environment.

Specifiers The "in full remission" specifier does not address the
continued presence or absence of voyeurism per se, which may still be
present after behaviors and distress have remitted.

Diagnostic Features The diagnostic criteria for voyeuristic disorder can
apply both to individuals who more or less freely disclose this
paraphilic interest and to those who categorically deny any sexual
arousal from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, disrobing,
or engaged in sexual activity despite substantial objective evidence to
the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report distress or
psychosocial problems because of their voyeuristic sexual preferences,
they could be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. On the other hand, if
they declare no distress, demonstrated by lack of anxiety, obsessions,
guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses and are not impaired in
other important areas of functioning because of this sexual interest,
and their psychiatric or legal histories indicate that they do not act
on it, they could be ascertained as having voyeuristic sexual interest
but should not be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder7.

Nondisclosing individuals include, for example, individuals known to
have been spying repeatedly on unsuspecting persons who are naked or
engaging in sexual activity on separate occasions but who deny any urges
or fantasies concerning such sexual behavior, and who may report that
known episodes of watching unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons
were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of
observing unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons but contest any
significant or sustained sexual interest in this behavior. Since these
individuals deny having fantasies or impulses about watching others nude
or involved in sexual activity, it follows that they would also reject
feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses.
Despite their nondisclosing stance, such individuals may be diagnosed
with voyeuristic disorder. Recurrent voyeuristic behavior constitutes
sufficient support for voyeurism (by fulfilling Criterion A) and
simultaneously demonstrates that this paraphilically motivated behavior
is causing harm to others (by fulfilling Criterion B). "Recurrent"
spying on unsuspecting persons who are naked or engaging in sexual
activity (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a
general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on separate
occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion
if there were multiple occasions of watching the same victim or if there
is corroborating evidence of a distinct or preferential interest in
secret watching of naked or sexually active unsuspecting persons. Note
that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a
necessary condition for diagnosis; the criteria may also be met if the
individual acknowledges intense voyeuristic sexual interest. The
Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of voyeurism
must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as
a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual
interest in secretly watching unsuspecting naked or sexually active
others is not merely transient. Adolescence and puberty generally
increase sexual curiosity and activity. To alleviate the risk of
pathologizing normative sexual interest and behavior during pubertal
adolescence, the minimum age for the diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder
is 18 years (Criterion C).

Prevalence

Voyeuristic acts are the most common of potentially law-breaking sexual
behaviors. The population prevalence of voyeuristic disorder is
unknown9. However, based on voyeuristic sexual acts in nonclinical
samples7, the highest possible lifetime prevalence for voyeuristic
disorder is approximately 12% in males and 4% in females.

Development and Course Adult males with voyeuristic disorder often first
become aware of their sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting
persons during adolescence1. However, the minimum age for a diagnosis of
voyeuristic disorder is 18 years because there is substantial difficulty
in differentiating it from age-appropriate puberty-related sexual
curiosity and activity. The persistence of voyeurism over time is
unclear9. Voyeuristic disorder, however, per definition requires one or
more contributing factors that may change over time with or without
treatment: subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual
frustration, loneliness), psychiatric morbidity, hypersexuality, and
sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity to
act out sexually by spying on unsuspecting naked or sexually active
persons. Therefore, the course of voyeuristic disorder is likely to vary
with age.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Voyeurism is a necessary
precondition for voyeuristic disorder; hence, risk factors for voyeurism
should also increase the rate of voyeuristic disorder. Environmental.
Childhood sexual abuse, substance misuse, and sexual
preoccupation/hypersexuality have been suggested as risk factors,
although the causal relationship to voyeurism is uncertain and the
specificity unclear8.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Voyeuristic disorder is very uncommon
among females in clinical settings10, while the male-to-female ratio for
single sexually arousing voyeuristic acts might be 3:18.

Differential Diagnosis Conduct disorder and antisocial personality
disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial personality
disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and
antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in secretly
watching unsuspecting others who are naked or engaging in sexual
activity should be lacking. Substance use disorders. Substance use
disorders might involve single voyeuristic episodes by intoxicated
individuals but should not involve the typical sexual interest in
secretly watching unsuspecting persons being naked or engaging in sexual
activity. Hence, recurrent voyeuristic sexual fantasies, urges, or
behaviors that occur also when the individual is not intoxicated suggest
that voyeuristic disorder might be present.

Comorbidity Known comorbidities in voyeuristic disorder are largely
based on research with males suspected of or convicted for acts
involving the secret watching of unsuspecting nude or sexually active
persons. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals
with voyeuristic disorder. Conditions that occur comorbidly with
voyeuristic disorder include hypersexuality5 and other paraphilic
disorders, particularly exhibitionistic disorder1, 2, 3, 4. Depressive,
bipolar, anxiety, and substance use disorders;
attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder6, and conduct disorder and
antisocial personality disorder are also frequent comorbid conditions.

Exhibitionistic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.4 (F65.2)

a.  Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
    arousal from the exposure of one's genitals to an unsuspecting
    person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
b.  The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting
    person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically
    significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
    important areas of functioning. Specify whether: Sexually aroused by
    exposing genitals to prepubertal children Sexually aroused by
    exposing genitals to physically mature individuals Sexually aroused
    by exposing genitals to prepubertal children and to physically
    mature individuals Specify if:

In a controlled environment: This specifier is primarily applicable to
individuals living in institutional or other settings where
opportunities to expose one's genitals are restricted. In full
remission: The individual has not acted on the urges with a
nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for at least 5
years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Subtypes The subtypes for exhibitionistic disorder are based on the age
or physical maturity of the nonconsenting individuals to whom the
individual prefers to expose his or her genitals. The nonconsenting
individuals could be prepubescent children, adults, or both. This
specifier should help draw adequate attention to characteristics of
victims of individuals with exhibitionistic disorder to prevent
co-occurring pedophilic disorder from being overlooked9. However,
indications that the individual with exhibitionistic disorder is
sexually attracted to exposing his or her genitals to children should
not preclude a diagnosis of pedophilic disorder.

Specifiers The "in full remission" specifier does not address the
continued presence or absence of exhibitionism per se, which may still
be present after behaviors and distress have remitted.

Diagnostic Features The diagnostic criteria for exhibitionistic disorder
can apply both to individuals who more or less freely disclose this
paraphilia and to those who categorically deny any sexual attraction to
exposing their genitals to unsuspecting persons despite substantial
objective evidence to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also
report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or
preferences for exposing, they may be diagnosed with exhibitionistic
disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress (exemplified by
absence of anxiety, obsessions, and guilt or shame about these
paraphilic impulses) and are not impaired by this sexual interest in
other important areas of functioning, and their self-reported,
psychiatric, or legal histories indicate that they do not act on them,
they could be

ascertained as having exhibitionistic sexual interest but not be
diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder. Examples of nondisclosing
individuals include those who have exposed themselves repeatedly to
unsuspecting persons on separate occasions but who deny any urges or
fantasies about such sexual behavior and who report that known episodes
of exposure were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past
episodes of sexual behavior involving genital exposure but refute any
significant or sustained sexual interest in such behavior. Since these
individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving genital exposure,
it follows that they would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or
socially impaired by such impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed
with exhibitionistic disorder despite their negative self-report.
Recurrent exhibitionistic behavior constitutes sufficient support for
exhibitionism (Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that this
paraphilically motivated behavior is causing harm to others (Criterion
B). "Recurrent" genital exposure to unsuspecting others (i.e., multiple
victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be
interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer
victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion if there were
multiple occasions of exposure to the same victim, or if there is
corroborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in genital
exposure to unsuspecting persons. Note that multiple victims, as
suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for
diagnosis, as criteria may be met by an individual's acknowledging
intense exhibitionistic sexual interest with distress and/or impairment.
The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of
exhibitionism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be
understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure
that the sexual interest in exposing one's genitals to unsuspecting
others is not merely transient. This might be expressed in clear
evidence of repeated behaviors or distress over a nontransient period
shorter than 6 months.

Prevalence The prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder is unknown9.
However, based on exhibitionistic sexual acts in nonclinical or general
populations7, the highest possible prevalence for exhibitionistic
disorder in the male population is

2%--4%9. The prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder in females is even
more uncertain but is generally believed to be much lower than in
males9.

Development and Course Adult males with exhibitionistic disorder often
report that they first became aware of sexual interest in exposing their
genitals to unsuspecting persons during adolescence, at a somewhat later
time than the typical development of normative sexual interest in women
or men9. Although there is no minimum age requirement for the diagnosis
of exhibitionistic disorder, it may be difficult to differentiate
exhibitionistic behaviors from ageappropriate sexual curiosity in
adolescents. Whereas exhibitionistic impulses appear to emerge in
adolescence or early adulthood9, very little is known about persistence
over time. By definition, exhibitionistic disorder requires one or more
contributing factors, which may change over time with or without
treatment; subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual
frustration, loneliness), mental disorder comorbidity, hypersexuality,
and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity
to act out sexually by exposing the genitals to unsuspecting persons.
Therefore, the course of exhibitionistic disorder is likely to vary with
age. As with other sexual preferences, advancing age may be associated
with decreasing exhibitionistic sexual preferences and behavior.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Since exhibitionism is a
necessary precondition for exhibitionistic disorder, risk factors for
exhibitionism should also increase the rate of exhibitionistic disorder.
Antisocial history, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol misuse, and
pedophilic sexual preference might increase risk of sexual recidivism in
exhibitionistic offenders4. Hence, antisocial personality disorder,
alcohol use disorder, and pedophilic interest may be considered risk
factors for exhibitionistic disorder in males with exhibitionistic
sexual preferences. Environmental. Childhood sexual and emotional abuse
and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality have been suggested as risk
factors for exhibitionism, although the causal relationship to
exhibitionism is uncertain and the specificity unclear6.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Exhibitionistic disorder is highly
unusual in females8, 9, whereas single sexually arousing exhibitionistic
acts might occur up to half as often among women compared with men7.

Functional Disorder

Consequences

of

Exhibitionistic

The functional consequences of exhibitionistic disorder have not been
addressed in research involving individuals who have not acted out
sexually by exposing their genitals to unsuspecting strangers but who
fulfill Criterion B by experiencing intense emotional distress over
these preferences.

Differential Diagnosis Potential differential diagnoses for
exhibitionistic disorder sometimes occur also as comorbid disorders.
Therefore, it is generally necessary to evaluate the evidence for
exhibitionistic disorder and other possible conditions as separate
questions. Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Conduct
disorder in adolescents and antisocial personality disorder would be
characterized by additional norm-breaking and antisocial behaviors, and
the specific sexual interest in exposing the genitals should be lacking.
Substance use disorders. Alcohol and substance use disorders might
involve single exhibitionistic episodes by intoxicated individuals but
should not involve the typical sexual interest in exposing the genitals
to unsuspecting persons. Hence, recurrent exhibitionistic sexual
fantasies, urges, or behaviors that occur also when the individual is
not intoxicated suggest that exhibitionistic disorder might be present.

Comorbidity Known comorbidities in exhibitionistic disorder are largely
based on research with individuals (almost all males) convicted for
criminal acts involving genital exposure to nonconsenting individuals.
Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals who
qualify for a diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder. Conditions that
occur comorbidly with

exhibitionistic disorder at high rates include depressive, bipolar,
anxiety, and substance use disorders; hypersexuality;
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder9, other paraphilic disorders1,
2, 3, 5, and antisocial personality disorder.

Frotteuristic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.89 (F65.81)

a. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
arousal from touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person, as
manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. b. The individual has
acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual
urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Specify if: In a controlled environment: This specifier is primarily
applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings
where opportunities to touch or rub against a nonconsenting person are
restricted. In full remission: The individual has not acted on the urges
with a nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for
at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Specifiers The "in remission" specifier does not address the continued
presence or absence of frotteurism per se, which may still be present
after behaviors and distress have remitted.

Diagnostic Features The diagnostic criteria for frotteuristic disorder
can apply both to individuals who relatively freely disclose this
paraphilia and to those who firmly deny any sexual attraction from
touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual regardless of
considerable objective evidence to the contrary. If disclosing
individuals also report psychosocial impairment due to their sexual
preferences for touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual,
they could be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder. In contrast, if
they declare no distress (demonstrated by lack of anxiety, obsessions,
guilt, or shame) about these paraphilic impulses and are not impaired in
other important areas of functioning because of this sexual interest,
and their psychiatric or legal histories indicate that they do not act

on it, they could be ascertained as having frotteuristic sexual interest
but should not be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder. Nondisclosing
individuals include, for instance, individuals known to have been
touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals on separate
occasions but who contest any urges or fantasies concerning such sexual
behavior. Such individuals may report that identified episodes of
touching or rubbing against an unwilling individual were all
unintentional and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of
touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals but contest any
major or persistent sexual interest in this. Since these individuals
deny having fantasies or impulses about touching or rubbing, they would
consequently reject feeling distressed or psychosocially impaired by
such impulses. Despite their nondisclosing position, such individuals
may be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder. Recurrent frotteuristic
behavior constitutes satisfactory support for frotteurism (by fulfilling
Criterion A) and concurrently demonstrates that this paraphilically
motivated behavior is causing harm to others (by fulfilling Criterion
B). "Recurrent" touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual
(i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general
rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions.
Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion if there
were multiple occasions of touching or rubbing against the same
unwilling individual, or corroborating evidence of a strong or
preferential interest in touching or rubbing against nonconsenting
individuals. Note that multiple victims are a sufficient but not a
necessary condition for diagnosis; criteria may also be met if the
individual acknowledges intense frotteuristic sexual interest with
clinically significant distress and/or impairment. The Criterion A time
frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of frotteurism must persist for
at least 6 months, should also be interpreted as a general guideline,
not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in touching
or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual is not transient. Hence,
the duration part of Criterion A may also be met if there is clear
evidence of recurrent behaviors or distress over a shorter but
nontransient time period.

Prevalence

Frotteuristic acts, including the uninvited sexual touching of or
rubbing against another individual, may occur in up to 30% of adult
males in the general population7, 8. Approximately 10%--14% of adult
males seen in outpatient settings for paraphilic disorders and
hypersexuality have a presentation that meets diagnostic criteria for
frotteuristic disorder1, 5. Hence, whereas the population prevalence of
frotteuristic disorder is unknown6, it is not likely that it exceeds the
rate found in selected clinical settings.

Development and Course Adult males with frotteuristic disorder often
report first becoming aware of their sexual interest in surreptitiously
touching unsuspecting persons during late adolescence or emerging
adulthood8. However, children and adolescents may also touch or rub
against unwilling others in the absence of a diagnosis of frotteuristic
disorder. Although there is no minimum age for the diagnosis,
frotteuristic disorder can be difficult to differentiate from
conduct-disordered behavior without sexual motivation in individuals at
younger ages. The persistence of frotteurism over time is unclear.
Frotteuristic disorder, however, by definition requires one or more
contributing factors that may change over time with or without
treatment: subjective distress (e.g., guilt, shame, intense sexual
frustration, loneliness); psychiatric morbidity; hypersexuality and
sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity to
act out sexually by touching or rubbing against unconsenting persons.
Therefore, the course of frotteuristic disorder is likely to vary with
age. As with other sexual preferences, advancing age may be associated
with decreasing frotteuristic sexual preferences and behavior.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Nonsexual antisocial behavior
and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality might be nonspecific risk
factors, although the causal relationship to frotteurism is uncertain
and the specificity unclear8. However, frotteurism is a necessary
precondition for frotteuristic disorder, so risk factors for frotteurism
should also increase the rate of frotteuristic disorder.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues There appear to be substantially fewer
females with frotteuristic sexual preferences than males6.

Differential Diagnosis Conduct disorder and antisocial personality
disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial personality
disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and
antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in touching or
rubbing against a nonconsenting individual should be lacking. Substance
use disorders. Substance use disorders, particularly those involving
stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines, might involve single
frotteuristic episodes by intoxicated individuals but should not involve
the typical sustained sexual interest in touching or rubbing against
unsuspecting persons. Hence, recurrent frotteuristic sexual fantasies,
urges, or behaviors that occur also when the individual is not
intoxicated suggest that frotteuristic disorder might be present.

Comorbidity Known comorbidities in frotteuristic disorder are largely
based on research with males suspected of or convicted for criminal acts
involving sexually motivated touching of or rubbing against a
nonconsenting individual. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to
other individuals with a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder based on
subjective distress over their sexual interest. Conditions that occur
comorbidly with frotteuristic disorder include hypersexuality5 and other
paraphilic disorders1, 2, 3, 4, particularly exhibitionistic disorder
and voyeuristic disorder4. Conduct disorder, antisocial personality
disorder, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders,
and substance use disorders also co-occur. Potential differential
diagnoses for frotteuristic disorder sometimes occur also as comorbid
disorders. Therefore, it is generally necessary to evaluate the evidence
for frotteuristic disorder and possible comorbid conditions as separate
questions.

Sexual Masochism Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.83 (F65.51)

a.  Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
    arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or
    otherwise made to suffer, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or
    behaviors.
b.  The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically
    significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
    important areas of functioning. Specify if: With asphyxiophilia: If
    the individual engages in the practice of achieving sexual arousal
    related to restriction of breathing.

Specify if: In a controlled environment: This specifier is primarily
applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings
where opportunities to engage in masochistic sexual behaviors are
restricted. In full remission: There has been no distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning for at least 5
years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Diagnostic Features The diagnostic criteria for sexual masochism
disorder are intended to apply to individuals who freely admit to having
such paraphilic interests. Such individuals openly acknowledge intense
sexual arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or
otherwise made to suffer, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or
behaviors. If these individuals also report psychosocial difficulties
because of their sexual attractions or preferences for being humiliated,
beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, they may be diagnosed with
sexual masochism disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress,
exemplified by anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these
paraphilic impulses, and are not hampered by them in pursuing other
personal goals, they could be ascertained as having masochistic sexual
interest but should not be diagnosed with sexual masochism disorder. The
Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs or symptoms of sexual
masochism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should be
understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure
that the sexual interest in being humiliated, beaten, bound, or
otherwise made to suffer is not merely transient. However, the disorder
can be diagnosed in the context of a clearly sustained but shorter time
period.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The extensive use of
pornography involving the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or
otherwise made to suffer is sometimes an associated feature of sexual
masochism disorder.

Prevalence

The population prevalence of sexual masochism disorder is unknown6, 8.
In Australia, it has been estimated that 2.2% of males and 1.3% of
females had been involved in bondage and discipline, sadomasochism, or
dominance and submission in the past 12 months9.

Development and Course Community individuals with paraphilias2 have
reported a mean age at onset for masochism of 19.3 years, although
earlier ages, including puberty and childhood, have also been reported
for the onset of masochistic fantasies5. Very little is known about
persistence over time. Sexual masochism disorder per definition requires
one or more contributing factors, which may change over time with or
without treatment. These include subjective distress (e.g., guilt,
shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness), psychiatric morbidity,
hypersexuality and sexual impulsivity, and psychosocial impairment.
Therefore, the course of sexual masochism disorder is likely to vary
with age. Advancing age is likely to have the same reducing effect on
sexual preference involving sexual masochism as it has on other
paraphilic or normophilic sexual behavior.

Functional Consequences of Sexual Masochism Disorder The functional
consequences of sexual masochism disorder are unknown. However,
masochists are at risk of accidental death while practicing
asphyxiophilia7 or other autoerotic procedures4.

Differential Diagnosis Many of the conditions that could be differential
diagnoses for sexual masochism disorder (e.g., transvestic fetishism,
sexual sadism disorder, hypersexuality, alcohol and substance use
disorders) sometimes occur also as comorbid diagnoses. Therefore, it is
necessary to carefully evaluate the evidence for sexual masochism
disorder, keeping the possibility of other paraphilias or other mental
disorders as part of the differential diagnosis. Sexual masochism in the
absence of distress (i.e., no disorder) is also included in the
differential, as individuals who conduct the behaviors may be satisfied
with their masochistic interest.

Comorbidity Known comorbidities with sexual masochism disorder are
largely based on individuals in treatment6. Disorders that occur
comorbidly with sexual masochism disorder typically include other
paraphilic disorders1, 3, such as transvestic fetishism5.

Sexual Sadism Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.84 (F65.52)

a. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
arousal from the physical or psychological suffering of another person,
as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. b. The individual has
acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual
urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Specify if: In a controlled environment: This specifier is primarily
applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings
where opportunities to engage in sadistic sexual behaviors are
restricted. In full remission: The individual has not acted on the urges
with a nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for
at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Diagnostic Features The diagnostic criteria for sexual sadism disorder
are intended to apply both to individuals who freely admit to having
such paraphilic interests and to those who deny any sexual interest in
the physical or psychological suffering of another individual despite
substantial objective evidence to the contrary. Individuals who openly
acknowledge intense sexual interest in the physical or psychological
suffering of others are referred to as "admitting individuals." If these
individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their
sexual attractions or preferences for the physical or psychological
suffering of another individual, they may be diagnosed with sexual
sadism disorder. In contrast, if admitting individuals declare no
distress, exemplified by anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about
these paraphilic impulses, and are not hampered by them in pursuing
other goals, and their self-reported, psychiatric, or legal histories
indicate that they do not act on them, then they could be ascertained as
having sadistic sexual interest but they would not meet criteria for
sexual sadism disorder. Examples of individuals who deny any interest in
the physical or psychological suffering of another individual include
individuals known to have inflicted pain or suffering on multiple
victims on separate occasions

but who deny any urges or fantasies about such sexual behavior and who
may further claim that known episodes of sexual assault were either
unintentional or nonsexual. Others may admit past episodes of sexual
behavior involving the infliction of pain or suffering on a
nonconsenting individual but do not report any significant or sustained
sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another
individual. Since these individuals deny having urges or fantasies
involving sexual arousal to pain and suffering, it follows that they
would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by
such impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed with sexual sadism
disorder despite their negative self-report. Their recurrent behavior
constitutes clinical support for the presence of the paraphilia of
sexual sadism (by satisfying Criterion A) and simultaneously
demonstrates that their paraphilically motivated behavior is causing
clinically significant distress, harm, or risk of harm to others
(satisfying Criterion B). "Recurrent" sexual sadism involving
nonconsenting others (i.e., multiple victims, each on a separate
occasion) may, as general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims
on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying
this criterion, if there are multiple instances of infliction of pain
and suffering to the same victim, or if there is corroborating evidence
of a strong or preferential interest in pain and suffering involving
multiple victims. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are
a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis, as the
criteria may be met if the individual acknowledges intense sadistic
sexual interest. The Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs
or symptoms of sexual sadism must have persisted for at least 6 months,
should also be understood as a general guideline, not a strict
threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in inflicting pain and
suffering on nonconsenting victims is not merely transient. However, the
diagnosis may be met if there is a clearly sustained but shorter period
of sadistic behaviors.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The extensive use of
pornography involving the infliction of pain and suffering is sometimes
an associated feature of sexual sadism disorder.

Prevalence

The population prevalence of sexual sadism disorder is unknown8 and is
largely based on individuals in forensic settings. Depending on the
criteria for sexual sadism, prevalence varies widely, from 2% to 30%4.
Among civilly committed sexual offenders in the United States, less than
10% have sexual sadism. Among individuals who have committed sexually
motivated homicides, rates of sexual sadism disorder range from 37% to
75%4.

Development and Course Individuals with sexual sadism in forensic
samples are almost exclusively male4, but a representative sample of the
population in Australia reported that 2.2% of men and 1.3% of women said
they had been involved in bondage and discipline, "sadomasochism," or
dominance and submission in the previous year6. Information on the
development and course of sexual sadism disorder is extremely limited.
One study5 reported that females became aware of their sadomasochistic
interest as young adults, and another1 reported that the mean age at
onset of sadism in a group of males was 19.4 years. Whereas sexual
sadism per se is probably a lifelong characteristic, sexual sadism
disorder may fluctuate according to the individual's subjective distress
or his or her propensity to harm nonconsenting others. Advancing age is
likely to have the same reducing effect on this disorder as it has on
other paraphilic or normophilic sexual behavior.

Differential Diagnosis Many of the conditions that could be differential
diagnoses for sexual sadism disorder (e.g., antisocial personality
disorder, sexual masochism disorder, hypersexuality, substance use
disorders) sometimes occur also as comorbid diagnoses. Therefore, it is
necessary to carefully evaluate the evidence for sexual sadism disorder,
keeping the possibility of other paraphilias or mental disorders as part
of the differential diagnosis. The majority of individuals who are
active in community networks that practice sadistic and masochistic
behaviors do not express any dissatisfaction with their sexual
interests7, and their behavior would not meet DSM-5 criteria for sexual
sadism disorder. Sadistic interest, but not the disorder, may be
considered in the differential diagnosis.

Comorbidity Known comorbidities with sexual sadism disorder are largely
based on individuals (almost all males) convicted for criminal acts
involving sadistic acts against nonconsenting victims. Hence, these
comorbidities might not apply to all individuals who never engaged in
sadistic activity with a nonconsenting victim but who qualify for a
diagnosis of sexual sadism disorder based on subjective distress over
their sexual interest. Disorders that are commonly comorbid with sexual
sadism disorder include other paraphilic disorders1, 3.

Pedophilic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.2 (F65.4)

a.  Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually
    arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual
    activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13
    years or younger).
b.  The individual has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges
    or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.
c.  The individual is at least age 16 years and at least 5 years older
    than the child or children in Criterion A.
d.  Note: Do not include an individual in late adolescence involved in
    an ongoing sexual relationship with a 12- or 13-year-old. Specify
    whether: Exclusive type (attracted only to children) Nonexclusive
    type Specify if: Sexually attracted to males Sexually attracted to
    females Sexually attracted to both Specify if: Limited to incest

Diagnostic Features The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are
intended to apply both to individuals who freely disclose this
paraphilia and to individuals who deny any sexual attraction to
prepubertal children (generally age 13 years or younger), despite
substantial objective evidence to the contrary. Examples of disclosing
this paraphilia include candidly acknowledging an intense sexual
interest in children and indicating that sexual interest in children is

greater than or equal to sexual interest in physically mature
individuals. If individuals also complain that their sexual attractions
or preferences for children are causing psychosocial difficulties, they
may be diagnosed with pedophilic disorder. However, if they report an
absence of feelings of guilt, shame, or anxiety about these impulses and
are not functionally limited by their paraphilic impulses (according to
self-report, objective assessment, or both), and their self-reported and
legally recorded histories indicate that they have never acted on their
impulses, then these individuals have a pedophilic sexual interest but
not pedophilic disorder. Examples of individuals who deny attraction to
children include individuals who are known to have sexually approached
multiple children on separate occasions but who deny any urges or
fantasies about sexual behavior involving children, and who may further
claim that the known episodes of physical contact were all unintentional
and nonsexual. Other individuals may acknowledge past episodes of sexual
behavior involving children but deny any significant or sustained sexual
interest in children. Since these individuals may deny experiences
impulses or fantasies involving children, they may also deny feeling
subjectively distressed. Such individuals may still be diagnosed with
pedophilic disorder despite the absence of self-reported distress,
provided that there is evidence of recurrent behaviors persisting for 6
months (Criterion A) and evidence that the individual has acted on
sexual urges or experienced interpersonal difficulties as a consequence
of the disorder (Criterion B). Presence of multiple victims, as
discussed above, is sufficient but not necessary for diagnosis; that is,
the individual can still meet Criterion A by merely acknowledging
intense or preferential sexual interest in children. The Criterion A
clause, indicating that the signs or symptoms of pedophilia have
persisted for 6 months or longer, is intended to ensure that the sexual
attraction to children is not merely transient. However, the diagnosis
may be made if there is clinical evidence of sustained persistence of
the sexual attraction to children even if the 6-month duration cannot be
precisely determined.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis The extensive use of
pornography depicting prepubescent children is a useful diagnostic
indicator of pedophilic disorder10. This is a specific

instance of the general case that individuals are likely to choose the
kind of pornography that corresponds to their sexual interests.

Prevalence The population prevalence of pedophilic disorder is unknown4,
5. The highest possible prevalence for pedophilic disorder in the male
population is approximately 3%--5%8, 9. The population prevalence of
pedophilic disorder in females is even more uncertain, but it is likely
a small fraction of the prevalence in males4, 5, 9.

Development and Course Adult males with pedophilic disorder may indicate
that they become aware of strong or preferential sexual interest in
children around the time of puberty---the same time frame in which males
who later prefer physically mature partners became aware of their sexual
interest in women or men4, 5, 6. Attempting to diagnose pedophilic
disorder at the age at which it first manifests is problematic because
of the difficulty during adolescent development in differentiating it
from age-appropriate sexual interest in peers or from sexual curiosity.
Hence, Criterion C requires for diagnosis a minimum age of 16 years and
at least 5 years older than the child or children in Criterion A.
Pedophilia per se appears to be a lifelong condition5, 8. Pedophilic
disorder, however, necessarily includes other elements that may change
over time with or without treatment: subjective distress (e.g., guilt,
shame, intense sexual frustration, or feelings of isolation) or
psychosocial impairment, or the propensity to act out sexually with
children, or both. Therefore, the course of pedophilic disorder may
fluctuate, increase, or decrease with age. Adults with pedophilic
disorder may report an awareness of sexual interest in children that
preceded engaging in sexual behavior involving children or
self-identification as a pedophile7. Advanced age is as likely to
similarly diminish the frequency of sexual behavior involving children
as it does other paraphilically motivated and normophilic sexual
behavior1.

Risk and Prognostic Factors

Temperamental. There appears to be an interaction between pedophilia and
antisociality, such that males with both traits are more likely to act
out sexually with children8,9. Thus, antisocial personality disorder may
be considered a risk factor for pedophilic disorder in males with
pedophilia. Environmental. Adult males with pedophilia often report that
they were sexually abused as children4, 5, 8. It is unclear, however,
whether this correlation reflects a causal influence of childhood sexual
abuse on adult pedophilia. Genetic and physiological. Since pedophilia
is a necessary condition for pedophilic disorder, any factor that
increases the probability of pedophilia also increases the risk of
pedophilic disorder. There is some evidence that neurodevelopmental
perturbation in utero increases the probability of development of a
pedophilic interest3.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Psychophysiological laboratory measures
of sexual interest, which are sometimes useful in diagnosing pedophilic
disorder in males, are not necessarily useful in diagnosing this
disorder in females, even when an identical procedure (e.g., viewing
time) or analogous procedures (e.g., penile plethysmography and vaginal
photoplethysmography) are available.

Diagnostic Markers Psychophysiological measures of sexual interest may
sometimes be useful when an individual's history suggests the possible
presence of pedophilic disorder but the individual denies strong or
preferential attraction to children. The most thoroughly researched and
longest used of such measures is penile plethysmography2, 7, although
the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis may vary from one site to
another. Viewing time, using photographs of nude or minimally clothed
persons as visual stimuli, is also used to diagnose pedophilic disorder,
especially in combination with self-report measures2. Mental health
professionals in the United States, however, should be aware that
possession of such visual stimuli, even for diagnostic purposes, may
violate American law regarding possession of child pornography and leave
the mental health professional susceptible to criminal prosecution.

Differential Diagnosis Many of the conditions that could be differential
diagnoses for pedophilic disorder also sometimes occur as comorbid
diagnoses. It is therefore generally necessary to evaluate the evidence
for pedophilic disorder and other possible conditions as separate
questions. Antisocial personality disorder. This disorder increases the
likelihood that a person who is primarily attracted to the mature
physique will approach a child, on one or a few occasions, on the basis
of relative availability. The individual often shows other signs of this
personality disorder, such as recurrent law-breaking. Alcohol and
substance use disorders. The disinhibiting effects of intoxication may
also increase the likelihood that a person who is primarily attracted to
the mature physique will sexually approach a child. Obsessive-compulsive
disorder. There are occasional individuals who complain about
ego-dystonic thoughts and worries about possible attraction to children.
Clinical interviewing usually reveals an absence of sexual thoughts
about children during high states of sexual arousal (e.g., approaching
orgasm during masturbation) and sometimes additional egodystonic,
intrusive sexual ideas (e.g., concerns about homosexuality).

Comorbidity Psychiatric comorbidity of pedophilic disorder includes
substance use disorders; depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders;
antisocial personality disorder; and other paraphilic disorders2, 4, 5,
8. However, findings on comorbid disorders are largely among individuals
convicted for sexual offenses involving children (almost all males) and
may not be generalizable to other individuals with pedophilic disorder
(e.g., individuals who have never approached a child sexually but who
qualify for the diagnosis of pedophilic disorder on the basis of
subjective distress).

Fetishistic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.81 (F65.0)

a.  Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
    arousal from either the use of nonliving objects or a highly
    specific focus on nongenital body part(s), as manifested by
    fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
b.  The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically
    significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
    important

areas of functioning. c. The fetish objects are not limited to articles
of clothing used in crossdressing (as in transvestic disorder) or
devices specifically designed for the purpose of tactile genital
stimulation (e.g., vibrator). Specify: Body part(s) Nonliving object(s)
Other Specify if: In a controlled environment: This specifier is
primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other
settings where opportunities to engage in fetishistic behaviors are
restricted. In full remission: There has been no distress or impairment
in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning for at least 5
years while in an uncontrolled environment.

Specifiers Although individuals with fetishistic disorder may report
intense and recurrent sexual arousal to inanimate objects or a specific
body part, it is not unusual for non--mutually exclusive combinations of
fetishes to occur. Thus, an individual may have fetishistic disorder
associated with an inanimate object (e.g., female undergarments) or an
exclusive focus on an intensely eroticized body part (e.g., feet, hair),
or their fetishistic interest may meet criteria for various combinations
of these specifiers (e.g., socks, shoes and feet).

Diagnostic Features The paraphilic focus of fetishistic disorder
involves the persistent and repetitive use of or dependence on nonliving
objects or a highly specific focus on a (typically nongenital) body part
as primary elements associated with sexual arousal (Criterion A). A
diagnosis of fetishistic disorder must include clinically significant
personal distress or psychosocial role impairment (Criterion B). Common
fetish objects include female undergarments, male or female footwear,
rubber articles, leather clothing, or

other wearing apparel. Highly eroticized body parts associated with
fetishistic disorder include feet, toes, and hair. It is not uncommon
for sexualized fetishes to include both inanimate objects and body parts
(e.g., dirty socks and feet)6, 7, 9, 10, and for this reason the
definition of fetishistic disorder now re-incorporates partialism (i.e.,
an exclusive focus on a body part) into its boundaries. Partialism,
previously considered a paraphilia not otherwise specified disorder, had
historically been subsumed in fetishism prior to DSM-III8. Many
individuals who self-identify as fetishist practitioners do not
necessarily report clinical impairment in association with their
fetishassociated behaviors2, 6, 9, 10. Such individuals could be
considered as having a fetish but not fetishistic disorder. A diagnosis
of fetishistic disorder requires concurrent fulfillment of both the
behaviors in Criterion A and the clinically significant distress or
impairment in functioning noted in Criterion B.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Fetishistic disorder can be a
multisensory experience, including holding, tasting, rubbing, inserting,
or smelling the fetish object while masturbating, or preferring that a
sexual partner wear or utilize a fetish object during sexual
encounters2, 6, 9, 10. Some individuals may acquire extensive
collections of highly desired fetish objects.

Development and Course Usually paraphilias have an onset during puberty,
but fetishes can develop prior to adolescence. Once established,
fetishistic disorder tends to have a continuous course that fluctuates
in intensity and frequency of urges or behavior.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Knowledge of and appropriate
consideration for normative aspects of sexual behavior are important
factors to explore to establish a clinical diagnosis of fetishistic
disorder and to distinguish a clinical diagnosis from a socially
acceptable sexual behavior.

Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues

Fetishistic disorder has not been systematically reported to occur in
females. In clinical samples, fetishistic disorder is nearly exclusively
reported in males.

Functional Consequences of Fetishistic Disorder Typical impairments
associated with fetishistic disorder include sexual dysfunction during
romantic reciprocal relationships when the preferred fetish object or
body part is unavailable during foreplay or coitus. Some individuals
with fetishistic disorder may prefer solitary sexual activity associated
with their fetishistic preference(s) even while involved in a meaningful
reciprocal and affectionate relationship. Although fetishistic disorder
is relatively uncommon among arrested sexual offenders with
paraphilias1, 4, 5, males with fetishistic disorder may steal and
collect their particular fetishistic objects of desire2, 5. Such
individuals have been arrested and charged for nonsexual antisocial
behaviors (e.g., breaking and entering, theft, burglary) that are
primarily motivated by the fetishistic disorder.

Differential Diagnosis Transvestic disorder. The nearest diagnostic
neighbor of fetishistic disorder is transvestic disorder. As noted in
the diagnostic criteria, fetishistic disorder is not diagnosed when
fetish objects are limited to articles of clothing exclusively worn
during cross-dressing (as in transvestic disorder), or when the object
is genitally stimulating because it has been designed for that purpose
(e.g., a vibrator). Sexual masochism disorder or other paraphilic
disorders. Fetishes can co-occur with other paraphilic disorders,
especially "sadomasochism" 6, 10 and transvestic disorder3, 11. When an
individual fantasizes about or engages in "forced cross-dressing" and is
primarily sexually aroused by the domination or humiliation associated
with such fantasy or repetitive activity, the diagnosis of sexual
masochism disorder should be made. Fetishistic behavior without
fetishistic disorder. Use of a fetish object for sexual arousal without
any associated distress or psychosocial role impairment or other adverse
consequence would not meet criteria for fetishistic disorder, as the
threshold required by Criterion B would not be met. For example, an
individual whose sexual partner either shares or can

successfully incorporate his interest in caressing, smelling, or licking
feet or toes as an important element of foreplay would not be diagnosed
with fetishistic disorder; nor would an individual who prefers, and is
not distressed or impaired by, solitary sexual behavior associated with
wearing rubber garments or leather boots.

Comorbidity Fetishistic disorder may co-occur with other paraphilic
disorders as well as hypersexuality. Rarely, fetishistic disorder may be
associated with neurological conditions.

Transvestic Disorder Diagnostic Criteria

302.3 (F65.1)

a.  Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual
    arousal from cross-dressing, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or
    behaviors.
b.  The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically
    significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other
    important areas of functioning. Specify if: With fetishism: If
    sexually aroused by fabrics, materials, or garments. With
    autogynephilia: If sexually aroused by thoughts or images of self as
    female. Specify if: In a controlled environment: This specifier is
    primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other
    settings where opportunities to cross-dress are restricted. In full
    remission: There has been no distress or impairment in social,
    occupational, or other areas of functioning for at least 5 years
    while in an uncontrolled environment.

Specifiers The presence of fetishism decreases the likelihood of gender
dysphoria in men with transvestic disorder2. The presence of
autogynephilia increases the likelihood of gender dysphoria in men with
transvestic disorder2.

Diagnostic Features The diagnosis of transvestic disorder does not apply
to all individuals who dress as the opposite sex, even those who do so
habitually. It applies to individuals whose cross-dressing or thoughts
of cross-dressing are always or often accompanied by sexual excitement
(Criterion A) and who are

emotionally distressed by this pattern or feel it impairs social or
interpersonal functioning (Criterion B). The cross-dressing may involve
only one or two articles of clothing (e.g., for men, it may pertain only
to women's undergarments), or it may involve dressing completely in the
inner and outer garments of the other sex and (in men) may include the
use of women's wigs and make-up. Transvestic disorder is nearly
exclusively reported in males. Sexual arousal, in its most obvious form
of penile erection, may co-occur with cross-dressing in various ways. In
younger males, cross-dressing often leads to masturbation, following
which any female clothing is removed. Older males often learn to avoid
masturbating or doing anything to stimulate the penis so that the
avoidance of ejaculation allows them to prolong their cross-dressing
session. Males with female partners sometimes complete a cross-dressing
session by having intercourse with their partners, and some have
difficulty maintaining a sufficient erection for intercourse without
cross-dressing (or private fantasies of crossdressing). Clinical
assessment of distress or impairment, like clinical assessment of
transvestic sexual arousal, is usually dependent on the individual's
selfreport. The pattern of behavior "purging and acquisition" often
signifies the presence of distress in individuals with transvestic
disorder. During this behavioral pattern, an individual (usually a man)
who has spent a great deal of money on women's clothes and other apparel
(e.g., shoes, wigs) discards the items (i.e., purges them) in an effort
to overcome urges to cross-dress, and then begins acquiring a woman's
wardrobe all over again.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Transvestic disorder in men is
often accompanied by autogynephilia (i.e., a male's paraphilic tendency
to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of himself as a woman)1.
Autogynephilic fantasies and behaviors may focus on the idea of
exhibiting female physiological functions (e.g., lactation,
menstruation), engaging in stereotypically feminine behavior (e.g.,
knitting), or possessing female anatomy (e.g., breasts).

Prevalence The prevalence of transvestic disorder is unknown.
Transvestic disorder is rare in males and extremely rare in females.
Fewer than 3% of males report

having ever been sexually aroused by dressing in women's attire6. The
percentage of individuals who have cross-dressed with sexual arousal
more than once or a few times in their lifetimes would be even lower.
The majority of males with transvestic disorder identify as
heterosexual, although some individuals have occasional sexual
interaction with other males, especially when they are cross-dressed.

Development and Course In males, the first signs of transvestic disorder
may begin in childhood, in the form of strong fascination with a
particular item of women's attire. Prior to puberty, cross-dressing
produces generalized feelings of pleasurable excitement. With the
arrival of puberty, dressing in women's clothes begins to elicit penile
erection and, in some cases, leads directly to first ejaculation. In
many cases, cross-dressing elicits less and less sexual excitement as
the individual grows older; eventually it may produce no discernible
penile response at all. The desire to cross-dress, at the same time,
remains the same or grows even stronger. Individuals who report such a
diminution of sexual response typically report that the sexual
excitement of cross-dressing has been replaced by feelings of comfort or
well-being3, 4. In some cases, the course of transvestic disorder is
continuous, and in others it is episodic. It is not rare for men with
transvestic disorder to lose interest in cross-dressing when they first
fall in love with a woman and begin a relationship, but such abatement
usually proves temporary. When the desire to cross-dress returns, so
does the associated distress. Some cases of transvestic disorder
progress to gender dysphoria. The males in these cases, who may be
indistinguishable from others with transvestic disorder in adolescence
or early childhood, gradually develop desires to remain in the female
role for longer periods and to feminize their anatomy7. The development
of gender dysphoria is usually accompanied by a (self-reported)
reduction or elimination of sexual arousal in association with
cross-dressing. The manifestation of transvestism in penile erection and
stimulation, like the manifestation of other paraphilic as well as
normophilic sexual interests, is most intense in adolescence and early
adulthood. The severity of transvestic disorder is highest in adulthood,
when the transvestic drives are most likely to conflict with performance
in heterosexual intercourse and

desires to marry and start a family. Middle-age and older men with a
history of transvestism are less likely to present with transvestic
disorder than with gender dysphoria.

Functional Consequences of Transvestic Disorder Engaging in transvestic
behaviors can interfere with, or detract from, heterosexual
relationships. This can be a source of distress to men who wish to
maintain conventional marriages or romantic partnerships with women.

Differential Diagnosis Fetishistic disorder. This disorder may resemble
transvestic disorder, in particular, in men with fetishism who put on
women's undergarments while masturbating with them. Distinguishing
transvestic disorder depends on the individual's specific thoughts
during such activity (e.g., are there any ideas of being a woman, being
like a woman, or being dressed as a woman?) and on the presence of other
fetishes (e.g., soft, silky fabrics, whether these are used for garments
or for something else). Gender dysphoria. Individuals with transvestic
disorder do not report an incongruence between their experienced gender
and assigned gender nor a desire to be of the other gender; and they
typically do not have a history of childhood cross-gender behaviors,
which would be present in individuals with gender dysphoria. Individuals
with a presentation that meets full criteria for transvestic disorder as
well as gender dysphoria should be given both diagnoses.

Comorbidity Transvestism (and thus transvestic disorder) is often found
in association with other paraphilias. The most frequently co-occurring
paraphilias are fetishism and masochism8. One particularly dangerous
form of masochism, autoerotic asphyxia, is associated with transvestism
in a substantial proportion of fatal cases5.

Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder 302.89 (F65.89) This category
applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a
paraphilic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the
disorders in the paraphilic disorders diagnostic class. The other
specified paraphilic disorder category is used in situations in which
the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific paraphilic
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified paraphilic
disorder" followed by the specific reason (e.g., "zoophilia"). Examples
of presentations that can be specified using the "other specified"
designation include, but are not limited to, recurrent and intense
sexual arousal involving telephone scatologia (obscene phone calls),
necrophilia (corpses), zoophilia (animals), coprophilia (feces),
klismaphilia (enemas), or urophilia (urine) that has been present for at
least 6 months and causes marked distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other

important areas of functioning. Other specified paraphilic disorder can
be specified as in remission and/or as occurring in a controlled
environment.

Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder 302.9 (F65.9) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a paraphilic disorder
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the paraphilic
disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified paraphilic disorder category
is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the
reason that the criteria are not met for a specific paraphilic disorder,
and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to
make a more specific diagnosis.

Other Mental Disorders Four disorders are included in this chapter:
other specified mental disorder due to another medical condition;
unspecified mental disorder due to another medical condition; other
specified mental disorder; and unspecified mental disorder. This
residual category applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of a mental disorder that cause clinically significant
distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas
of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any
other mental disorder in DSM-5. For other specified and unspecified
mental disorders due to another medical condition, it must be
established that the disturbance is caused by the physiological effects
of another medical condition. If other specified and unspecified mental
disorders are due to another medical condition, it is necessary to code
and list the medical condition first (e.g., 042 \[B20\] HIV disease),
followed by the other specified or unspecified mental disorder (use
appropriate code).

Other Specified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 294.8
(F06.8) This category applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of a mental disorder due to another medical condition
that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any specific mental disorder attributable
to another medical condition. The other specified mental disorder due to
another medical condition category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific mental disorder
attributable to another medical condition. This is done by recording the
name of the disorder, with the specific etiological medical condition
inserted in place of "another medical condition," followed by the

specific symptomatic manifestation that does not meet the criteria for
any specific mental disorder due to another medical condition.
Furthermore, the diagnostic code for the specific medical condition must
be listed immediately before the code for the other specified mental
disorder due to another medical condition. For example, dissociative
symptoms due to complex partial seizures would be coded and recorded as
345.40 (G40.209) complex partial seizures, 294.8 (F06.8) other specified
mental disorder due to complex partial seizures, dissociative symptoms.
An example of a presentation that can be specified using the "other
specified" designation is the following: Dissociative symptoms: This
includes symptoms occurring, for example, in the context of complex
partial seizures.

Unspecified Mental Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition 294.9 (F09)
This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic
of a mental disorder due to another medical condition that cause
clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the
full criteria for any specific mental disorder due to another medical
condition. The unspecified mental disorder due to another medical
condition category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses
not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific
mental disorder due to another medical condition, and includes
presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more
specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings). This is done by
recording the name of the disorder, with the specific etiological
medical condition inserted in place of "another medical condition."
Furthermore, the diagnostic code for the specific medical condition must
be listed immediately before the code for the unspecified mental
disorder due to another medical condition. For example, dissociative
symptoms due to complex partial seizures would be coded and recorded as
345.40 (G40.209) complex partial seizures, 294.9 (F06.9) unspecified
mental disorder due to complex partial seizures.

Other Specified Mental Disorder 300.9 (F99) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a mental disorder that
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any specific mental disorder. The other
specified mental disorder category is used in situations in which the
clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the
presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific mental
disorder. This is done by recording "other specified mental disorder"
followed by the specific reason.

Unspecified Mental Disorder 300.9 (F99) This category applies to
presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a mental disorder that
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do
not meet the full criteria for any mental disorder. The unspecified
mental disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician
chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a
specific mental disorder, and includes presentations for which there is
insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in
emergency room settings).

Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of
Medication Medication-induced movement disorders are included in Section
II because of their frequent importance in 1) the management by
medication of mental disorders or other medical conditions and 2) the
differential diagnosis of mental disorders (e.g., anxiety disorder
versus neurolepticinduced akathisia; malignant catatonia versus
neuroleptic malignant syndrome). Although these movement disorders are
labeled "medication induced," it is often difficult to establish the
causal relationship between medication exposure and the development of
the movement disorder, especially because some of these movement
disorders also occur in the absence of medication exposure. The
conditions and problems listed in this chapter are not mental disorders.
The term neuroleptic is becoming outdated because it highlights the
propensity of antipsychotic medications to cause abnormal movements, and
it is being replaced with the term antipsychotic in many contexts.
Nevertheless, the term neuroleptic remains appropriate in this context.
Although newer antipsychotic medications may be less likely to cause
some medication-induced movement disorders, those disorders still occur.
Neuroleptic medications include so-called conventional, "typical," or
firstgeneration antipsychotic agents (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol,
fluphenazine); "atypical" or second-generation antipsychotic agents
(e.g., clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine); certain dopamine
receptor-- blocking drugs used in the treatment of symptoms such as
nausea and gastroparesis (e.g., prochlorperazine, promethazine,
trimethobenzamide, thiethylperazine, metoclopramide); and amoxapine,
which is marketed as an antidepressant.

Neuroleptic-Induced Parkinsonism Other Medication-Induced Parkinsonism
332.1 (G21.11) Neuroleptic-Induced Parkinsonism 332.1 (G21.19) Other
Medication-Induced Parkinsonism Parkinsonian tremor, muscular rigidity,
akinesia (i.e., loss of movement or difficulty initiating movement), or
bradykinesia (i.e., slowing movement) developing within a few weeks of
starting or raising the dosage of a medication (e.g., a neuroleptic) or
after reducing the dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal
symptoms.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome 333.92 (G21.0) Neuroleptic Malignant
Syndrome Although neuroleptic malignant syndrome is easily recognized in
its classic full-blown form, it is often heterogeneous in onset,
presentation, progression, and outcome1, 3, 5, 14, 18. The clinical
features described below are those considered most important in making
the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome based on consensus
recommendations8.

Diagnostic Features Patients have generally been exposed to a dopamine
antagonist within 72 hours prior to symptom development. Hyperthermia
(\>100.4°F or \>38.0°C on at least two occasions, measured orally),
associated with profuse diaphoresis, is a distinguishing feature of
neuroleptic malignant syndrome, setting it apart from other neurological
side effects of antipsychotic medications. Extreme elevations in
temperature, reflecting a breakdown in central thermoregulation, are
more likely to support the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Generalized rigidity, described as "lead pipe" in its most severe form
and usually unresponsive to antiparkinsonian agents, is a cardinal
feature of the disorder and may be associated with other neurological
symptoms (e.g., tremor, sialorrhea, akinesia, dystonia, trismus,
myoclonus, dysarthria, dysphagia, rhabdomyolysis). Creatine kinase
elevation of at least four times the upper limit of normal is commonly
seen. Changes in mental status, characterized by delirium or altered
consciousness ranging from stupor to coma, are often an early sign21.
Affected individuals may appear alert but dazed and unresponsive,

consistent with catatonic stupor. Autonomic activation and
instability--- manifested by tachycardia (rate \>25% above baseline),
diaphoresis, blood pressure elevation (systolic or diastolic ≥25% above
baseline) or fluctuation (≥20 mmHg diastolic change or ≥25 mmHg systolic
change within 24 hours), urinary incontinence, and pallor---may be seen
at any time but provide an early clue to the diagnosis7. Tachypnea (rate
\>50% above baseline) is common, and respiratory distress---resulting
from metabolic acidosis, hypermetabolism, chest wall restriction,
aspiration pneumonia, or pulmonary emboli---can occur and lead to sudden
respiratory arrest. A workup, including laboratory investigation, to
exclude other infectious, toxic, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric
etiologies or complications is essential5 (see the section "Differential
Diagnosis" later in this discussion). Although several laboratory
abnormalities are associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, no
single abnormality is specific to the diagnosis. Individuals with
neuroleptic malignant syndrome may have leukocytosis, metabolic
acidosis, hypoxia, decreased serum iron concentrations13, and elevations
in serum muscle enzymes and catecholamines. Findings from cerebrospinal
fluid analysis and neuroimaging studies are generally normal, whereas
electroencephalography shows generalized slowing. Autopsy findings in
fatal cases have been nonspecific and variable, depending on
complications.

Development and Course Evidence from database studies suggests incidence
rates for neuroleptic malignant syndrome of 0.01%--0.02% among
individuals treated with antipsychotics17, 19. The temporal progression
of signs and symptoms provides important clues to the diagnosis and
prognosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Alteration in mental status
and other neurological signs typically precede systemic signs21. The
onset of symptoms varies from hours to days after drug initiation. Some
cases develop within 24 hours after drug initiation, most within the
first week, and virtually all cases within 30 days4. Once the syndrome
is diagnosed and oral antipsychotic drugs are discontinued, neuroleptic
malignant syndrome is self-limited in most cases. The mean recovery time
after drug discontinuation is 7--10 days, with most individuals
recovering within 1 week and nearly all within 30 days4. The duration
may be prolonged when long-acting antipsychotics

are implicated. There have been reports of individuals in whom residual
neurological signs persisted for weeks after the acute hypermetabolic
symptoms resolved6. Total resolution of symptoms can be obtained in most
cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome; however, fatality rates of
10%-- 20% have been reported when the disorder is not recognized3.
Although many individuals do not experience a recurrence of neuroleptic
malignant syndrome when rechallenged with antipsychotic medication12,
some do, especially when antipsychotics are reinstituted soon after an
episode4, 15, 20.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a
potential risk in any individual after antipsychotic drug
administration. It is not specific to any neuropsychiatric diagnosis and
may occur in individuals without a diagnosable mental disorder who
receive dopamine antagonists. Clinical, systemic, and metabolic factors
associated with a heightened risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome
include agitation, exhaustion, dehydration, and iron deficiency13, 10,
16. A prior episode associated with antipsychotics has been described in
15%--20% of index cases, suggesting underlying vulnerability in some
patients4, 23, however, genetic findings based on neurotransmitter
receptor polymorphisms have not been replicated consistently. Nearly all
dopamine antagonists have been associated with neuroleptic malignant
syndrome, although high-potency antipsychotics pose a greater risk
compared with low-potency agents and newer atypical antipsychotics2, 9,
19, 22. Partial or milder forms may be associated with newer
antipsychotics, but neuroleptic malignant syndrome varies in severity
even with older drugs. Dopamine antagonists used in medical settings
(e.g., metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) have also been implicated.
Parenteral administration routes, rapid titration rates, and higher
total drug dosages have been associated with increased risk10, 16,
however, neuroleptic malignant syndrome usually occurs within the
therapeutic dosage range of antipsychotics.

Differential Diagnosis Neuroleptic malignant syndrome must be
distinguished from other serious neurological or medical conditions,
including central nervous system infections, inflammatory or autoimmune
conditions, status epilepticus,

subcortical structural lesions, and systemic conditions (e.g.,
pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, tetanus, heat stroke). Neuroleptic
malignant syndrome also must be distinguished from similar syndromes
resulting from the use of other substances or medications, such as
serotonin syndrome; parkinsonian hyperthermia syndrome following abrupt
discontinuation of dopamine agonists; alcohol or sedative withdrawal;
malignant hyperthermia occurring during anesthesia; hyperthermia
associated with abuse of stimulants and hallucinogens; and atropine
poisoning from anticholinergics. In rare instances, individuals with
schizophrenia or a mood disorder may present with malignant catatonia,
which may be indistinguishable from neuroleptic malignant syndrome11.
Some investigators consider neuroleptic malignant syndrome to be a
drug-induced form of malignant catatonia.

Medication-Induced Acute Dystonia 333.72 (G24.02) Medication-Induced
Acute Dystonia Abnormal and prolonged contraction of the muscles of the
eyes (oculogyric crisis), head, neck (torticollis or retrocollis),
limbs, or trunk developing within a few days of starting or raising the
dosage of a medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the
dosage of a medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.

Medication-Induced Acute Akathisia 333.99 (G25.71) Medication-Induced
Acute Akathisia Subjective complaints of restlessness, often accompanied
by observed excessive movements (e.g., fidgety movements of the legs,
rocking from foot to foot, pacing, inability to sit or stand still),
developing within a few weeks of starting or raising the dosage of a
medication (such as a neuroleptic) or after reducing the dosage of a
medication used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms.

Tardive Dyskinesia 333.85 (G24.01) Tardive Dyskinesia Involuntary
athetoid or choreiform movements (lasting at least a few weeks)
generally of the tongue, lower face and jaw, and extremities (but
sometimes involving the pharyngeal, diaphragmatic, or trunk muscles)
developing in association with the use of a neuroleptic medication for
at least a few months.

Symptoms may develop after a shorter period of medication use in older
persons. In some patients, movements of this type may appear after
discontinuation, or after change or reduction in dosage, of neuroleptic
medications, in which case the condition is called neuroleptic
withdrawalemergent dyskinesia. Because withdrawal-emergent dyskinesia is
usually time-limited, lasting less than 4--8 weeks, dyskinesia that
persists beyond this window is considered to be tardive dyskinesia.

Tardive Dystonia Tardive Akathisia 333.72 (G24.09) Tardive Dystonia
333.99 (G25.71) Tardive Akathisia Tardive syndrome involving other types
of movement problems, such as dystonia or akathisia, which are
distinguished by their late emergence in the course of treatment and
their potential persistence for months to years, even in the face of
neuroleptic discontinuation or dosage reduction.

Medication-Induced Postural Tremor 333.1 (G25.1) Medication-Induced
Postural Tremor Fine tremor (usually in the range of 8--12 Hz) occurring
during attempts to maintain a posture and developing in association with
the use of medication (e.g., lithium, antidepressants, valproate). This
tremor is very similar to the tremor seen with anxiety, caffeine, and
other stimulants.

Other Medication-Induced Movement Disorder 333.99 (G25.79) Other
Medication-Induced Movement Disorder This category is for
medication-induced movement disorders not captured by any of the
specific disorders listed above. Examples include 1) presentations
resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome that are associated with
medications other than neuroleptics and 2) other medication-induced
tardive conditions.

Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome 995.29 (T43.205A) Initial
encounter 995.29 (T43.205D) Subsequent encounter

995.29 (T43.205S) Sequelae Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is a
set of symptoms that can occur after an abrupt cessation (or marked
reduction in dose) of an antidepressant medication that was taken
continuously for at least 1 month. Symptoms generally begin within 2--4
days and typically include specific sensory, somatic, and
cognitive-emotional manifestations. Frequently reported sensory and
somatic symptoms include flashes of lights, "electric shock" sensations,
nausea, and hyperresponsivity to noises or lights. Nonspecific anxiety
and feelings of dread may also be reported. Symptoms are alleviated by
restarting the same medication or starting a different medication that
has a similar mechanism of action---for example, discontinuation
symptoms after withdrawal from a serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor may be alleviated by starting a tricyclic antidepressant. To
qualify as antidepressant discontinuation syndrome, the symptoms should
not have been present before the antidepressant dosage was reduced and
are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., manic or
hypomanic episode, substance intoxication, substance withdrawal, somatic
symptom disorder).

Diagnostic Features Discontinuation symptoms may occur following
treatment with tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine,
amitriptyline, desipramine), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g.,
fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(e.g., phenelzine, selegiline, pargyline)1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11. The incidence of this syndrome depends on the dosage and half-life
of the medication being taken, as well as the rate at which the
medication is tapered. Short-acting medications that are stopped
abruptly rather than tapered gradually may pose the greatest risk. The
short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is
the agent most commonly associated with discontinuation symptoms, but
such symptoms occur for all types of antidepressants4, 5, 11. Unlike
withdrawal syndromes associated with opioids, alcohol, and other
substances of abuse, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome has no
pathognomonic symptoms. Instead, the symptoms tend to be vague and
variable1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and typically begin 2--4 days
after the last dose of the antidepressant. For SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine),
symptoms such as

dizziness, ringing in the ears, "electric shocks in the head," an
inability to sleep, and acute anxiety are described. The antidepressant
use prior to discontinuation must not have incurred hypomania or
euphoria (i.e., there should be confidence that the discontinuation
syndrome is not the result of fluctuations in mood stability associated
with the previous treatment). The antidepressant discontinuation
syndrome is based solely on pharmacological factors and is not related
to the reinforcing effects of an antidepressant. Also, in the case of
stimulant augmentation of an antidepressant, abrupt cessation may result
in stimulant withdrawal symptoms (see "Stimulant Withdrawal" in the
chapter "Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders") rather than the
antidepressant discontinuation syndrome described here.

Prevalence The prevalence of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is
unknown but is thought to vary according to the dosage prior to
discontinuation, the halflife and receptor-binding affinity of the
medication, and possibly the individual's genetically influenced rate of
metabolism for this medication.

Course and Development Because longitudinal studies are lacking, little
is known about the clinical course of antidepressant discontinuation
syndrome. Symptoms appear to abate over time with very gradual dosage
reductions. After an episode, some individuals may prefer to resume
medication indefinitely if tolerated.

Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of antidepressant
discontinuation syndrome includes anxiety and depressive disorders,
substance use disorders, and tolerance to medications. Anxiety and
depressive disorders. Discontinuation symptoms often resemble symptoms
of a persistent anxiety disorder or a return of somatic symptoms of
depression for which the medication was initially given. Substance use
disorders. Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome differs from
substance withdrawal in that antidepressants themselves have no
reinforcing or euphoric effects. The medication dosage has usually not
been increased without the clinician's permission, and the individual

generally does not engage in drug-seeking behavior to obtain additional
medication. Criteria for a substance use disorder are not met.

Tolerance to medications Tolerance and discontinuation symptoms can
occur as a normal physiological response to stopping medication after a
substantial duration of exposure. Most cases of medication tolerance can
be managed through carefully controlled tapering.

Comorbidity Typically, the individual was initially started on the
medication for a major depressive disorder; the original symptoms may
return during the discontinuation syndrome.

severe hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and priapism.

Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention This
discussion covers other conditions and problems that may be a focus of
clinical attention or that may otherwise affect the diagnosis, course,
prognosis, or treatment of a patient's mental disorder. These conditions
are presented with their corresponding codes from ICD-9-CM (usually V
codes) and ICD-10-CM (usually Z codes). A condition or problem in this
chapter may be coded if it is a reason for the current visit or helps to
explain the need for a test, procedure, or treatment. Conditions and
problems in this chapter may also be included in the medical record as
useful information on circumstances that may affect the patient's care,
regardless of their relevance to the current visit. The conditions and
problems listed in this chapter are not mental disorders. Their
inclusion in DSM-5 is meant to draw attention to the scope of additional
issues that may be encountered in routine clinical practice and to
provide a systematic listing that may be useful to clinicians in
documenting these issues.

Relational Problems Key relationships, especially intimate adult partner
relationships and parent/caregiver-child relationships, have a
significant impact on the health of the individuals in these
relationships. These relationships can be health promoting and
protective, neutral, or detrimental to health outcomes. In the extreme,
these close relationships can be associated with maltreatment or
neglect, which has significant medical and psychological consequences
for the affected individual. A relational problem may come to clinical
attention either as the reason that the individual seeks health care or
as a problem that affects the course, prognosis, or treatment of the
individual's mental or other medical disorder.

Problems Related to Family Upbringing V61.20 (Z62.820) Parent-Child
Relational Problem For this category, the term parent is used to refer
to one of the child's primary caregivers, who may be a biological,
adoptive, or foster parent or may be another relative (such as a
grandparent) who fulfills a parental role for the child. This category
should be used when the main focus of clinical attention is to address
the quality of the parent-child relationship or when the quality of the
parent-child relationship is affecting the course, prognosis, or
treatment of a mental or other medical disorder. Typically, the
parentchild relational problem is associated with impaired functioning
in behavioral, cognitive, or affective domains. Examples of behavioral
problems include inadequate parental control, supervision, and
involvement with the child; parental overprotection; excessive parental
pressure; arguments that escalate to threats of physical violence; and
avoidance without resolution of problems. Cognitive problems may include
negative attributions of the other's intentions, hostility toward or
scapegoating of the other, and unwarranted feelings of estrangement.
Affective problems may include feelings of sadness, apathy, or anger
about the other individual in the relationship. Clinicians should take
into account the developmental needs of the child and the cultural
context. V61.8 (Z62.891) Sibling Relational Problem This category should
be used when the focus of clinical attention is a pattern of interaction
among siblings that is associated with significant impairment in
individual or family functioning or with development of symptoms in one
or more of the siblings, or when a sibling relational problem is
affecting the course, prognosis, or treatment of a sibling's mental or
other medical disorder. This category can be used for either children or
adults if the focus is on the sibling relationship. Siblings in this
context include full, half-, step-, foster, and adopted siblings. V61.8
(Z62.29) Upbringing Away From Parents This category should be used when
the main focus of clinical attention pertains to issues regarding a
child being raised away from the parents or when this separate
upbringing affects the course, prognosis, or treatment of a mental or
other medical disorder. The child could be one who is under state
custody and placed in kin care or foster care. The child could also be
one who is living in a nonparental relative's home, or with friends, but

whose out-of-home placement is not mandated or sanctioned by the courts.
Problems related to a child living in a group home or orphanage are also
included. This category excludes issues related to V60.6 (Z59.3)
children in boarding schools. V61.29 (Z62.898) Child Affected by
Parental Relationship Distress This category should be used when the
focus of clinical attention is the negative effects of parental
relationship discord (e.g., high levels of conflict, distress, or
disparagement) on a child in the family, including effects on the
child's mental or other medical disorders.

Other Problems Related to Primary Support Group V61.10 (Z63.0)
Relationship Distress With Spouse or Intimate Partner This category
should be used when the major focus of the clinical contact is to
address the quality of the intimate (spouse or partner) relationship or
when the quality of that relationship is affecting the course,
prognosis, or treatment of a mental or other medical disorder. Partners
can be of the same or different genders. Typically, the relationship
distress is associated with impaired functioning in behavioral,
cognitive, or affective domains. Examples of behavioral problems include
conflict resolution difficulty, withdrawal, and overinvolvement.
Cognitive problems can manifest as chronic negative attributions of the
other's intentions or dismissals of the partner's positive behaviors.
Affective problems would include chronic sadness, apathy, and/or anger
about the other partner. Note: This category excludes clinical
encounters for V61.1x (Z69.1x) mental health services for spousal or
partner abuse problems and V65.49 (Z70.9) sex counseling. V61.03 (Z63.5)
Disruption of Family by Separation or Divorce This category should be
used when partners in an intimate adult couple are living apart due to
relationship problems or are in the process of divorce. V61.8 (Z63.8)
High Expressed Emotion Level Within Family Expressed emotion is a
construct used as a qualitative measure of the "amount" of emotion---in
particular, hostility, emotional overinvolvement, and criticism directed
toward a family member who is an identified patient ---displayed in the
family environment. This category should be used when

a family's high level of expressed emotion is the focus of clinical
attention or is affecting the course, prognosis, or treatment of a
family member's mental or other medical disorder. V62.82 (Z63.4)
Uncomplicated Bereavement This category can be used when the focus of
clinical attention is a normal reaction to the death of a loved one. As
part of their reaction to such a loss, some grieving individuals present
with symptoms characteristic of a major depressive episode---for
example, feelings of sadness and associated symptoms such as insomnia,
poor appetite, and weight loss. The bereaved individual typically
regards the depressed mood as "normal," although the individual may seek
professional help for relief of associated symptoms such as insomnia or
anorexia. The duration and expression of "normal" bereavement vary
considerably among different cultural groups. Further guidance in
distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode is provided in the
criteria for major depressive episode.

Abuse and Neglect Maltreatment by a family member (e.g., caregiver,
intimate adult partner) or by a nonrelative can be the area of current
clinical focus, or such maltreatment can be an important factor in the
assessment and treatment of patients with mental or other medical
disorders. Because of the legal implications of abuse and neglect, care
should be used in assessing these conditions and assigning these codes.
Having a past history of abuse or neglect can influence diagnosis and
treatment response in a number of mental disorders, and may also be
noted along with the diagnosis. For the following categories, in
addition to listings of the confirmed or suspected event of abuse or
neglect, other codes are provided for use if the current clinical
encounter is to provide mental health services to either the victim or
the perpetrator of the abuse or neglect. A separate code is also
provided for designating a past history of abuse or neglect. Coding Note
for ICD-10-CM Abuse and Neglect Conditions For T codes only, the 7th
character should be coded as follows: A (initial encounter)---Use while
the patient is receiving active treatment for the condition (e.g.,
surgical treatment, emergency

department encounter, evaluation and treatment by a new clinician); or D
(subsequent encounter)---Use for encounters after the patient has
received active treatment for the condition and when he or she is
receiving routine care for the condition during the healing or recovery
phase (e.g., cast change or removal, removal of external or internal
fixation device, medication adjustment, other aftercare and follow-up
visits).

Child Maltreatment and Neglect Problems Child Physical Abuse Child
physical abuse is nonaccidental physical injury to a child---ranging
from minor bruises to severe fractures or death---occurring as a result
of punching, beating, kicking, biting, shaking, throwing, stabbing,
choking, hitting (with a hand, stick, strap, or other object), burning,
or any other method that is inflicted by a parent, caregiver, or other
individual who has responsibility for the child. Such injury is
considered abuse regardless of whether the caregiver intended to hurt
the child. Physical discipline, such as spanking or paddling, is not
considered abuse as long as it is reasonable and causes no bodily injury
to the child. Child Physical Abuse, Confirmed 995.54 (T74.12XA) Initial

Child Sexual Abuse Child sexual abuse encompasses any sexual act
involving a child that is intended to provide sexual gratification to a
parent, caregiver, or other individual who has responsibility for the
child. Sexual abuse includes activities such as fondling a child's
genitals, penetration, incest, rape, sodomy, and indecent exposure.
Sexual abuse also includes noncontact exploitation of a child by a
parent or caregiver---for example, forcing, tricking, enticing,
threatening, or pressuring a child to participate in acts for the sexual
gratification of others, without direct physical contact between child
and abuser. Child Sexual Abuse, Confirmed 995.53 (T74.22XA) Initial

Child Neglect Child neglect is defined as any confirmed or suspected
egregious act or omission by a child's parent or other caregiver that
deprives the child of basic age-appropriate needs and thereby results,
or has reasonable potential to result, in physical or psychological harm
to the child. Child neglect encompasses abandonment; lack of appropriate
supervision; failure to attend to necessary emotional or psychological
needs; and failure to provide necessary education, medical care,
nourishment, shelter, and/or clothing. Child Neglect, Confirmed 995.52

Child Psychological Abuse Child psychological abuse is nonaccidental
verbal or symbolic acts by a child's parent or caregiver that result, or
have reasonable potential to result, in significant psychological harm
to the child. (Physical and sexual abusive acts are not included in this
category.) Examples of psychological abuse of a child include berating,
disparaging, or humiliating the child; threatening the child;
harming/abandoning---or indicating that the alleged offender will
harm/abandon---people or things that the child cares about; confining
the child (as by tying a child's arms or legs together or binding a
child to furniture or another object, or confining a child to a small
enclosed area \[e.g., a closet\]); egregious scapegoating of the child;
coercing the child to inflict pain on himself or herself; and
disciplining the child excessively (i.e., at an extremely high frequency
or duration, even if not at a level of physical abuse) through physical
or nonphysical means. Child Psychological Abuse, Confirmed 995.51

Spouse or Partner Neglect Partner neglect is any egregious act or
omission in the past year by one partner that deprives a dependent
partner of basic needs and thereby results, or has reasonable potential
to result, in physical or psychological harm to

the dependent partner. This category is used in the context of
relationships in which one partner is extremely dependent on the other
partner for care or for assistance in navigating ordinary daily
activities---for example, a partner who is incapable of self-care owing
to substantial physical, psychological/intellectual, or cultural
limitations (e.g., inability to communicate with others and manage
everyday activities due to living in a foreign culture). Spouse or

teachers, school staff, or other students; and any other problems
related to education and/or literacy.

Occupational Problems V62.21 (Z56.82) Problem Related to Current
Military Deployment Status This category should be used when an
occupational problem directly related to an individual's military
deployment status is the focus of clinical attention or has an impact on
the individual's diagnosis, treatment, or prognosis. Psychological
reactions to deployment are not included in this category; such
reactions would be better captured as an adjustment disorder or another
mental disorder. V62.29 (Z56.9) Other Problem Related to Employment This
category should be used when an occupational problem is the focus of
clinical attention or has an impact on the individual's treatment or
prognosis. Areas to be considered include problems with employment or in
the work environment, including unemployment; recent change of job;
threat of job loss; job dissatisfaction; stressful work schedule;
uncertainty about career choices; sexual harassment on the job; other
discord with boss,

supervisor, co-workers, or others in the work environment; uncongenial
or hostile work environments; other psychosocial stressors related to
work; and any other problems related to employment and/or occupation.

Housing and Economic Problems Housing Problems V60.0 (Z59.0)
Homelessness This category should be used when lack of a regular

station, mall), a building not intended for residential use (e.g.,
abandoned structure, unused factory), a cardboard box or cave, or some
other ad hoc housing situation. V60.1 (Z59.1) Inadequate Housing This
category should be used when lack of adequate housing has an impact on
an individual's treatment or prognosis. Examples of inadequate housing
conditions include lack of heat (in cold temperatures) or electricity,
infestation by insects or rodents, inadequate plumbing and toilet

prognosis. Examples of such transitions include entering or completing
school, leaving parental control, getting married, starting a new
career, becoming a parent, adjusting to an "empty nest" after children
leave home, and retiring. V60.3 (Z60.2) Problem Related to Living Alone
This category should be used when a problem associated with living alone
is the focus of clinical attention or has an impact on the individual's

activities of daily living (e.g., irregular meal and sleep schedules,
inconsistent performance of home maintenance chores). V62.4 (Z60.3)
Acculturation Difficulty This category should be used when difficulty in
adjusting to a new culture (e.g., following migration) is the focus of
clinical attention or has an impact on the individual's treatment or

Lifestyle This category should be used when a lifestyle problem is a
specific focus of treatment or directly affects the course, prognosis,
or treatment of a mental or other medical disorder. Examples of
lifestyle problems include lack of physical exercise, inappropriate
diet, high-risk sexual behavior, and poor sleep hygiene. A problem that
is attributable to a symptom of a mental disorder should not be coded
unless that problem is a specific focus of treatment or directly affects
the course, prognosis, or treatment of the individual. In such cases,
both the mental disorder and the lifestyle problem should be coded.
V71.01 (Z72.811) Adult Antisocial Behavior This category can be used
when the focus of clinical attention is adult antisocial behavior that
is not due to a mental disorder (e.g., conduct disorder, antisocial
personality disorder). Examples include the behavior of some
professional thieves, racketeers, or dealers in illegal substances.
V71.02 (Z72.810) Child or Adolescent Antisocial Behavior This category
can be used when the focus of clinical attention is antisocial behavior
in a child or adolescent that is not due to a mental disorder (e.g.,

intermittent explosive disorder, conduct disorder). Examples include
isolated antisocial acts by children or adolescents (not a pattern of
antisocial behavior).

Nonadherence to Medical Treatment V15.81 (Z91.19) Nonadherence to
Medical Treatment This category can be used when the focus of clinical
attention is nonadherence to an important aspect of treatment for a
mental disorder or another medical condition. Reasons for such
nonadherence may include discomfort resulting from treatment (e.g.,
medication side effects), expense of treatment, personal value judgments
or religious or cultural beliefs about the proposed treatment,
age-related debility, and the presence of a mental disorder (e.g.,
schizophrenia, personality disorder). This category should be used only
when the problem is sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical
attention and does not meet diagnostic criteria for psychological
factors affecting other medical conditions. 278.00 (E66.9) Overweight or
Obesity This category may be used when overweight or obesity is a focus
of clinical attention. V65.2 (Z76.5) Malingering The essential feature
of malingering is the intentional production of false or grossly
exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external
incentives such as avoiding military duty, avoiding work, obtaining
financial compensation, evading criminal prosecution, or obtaining
drugs. Under some circumstances, malingering may represent adaptive
behavior--- for example, feigning illness while a captive of the enemy
during wartime. Malingering should be strongly suspected if any
combination of the following is noted:

1. Medicolegal context of presentation (e.g., the individual is referred
by an attorney to the clinician for examination, or the individual
selfrefers while litigation or criminal charges are pending). 2. Marked
discrepancy between the individual's claimed stress or disability and
the objective findings and observations. 3. Lack of cooperation during
the diagnostic evaluation and in complying with the prescribed treatment
regimen. 4. The presence of antisocial personality disorder. Malingering
differs from factitious disorder in that the motivation for the symptom
production in malingering is an external incentive, whereas in
factitious disorder external incentives are absent. Malingering is
differentiated from conversion disorder and somatic symptom--related
mental disorders by the intentional production of symptoms and by the
obvious external incentives associated with it. Definite evidence of
feigning (such as clear evidence that loss of function is present during
the examination but not at home) would suggest a diagnosis of factitious
disorder if the individual's apparent aim is to assume the sick role, or
malingering if it is to obtain an incentive, such as money. V40.31
(Z91.83) Wandering Associated With a Mental Disorder This category is
used for individuals with a mental disorder whose desire to walk about
leads to significant clinical management or safety concerns. For
example, individuals with major neurocognitive or neurodevelopmental
disorders may experience a restless urge to wander that places them at
risk for falls and causes them to leave supervised settings without
needed accompaniment. This category excludes individuals whose intent is
to escape an unwanted housing situation (e.g., children who are running
away from home, patients who no longer wish to remain in the hospital)
or those who walk or pace as a result of medication-induced akathisia.
Coding note: First code associated mental disorder (e.g., major
neurocognitive disorder, autism spectrum disorder), then code V40.31
(Z91.83) wandering associated with \[specific mental disorder\]. V62.89
(R41.83) Borderline Intellectual Functioning This category can be used
when an individual's borderline intellectual functioning is the focus of
clinical attention or has an impact on the

individual's treatment or prognosis. Differentiating borderline
intellectual functioning and mild intellectual disability (intellectual
developmental disorder) requires careful assessment of intellectual and
adaptive functions and their discrepancies, particularly in the presence
of co-occurring mental disorders that may affect patient compliance with
standardized testing procedures (e.g., schizophrenia or
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder with severe impulsivity).

This section contains tools and techniques to enhance the clinical
decisionmaking process, understand the cultural context of mental
disorders, and recognize emerging diagnoses for further study. It
provides strategies to enhance clinical practice and new criteria to
stimulate future research, representing a dynamic DSM-5 that will evolve
with advances in the field. Among the tools in Section III is a Level 1
cross-cutting self/informantrated measure that serves as a review of
systems across mental disorders. A clinician-rated severity scale for
schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders also is provided, as well as
the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, Version 2
(WHODAS 2.0). Level 2 severity measures are available online
(www.psychiatry.org/dsm5) and may be used to explore significant
responses to the Level 1 screen. A comprehensive review of the cultural
context of mental disorders, and the Cultural Formulation Interview
(CFI) for clinical use, are provided. Proposed disorders for future
study are provided, which include a new model for the diagnosis of
personality disorders as an alternative to the established diagnostic
criteria; the proposed model incorporates impairments in personality
functioning as well as pathological personality traits. Also included
are new conditions that are the focus of active research, such as
attenuated psychosis syndrome and nonsuicidal selfinjury.

Assessment Measures A growing body of scientific evidence favors
dimensional concepts in the diagnosis of mental disorders. The
limitations of a categorical approach to diagnosis include the failure
to find zones of rarity between diagnoses (i.e., delineation of mental
disorders from one another by natural boundaries), the need for
intermediate categories like schizoaffective disorder, high rates of
comorbidity, frequent not-otherwisespecified (NOS) diagnoses, relative
lack of utility in furthering the identification of unique antecedent
validators for most mental disorders, and lack of treatment specificity
for the various diagnostic categories. From both clinical and research
perspectives, there is a need for a more dimensional approach that can
be combined with DSM's set of categorical diagnoses. Such an approach
incorporates variations of features within an individual (e.g.,
differential severity of individual symptoms both within and outside of
a disorder's diagnostic criteria as measured by intensity, duration, or
number of symptoms, along with other features such as type and severity
of disabilities) rather than relying on a simple yes-or-no approach. For
diagnoses for which all symptoms are needed for a diagnosis (a
monothetic criteria set), different severity levels of the constituent
symptoms may be noted. If a threshold endorsement of multiple symptoms
is needed, such as at least five of nine symptoms for major depressive
disorder (a polythetic criteria set), both severity levels and different
combinations of the criteria may identify more homogeneous diagnostic
groups. A dimensional approach depending primarily on an individual's
subjective reports of symptom experiences along with the clinician's
interpretation is consistent with current diagnostic practice. It is
expected that as our understanding of basic disease mechanisms based on
pathophysiology, neurocircuitry, gene-environment interactions, and
laboratory tests increases, approaches that integrate both objective and
subjective patient data will be developed to supplement and enhance the
accuracy of the diagnostic process. Cross-cutting symptom measures
modeled on general medicine's review of systems can serve as an approach
for reviewing critical psychopathological domains. The general medical
review of systems is crucial to detecting subtle changes in different
organ systems that can facilitate diagnosis and treatment. A similar
review of various mental functions can aid in a more comprehensive
mental status assessment by drawing attention to symptoms that may not
fit neatly into the diagnostic criteria suggested by the individual's
presenting symptoms, but may nonetheless be important to the
individual's care. The crosscutting measures have two levels: Level 1
questions are a brief survey of 13 symptom domains for adult patients
and 12 domains for child and adolescent patients. Level 2 questions
provide a more in-depth assessment of certain domains. These measures
were developed to be administered both at initial interview and over
time to track the patient's symptom status and response to treatment.
Severity measures are disorder-specific, corresponding closely to the
criteria that constitute the disorder definition. They may be
administered to individuals who have received a diagnosis or who have a
clinically significant syndrome that falls short of meeting full
criteria for a diagnosis. Some of the assessments are selfcompleted by
the individual, while others require a clinician to complete. As with
the cross-cutting symptom measures, these measures were developed to be
administered both at initial interview and over time to track the
severity of the individual's disorder and response to treatment. The
World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, Version 2.0
(WHODAS 2.0) was developed to assess a patient's ability to perform
activities in six areas: understanding and communicating; getting
around; self-care; getting along with people; life activities (e.g.,
household, work/school); and participation in society. The scale is
self-administered and was developed to be used in patients with any
medical disorder. It corresponds to concepts contained in the WHO
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. This
assessment can also be used over time to track changes in a patient's
disabilities. This chapter focuses on the DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting
Symptom Measure (adult self-rated and parent/guardian versions); the
Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity; and the WHODAS
2.0. Clinician instructions, scoring information, and interpretation
guidelines are included for

each. These measures and additional dimensional assessments, including
those for diagnostic severity, can be found online at
www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.

Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure The
DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure is a patient- or
informant-rated measure that assesses mental health domains that are
important across psychiatric diagnoses. It is intended to help
clinicians identify additional areas of inquiry that may have
significant impact on the individual's treatment and prognosis. In
addition, the measure may be used to track changes in the individual's
symptom presentation over time. The adult version of the measure
consists of 23 questions that assess 13 psychiatric domains, including
depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation,
psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors,
dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use (Table 1). Each
domain consists of one to three questions. Each item inquires about how
much (or how often) the individual has been bothered by the specific
symptom during the past 2 weeks. If the individual is of impaired
capacity and unable to complete the form (e.g., an individual with
dementia), a knowledgeable adult informant may complete this measure.
The measure was found to be clinically useful and to have good
reliability in the DSM-5 field trials that were conducted in adult
clinical samples across the United States and in Canada1, 2. The
parent/guardian-rated version of the measure (for children ages 6--17)
consists of 25 questions that assess 12 psychiatric domains, including
depression, anger, irritability, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms,
inattention, suicidal ideation/attempt, psychosis, sleep disturbance,
repetitive thoughts and behaviors, and substance use (Table 2). Each
item asks the parent or guardian to rate how much (or how often) his or
her child has been bothered by the specific psychiatric symptom during
the past 2 weeks. The measure was also found to be clinically useful and
to have good reliability in the DSM-5 field trials that were conducted
in pediatric clinical samples across the United States 3. For children
ages 11--17, along with the parent/guardian rating of the child's
symptoms, the clinician may consider having the child complete the
child-rated version of the measure. The child-rated version of the
measure can be found online at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5. Scoring and
interpretation. On the adult self-rated version of the measure, each
item is rated on a 5-point scale (0=none or not at all; 1=slight or
rare, less than a day or two; 2=mild or several days; 3=moderate or more
than half the days; and 4=severe or nearly every day). The score on each
item within a domain should be reviewed. However, a rating of mild
(i.e., 2) or greater on any item within a domain, except for substance
use, suicidal ideation, and psychosis, may serve as a guide for
additional inquiry and follow-up to determine if a more detailed
assessment is necessary, which may include the Level 2 cross-cutting
symptom assessment for the domain (see Table 1). For substance use,
suicidal ideation, and psychosis, a rating of slight (i.e., 1) or
greater on any item within the domain may serve as a guide for
additional inquiry and follow-up to determine if a more detailed
assessment is needed. As such, indicate the highest score within a
domain in the "Highest domain score" column. Table 1 outlines threshold
scores that may guide further inquiry for the remaining domains.

Note. National Institute on Drug Abuse.aAvailable at
www.psychiatry.org/dsm5. On the parent/guardian-rated version of the
measure (for children ages 6--17), 19 of the 25 items are each rated on
a 5-point scale (0=none or not at all; 1=slight or rare, less than a day
or two; 2=mild or several days; 3=moderate or more than half the days;
and 4=severe or nearly every day). The suicidal ideation, suicide
attempt, and substance abuse items are each rated on a "Yes, No, or
Don't Know" scale. The score on each item within a domain should be
reviewed. However, with the exception of inattention and psychosis, a
rating of mild (i.e., 2) or greater on any item within a domain that is
scored on the 5-point scale may serve as a guide for additional inquiry
and follow-up to determine if a more detailed assessment is necessary,
which may include the Level 2 cross-cutting symptom assessment for the
domain (see Table 2). For inattention or psychosis, a rating of slight
or greater (i.e., 1 or greater) may be used as an indicator for
additional inquiry. A parent or guardian's rating of "Don't Know" on the
suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and any of the substance use items,
especially for children ages 11--17 years, may result in additional
probing of the issues with the child, including using the child-rated
Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure for the relevant domain. Because
additional inquiry is made on the basis of the highest score on any item
within a domain, clinicians should indicate that score in the "Highest
Domain Score" column. Table 2 outlines threshold scores that may guide
further inquiry for the remaining domains.

Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures Any threshold scores on the Level
1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure (as noted in Tables 1 and 2 and
described in "Scoring and Interpretation" indicate a possible need for
detailed clinical inquiry. Level 2 CrossCutting Symptom Measures provide
one method of obtaining more in-depth information on potentially
significant symptoms to inform diagnosis, treatment planning, and
follow-up. They are available online at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5. Tables
1 and 2 outline each Level 1 domain and identify the domains for which
DSM-5 Level 2 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures are available for more
detailed assessments. Adult and pediatric (parent and child) versions
are available online for most Level 1 symptom domains at
www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.

Frequency of Use of the Cross-Cutting Symptom Measures To track change
in the individual's symptom presentation over time, the Level 1 and
relevant Level 2 crosscutting symptom measures may be completed at
regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability of
the individual's symptoms and treatment status. For individuals with
impaired capacity and for children ages 6--17 years, it is preferable
for the measures to be completed at follow-up appointments by the same
knowledgeable informant and by the same parent or guardian. Consistently
high scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and
problematic symptoms for the individual that might warrant further
assessment, treatment, and follow-up. Clinical judgment should guide
decision making.

Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity As described in
the chapter "Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders,"
psychotic disorders are heterogeneous, and symptom severity can predict
important aspects of the illness, such as the degree of cognitive and/or
neurobiological deficits1. Dimensional assessments capture meaningful
variation in the severity of symptoms, which may help with treatment
planning, prognostic decision-making, and research on pathophysiological
mechanisms. The Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity
provides scales for the dimensional assessment of the primary symptoms
of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech,
abnormal psychomotor behavior, and negative symptoms. A scale for the
dimensional assessment of cognitive impairment is also included. Many
individuals with psychotic disorders have impairments in a range of
cognitive domains5, which predict functional abilities3. In addition,
scales for dimensional assessment of depression and mania are provided,
which may alert clinicians to mood pathology. The severity of mood
symptoms in psychosis has prognostic value2 and guides treatment4. The
Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity is an 8-item
measure that may be completed by the clinician at the time of the
clinical assessment. Each item asks the clinician to rate the severity
of each symptom as experienced by the individual during the past 7 days.

Scoring and Interpretation Each item on the measure is rated on a
5-point scale (0=none; 1=equivocal; 2=present, but mild; 3=present and
moderate; and 4=present and severe) with a symptom-specific definition
of each rating level. The clinician may review all of the individual's
available information and, based on clinical judgment, select

(with checkmark) the level that most accurately describes the severity
of the individual's condition. The clinician then indicates the score
for each item in the "Score" column provided.

Frequency of Use To track changes in the individual's symptom severity
over time, the measure may be completed at regular intervals as
clinically indicated, depending on the stability of the individual's
symptoms and treatment status. Consistently high scores on a particular
domain may indicate significant and problematic areas for the individual
that might warrant further assessment, treatment, and follow-up.
Clinical judgment should guide decision making.

World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 The adult
self-administered version of the World Health Organization Disability
Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) is a 36-item measure that assesses
disability in adults age 18 years and older. It assesses disability
across six domains, including understanding and communicating, getting
around, self-care, getting along with people, life activities (i.e.,
household, work, and/or school activities), and participation in
society. If the adult individual is of impaired capacity and unable to
complete the form (e.g., a patient with dementia), a knowledgeable
informant may complete the proxy-administered version of the measure,
which is available at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5. Each item on the
self-administered version of the WHODAS 2.0 asks the individual to rate
how much difficulty he or she has had in specific areas of functioning
during the past 30 days.

WHODAS 2.0 Scoring Instructions Provided by WHO WHODAS 2.0 summary
scores. There are two basic options for computing the summary scores for
the WHODAS 2.0 36-item full version. Simple: The scores assigned to each
of the items---"none" (1), "mild" (2), "moderate" (3), "severe" (4), and
"extreme" (5)---are summed. This method is referred to as simple scoring
because the scores from each of the items are simply added up without
recoding or collapsing of response categories; thus, there is no
weighting of individual items. This approach is practical to use as a
hand-scoring approach, and may be the method of choice in busy clinical
settings or in paper-and-pencil interview situations. As a result, the
simple sum of the scores of the items across all domains constitutes a
statistic that is sufficient to describe the degree of functional
limitations. Complex: The more complex method of scoring is called
"item-response-theory" (IRT)--based scoring. It takes into account
multiple levels of difficulty for each WHODAS 2.0 item. It takes the
coding for each item response as "none," "mild," "moderate," "severe,"
and "extreme" separately, and then uses a computer to determine the
summary score by differentially weighting the items and the levels of
severity. The computer program is available from the WHO Web site. The
scoring has three steps: Step 1---Summing of recoded item scores within
each domain. Step 2---Summing of all six domain scores. Step
3---Converting the summary score into a metric ranging from 0 to 100
(where 0=no disability; 100=full disability). WHODAS 2.0 domain scores.
WHODAS 2.0 produces domain-specific scores for six different functioning
domains: cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities
(household and work/school), and participation. WHODAS 2.0 population
norms. For the population norms for IRT-based scoring of the WHODAS 2.0
and for the population distribution of IRT-based scores for WHODAS 2.0,

Additional Scoring and Interpretation Guidance for DSM-5 Users

The clinician is asked to review the individual's response on each item
on the measure during the clinical interview and to indicate the
self-reported score for each item in the section provided for "Clinician
Use Only." However, if the clinician determines that the score on an
item should be different based on the clinical interview and other
information available, he or she may indicate a corrected score in the
raw item score box. Based on findings from the DSM-5 Field Trials in
adult patient samples across six sites in the United States and one in
Canada, DSM-5 recommends calculation and use of average scores for each
domain and for general disability. The average scores are comparable to
the WHODAS 5-point scale, which allows the clinician to think of the
individual's disability in terms of none (1), mild (2), moderate (3),
severe (4), or extreme (5). The average domain and general disability
scores were found to be reliable, easy to use, and clinically useful to
the clinicians in the DSM-5 Field Trials. The average domain score is
calculated by dividing the raw domain score by the number of items in
the domain (e.g., if all the items within the "understanding and
communicating" domain are rated as being moderate, then the average
domain score would be 18/6=3, indicating moderate disability). The
average general disability score is calculated by dividing the raw
overall score by number of items in the measure (i.e., 36). The
individual should be encouraged to complete all of the items on the
WHODAS 2.0. If no response is given on 10 or more items of the measure
(i.e., more than 25% of the 36 total items), calculation of the simple
and average general disability scores may not be helpful. If 10 or more
of the total items on the measure are missing but the items for some of
the domains are 75%--100% complete, the simple or average domain scores
may be used for those domains. Frequency of use. To track change in the
individual's level of disability over time, the measure may be completed
at regular intervals as clinically indicated, depending on the stability
of the individual's symptoms and treatment status. Consistently high
scores on a particular domain may indicate significant and problematic
areas for the individual that might warrant further assessment and
intervention.

Cultural Formulation Understanding the cultural context of illness
experience is essential for effective diagnostic assessment and clinical
management. Culture refers to systems of knowledge, concepts, rules, and
practices that are learned and transmitted across generations. Culture
includes language, religion and spirituality, family structures,
life-cycle stages, ceremonial rituals, and customs, as well as moral and
legal systems. Cultures are open, dynamic systems that undergo
continuous change over time; in the contemporary world, most individuals
and groups are exposed to multiple cultures, which they use to fashion
their own identities and make sense of experience. These features of
culture make it crucial not to overgeneralize cultural information or
stereotype groups in terms of fixed cultural traits. Race is a
culturally constructed category of identity that divides humanity into
groups based on a variety of superficial physical traits attributed to
some hypothetical intrinsic, biological characteristics. Racial
categories and constructs have varied widely over history and across
societies. The construct of race has no consistent biological
definition, but it is socially important because it supports racial
ideologies, racism, discrimination, and social exclusion, which can have
strong negative effects on mental health. There is evidence that racism
can exacerbate many psychiatric disorders, contributing to poor outcome,
and that racial biases can affect diagnostic assessment. Ethnicity is a
culturally constructed group identity used to define peoples and
communities. It may be rooted in a common history, geography, language,
religion, or other shared characteristics of a group, which distinguish
that group from others. Ethnicity may be self-assigned or attributed by
outsiders. Increasing mobility, intermarriage, and intermixing of
cultures has defined new mixed, multiple, or hybrid ethnic identities.
Culture, race, and ethnicity are related to economic inequities, racism,
and discrimination that result in health disparities. Cultural, ethnic,
and racial identities can be sources of strength and group support that
enhance resilience, but they may also lead to psychological,
interpersonal, and

intergenerational conflict or difficulties in adaptation that require
diagnostic assessment.

Outline for Cultural Formulation The Outline for Cultural Formulation
introduced in DSM-IV provided a framework for assessing information
about cultural features of an individual's mental health problem and how
it relates to a social and cultural context and history. DSM-5 not only
includes an updated version of the Outline but also presents an approach
to assessment, using the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI), which has
been field-tested for diagnostic usefulness among clinicians and for
acceptability among patients. The revised Outline for Cultural
Formulation calls for systematic assessment of the following categories:
Cultural identity of the individual: Describe the individual's racial,
ethnic, or cultural reference groups that may influence his or her
relationships with others, access to resources, and developmental and
current challenges, conflicts, or predicaments. For immigrants and
racial or ethnic minorities, the degree and kinds of involvement with
both the culture of origin and the host culture or majority culture
should be noted separately. Language abilities, preferences, and
patterns of use are relevant for identifying difficulties with access to
care, social integration, and the need for an interpreter. Other
clinically relevant aspects of identity may include religious
affiliation, socioeconomic background, personal and family places of
birth and growing up, migrant status, and sexual orientation. Cultural
conceptualizations of distress: Describe the cultural constructs that
influence how the individual experiences, understands, and communicates
his or her symptoms or problems to others. These constructs may include
cultural syndromes, idioms of distress, and explanatory models or
perceived causes. The level of severity and meaning of the distressing
experiences should be assessed in relation to the norms of the
individual's cultural reference groups. Assessment of coping and
help-seeking patterns should consider the use of professional as well as
traditional, alternative, or complementary sources of care.

Psychosocial stressors and cultural features of vulnerability and
resilience: Identify key stressors and supports in the individual's
social environment (which may include both local and distant events) and
the role of religion, family, and other social networks (e.g., friends,
neighbors, coworkers) in providing emotional, instrumental, and
informational support. Social stressors and social supports vary with
cultural interpretations of events, family structure, developmental
tasks, and social context. Levels of functioning, disability, and
resilience should be assessed in light of the individual's cultural
reference groups. Cultural features of the relationship between the
individual and the clinician: Identify differences in culture, language,
and social status between an individual and clinician that may cause
difficulties in communication and may influence diagnosis and treatment.
Experiences of racism and discrimination in the larger society may
impede establishing trust and safety in the clinical diagnostic
encounter. Effects may include problems eliciting symptoms,
misunderstanding of the cultural and clinical significance of symptoms
and behaviors, and difficulty establishing or maintaining the rapport
needed for an effective clinical alliance. Overall cultural assessment:
Summarize the implications of the components of the cultural formulation
identified in earlier sections of the Outline for diagnosis and other
clinically relevant issues or problems as well as appropriate management
and treatment intervention.

Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI) The Cultural Formulation Interview
(CFI) is a set of 16 questions that clinicians may use to obtain
information during a mental health assessment about the impact of
culture on key aspects of an individual's clinical presentation and
care. In the CFI, culture refers to The values, orientations, knowledge,
and practices that individuals derive from membership in diverse social
groups (e.g., ethnic groups, faith communities, occupational groups,
veterans groups).

Aspects of an individual's background, developmental experiences, and
current social contexts that may affect his or her perspective, such as
geographical origin, migration, language, religion, sexual orientation,
or race/ethnicity. The influence of family, friends, and other community
members (the individual's social network) on the individual's illness
experience. The CFI is a brief semistructured interview for
systematically assessing cultural factors in the clinical encounter that
may be used with any individual. The CFI focuses on the individual's
experience and the social contexts of the clinical problem. The CFI
follows a person-centered approach to cultural assessment by eliciting
information from the individual about his or her own views and those of
others in his or her social network. This approach is designed to avoid
stereotyping, in that each individual's cultural knowledge affects how
he or she interprets illness experience and guides how he or she seeks
help. Because the CFI concerns the individual's personal views, there
are no right or wrong answers to these questions. The interview follows
and is available online at www.psychiatry.org/dsm5. The CFI is formatted
as two text columns. The left-hand column contains the instructions for
administering the CFI and describes the goals for each interview domain.
The questions in the right-hand column illustrate how to explore these
domains, but they are not meant to be exhaustive. Follow-up questions
may be needed to clarify individuals' answers. Questions may be
rephrased as needed. The CFI is intended as a guide to cultural
assessment and should be used flexibly to maintain a natural flow of the
interview and rapport with the individual. The CFI is best used in
conjunction with demographic information obtained prior to the interview
in order to tailor the CFI questions to address the individual's
background and current situation. Specific demographic domains to be
explored with the CFI will vary across individuals and settings. A
comprehensive assessment may include place of birth, age, gender,
racial/ethnic origin, marital status, family composition, education,
language fluencies, sexual orientation, religious or spiritual
affiliation, occupation, employment, income, and migration history. The
CFI can be used in the initial assessment of individuals in all clinical
settings, regardless of the cultural background of the individual or of
the

clinician. Individuals and clinicians who appear to share the same
cultural background may nevertheless differ in ways that are relevant to
care. The CFI may be used in its entirety, or components may be
incorporated into a clinical evaluation as needed. The CFI may be
especially helpful when there is Difficulty in diagnostic assessment
owing to significant differences in the cultural, religious, or
socioeconomic backgrounds of clinician and the individual. Uncertainty
about the fit between culturally distinctive symptoms and diagnostic
criteria. Difficulty in judging illness severity or impairment.
Disagreement between the individual and clinician on the course of care.
Limited engagement in and adherence to treatment by the individual. The
CFI emphasizes four domains of assessment: Cultural Definition of the
Problem (questions 1--3); Cultural Perceptions of Cause, Context, and
Support (questions 4--10); Cultural Factors Affecting Self-Coping and
Past Help Seeking (questions 11--13); and Cultural Factors Affecting
Current Help Seeking (questions 14--16). Both the person-centered
process of conducting the CFI and the information it elicits are
intended to enhance the cultural validity of diagnostic assessment,
facilitate treatment planning, and promote the individual's engagement
and satisfaction. To achieve these goals, the information obtained from
the CFI should be integrated with all other available clinical material
into a comprehensive clinical and contextual evaluation. An Informant
version of the CFI can be used to collect collateral information on the
CFI domains from family members or caregivers. Supplementary modules
have been developed that expand on each domain of the CFI and guide
clinicians who wish to explore these domains in greater depth.
Supplementary modules have also been developed for specific populations,
such as children and adolescents, elderly individuals, and immigrants
and refugees. These supplementary modules are referenced in the CFI
under the pertinent subheadings and are available online at
www.psychiatry.org/dsm5.

Cultural Concepts of Distress Cultural concepts of distress refers to
ways that cultural groups experience, understand, and communicate
suffering, behavioral problems, or troubling thoughts and emotions.
Three main types of cultural concepts may be distinguished. Cultural
syndromes are clusters of symptoms and attributions that tend to
co-occur among individuals in specific cultural groups, communities, or
contexts and that are recognized locally as coherent patterns of
experience. Cultural idioms of distress are ways of expressing distress
that may not involve specific symptoms or syndromes, but that provide
collective, shared ways of experiencing and talking about personal or
social concerns. For example, everyday talk about "nerves" or
"depression" may refer to widely varying forms of suffering without
mapping onto a discrete set of symptoms, syndrome, or disorder. Cultural
explanations or perceived causes are labels, attributions, or features
of an explanatory model that indicate culturally recognized meaning or
etiology for symptoms, illness, or distress. These three
concepts---syndromes, idioms, and explanations---are more relevant to
clinical practice than the older formulation culture-bound syndrome.
Specifically, the term culture-bound syndrome ignores the fact that
clinically important cultural differences often involve explanations or
experience of distress rather than culturally distinctive configurations
of symptoms. Furthermore, the term culture-bound overemphasizes the
local particularity and limited distribution of cultural concepts of
distress. The current formulation acknowledges that all forms of
distress are locally shaped, including the DSM disorders. From this
perspective, many DSM diagnoses can be understood as operationalized
prototypes that started out as cultural syndromes, and became widely
accepted as a result of their clinical and research utility. Across
groups there remain culturally patterned differences in symptoms, ways
of talking about distress, and locally perceived causes, which are in
turn associated with coping strategies and patterns of help seeking5.
Cultural concepts arise from local folk or professional diagnostic
systems for mental and emotional distress, and they may also reflect the
influence of

biomedical concepts. Cultural concepts have four key features in
relation to the DSM-5 nosology: There is seldom a one-to-one
correspondence of any cultural concept with a DSM diagnostic entity; the
correspondence is more likely to be one-to-many in either direction.
Symptoms or behaviors that might be sorted by DSM-5 into several
disorders may be included in a single folk concept, and diverse
presentations that might be classified by DSM-5 as variants of a single
disorder may be sorted into several distinct concepts by an indigenous
diagnostic system. Cultural concepts may apply to a wide range of
severity, including presentations that do not meet DSM criteria for any
mental disorder. For example, an individual with acute grief or a social
predicament may use the same idiom of distress or display the same
cultural syndrome as another individual with more severe
psychopathology. In common usage, the same cultural term frequently
denotes more than one type of cultural concept. A familiar example may
be the concept of "depression," which may be used to describe a syndrome
(e.g., major depressive disorder), an idiom of distress (e.g., as in the
common expression "I feel depressed"), or a perceived cause (similar to
"stress"). Like culture and DSM itself, cultural concepts may change
over time in response to both local and global influences. Cultural
concepts are important to psychiatric diagnosis for several reasons: To
avoid misdiagnosis: Cultural variation in symptoms and in explanatory
models associated with these cultural concepts may lead clinicians to
misjudge the severity of a problem or assign the wrong diagnosis (e.g.,
unfamiliar spiritual explanations may be misunderstood as psychosis)1.
To obtain useful clinical information: Cultural variations in symptoms
and attributions may be associated with particular features of risk,
resilience, and outcome7. To improve clinical rapport and engagement:
"Speaking the language of the patient," both linguistically and in terms
of his or her

dominant concepts and metaphors, can result in greater communication and
satisfaction, facilitate treatment negotiation, and lead to higher
retention and adherence6. To improve therapeutic efficacy: Culture
influences the psychological mechanisms of disorder, which need to be
understood and addressed to improve clinical efficacy2. For example,
culturally specific catastrophic cognitions can contribute to symptom
escalation into panic attacks3. To guide clinical research: Locally
perceived connections between cultural concepts may help identify
patterns of comorbidity and underlying biological substrates4. To
clarify the cultural epidemiology: Cultural concepts of distress are not
endorsed uniformly by everyone in a given culture. Distinguishing
syndromes, idioms, and explanations provides an approach for studying
the distribution of cultural features of illness across settings and
regions, and over time. It also suggests questions about cultural
determinants of risk, course, and outcome in clinical and community
settings to enhance the evidence base of cultural research8. DSM-5
includes information on cultural concepts in order to improve the
accuracy of diagnosis and the comprehensiveness of clinical assessment.
Clinical assessment of individuals presenting with these cultural
concepts should determine whether they meet DSM-5 criteria for a
specified disorder or an other specified or unspecified diagnosis. Once
the disorder is diagnosed, the cultural terms and explanations should be
included in case formulations; they may help clarify symptoms and
etiological attributions that could otherwise be confusing. Individuals
whose symptoms do not meet DSM criteria for a specific mental disorder
may still expect and require treatment; this should be assessed on a
case-by-case basis. In addition to the CFI and its supplementary
modules, DSM-5 contains the following information and tools that may be
useful when integrating cultural information in clinical practice: Data
in DSM-5 criteria and text for specific disorders: The text includes
information on cultural variations in prevalence,

symptomatology, associated cultural concepts, and other clinical
aspects. It is important to emphasize that there is no one-to-one
correspondence at the categorical level between DSM disorders and
cultural concepts. Differential diagnosis for individuals must therefore
incorporate information on cultural variation with information elicited
by the CFI. Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention:
Some of the clinical concerns identified by the CFI may correspond to V
codes or Z codes---for example, acculturation problems, parentchild
relational problems, or religious or spiritual problems. Glossary of
Cultural Concepts of Distress: Located in the Appendix, this glossary
provides examples of well-studied cultural concepts of distress that
illustrate the relevance of cultural information for clinical diagnosis
and some of the interrelationships among cultural syndromes, idioms of
distress, and causal explanations.

Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders The current approach
to personality disorders appears in Section II of DSM-5, and an
alternative model developed for DSM-5 is presented here in Section III.
The inclusion of both models in DSM-5 reflects the decision of the APA
Board of Trustees to preserve continuity with current clinical practice,
while also introducing a new approach that aims to address numerous
shortcomings of the current approach to personality disorders. For
example, the typical patient meeting criteria for a specific personality
disorder frequently also meets criteria for other personality disorders.
Similarly, other specified or unspecified personality disorder is often
the correct (but mostly uninformative) diagnosis, in the sense that
patients do not tend to present with patterns of symptoms that
correspond with one and only one personality disorder. In the following
alternative DSM-5 model, personality disorders are characterized by
impairments in personality functioning and pathological personality
traits. The specific personality disorder diagnoses that may be derived
from this model include antisocial, avoidant, borderline, narcissistic,
obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal personality disorders. This
approach also includes a diagnosis of personality disorder---trait
specified (PD-TS) that can be made when a personality disorder is
considered present but the criteria for a specific disorder are not met.

General Criteria for Personality Disorder General Criteria for
Personality Disorder The essential features of a personality disorder
are a. Moderate or greater impairment in personality
(self/interpersonal) functioning. b. One or more pathological
personality traits. c. The impairments in personality functioning and
the individual's personality trait expression are relatively inflexible
and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations.
d. The impairments in personality functioning and the individual's
personality trait expression are relatively stable across time, with
onsets that can be traced back to at least adolescence or early
adulthood. e. The impairments in personality functioning and the
individual's personality trait expression are not better explained by
another mental disorder. f. The impairments in personality functioning
and the individual's personality trait expression are not solely
attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another
medical condition (e.g., severe head trauma). g. The impairments in
personality functioning and the individual's personality trait
expression are not better understood as normal for an individual's
developmental stage or

sociocultural environment. A diagnosis of a personality disorder
requires two determinations: 1) an assessment of the level of impairment
in personality functioning, which is needed for Criterion A, and 2) an
evaluation of pathological personality traits, which is required for
Criterion B. The impairments in personality functioning and personality
trait expression are relatively inflexible and pervasive across a broad
range of personal and social situations (Criterion C); relatively stable
across time, with onsets that can be traced back to at least adolescence
or early adulthood (Criterion D); not better explained by another mental
disorder (Criterion E); not attributable to the effects of a substance
or another medical condition (Criterion F); and not better understood as
normal for an individual's developmental stage or sociocultural
environment (Criterion G). All Section III personality disorders
described by criteria sets, as well as PD-TS, meet these general
criteria, by definition.

Criterion A: Level of Personality Functioning Disturbances in self and
interpersonal functioning constitute the core of personality
psychopathology1 and in this alternative diagnostic model they are
evaluated on a continuum. Self functioning involves identity and
self-direction; interpersonal functioning involves empathy and intimacy
(see Table 1). The Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS; see
Table 2, pp. 775--778) uses each of these elements to differentiate five
levels of impairment, ranging from little or no impairment (i.e.,
healthy, adaptive functioning; Level 0) to some (Level 1), moderate
(Level 2), severe (Level 3), and extreme (Level 4) impairment.

TABLE 1 Elements of personality functioning Self: 1. Identity:
Experience of oneself as unique, with clear boundaries between self and
others; stability of self-esteem and accuracy of self-appraisal;
capacity for, and ability to regulate, a range of emotional experience.
2. Self-direction: Pursuit of coherent and meaningful short-term and
life goals; utilization of constructive and prosocial internal standards
of behavior; ability to self-reflect productively. Interpersonal: 1.
Empathy: Comprehension and appreciation of others' experiences and
motivations; tolerance of differing perspectives; understanding the
effects of one's own behavior on others. 2. Intimacy: Depth and duration
of connection with others; desire and capacity for closeness; mutuality
of regard reflected in interpersonal behavior. Impairment in personality
functioning predicts the presence of a personality disorder, and the
severity of impairment predicts whether an individual has more than one
personality disorder or one of the more typically severe personality
disorders19. A moderate level of impairment in personality functioning
is required for the diagnosis of a personality disorder; this threshold
is based on empirical evidence that the moderate level of impairment
maximizes the ability of clinicians to accurately and efficiently
identify personality disorder pathology21.

Criterion B: Pathological Personality Traits Pathological personality
traits are organized into five broad domains: Negative Affectivity,
Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition, and Psychoticism. Within the five
broad trait domains are 25 specific trait facets that were developed
initially from a review of existing trait models and subsequently
through iterative research with samples of persons who sought mental
health services10, 11, 12. The full trait taxonomy is presented in Table
3 (see pp. 779--781). The B criteria for the specific personality
disorders comprise subsets of the 25 trait facets, based on metaanalytic
reviews24, 25 and empirical data on the relationships of the traits to
DSM-IV personality disorder diagnoses.

Criteria C and D: Pervasiveness and Stability Impairments in personality
functioning and pathological personality traits are relatively pervasive
across a range of personal and social contexts, as personality is
defined as a pattern of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the
environment and oneself. The term relatively reflects the fact that all
except the most extremely pathological personalities show some degree of
adaptability. The pattern in personality disorders is maladaptive and
relatively inflexible, which leads to disabilities in social,
occupational, or other important pursuits, as individuals are unable to
modify their thinking or behavior, even in the face of evidence that
their approach is not working. The impairments in functioning and
personality traits are also relatively stable. Personality traits---the
dispositions to behave or feel in certain ways---are more stable than
the symptomatic expressions of these dispositions, but personality
traits can also change. Impairments in personality functioning are more
stable than symptoms.

Criteria E, F, and G: Alternative Explanations for Personality Pathology
(Differential Diagnosis) On some occasions, what appears to be a
personality disorder may be better explained by another mental disorder,
the effects of a substance or another medical condition, or a normal
developmental stage (e.g., adolescence, late life) or the individual's
sociocultural environment. When another mental disorder is present, the
diagnosis of a personality disorder is not made, if the manifestations
of the personality disorder clearly are an expression of the other
mental disorder (e.g., if features of schizotypal personality disorder
are present only in the context of schizophrenia). On the other hand,
personality disorders can be accurately diagnosed in the presence of
another mental disorder, such as major depressive disorder18, and
patients with other mental disorders should be assessed for comorbid
personality disorders because personality disorders often impact the
course of other mental disorders5, 26. Therefore, it is always
appropriate to assess personality functioning and pathological
personality traits to provide a context for other psychopathology.

Specific Personality Disorders Section III includes diagnostic criteria
for antisocial, avoidant, borderline, narcissistic, obsessivecompulsive,
and schizotypal personality disorders. Each personality disorder is
defined by typical impairments in personality functioning (Criterion A)
and characteristic pathological personality traits (Criterion B):

Typical features of antisocial personality disorder are a failure to
conform to lawful and ethical behavior, and an egocentric, callous lack
of concern for others, accompanied by deceitfulness, irresponsibility,
manipulativeness, and/or risk taking. Typical features of avoidant
personality disorder are avoidance of social situations and inhibition
in interpersonal relationships related to feelings of ineptitude and
inadequacy, anxious preoccupation with negative evaluation and
rejection, and fears of ridicule or embarrassment. Typical features of
borderline personality disorder are instability of self-image, personal
goals, interpersonal relationships, and affects, accompanied by
impulsivity, risk taking, and/or hostility. Typical features of
narcissistic personality disorder are variable and vulnerable
selfesteem, with attempts at regulation through attention and approval
seeking, and either overt or covert grandiosity. Typical features of
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are difficulties in
establishing and sustaining close relationships, associated with rigid
perfectionism, inflexibility, and restricted emotional expression.
Typical features of schizotypal personality disorder are impairments in
the capacity for social and close relationships, and eccentricities in
cognition, perception, and behavior that are associated with distorted
self-image and incoherent personal goals and accompanied by
suspiciousness and restricted emotional expression. The A and B criteria
for the six specific personality disorders and for PD-TS follow. All
personality disorders also meet criteria C through G of the General
Criteria for Personality Disorder.

Antisocial Personality Disorder Typical features of antisocial
personality disorder are a failure to conform to lawful and ethical
behavior, and an egocentric, callous lack of concern for others,
accompanied by deceitfulness, irresponsibility, manipulativeness, and/or
risk taking. Characteristic difficulties are apparent in identity,
self-direction, empathy, and/or intimacy, as described below, along with
specific maladaptive traits in the domains of Antagonism and
Disinhibition.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria a. Moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning, manifested by characteristic difficulties in
two or more of the following four areas: 1. Identity: Egocentrism;
self-esteem derived from personal gain, power, or pleasure. 2.
Self-direction: Goal setting based on personal gratification; absence of
prosocial internal standards, associated with failure to conform to
lawful or culturally normative ethical behavior. 3. Empathy: Lack of
concern for feelings, needs, or suffering of others; lack of remorse
after hurting or mistreating another. 4. Intimacy: Incapacity for
mutually intimate relationships, as exploitation is a primary means of
relating to others, including by deceit and coercion; use of dominance
or

intimidation to control others. b. Six or more of the following seven
pathological personality traits: 1. Manipulativeness (an aspect of
Antagonism): Frequent use of subterfuge to influence or control others;
use of seduction, charm, glibness, or ingratiation to achieve one's
ends. 2. Callousness (an aspect of Antagonism): Lack of concern for
feelings or problems of others; lack of guilt or remorse about the
negative or harmful effects of one's actions on others; aggression;
sadism. 3. Deceitfulness (an aspect of Antagonism): Dishonesty and
fraudulence; misrepresentation of self; embellishment or fabrication
when relating events. 4. Hostility (an aspect of Antagonism): Persistent
or frequent angry feelings; anger or irritability in response to minor
slights and insults; mean, nasty, or vengeful behavior. 5. Risk taking
(an aspect of Disinhibition): Engagement in dangerous, risky, and
potentially self-damaging activities, unnecessarily and without regard
for consequences; boredom proneness and thoughtless initiation of
activities to counter boredom; lack of concern for one's limitations and
denial of the reality of personal danger. 6. Impulsivity (an aspect of
Disinhibition): Acting on the spur of the moment in response to
immediate stimuli; acting on a momentary basis without a plan or
consideration of outcomes; difficulty establishing and following plans.
7. Irresponsibility (an aspect of Disinhibition): Disregard for---and
failure to honor--- financial and other obligations or commitments; lack
of respect for---and lack of follow-through on---agreements and
promises. Note. The individual is at least 18 years of age. Specify if:
With psychopathic features.

Specifiers A distinct variant often termed psychopathy (or "primary"
psychopathy) is marked by a lack of anxiety or fear and by a bold
interpersonal style that may mask maladaptive behaviors (e.g.,
fraudulence). This psychopathic variant is characterized by low levels
of anxiousness (Negative Affectivity domain) and withdrawal (Detachment
domain) and high levels of attention seeking (Antagonism domain). High
attention seeking and low withdrawal capture the social potency
(assertive/dominant) component of psychopathy, whereas low anxiousness
captures the stress immunity (emotional stability/resilience) component.
In addition to psychopathic features, trait and personality functioning
specifiers may be used to record other personality features that may be
present in antisocial personality disorder but are not required for the
diagnosis. For example, traits of Negative Affectivity (e.g.,
anxiousness), are not diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality
disorder (see Criterion B) but can be specified when appropriate.
Furthermore, although moderate or greater impairment in personality
functioning is required for the diagnosis of antisocial personality
disorder (Criterion A), the level of personality functioning can also be
specified.

Avoidant Personality Disorder Typical features of avoidant personality
disorder are avoidance of social situations and inhibition in
interpersonal relationships related to feelings of ineptitude and
inadequacy, anxious preoccupation with negative evaluation and
rejection, and fears of ridicule or embarrassment. Characteristic
difficulties are apparent in identity, self-direction, empathy, and/or
intimacy, as described below, along with specific maladaptive traits in
the domains of Negative Affectivity and Detachment.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria a. Moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning, manifest by characteristic difficulties in two
or more of the following four areas: 1. Identity: Low self-esteem
associated with self-appraisal as socially inept, personally
unappealing, or inferior; excessive feelings of shame. 2.
Self-direction: Unrealistic standards for behavior associated with
reluctance to pursue goals, take personal risks, or engage in new
activities involving interpersonal contact. 3. Empathy: Preoccupation
with, and sensitivity to, criticism or rejection, associated with
distorted inference of others' perspectives as negative. 4. Intimacy:
Reluctance to get involved with people unless being certain of being
liked; diminished mutuality within intimate relationships because of
fear of being shamed or ridiculed. b. Three or more of the following
four pathological personality traits, one of which must be (1)
Anxiousness: 1. Anxiousness (an aspect of Negative Affectivity): Intense
feelings of nervousness, tenseness, or panic, often in reaction to
social situations; worry about the negative effects of past unpleasant
experiences and future negative possibilities; feeling fearful,
apprehensive, or threatened by uncertainty; fears of embarrassment. 2.
Withdrawal (an aspect of Detachment): Reticence in social situations;
avoidance of social contacts and activity; lack of initiation of social
contact. 3. Anhedonia (an aspect of Detachment): Lack of enjoyment from,
engagement in, or energy for life's experiences; deficits in the
capacity to feel pleasure or take interest in things. 4. Intimacy
avoidance (an aspect of Detachment): Avoidance of close or romantic
relationships, interpersonal attachments, and intimate sexual
relationships. Specifiers. Considerable heterogeneity in the form of
additional personality traits is found among individuals diagnosed with
avoidant personality disorder. Trait and level of personality
functioning specifiers can be used to record additional personality
features that may be present in avoidant personality disorder. For
example, other Negative Affectivity traits (e.g., depressivity,
separation insecurity, submissiveness, suspiciousness, hostility) are
not diagnostic criteria for avoidant personality disorder (see Criterion
B) but can be specified when appropriate. Furthermore, although moderate
or greater impairment in personality functioning is required for

the diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder (Criterion A), the level
of personality functioning also can be specified.

Borderline Personality Disorder Typical features of borderline
personality disorder are instability of self-image, personal goals,
interpersonal relationships, and affects, accompanied by impulsivity,
risk taking, and/or hostility. Characteristic difficulties are apparent
in identity, self-direction, empathy, and/or intimacy, as described
below, along with specific maladaptive traits in the domain of Negative
Affectivity, and also Antagonism and/or Disinhibition.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria a. Moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning, manifested by characteristic difficulties in
two or more of the following four areas: 1. Identity: Markedly
impoverished, poorly developed, or unstable self-image, often associated
with excessive self-criticism; chronic feelings of emptiness;
dissociative states under stress. 2. Self-direction: Instability in
goals, aspirations, values, or career plans. 3. Empathy: Compromised
ability to recognize the feelings and needs of others associated with
interpersonal hypersensitivity (i.e., prone to feel slighted or
insulted); perceptions of others selectively biased toward negative
attributes or vulnerabilities. 4. Intimacy: Intense, unstable, and
conflicted close relationships, marked by mistrust, neediness, and
anxious preoccupation with real or imagined abandonment; close
relationships often viewed in extremes of idealization and devaluation
and alternating between overinvolvement and withdrawal. b. Four or more
of the following seven pathological personality traits, at least one of
which must be (5) Impulsivity, (6) Risk taking, or (7) Hostility: 1.
Emotional lability (an aspect of Negative Affectivity): Unstable
emotional experiences and frequent mood changes; emotions that are
easily aroused, intense, and/or out of proportion to events and
circumstances. 2. Anxiousness (an aspect of Negative Affectivity):
Intense feelings of nervousness, tenseness, or panic, often in reaction
to interpersonal stresses; worry about the negative effects of past
unpleasant experiences and future negative possibilities; feeling
fearful, apprehensive, or threatened by uncertainty; fears of falling
apart or losing control. 3. Separation insecurity (an aspect of Negative
Affectivity): Fears of rejection by--- and/or separation
from---significant others, associated with fears of excessive dependency
and complete loss of autonomy. 4. Depressivity (an aspect of Negative
Affectivity): Frequent feelings of being down, miserable, and/or
hopeless; difficulty recovering from such moods; pessimism about the
future; pervasive shame; feelings of inferior self-worth; thoughts of
suicide and suicidal behavior. 5. Impulsivity (an aspect of
Disinhibition): Acting on the spur of the moment in response to
immediate stimuli; acting on a momentary basis without a plan or

consideration of outcomes; difficulty establishing or following plans; a
sense of urgency and self-harming behavior under emotional distress. 6.
Risk taking (an aspect of Disinhibition): Engagement in dangerous,
risky, and potentially self-damaging activities, unnecessarily and
without regard to consequences; lack of concern for one's limitations
and denial of the reality of personal danger. 7. Hostility (an aspect of
Antagonism): Persistent or frequent angry feelings; anger or
irritability in response to minor slights and insults. Specifiers. Trait
and level of personality functioning specifiers may be used to record
additional personality features that may be present in borderline
personality disorder but are not required for the diagnosis. For
example, traits of Psychoticism (e.g., cognitive and perceptual
dysregulation) are not diagnostic criteria for borderline personality
disorder (see Criterion B) but can be specified when appropriate.
Furthermore, although moderate or greater impairment in personality
functioning is required for the diagnosis of borderline personality
disorder (Criterion A), the level of personality functioning can also be
specified.

Narcissistic Personality Disorder Typical features of narcissistic
personality disorder are variable and vulnerable self-esteem, with
attempts at regulation through attention and approval seeking, and
either overt or covert grandiosity. Characteristic difficulties are
apparent in identity, self-direction, empathy, and/or intimacy, as
described below, along with specific maladaptive traits in the domain of
Antagonism.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria a. Moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning, manifested by characteristic difficulties in
two or more of the following four areas: 1. Identity: Excessive
reference to others for self-definition and self-esteem regulation;
exaggerated self-appraisal inflated or deflated, or vacillating between
extremes; emotional regulation mirrors fluctuations in self-esteem. 2.
Self-direction: Goal setting based on gaining approval from others;
personal standards unreasonably high in order to see oneself as
exceptional, or too low based on a sense of entitlement; often unaware
of own motivations. 3. Empathy: Impaired ability to recognize or
identify with the feelings and needs of others; excessively attuned to
reactions of others, but only if perceived as relevant to self; over- or
underestimation of own effect on others. 4. Intimacy: Relationships
largely superficial and exist to serve self-esteem regulation; mutuality
constrained by little genuine interest in others' experiences and
predominance of a need for personal gain. b. Both of the following
pathological personality traits: 1. Grandiosity (an aspect of
Antagonism): Feelings of entitlement, either overt or covert;
self-centeredness; firmly holding to the belief that one is better than
others; condescension toward others.

2. Attention seeking (an aspect of Antagonism): Excessive attempts to
attract and be the focus of the attention of others; admiration seeking.
Specifiers. Trait and personality functioning specifiers may be used to
record additional personality features that may be present in
narcissistic personality disorder but are not required for the
diagnosis. For example, other traits of Antagonism (e.g.,
manipulativeness, deceitfulness, callousness) are not diagnostic
criteria for narcissistic personality disorder (see Criterion B) but can
be specified when more pervasive antagonistic features (e.g., "malignant
narcissism") are present. Other traits of Negative Affectivity (e.g.,
depressivity, anxiousness) can be specified to record more "vulnerable"
presentations. Furthermore, although moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning is required for the diagnosis of narcissistic
personality disorder (Criterion A), the level of personality functioning
can also be specified.

Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder Typical features of
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are difficulties in
establishing and sustaining close relationships, associated with rigid
perfectionism, inflexibility, and restricted emotional expression.
Characteristic difficulties are apparent in identity, self-direction,
empathy, and/or intimacy, as described below, along with specific
maladaptive traits in the domains of Negative Affectivity and/or
Detachment.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria a. Moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning, manifested by characteristic difficulties in
two or more of the following four areas: 1. Identity: Sense of self
derived predominantly from work or productivity; constricted experience
and expression of strong emotions. 2. Self-direction: Difficulty
completing tasks and realizing goals, associated with rigid and
unreasonably high and inflexible internal standards of behavior; overly
conscientious and moralistic attitudes. 3. Empathy: Difficulty
understanding and appreciating the ideas, feelings, or behaviors of
others. 4. Intimacy: Relationships seen as secondary to work and
productivity; rigidity and stubbornness negatively affect relationships
with others. b. Three or more of the following four pathological
personality traits, one of which must be (1) Rigid perfectionism: 1.
Rigid perfectionism (an aspect of extreme Conscientiousness \[the
opposite pole of Disinhibition\]): Rigid insistence on everything being
flawless, perfect, and without errors or faults, including one's own and
others' performance; sacrificing of timeliness to ensure correctness in
every detail; believing that there is only one right way to do things;
difficulty changing ideas and/or viewpoint; preoccupation with details,
organization, and order. 2. Perseveration (an aspect of Negative
Affectivity): Persistence at tasks long after the behavior has ceased to
be functional or effective; continuance of the same behavior despite
repeated failures.

3. Intimacy avoidance (an aspect of Detachment): Avoidance of close or
romantic relationships, interpersonal attachments, and intimate sexual
relationships. 4. Restricted affectivity (an aspect of Detachment):
Little reaction to emotionally arousing situations; constricted
emotional experience and expression; indifference or coldness.
Specifiers. Trait and personality functioning specifiers may be used to
record additional personality features that may be present in
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder but are not required for the
diagnosis. For example, other traits of Negative Affectivity (e.g.,
anxiousness) are not diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder (see Criterion B) but can be specified when
appropriate. Furthermore, although moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning is required for the diagnosis of
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (Criterion A), the level of
personality functioning can also be specified.

Schizotypal Personality Disorder Typical features of schizotypal
personality disorder are impairments in the capacity for social and
close relationships and eccentricities in cognition, perception, and
behavior that are associated with distorted self-image and incoherent
personal goals and accompanied by suspiciousness and restricted
emotional expression. Characteristic difficulties are apparent in
identity, self-direction, empathy, and/or intimacy, along with specific
maladaptive traits in the domains of Psychoticism and Detachment.

Proposed Diagnostic Criteria a. Moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning, manifested by characteristic difficulties in
two or more of the following four areas: 1. Identity: Confused
boundaries between self and others; distorted self-concept; emotional
expression often not congruent with context or internal experience. 2.
Self-direction: Unrealistic or incoherent goals; no clear set of
internal standards. 3. Empathy: Pronounced difficulty understanding
impact of own behaviors on others; frequent misinterpretations of
others' motivations and behaviors. 4. Intimacy: Marked impairments in
developing close relationships, associated with mistrust and anxiety. b.
Four or more of the following six pathological personality traits: 1.
Cognitive and perceptual dysregulation (an aspect of Psychoticism): Odd
or unusual thought processes; vague, circumstantial, metaphorical,
overelaborate, or stereotyped thought or speech; odd sensations in
various sensory modalities. 2. Unusual beliefs and experiences (an
aspect of Psychoticism): Thought content and views of reality that are
viewed by others as bizarre or idiosyncratic; unusual experiences of
reality. 3. Eccentricity (an aspect of Psychoticism): Odd, unusual, or
bizarre behavior or appearance; saying unusual or inappropriate things.

emotionally arousing situations; constricted emotional experience and
expression; indifference or coldness. 5. Withdrawal (an aspect of
Detachment): Preference for being alone to being with others; reticence

initiation of social contact. 6. Suspiciousness (an aspect of
Detachment): Expectations of---and heightened sensitivity to---signs of
interpersonal ill-intent or harm; doubts about loyalty and fidelity of
others; feelings of persecution. Specifiers. Trait and personality
functioning specifiers may be used to record additional personality
features that may be present in schizotypal personality disorder but are
not required for the diagnosis. For example, traits of Negative
Affectivity (e.g., depressivity, anxiousness) are not diagnostic
criteria for schizotypal personality disorder (see Criterion B) but can
be specified when appropriate. Furthermore, although moderate or greater
impairment in personality functioning is required for the diagnosis of
schizotypal personality disorder (Criterion A), the level of personality
functioning can also be specified.

Personality Disorder---Trait Specified Proposed Diagnostic Criteria a.
Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, manifested by
difficulties in two or more of the following four areas: 1. Identity 2.
Self-direction 3. Empathy 4. Intimacy b. One or more pathological
personality trait domains OR specific trait facets within domains,
considering ALL of the following domains: 1. Negative Affectivity
(vs. Emotional Stability): Frequent and intense experiences of high
levels of a wide range of negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression,
guilt/shame, worry, anger), and their behavioral (e.g., self-harm) and
interpersonal (e.g., dependency) manifestations. 2. Detachment
(vs. Extraversion): Avoidance of socioemotional experience, including
both withdrawal from interpersonal interactions, ranging from casual,
daily interactions to friendships to intimate relationships, as well as
restricted affective experience and expression, particularly limited
hedonic capacity. 3. Antagonism (vs. Agreeableness): Behaviors that put
the individual at odds with other people, including an exaggerated sense
of self-importance and a concomitant expectation of special treatment,
as well as a callous antipathy toward others, encompassing both
unawareness of others' needs and feelings, and a readiness to use others
in the service of self-enhancement.

4. Disinhibition (vs. Conscientiousness): Orientation toward immediate
gratification, leading to impulsive behavior driven by current thoughts,
feelings, and external stimuli, without regard for past learning or
consideration of future consequences. 5. Psychoticism (vs. Lucidity):
Exhibiting a wide range of culturally incongruent odd, eccentric, or
unusual behaviors and cognitions, including both process (e.g.,
perception, dissociation) and content (e.g., beliefs). Subtypes. Because
personality features vary continuously along multiple trait dimensions,
a comprehensive set of potential expressions of PD-TS can be represented
by DSM-5's dimensional model of maladaptive personality trait variants
(see Table 3, pp. 779--781). Thus, subtypes are unnecessary for PD-TS,
and instead, the descriptive elements that constitute personality are
provided, arranged in an empirically based model. This arrangement
allows clinicians to tailor the description of each individual's
personality disorder profile, considering all five broad domains of
personality trait variation and drawing on the descriptive features of
these domains as needed to characterize the individual. Specifiers. The
specific personality features of individuals are always recorded in
evaluating Criterion B, so the combination of personality features
characterizing an individual directly constitutes the specifiers in each
case. For example, two individuals who are both characterized by
emotional lability, hostility, and depressivity may differ such that the
first individual is characterized additionally by callousness, whereas
the second is not.

Personality Disorder Scoring Algorithms The requirement for any two of
the four A criteria for each of the six personality disorders was based
on maximizing the relationship of these criteria to their corresponding
personality disorder. Diagnostic thresholds for the B criteria were also
set empirically to minimize change in prevalence of the disorders from
DSM-IV and overlap with other personality disorders, and to maximize
relationships with functional impairment. The resulting diagnostic
criteria sets represent clinically useful personality disorders with
high fidelity, in terms of core impairments in personality functioning
of varying degrees of severity and constellations of pathological
personality traits.

Personality Disorder Diagnosis Individuals who have a pattern of
impairment in personality functioning and maladaptive traits that
matches one of the six defined personality disorders should be diagnosed
with that personality disorder. If an individual also has one or even
several prominent traits that may have clinical relevance in addition to
those required for the diagnosis (e.g., see narcissistic personality
disorder), the option exists for these to be noted as specifiers.
Individuals whose personality functioning or trait pattern is
substantially different from that of any of the six specific personality
disorders should be diagnosed with PD-TS. The individual may not meet
the required number of A or B criteria and, thus, have a subthreshold
presentation of a personality disorder. The individual may have a mix of
features of personality disorder types or some features that are less
characteristic of a type and more accurately considered a mixed or
atypical presentation. The specific level of impairment in personality
functioning and the pathological personality traits that characterize
the individual's personality can be specified for PD-TS, using the Level
of Personality Functioning Scale (Table 2) and the pathological trait
taxonomy (Table 3). The

current diagnoses of paranoid, schizoid, histrionic, and dependent
personality disorders are represented also by the diagnosis of PD-TS;
these are defined by moderate or greater impairment in personality
functioning and can be specified by the relevant pathological
personality trait combinations.

Level of Personality Functioning Like most human tendencies, personality
functioning is distributed on a continuum. Central to functioning and
adaptation are individuals' characteristic ways of thinking about and
understanding themselves and their interactions with others13. An
optimally functioning individual has a complex, fully elaborated, and
well-integrated psychological world that includes a mostly positive,
volitional, and adaptive self-concept; a rich, broad, and appropriately
regulated emotional life; and the capacity to behave as a productive
member of society with reciprocal and fulfilling interpersonal
relationships. At the opposite end of the continuum, an individual with
severe personality pathology has an impoverished, disorganized, and/or
conflicted psychological world that includes a weak, unclear, and
maladaptive self-concept; a propensity to negative, dysregulated
emotions; and a deficient capacity for adaptive interpersonal
functioning and social behavior.

Self- and Interpersonal Functioning Dimensional Definition Generalized
severity may be the most important single predictor of concurrent and
prospective dysfunction in assessing personality psychopathology.
Personality disorders are optimally characterized by a generalized
personality severity continuum with additional specification of
stylistic elements, derived from personality disorder symptom
constellations and personality traits8. At the same time, the core of
personality psychopathology is impairment in ideas and feelings
regarding self and interpersonal relationships; this notion is
consistent with multiple theories of personality disorder and their
research bases3, 22. The components of the Level of Personality
Functioning Scale---identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy (see
Table 1)---are particularly central in describing a personality
functioning continuum1, 19. Mental representations of the self and
interpersonal relationships are reciprocally influential and
inextricably tied13, affect the nature of interaction with mental health
professionals, and can have a significant impact on both treatment
efficacy and outcome1, underscoring the importance of assessing an
individual's characteristic self-concept as well as views of other
people and relationships. Although the degree of disturbance in the self
and interpersonal functioning is continuously distributed, it is useful
to consider the level of impairment in functioning for clinical
characterization and for treatment planning and prognosis.

Rating Level of Personality Functioning To use the Level of Personality
Functioning Scale (LPFS), the clinician selects the level that most
closely captures the individual's current overall level of impairment in
personality functioning. The rating is necessary for the diagnosis of a
personality disorder (moderate or greater impairment) and can be used to
specify the severity of impairment present for an individual with any
personality disorder at a given point in time. The LPFS may also be used
as a global indicator of personality functioning without specification
of a personality disorder diagnosis, or in the event that personality
impairment is subthreshold for a disorder diagnosis.

Personality Traits

Definition and Description Criterion B in the alternative model involves
assessments of personality traits that are grouped into five domains. A
personality trait is a tendency to feel, perceive, behave, and think in
relatively consistent ways across time and across situations in which
the trait may manifest. For example, individuals with a high level of
the personality trait of anxiousness would tend to feel anxious readily,
including in circumstances in which most people would be calm and
relaxed. Individuals high in trait anxiousness also would perceive
situations to be anxiety-provoking more frequently than would
individuals with lower levels of this trait, and those high in the trait
would tend to behave so as to avoid situations that they think would
make them anxious. They would thereby tend to think about the world as
more anxiety provoking than other people. Importantly, individuals high
in trait anxiousness would not necessarily be anxious at all times and
in all situations. Individuals' trait levels also can and do change
throughout life. Some changes are very general and reflect maturation
(e.g., teenagers generally are higher on trait impulsivity than are
older adults)23, whereas other changes reflect individuals' life
experiences27. Dimensionality of personality traits. All individuals can
be located on the spectrum of trait dimensions; that is, personality
traits apply to everyone in different degrees rather than being present
versus absent. Moreover, personality traits, including those identified
specifically in the Section III model, exist on a spectrum with two
opposing poles. For example, the opposite of the trait of callousness is
the tendency to be empathic and kind-hearted, even in circumstances in
which most persons would not feel that way. Hence, although in Section
III this trait is labeled callousness, because that pole of the
dimension is the primary focus, it could be described in full as
callousness versus kind-heartedness. Moreover, its opposite pole can be
recognized and may not be adaptive in all circumstances (e.g.,
individuals who, due to extreme kind-heartedness, repeatedly allow
themselves to be taken advantage of by unscrupulous others).
Hierarchical structure of personality. Some trait terms are quite
specific (e.g., "talkative") and describe a narrow range of behaviors,
whereas others are quite broad (e.g., Detachment) and characterize a
wide range of behavioral propensities. Broad trait dimensions are called
domains, and specific trait dimensions are called facets. Personality
trait domains comprise a spectrum of more specific personality facets
that tend to occur together. For example, withdrawal and anhedonia are
specific trait facets in the trait domain of Detachment. Despite some
cross-cultural variation in personality trait facets, the broad domains
they collectively comprise are relatively consistent across cultures.

The Personality Trait Model The Section III personality trait system
includes five broad domains of personality trait variation ---Negative
Affectivity (vs. Emotional Stability), Detachment (vs. Extraversion),
Antagonism (vs. Agreeableness), Disinhibition (vs. Conscientiousness),
and Psychoticism (vs. Lucidity)--- comprising 25 specific personality
trait facets. Table 3 provides definitions of all personality domains
and facets. These five broad domains are maladaptive variants of the
five domains of the extensively validated and replicated personality
model known as the "Big Five" 4, or Five Factor Model of personality
(FFM)15, 29, and are also similar to the domains of the Personality
Psychopathology Five (PSY-5)6. The specific 25 facets represent a list
of personality facets chosen for their clinical relevance12. Although
the Trait Model focuses on personality traits associated with
psychopathology, there are healthy, adaptive, and resilient personality
traits identified as the polar opposites of these

traits, as noted in the parentheses above (i.e., Emotional Stability,
Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Lucidity). Their
presence can greatly mitigate the effects of mental disorders and
facilitate coping and recovery from traumatic injuries and other medical
illness.

Distinguishing Traits, Symptoms, and Specific Behaviors Although traits
are by no means immutable and do change throughout the life span, they
show relative consistency compared with symptoms and specific behaviors.
For example, a person may behave impulsively at a specific time for a
specific reason (e.g., a person who is rarely impulsive suddenly decides
to spend a great deal of money on a particular item because of an
unusual opportunity to purchase something of unique value), but it is
only when behaviors aggregate across time and circumstance, such that a
pattern of behavior distinguishes between individuals, that they reflect
traits. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize, for example, that
even people who are impulsive are not acting impulsively all of the
time. A trait is a tendency or disposition toward specific behaviors; a
specific behavior is an instance or manifestation of a trait. Similarly,
traits are distinguished from most symptoms because symptoms tend to wax
and wane, whereas traits are relatively more stable. For example,
individuals with higher levels of depressivity have a greater likelihood
of experiencing discrete episodes of a depressive disorder and of
showing the symptoms of these disorders, such difficulty concentrating.
However, even patients who have a trait propensity to depressivity
typically cycle through distinguishable episodes of mood disturbance,
and specific symptoms such as difficulty concentrating tend to wax and
wane in concert with specific episodes, so they do not form part of the
trait definition. Importantly, however, symptoms and traits are both
amenable to intervention, and many interventions targeted at symptoms
can affect the longer term patterns of personality functioning that are
captured by personality traits28.

Assessment of the DSM-5 Section III Personality Trait Model The clinical
utility of the Section III multidimensional personality trait model lies
in its ability to focus attention on multiple relevant areas of
personality variation in each individual patient. Rather than focusing
attention on the identification of one and only one optimal diagnostic
label, clinical application of the Section III personality trait model
involves reviewing all five broad personality domains portrayed in Table
3.. The clinical approach to personality is similar to the well-known
review of systems in clinical medicine. For example, an individual's
presenting complaint may focus on a specific neurological symptom, yet
during an initial evaluation clinicians still systematically review
functioning in all relevant systems (e.g., cardiovascular, respiratory,
gastrointestinal), lest an important area of diminished functioning and
corresponding opportunity for effective intervention be missed. Clinical
use of the Section III personality trait model proceeds similarly. An
initial inquiry reviews all five broad domains of personality. This
systematic review is facilitated by the use of formal psychometric
instruments designed to measure specific facets and domains of
personality. For example, the personality trait model is operationalized
in the Personality Inventory for DSM5 (PID-5)12, which can be completed
in its self-report form by patients and in its informant-report form14
by those who know the patient well (e.g., a spouse). A detailed clinical
assessment would involve collection of both patient- and
informant-report data on all 25 facets of the personality trait model.
However, if this is not possible, due to time or other constraints,
assessment focused at the five-domain level is an acceptable clinical
option when only a general (vs. detailed)

portrait of a patient's personality is needed (see Criterion B of
PD-TS). However, if personalitybased problems are the focus of
treatment, then it will be important to assess individuals' trait facets
as well as domains2. Because personality traits are continuously
distributed in the population, an approach to making the judgment that a
specific trait is elevated (and therefore is present for diagnostic
purposes) could involve comparing individuals' personality trait levels
with population norms and/or clinical judgment. If a trait is
elevated---that is, formal psychometric testing and/or interview data
support the clinical judgment of elevation---then it is considered as
contributing to meeting Criterion B of Section III personality
disorders.

Clinical Utility of the Multidimensional Personality Trait Model
Disorder and trait constructs each add value to the other in predicting
important antecedent (e.g., family history, history of child abuse),
concurrent (e.g., functional impairment, medication use), and predictive
(e.g., hospitalization, suicide attempts) variables7, 16, 17, 20. DSM-5
impairments in personality functioning and pathological personality
traits each contribute independently to clinical decisions about degree
of disability; risks for self-harm, violence, and criminality;
recommended treatment type and intensity; and prognosis---all important
aspects of the utility of psychiatric diagnoses9. Notably, knowing the
level of an individual's personality functioning and his or her
pathological trait profile also provides the clinician with a rich base
of information and is valuable in treatment planning and in predicting
the course and outcome of many mental disorders in addition to
personality disorders5, 26. Therefore, assessment of personality
functioning and pathological personality traits may be relevant whether
an individual has a personality disorder or not. TABLE 2 Level of

Conditions for Further Study Proposed criteria sets are presented for
conditions on which future research is encouraged. The specific items,
thresholds, and durations contained in these research criteria sets were
set by expert consensus--- informed by literature review, data
reanalysis, and field trial results, where available---and are intended
to provide a common language for researchers and clinicians who are
interested in studying these disorders. It is hoped that such research
will allow the field to better understand these conditions and will
inform decisions about possible placement in forthcoming editions of
DSM. The DSM-5 Task Force and Work Groups subjected each of these
proposed criteria sets to a careful empirical review and invited wide
commentary from the field as well as from the general public. The Task
Force determined that there was insufficient evidence to warrant
inclusion of these proposals as official mental disorder diagnoses in
Section II. These proposed criteria sets are not intended for clinical
use; only the criteria sets and disorders in Section II of DSM-5 are
officially recognized and can be used for clinical purposes.

Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome Proposed Criteria a. At least one of the
following symptoms is present in attenuated form, with relatively intact
reality testing, and is of sufficient severity or frequency to warrant
clinical attention: 1. Delusions. 2. Hallucinations. 3. Disorganized
speech. b. Symptom(s) must have been present at least once per week for
the past month.

c. Symptom(s) must have begun or worsened in the past year.
d. Symptom(s) is sufficiently distressing and disabling to the
individual to warrant clinical attention. e. Symptom(s) is not better
explained by another mental disorder, including a depressive or bipolar
disorder with psychotic features, and is not attributable to the
physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.
f. Criteria for any psychotic disorder have never been met.

Diagnostic Features Attenuated psychotic symptoms, as defined in
Criterion A, are psychosislike but below the threshold for a full
psychotic disorder. Compared with psychotic disorders, the symptoms are
less severe and more transient, and insight is relatively maintained. A
diagnosis of attenuated psychosis syndrome requires state
psychopathology associated with functional impairment rather than
long-standing trait pathology. The psychopathology has not progressed to
full psychotic severity. Attenuated psychosis syndrome is a disorder
based on the manifest pathology and impaired function and distress.
Changes in experiences and behaviors are noted by the individual and/or
others, suggesting a change in mental state (i.e., the symptoms are of
sufficient severity or frequency to warrant clinical attention)
(Criterion A). Attenuated delusions (Criterion A1) may have
suspiciousness/persecutory ideational content, including persecutory
ideas of reference. The individual may have a guarded, distrustful
attitude. When the delusions are moderate in severity, the individual
views others as untrustworthy and may be hypervigilant or sense ill will
in others. When the delusions are severe but still within the attenuated
range, the individual entertains loosely organized beliefs about danger
or hostile intention, but the delusions do not have the fixed nature
that is necessary for the diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Guarded
behavior in the interview can interfere with the ability to gather
information. Reality testing and perspective can be elicited with
nonconfirming evidence, but the propensity for viewing the world as
hostile and dangerous remains strong. Attenuated delusions may have
grandiose content presenting as an unrealistic sense of superior
capacity. When the delusions are moderate, the individual harbors
notions

of being gifted, influential, or special. When the delusions are severe,
the individual has beliefs of superiority that often alienate friends
and worry relatives. Thoughts of being special may lead to unrealistic
plans and investments, yet skepticism about these attitudes can be
elicited with persistent questioning and confrontation. Attenuated
hallucinations (Criterion A2) include alterations in sensory
perceptions, usually auditory and/or visual. When the hallucinations are
moderate, the sounds and images are often unformed (e.g., shadows,
trails, halos, murmurs, rumbling), and they are experienced as unusual
or puzzling. When the hallucinations are severe, these experiences
become more vivid and frequent (i.e., recurring illusions or
hallucinations that capture attention and affect thinking and
concentration). These perceptual abnormalities may disrupt behavior, but
skepticism about their reality can still be induced. Disorganized
communication (Criterion A3) may manifest as odd speech (vague,
metaphorical, overelaborate, stereotyped), unfocused speech (confused,
muddled, too fast or too slow, wrong words, irrelevant context, off
track), or meandering speech (circumstantial, tangential). When the
disorganization is moderately severe, the individual frequently gets
into irrelevant topics but responds easily to clarifying questions.
Speech may be odd but understandable. At the moderately severe level,
speech becomes meandering and circumstantial, and when the
disorganization is severe, the individual fails to get to the point
without external guidance (tangential). At the severe level, some
thought blocking and/or loose associations may occur infrequently,
especially when the individual is under pressure, but reorienting
questions quickly return structure and organization to the conversation.
The individual realizes that changes in mental state and/or in
relationships are taking place. He or she maintains reasonable insight
into the psychotic-like experiences and generally appreciates that
altered perceptions are not real and magical ideation is not compelling.
The individual must experience distress and/or impaired performance in
social or role functioning (Criterion D), and the individual or
responsible others must note the changes and express concern, such that
clinical care is sought (Criterion A).

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis

The individual may experience magical thinking, perceptual aberrations,
difficulty in concentration, some disorganization in thought or
behavior, excessive suspiciousness, anxiety, social withdrawal, and
disruption in sleep-wake cycle. Impaired cognitive function9 and
negative symptoms11 are often observed. Neuroimaging variables
distinguish cohorts with attenuated psychosis syndrome from normal
control cohorts with patterns similar to, but less severe than, that
observed in schizophrenia3, 4, 6, 7. However, neuroimaging data is not
diagnostic at the individual level.

Prevalence The prevalence of attenuated psychosis syndrome is unknown.
Symptoms in Criterion A are not uncommon in the non-help-seeking
population, ranging from 8%--13% for hallucinatory experiences and
delusional thinking10. There appears to be a slight male preponderance
for attenuated psychosis syndrome.

Development and Course Onset of attenuated psychosis syndrome is usually
in mid-to-late adolescence or early adulthood11. It may be preceded by
normal development or evidence for impaired cognition, negative
symptoms, and/or impaired social development. In help-seeking cohorts,
approximately 18% in 1 year and 32% in 3 years may progress
symptomatically and met criteria for a psychotic disorder2. In some
cases, the syndrome may transition to a depressive or bipolar disorder
with psychotic features, but development to a schizophrenia spectrum
disorder is more frequent. It appears that the diagnosis is best applied
to individuals ages 15--35 years2. Long-term course is not yet described
beyond 7--12 years2.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Temperamental. Factors predicting prognosis
of attenuated psychosis syndrome have not been definitively
characterized, but the presence of negative symptoms, cognitive
impairment, and poor functioning are associated with poor outcome and
increase risk of transition to psychosis. Genetic and physiological. A
family history of psychosis places the individual with attenuated
psychosis syndrome at increased risk for

developing a full psychotic disorder12. Structural3, 8, functional3, and
neurochemical5 imaging data are associated with increased risk of
transition to psychosis.

Functional Consequences of Attenuated Psychosis Syndrome Many
individuals may experience functional impairments. Modest-tomoderate
impairment in social and role functioning may persist even with
abatement of symptoms1. A substantial portion of individuals with the
diagnosis will improve over time; many continue to have mild symptoms
and impairment, and many others will have a full recovery1.

Differential Diagnosis Brief psychotic disorder. When symptoms of
attenuated psychosis syndrome initially manifest, they may resemble
symptoms of brief psychotic disorder. However, in attenuated psychosis
syndrome, the symptoms do not cross the psychosis threshold and reality
testing/insight remains intact. Schizotypal personality disorder.
Schizotypal personality disorder, although having symptomatic features
that are similar to those of attenuated psychosis syndrome, is a
relatively stable trait disorder not meeting the state-dependent aspects
(Criterion C) of attenuated psychosis syndrome. In addition, a broader
array of symptoms is required for schizotypal personality disorder,
although in the early stages of presentation it may resemble attenuated
psychosis syndrome. Depressive or bipolar disorders. Reality distortions
that are temporally limited to an episode of a major depressive disorder
or bipolar disorder and are descriptively more characteristic of those
disorders do not meet Criterion E for attenuated psychosis syndrome. For
example, feelings of low self-esteem or attributions of low regard from
others in the context of major depressive disorder would not qualify for
comorbid attenuated psychosis syndrome. Anxiety disorders. Reality
distortions that are temporally limited to an episode of an anxiety
disorder and are descriptively more characteristic of an anxiety
disorder do not meet Criterion E for attenuated psychosis

syndrome. For example, a feeling of being the focus of undesired
attention in the context of social anxiety disorder would not qualify
for comorbid attenuated psychosis syndrome. Bipolar II disorder. Reality
distortions that are temporally limited to an episode of mania or
hypomania and are descriptively more characteristic of bipolar disorder
do not meet Criterion E for attenuated psychosis syndrome. For example,
inflated self-esteem in the context of pressured speech and reduced need
for sleep would not qualify for comorbid attenuated psychosis syndrome.
Borderline personality disorder. Reality distortions that are
concomitant with borderline personality disorder and are descriptively
more characteristic of it do not meet Criterion E for attenuated
psychosis syndrome. For example, a sense of being unable to experience
feelings in the context of an intense fear of real or imagined
abandonment and recurrent self-mutilation would not qualify for comorbid
attenuated psychosis syndrome. Adjustment reaction of adolescence. Mild,
transient symptoms typical of normal development and consistent with the
degree of stress experienced do not qualify for attenuated psychosis
syndrome. Extreme end of perceptual aberration and magical thinking in
the nonill population. This diagnostic possibility should be strongly
entertained when reality distortions are not associated with distress
and functional impairment and need for care.
Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Substance use is common
among individuals whose symptoms meet attenuated psychosis syndrome
criteria. When otherwise qualifying characteristic symptoms are strongly
temporally related to substance use episodes, Criterion E for attenuated
psychosis syndrome may not be met, and a diagnosis of
substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder may be preferred.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. A history of attentional
impairment does not exclude a current attenuated psychosis syndrome
diagnosis. Earlier attentional impairment may be a prodromal condition
or comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Comorbidity

Individuals with attenuated psychosis syndrome often experience anxiety
and/or depression11. Some individuals with an attenuated psychosis
syndrome diagnosis will progress to another diagnosis, including
anxiety, depressive, bipolar, and personality disorders1. In such cases,
the psychopathology associated with the attenuated psychosis syndrome
diagnosis is reconceptualized as the prodromal phase of another
disorder, not a comorbid condition.

Depressive Episodes With Short-Duration Hypomania Proposed Criteria
Lifetime experience of at least one major depressive episode meeting the
following criteria: a. Five (or more) of the following criteria have
been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from
previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1)
depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure. (Note: Do not
include symptoms that are clearly attributable to a medical
condition.) 1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as
indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, or
hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note:
In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.) 2. Markedly
diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most
of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account
or observation).

3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a
change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or
increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider
failure to make expected weight gain.) 4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly
every day. 5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day
(observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or
being slowed down). 6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day. 7.
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may
be delusional) nearly every day (not merely selfreproach or guilt about
being sick). 8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or
indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as
observed by others). 9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of
dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a
suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. b. The
symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning. c. The
disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance or another medical condition. d. The disturbance is not better
explained by schizoaffective disorder and is not superimposed on
schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other
specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic
disorder. At least two lifetime episodes of hypomanic periods that
involve the required criterion symptoms below but are of insufficient
duration (at least 2 days but less than 4 consecutive days) to meet
criteria for a hypomanic episode. The criterion symptoms are as follows:
a. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive,
or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or
energy.

b. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and
activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted (four
if the mood is only irritable), represent a noticeable change from usual
behavior, and have been present to a significant degree: 1. Inflated
self-esteem or grandiosity. 2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels
rested after only 3 hours of sleep). 3. More talkative than usual or
pressured to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience
that thoughts are racing. 5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily
drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or
observed. 6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at
work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation. 7. Excessive
involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful
consequences (e.g., the individual engages in unrestrained buying
sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). c. The
episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is
uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic. d. The
disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are observable by
others. e. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment
in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization.
If there are psychotic features, the episode is, by definition, manic.
f. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment).

Diagnostic Features Individuals with short-duration hypomania have
experienced at least one major depressive episode as well as at least
two episodes of 2--3 days' duration in which criteria for a hypomanic
episode were met (except for symptom duration). These episodes are of
sufficient intensity to be

categorized as a hypomanic episode but do not meet the 4-day duration
requirement. Symptoms are present to a significant degree, such that
they represent a noticeable change from the individual's normal
behavior. An individual with a history of a syndromal hypomanic episode
and a major depressive episode by definition has bipolar II disorder,
regardless of current duration of hypomanic symptoms.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Individuals who have
experienced both short-duration hypomania and a major depressive
episode, with their increased comorbidity with substance use disorders
and a greater family history of bipolar disorder, more closely resemble
individuals with bipolar disorder than those with major depressive
disorder6. Differences have also been found between individuals with
short-duration hypomania and those with syndromal bipolar disorder. Work
impairment was greater for individuals with syndromal bipolar disorder,
as was the estimated average number of episodes5. Individuals with
short-duration hypomania may exhibit less severity than individuals with
syndromal hypomanic episodes, including less mood lability3.

Prevalence The prevalence of short-duration hypomania is unclear, since
the criteria are new as of this edition of the manual. Using somewhat
different criteria, however, it has been estimated that short-duration
hypomania occurs in 2.8% of the population (compared with hypomania or
mania in 5.5% of the population)1. Short-duration hypomania may be more
common in females, who may present with more features of atypical
depression4.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. A family history
of mania is two to three times more common in individuals with
short-duration hypomania compared with the general population, but less
than half as common as in individuals with a history of syndromal mania
or hypomania1.

Suicide Risk

Individuals with short-duration hypomania have higher rates of suicide
attempts than healthy individuals, although not as high as the rates in
individuals with syndromal bipolar disorder3.

Functional Consequences Hypomania

of

Short-Duration

Functional impairments associated specifically with short-duration
hypomania are as yet not fully determined. However, research suggests
that individuals with this disorder have less work impairment than
individuals with syndromal bipolar disorder5 but more comorbid substance
use disorders, particularly alcohol use disorder, than individuals with
major depressive disorder6.

Differential Diagnosis Bipolar II disorder. Bipolar II disorder is
characterized by a period of at least 4 days of hypomanic symptoms,
whereas short-duration hypomania is characterized by periods of 2--3
days of hypomanic symptoms. Once an individual has experienced a
hypomanic episode (4 days or more), the diagnosis becomes and remains
bipolar II disorder regardless of future duration of hypomanic symptom
periods. Major depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder is also
characterized by at least one lifetime major depressive episode.
However, the additional presence of at least two lifetime periods of
2--3 days of hypomanic symptoms leads to a diagnosis of short-duration
hypomania rather than to major depressive disorder. Major depressive
disorder with mixed features. Both major depressive disorder with mixed
features and short-duration hypomania are characterized by the presence
of some hypomanic symptoms and a major depressive episode. However,
major depressive disorder with mixed features is characterized by
hypomanic features present concurrently with a major depressive episode,
while individuals with short-duration hypomania experience subsyndromal
hypomania and fully syndromal major depression at different times.
Bipolar I disorder. Bipolar I disorder is differentiated from
short-duration hypomania by at least one lifetime manic episode, which
is longer (at least

1 week) and more severe (causes more impaired social functioning) than a
hypomanic episode. An episode (of any duration) that involves psychotic
symptoms or necessitates hospitalization is by definition a manic
episode rather than a hypomanic one. Cyclothymic disorder. While
cyclothymic disorder is characterized by periods of depressive symptoms
and periods of hypomanic symptoms, the lifetime presence of a major
depressive episode precludes the diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder.

Comorbidity Short-duration hypomania, similar to full hypomanic
episodes, has been associated with higher rates of comorbid anxiety
disorders and substance use disorders than are found in the general
population2, 6.

Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder Proposed Criteria a. The
individual experienced the death of someone with whom he or she had a
close relationship. b. Since the death, at least one of the following
symptoms is experienced on more days than not and to a clinically
significant degree and has persisted for at least 12 months after the
death in the case of bereaved adults and 6 months for bereaved
children: 1. Persistent yearning/longing for the deceased. In young
children, yearning may be expressed in play and behavior, including
behaviors that reflect being separated from, and also reuniting with, a
caregiver or other attachment figure. 2. Intense sorrow and emotional
pain in response to the death. 3. Preoccupation with the deceased. 4.
Preoccupation with the circumstances of the death. In children, this
preoccupation with the deceased may be expressed through the themes of
play and behavior and may extend to preoccupation with possible death of
others close to them. c. Since the death, at least six of the following
symptoms are experienced on more days than not and to a clinically
significant degree, and have persisted for at least 12 months after the
death in the case of bereaved adults and 6 months for bereaved children:
Reactive distress to the death 1. Marked difficulty accepting the death.
In children, this is dependent on the child's capacity to comprehend the
meaning and permanence of death. 2. Experiencing disbelief or emotional
numbness over the loss. 3. Difficulty with positive reminiscing about
the deceased. 4. Bitterness or anger related to the loss. 5. Maladaptive
appraisals about oneself in relation to the deceased or the death (e.g.,
self-blame).

6. Excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss (e.g., avoidance of
individuals, places, or situations associated with the deceased; in
children, this may include avoidance of thoughts and feelings regarding
the deceased). Social/identity disruption 7. A desire to die in order to
be with the deceased. 8. Difficulty trusting other individuals since the
death. 9. Feeling alone or detached from other individuals since the
death. 10. Feeling that life is meaningless or empty without the
deceased, or the belief that one cannot function without the deceased.
11. Confusion about one's role in life, or a diminished sense of one's
identity (e.g., feeling that a part of oneself died with the deceased).
12. Difficulty or reluctance to pursue interests since the loss or to
plan for the future (e.g., friendships, activities). d. The disturbance
causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, or other important areas of functioning. e. The
bereavement reaction is out of proportion to or inconsistent with
cultural, religious, or age-appropriate norms. Specify if: With
traumatic bereavement: Bereavement due to homicide or suicide with
persistent distressing preoccupations regarding the traumatic nature of
the death (often in response to loss reminders), including the
deceased's last moments, degree of suffering and mutilating injury, or
the malicious or intentional nature of the death.

Diagnostic Features Persistent complex bereavement disorder is diagnosed
only if at least 12 months (6 months in children) have elapsed since the
death of someone with whom the bereaved had a close relationship
(Criterion A). This time frame discriminates normal grief from
persistent grief. The condition

typically involves a persistent yearning/longing for the deceased
(Criterion B1), which may be associated with intense sorrow and frequent
crying (Criterion B2) or preoccupation with the deceased (Criterion
B3)8, 9. The individual may also be preoccupied with the manner in which
the person died (Criterion B4). Six additional symptoms are required,
including marked difficulty accepting that the individual has died
(Criterion C1) (e.g., preparing meals for them), disbelief that the
individual is dead (Criterion C2), distressing memories of the deceased
(Criterion C3), anger over the loss (Criterion C4), maladaptive
appraisals about oneself in relation to the deceased or the death
(Criterion C5)2, and excessive avoidance of reminders of the loss
(Criterion C6). Individuals may also report a desire to die because they
wish to be with the deceased (Criterion C7); be distrustful of others
(Criterion C8); feel isolated (Criterion C9); believe that life has no
meaning or purpose without the deceased (Criterion C10); experience a
diminished sense of identity in which they feel a part of themselves has
died or been lost (Criterion C11); or have difficulty engaging in
activities, pursuing relationships, or planning for the future
(Criterion C12). Persistent complex bereavement disorder requires
clinically significant distress or impairment in psychosocial
functioning (Criterion D). The nature and severity of grief must be
beyond expected norms for the relevant cultural setting, religious
group, or developmental stage (Criterion E). Although there are
variations in how grief can manifest, the symptoms of persistent complex
bereavement disorder occur in both genders and in diverse social and
cultural groups6.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Some individuals with
persistent complex bereavement disorder experience hallucinations of the
deceased (auditory or visual) in which they temporarily perceive the
deceased's presence (e.g., seeing the deceased sitting in his or her
favorite chair)10. They may also experience diverse somatic complaints
(e.g., digestive complaints, pain, fatigue)10, including symptoms
experienced by the deceased.

Prevalence

The prevalence of persistent complex bereavement disorder is
approximately 2.4%--4.8%3, 5. The disorder is more prevalent in females
than in males5.

Development and Course Persistent complex bereavement disorder can occur
at any age, beginning after the age of 1 year. Symptoms usually begin
within the initial months after the death, although there may be a delay
of months, or even years, before the full syndrome appears. Although
grief responses commonly appear immediately following bereavement, these
reactions are not diagnosed as persistent complex bereavement disorder
unless the symptoms persist beyond 12 months (6 months for children).
Young children may experience the loss of a primary caregiver as
traumatic, given the disorganizing effects the caregiver's absence can
have on a child's coping response. In children, the distress may be
expressed in play and behavior, developmental regressions, and anxious
or protest behavior at times of separation and reunion4. Separation
distress may be predominant in younger children, and social/identity
distress and risk for comorbid depression can increasingly manifest in
older children and adolescents1.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Risk for persistent complex
bereavement disorder is heightened by increased dependency on the
deceased person prior to the death and by the death of a child8, 9.
Disturbances in caregiver support increase the risk for bereaved
children. Genetic and physiological. Risk for the disorder is heightened
by the bereaved individual being female5, 7.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues The symptoms of persistent complex
bereavement disorder are observed across cultural settings9, but grief
responses may manifest in culturally specific ways. Diagnosis of the
disorder requires that the persistent and severe responses go beyond
cultural norms of grief responses and not be better explained by
culturally specific mourning rituals.

Suicide Risk Individuals with persistent complex bereavement disorder
frequently report suicidal ideation.

Functional Consequences of Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder
Persistent complex bereavement disorder is associated with deficits in
work and social functioning and with harmful health behaviors, such as
increased tobacco and alcohol use8. It is also associated with marked
increases in risks for serious medical conditions, including cardiac
disease, hypertension, cancer, immunological deficiency, and reduced
quality of life8.

Differential Diagnosis Normal grief. Persistent complex bereavement
disorder is distinguished from normal grief by the presence of severe
grief reactions that persist at least 12 months (or 6 months in
children) after the death of the bereaved. It is only when severe levels
of grief response persist at least 12 months following the death and
interfere with the individual's capacity to function that persistent
complex bereavement disorder is diagnosed. Depressive disorders.
Persistent complex bereavement disorder, major depressive disorder, and
persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) share sadness, crying, and
suicidal thinking. Whereas major depressive disorder and persistent
depressive disorder can share depressed mood with persistent complex
bereavement disorder, the latter is characterized by a focus on the
loss. Posttraumatic stress disorder. Individuals who experience
bereavement as a result of traumatic death may develop both
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and persistent complex bereavement
disorder. Both conditions can involve intrusive thoughts and avoidance.
Whereas intrusions in PTSD revolve around the traumatic event, intrusive
memories in persistent complex bereavement disorder focus on thoughts
about many aspects of the relationship with the deceased, including
positive aspects of the relationship and distress over the separation.
In individuals with the traumatic bereavement specifier of persistent
complex bereavement

disorder, the distressing thoughts or feelings may be more overtly
related to the manner of death, with distressing fantasies of what
happened. Both persistent complex bereavement disorder and PTSD can
involve avoidance of reminders of distressing events. Whereas avoidance
in PTSD is characterized by consistent avoidance of internal and
external reminders of the traumatic experience, in persistent complex
bereavement disorder, there is also a preoccupation with the loss and
yearning for the deceased, which is absent in PTSD. Separation anxiety
disorder. Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by anxiety about
separation from current attachment figures, whereas persistent complex
bereavement disorder involves distress about separation from a deceased
individual.

Comorbidity The most common comorbid disorders with persistent complex
bereavement disorder are major depressive disorder, PTSD, and substance
use disorders1. PTSD is more frequently comorbid with persistent complex
bereavement disorder when the death occurred in traumatic or violent
circumstances.

Caffeine Use Disorder Proposed Criteria A problematic pattern of
caffeine use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress,
as manifested by at least the first three of the following criteria
occurring within a 12-month period: 1. A persistent desire or
unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control caffeine use. 2. Continued
caffeine use despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
exacerbated by caffeine. 3. Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the
following: a. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for caffeine. b.
Caffeine (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid
withdrawal symptoms.

4. Caffeine is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period
than was intended. 5. Recurrent caffeine use resulting in a failure to
fulfill major role obligations at work, school, or home (e.g., repeated
tardiness or absences from work or school related to caffeine use or
withdrawal). 6. Continued caffeine use despite having persistent or
recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the
effects of caffeine (e.g., arguments with spouse about consequences of
use, medical problems, cost). 7. Tolerance, as defined by either of the
following: a. A need for markedly increased amounts of caffeine to
achieve desired effect. b. Markedly diminished effect with continued use
of the same amount of caffeine. 8. A great deal of time is spent in
activities necessary to obtain caffeine, use caffeine, or recover from
its effects. 9. Craving or a strong desire or urge to use caffeine. A
diagnosis of substance dependence due to caffeine is recognized by the
World Health Organization in ICD-10. Since the publication of DSM-IV in
1994, considerable research on caffeine dependence has been published,
and several recent reviews provide a current analysis of this
literature2. There is now sufficient evidence to warrant inclusion of
caffeine use disorder as a research diagnosis in DSM-5 to encourage
additional research. The working diagnostic algorithm proposed for the
study of caffeine use disorder differs from that of the other substance
use disorders, reflecting the need to identify only cases that have
sufficient clinical importance to warrant the labeling of a mental
disorder. A key goal of including caffeine use disorder in this section
of DSM-5 is to stimulate research that will determine the reliability,
validity, and prevalence of caffeine use disorder based on the proposed
diagnostic schema, with particular attention to the association of the
diagnosis with functional impairments as part of validity testing.

The proposed criteria for caffeine use disorder reflect the need for a
diagnostic threshold higher than that used for the other substance use
disorders. Such a threshold is intended to prevent overdiagnosis of
caffeine use disorder due to the high rate of habitual nonproblematic
daily caffeine use in the general population.

Diagnostic Features Caffeine use disorder is characterized by the
continued use of caffeine and failure to control use despite negative
physical and/or psychological consequences. In a survey of the general
population, 14% of caffeine users met the criterion of use despite harm,
with most reporting that a physician or counselor had advised them to
stop or reduce caffeine use within the last year1. Medical and
psychological problems attributed to caffeine included heart, stomach,
and urinary problems, and complaints of anxiety, depression, insomnia,
irritability, and difficulty thinking. In the same survey, 45% of
caffeine users reported desire or unsuccessful efforts to control
caffeine use, 18% reported withdrawal, 8% reported tolerance, 28% used
more than intended, and 50% reported spending a great deal of time using
caffeine. In addition, 19% reported a strong desire for caffeine that
they could not resist, and less than 1% reported that caffeine had
interfered with social activities. Among those seeking treatment for
quitting problematic caffeine use3, 88% reported having made prior
serious attempts to modify caffeine use, and 43% reported having been
advised by a medical professional to reduce or eliminate caffeine.
Ninety-three percent endorsed signs and symptoms meeting DSM-IV criteria
for caffeine dependence, with the most commonly endorsed criteria being
withdrawal (96%), persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to control
use (89%), and use despite knowledge of physical or psychological
problems caused by caffeine (87%). The most common reasons for wanting
to modify caffeine use were health-related (59%) and a desire to not be
dependent on caffeine (35%). The DSM-5 discussion of caffeine withdrawal
in the Section II chapter "Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders"
provides information on the features of the withdrawal criterion. It is
well documented that habitual caffeine users can experience a
well-defined withdrawal syndrome upon acute abstinence from caffeine,
and many caffeine-dependent individuals

report continued use of caffeine to avoid experiencing withdrawal
symptoms.

Prevalence The prevalence of caffeine use disorder in the general
population is unclear. Based on all seven generic DSM-IV-TR criteria for
dependence, 30% of current caffeine users may have met DSM-IV criteria
for a diagnosis of caffeine dependence, with endorsement of three or
more dependence criteria, during the past year. When only four of the
seven criteria (the three primary criteria proposed above plus
tolerance) are used, the prevalence appears to drop to 9%. Thus, the
expected prevalence of caffeine use disorder among regular caffeine
users is likely less than 9%1. Given that approximately 75%--80% of the
general population uses caffeine regularly, the estimated prevalence
would be less than 7%. Among regular caffeine drinkers at higher risk
for caffeine use problems (e.g., high school and college students,
individuals in drug treatment, and individuals at pain clinics who have
recent histories of alcohol or illicit drug misuse), approximately 20%
may have a pattern of use that meets all three of the proposed criteria
in Criterion A9.

Development and Course Individuals whose pattern of use meets criteria
for a caffeine use disorder have shown a wide range of daily caffeine
intake and have been consumers of various types of caffeinated products
(e.g., coffee, soft drinks, tea) and medications. A diagnosis of
caffeine use disorder has been shown to prospectively predict a greater
incidence of caffeine reinforcement and more severe withdrawal2, 8.
There has been no longitudinal or cross-sectional lifespan research on
caffeine use disorder. Caffeine use disorder has been identified in both
adolescents and adults. Rates of caffeine consumption and overall level
of caffeine consumption tend to increase with age until the early to
mid-30s and then level off2. Age-related factors for caffeine use
disorder are unknown, although concern is growing related to excessive
caffeine consumption among adolescents and young adults through use of
caffeinated energy drinks.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Genetic and physiological. Heritabilities of
heavy caffeine use, caffeine tolerance, and caffeine withdrawal range
from 35% to 77%. For caffeine use, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking, a
common genetic factor (polysubstance use) underlies the use of these
three substances, with 28%-- 41% of the heritable effects of caffeine
use (or heavy use) shared with alcohol and smoking. Caffeine and tobacco
use disorders are associated and substantially influenced by genetic
factors unique to these licit drugs. The magnitude of heritability for
caffeine use disorder markers appears to be similar to that for alcohol
and tobacco use disorder markers2, 4, 6, 11.

Functional Disorder

Consequences

of

Caffeine

Use

Caffeine use disorder may predict greater use of caffeine during
pregnancy10. Caffeine withdrawal, a key feature of caffeine use
disorder, has been shown to produce functional impairment in normal
daily activities. Caffeine intoxication may include symptoms of nausea
and vomiting, as well as impairment of normal activities7, 8.
Significant disruptions in normal daily activities may occur during
caffeine abstinence8.

Differential Diagnosis Nonproblematic use of caffeine. The distinction
between nonproblematic use of caffeine and caffeine use disorder can be
difficult to make because social, behavioral, or psychological problems
may be difficult to attribute to the substance, especially in the
context of use of other substances. Regular, heavy caffeine use that can
result in tolerance and withdrawal is relatively common, which by itself
should not be sufficient for making a diagnosis. Other stimulant use
disorder. Problems related to use of other stimulant medications or
substances may approximate the features of caffeine use disorder.
Anxiety disorders. Chronic heavy caffeine use may mimic generalized
anxiety disorder, and acute caffeine consumption may produce and mimic
panic attacks.

Comorbidity

There may be comorbidity between caffeine use disorder and daily
cigarette smoking, a family or personal history of alcohol use
disorder8, 8. Features of caffeine use disorder (e.g., tolerance,
caffeine withdrawal) may be positively associated with several
diagnoses: major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic
disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder, and alcohol, cannabis,
and cocaine use disorders5.

Internet Gaming Disorder Proposed Criteria Persistent and recurrent use
of the Internet to engage in games, often with other players, leading to
clinically significant impairment or distress as indicated by five (or
more) of the following in a 12-month period: 1. Preoccupation with
Internet games. (The individual thinks about previous gaming activity or
anticipates playing the next game; Internet gaming becomes the dominant
activity in daily life.) Note: This disorder is distinct from Internet
gambling, which is included under gambling disorder. 2. Withdrawal
symptoms when Internet gaming is taken away. (These symptoms are
typically described as irritability, anxiety, or sadness, but there are
no physical signs of pharmacological withdrawal.) 3. Tolerance---the
need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in Internet games. 4.
Unsuccessful attempts to control the participation in Internet games. 5.
Loss of interests in previous hobbies and entertainment as a result of,
and with the exception of, Internet games. 6. Continued excessive use of
Internet games despite knowledge of psychosocial problems. 7. Has
deceived family members, therapists, or others regarding the amount of
Internet gaming.

8. Use of Internet games to escape or relieve a negative mood (e.g.,
feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety). 9. Has jeopardized or lost a
significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity
because of participation in Internet games. Note: Only nongambling
Internet games are included in this disorder. Use of the Internet for
required activities in a business or profession is not included; nor is
the disorder intended to include other recreational or social Internet
use. Similarly, sexual Internet sites are excluded. Specify current
severity: Internet gaming disorder can be mild, moderate, or severe
depending on the degree of disruption of normal activities. Individuals
with less severe Internet gaming disorder may exhibit fewer symptoms and
less disruption of their lives. Those with severe Internet gaming
disorder will have more hours spent on the computer and more severe loss
of relationships or career or school opportunities.

Subtypes There are no well-researched subtypes for Internet gaming
disorder to date. Internet gaming disorder most often involves specific
Internet games, but it could involve non-Internet computerized games as
well, although these have been less researched. It is likely that
preferred games will vary over time as new games are developed and
popularized, and it is unclear if behaviors and consequence associated
with Internet gaming disorder vary by game type.

Diagnostic Features Gambling disorder is currently the only
non-substance-related disorder proposed for inclusion with DSM-5
substance-related and addictive disorders. However, there are other
behavioral disorders that show some similarities to substance use
disorders and gambling disorder for which the word addiction is commonly
used in nonmedical settings, and the one condition with a considerable
literature is the compulsive playing of Internet games. Internet gaming
has been reportedly defined as an "addiction" by the Chinese
government7, and a treatment system has been

set up. Reports of treatment of this condition have appeared in medical
journals, mostly from Asian countries and some in the United States. The
DSM-5 work group reviewed more than 240 articles and found some
behavioral similarities of Internet gaming to gambling disorder and to
substance use disorders3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. The literature
suffers, however, from lack of a standard definition from which to
derive prevalence data. An understanding of the natural histories of
cases, with or without treatment, is also missing. The literature does
describe many underlying similarities to substance addictions, including
aspects of tolerance, withdrawal, repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut
back or quit, and impairment in normal functioning. Further, the
seemingly high prevalence rates, both in Asian countries and, to a
lesser extent, in the West, justified inclusion of this disorder in
Section III of DSM-5. Internet gaming disorder has significant public
health importance, and additional research may eventually lead to
evidence that Internet gaming disorder (also commonly referred to as
Internet use disorder, Internet addiction, or gaming addiction) has
merit as an independent disorder. As with gambling disorder, there
should be epidemiological studies to determine prevalence, clinical
course, possible genetic influence, and potential biological factors
based on, for example, brain imaging data. Internet gaming disorder is a
pattern of excessive and prolonged Internet gaming that results in a
cluster of cognitive and behavioral symptoms, including progressive loss
of control over gaming, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms, analogous to
the symptoms of substance use disorders. As with substance-related
disorders, individuals with Internet gaming disorder continue to sit at
a computer and engage in gaming activities despite neglect of other
activities. They typically devote 8--10 hours or more per day to this
activity and at least 30 hours per week. If they are prevented from
using a computer and returning to the game, they become agitated and
angry. They often go for long periods without food or sleep. Normal
obligations, such as school or work, or family obligations are
neglected. This condition is separate from gambling disorder involving
the Internet because money is not at risk. The essential feature of
Internet gaming disorder is persistent and recurrent participation in
computer gaming, typically group games, for many hours. These games
involve competition between groups of players (often in different global
regions, so that duration of play is encouraged by

the time-zone independence) participating in complex structured
activities that include a significant aspect of social interactions
during play. Team aspects appear to be a key motivation. Attempts to
direct the individual toward schoolwork or interpersonal activities are
strongly resisted. Thus personal, family, or vocational pursuits are
neglected. When individuals are asked, the major reasons given for using
the computer are more likely to be "avoiding boredom" rather than
communicating or searching for information. The description of criteria
related to this condition is adapted from a study in China8. Until the
optimal criteria and threshold for diagnosis are determined empirically,
conservative definitions ought to be used, such that diagnoses are
considered for endorsement of five or more of nine criteria.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis No consistent personality types
associated with Internet gaming disorder have been identified. Some
authors describe associated diagnoses, such as depressive disorders,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD). Individuals with compulsive Internet gaming have
demonstrated brain activation in specific regions triggered by exposure
to the Internet game but not limited to reward system structures1, 4

Prevalence The prevalence of Internet gaming disorder is unclear because
of the varying questionnaires, criteria and thresholds employed, but it
seems to be highest in Asian countries and in male adolescents 12--20
years of age. There is an abundance of reports from Asian countries,
especially China and South Korea, but fewer from Europe and North
America, from which prevalence estimates are highly variable. The point
prevalence in adolescents (ages 15--19 years) in one Asian study2 using
a threshold of five criteria was 8.4% for males and 4.5% for females.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Environmental. Computer availability with
Internet connection allows access to the types of games with which
Internet gaming disorder is most often associated.

Genetic and physiological. Adolescent males seem to be at greatest risk
of developing Internet gaming disorder, and it has been speculated that
Asian environmental and/or genetic background is another risk factor,
but this remains unclear.

Functional Consequences of Internet Gaming Disorder Internet gaming
disorder may lead to school failure, job loss, or marriage failure. The
compulsive gaming behavior tends to crowd out normal social, scholastic,
and family activities. Students may show declining grades and eventually
failure in school. Family responsibilities may be neglected.

Differential Diagnosis Excessive use of the Internet not involving
playing of online games (e.g., excessive use of social media, such as
Facebook; viewing pornography online) is not considered analogous to
Internet gaming disorder, and future research on other excessive uses of
the Internet would need to follow similar guidelines as suggested
herein. Excessive gambling online may qualify for a separate diagnosis
of gambling disorder.

Comorbidity Health may be neglected due to compulsive gaming. Other
diagnoses that may be associated with Internet gaming disorder include
major depressive disorder, ADHD, and OCD.

Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure
Proposed Criteria a. More than minimal exposure to alcohol during
gestation, including prior to pregnancy recognition. Confirmation of
gestational exposure to alcohol may be obtained from maternal
self-report of alcohol use in pregnancy, medical or other records, or
clinical observation. b. Impaired neurocognitive functioning as
manifested by one or more of the following: 1. Impairment in global
intellectual performance (i.e., IQ of 70 or below, or a standard score
of 70 or below on a comprehensive developmental assessment). 2.
Impairment in executive functioning (e.g., poor planning and
organization; inflexibility; difficulty with behavioral inhibition). 3.
Impairment in learning (e.g., lower academic achievement than expected
for intellectual level; specific learning disability). 4. Memory
impairment (e.g., problems remembering information learned recently;
repeatedly making the same mistakes; difficulty remembering lengthy
verbal instructions). 5. Impairment in visual-spatial reasoning (e.g.,
disorganized or poorly planned drawings or constructions; problems
differentiating left from right). c. Impaired self-regulation as
manifested by one or more of the following: 1. Impairment in mood or
behavioral regulation (e.g., mood lability; negative affect or
irritability; frequent behavioral outbursts). 2. Attention deficit
(e.g., difficulty shifting attention; difficulty sustaining mental
effort).

3. Impairment in impulse control (e.g., difficulty waiting turn;
difficulty complying with rules). d. Impairment in adaptive functioning
as manifested by two or more of the following, one of which must be (1)
or (2): 1. Communication deficit (e.g., delayed acquisition of language;
difficulty understanding spoken language). 2. Impairment in social
communication and interaction (e.g., overly friendly with strangers;
difficulty reading social cues; difficulty understanding social
consequences). 3. Impairment in daily living skills (e.g., delayed
toileting, feeding, or bathing; difficulty managing daily schedule). 4.
Impairment in motor skills (e.g., poor fine motor development; delayed
attainment of gross motor milestones or ongoing deficits in gross motor
function; deficits in coordination and balance). e. Onset of the
disorder (symptoms in Criteria B, C, and D) occurs in childhood. f. The
disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
g. The disorder is not better explained by the direct physiological
effects associated with postnatal use of a substance (e.g., a
medication, alcohol or other drugs), a general medical condition (e.g.,
traumatic brain injury, delirium, dementia), another known teratogen
(e.g., fetal hydantoin syndrome), a genetic condition (e.g., Williams
syndrome, Down syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome), or environmental
neglect. Alcohol is a neurobehavioral teratogen, and prenatal alcohol
exposure has teratogenic effects on central nervous system (CNS)
development and subsequent function12. Neurobehavioral disorder
associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE) is a new clarifying
term, intended to encompass the full range of developmental disabilities
associated with exposure to alcohol in utero. The current diagnostic
guidelines allow ND-

PAE to be diagnosed both in the absence and in the presence of the
physical effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (e.g., facial
dysmorphology required for a diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome).

Diagnostic Features The essential features of ND-PAE are the
manifestation of impairment in neurocognitive, behavioral, and adaptive
functioning associated with prenatal alcohol exposure. Impairment can be
documented based on past diagnostic evaluations (e.g., psychological or
educational assessments) or medical records, reports by the individual
or informants, and/or observation by a clinician. A clinical diagnosis
of fetal alcohol syndrome, including specific prenatal alcohol-related
facial dysmorphology and growth retardation, can be used as evidence of
significant levels of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although both animal
and human studies have documented adverse effects of lower levels of
drinking4, 13, 15, identifying how much prenatal exposure is needed to
significantly impact neurodevelopmental outcome remains challenging.
Data suggest that a history of more than minimal gestational exposure
(e.g., more than light drinking) prior to pregnancy recognition and/or
following pregnancy recognition may be required. Light drinking is
defined as 1--13 drinks per month during pregnancy with no more than 2
of these drinks consumed on any 1 drinking occasion5. Identifying a
minimal threshold of drinking during pregnancy will require
consideration of a variety of factors known to affect exposure and/or
interact to influence developmental outcomes, including stage of
prenatal development, gestational smoking, maternal and fetal genetics,
and maternal physical status (i.e., age, health, and certain obstetric
problems)2, 3, 6. Symptoms of ND-PAE include marked impairment in global
intellectual performance (IQ) or neurocognitive impairments in any of
the following areas: executive functioning, learning, memory, and/or
visual-spatial reasoning. Impairments in self-regulation are present and
may include impairment in mood or behavioral regulation, attention
deficit, or impairment in impulse control. Finally, impairments in
adaptive functioning include communication deficits and impairment in
social communication and interaction. Impairment in daily living
(self-help) skills and impairment in motor skills may be present. As it
may be difficult to obtain an accurate

assessment of the neurocognitive abilities of very young children, it is
appropriate to defer a diagnosis for children 3 years of age and
younger.

Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Associated features vary
depending on age, degree of alcohol exposure, and the individual's
environment. An individual can be diagnosed with this disorder
regardless of socioeconomic or cultural background. However, ongoing
parental alcohol/substance misuse, parental mental illness, exposure to
domestic or community violence, neglect or abuse, disrupted caregiving
relationships, multiple out-of-home placements, and lack of continuity
in medical or mental health care are often present.

Prevalence The prevalence rates of ND-PAE are unknown. However,
estimated prevalence rates of clinical conditions associated with
prenatal alcohol exposure are 2%--5% in the United States9.

Development and Course Among individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure,
evidence of CNS dysfunction varies according to developmental stage.
Although about onehalf of young children prenatally exposed to alcohol
show marked developmental delay in the first 3 years of life, other
children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure may not exhibit signs of
CNS dysfunction until they are preschool- or school-age11. Additionally,
impairments in higher order cognitive processes (i.e., executive
functioning), which are often associated with prenatal alcohol exposure,
may be more easily assessed in older children. When children reach
school age, learning difficulties, impairment in executive function, and
problems with integrative language functions usually emerge more
clearly, and both social skills deficits and challenging behavior may
become more evident7, 8. In particular, as school and other requirements
become more complex, greater deficits are noted. Because of this, the
school years represent the ages at which a diagnosis of ND-PAE would be
most likely.

Suicide Risk

Suicide is a high-risk outcome, with rates increasing significantly in
late adolescence and early adulthood10.

Functional Consequences of Neurobehavioral Disorder Associated With
Prenatal Alcohol Exposure The CNS dysfunction seen in individuals with
ND-PAE often leads to decrements in adaptive behavior and to maladaptive
behavior with lifelong consequences8, 13. Individuals affected by
prenatal alcohol exposure have a higher prevalence of disrupted school
experiences, poor employment records, trouble with the law, confinement
(legal or psychiatric), and dependent living conditions14.

Differential Diagnosis Disorders that are attributable to the
physiological effects associated with postnatal use of a substance,
another medical condition, or environmental neglect. Other
considerations include the physiological effects of postnatal substance
use, such as a medication, alcohol, or other substances; disorders due
to another medical condition, such as traumatic brain injury or other
neurocognitive disorders (e.g., delirium, major neurocognitive disorder
\[dementia\]); or environmental neglect. Genetic and teratogenic
conditions. Genetic conditions such as Williams syndrome, Down syndrome,
or Cornelia de Lange syndrome and other teratogenic conditions such as
fetal hydantoin syndrome and maternal phenylketonuria may have similar
physical and behavioral characteristics. A careful review of prenatal
exposure history is needed to clarify the teratogenic agent, and an
evaluation by a clinical geneticist may be needed to distinguish
physical characteristics associated with these and other genetic
conditions.

Comorbidity Mental health problems have been identified in more than 90%
of individuals with histories of significant prenatal alcohol exposure.
The most common co-occurring diagnosis is
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder10, but research has shown that
individuals with ND-PAE differ in

neuropsychological characteristics and in their responsiveness to
pharmacological interventions8. Other high- probability co-occurring
disorders include oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder10,
but the appropriateness of these diagnoses should be weighed in the
context of the significant impairments in general intellectual and
executive functioning that are often associated with prenatal alcohol
exposure. Mood symptoms, including symptoms of bipolar disorder and
depressive disorders, have been described10. History of prenatal alcohol
exposure is associated with an increased risk for later tobacco,
alcohol, and other substance use disorders1.

Suicidal Behavior Disorder Proposed Criteria a. Within the last 24
months, the individual has made a suicide attempt. Note: A suicide
attempt is a self-initiated sequence of behaviors by an individual who,
at the time of initiation, expected that the set of actions would lead
to his or her own death. (The "time of initiation" is the time when a
behavior took place that involved applying the method.) b. The act does
not meet criteria for nonsuicidal self-injury---that is, it does not
involve self-injury directed to the surface of the body

undertaken to induce relief from a negative feeling/cognitive state or
to achieve a positive mood state. c. The diagnosis is not applied to
suicidal ideation or to preparatory acts. d. The act was not initiated
during a state of delirium or confusion. e. The act was not undertaken
solely for a political or religious objective. Specify if: Current: Not
more than 12 months since the last attempt. In early remission: 12--24
months since the last attempt.

Specifiers Suicidal behavior is often categorized in terms of violence
of the method. Generally, overdoses with legal or illegal substances are
considered nonviolent in method, whereas jumping, gunshot wounds, and
other methods are considered violent. Another dimension for
classification is medical consequences of the behavior, with
high-lethality attempts being defined as those requiring medical
hospitalization beyond a visit to an emergency department. An additional
dimension considered includes the degree of planning versus
impulsiveness of the attempt, a characteristic that might have
consequences for the medical outcome of a suicide attempt. If the
suicidal behavior occurred 12--24 months prior to evaluation, the
condition is considered to be in early remission. Individuals remain at
higher risk for further suicide attempts and death in the 24 months
after a suicide attempt1, and the period 12--24 months after the
behavior took place is specified as "early remission."

Diagnostic Features The essential manifestation of suicidal behavior
disorder is a suicide attempt. A suicide attempt is a behavior that the
individual has undertaken with at least some intent to die. The behavior
might or might not lead to injury or serious medical consequences.
Several factors can influence the medical consequences of the suicide
attempt, including poor planning, lack of knowledge about the lethality
of the method chosen, low intentionality or

ambivalence, or chance intervention by others after the behavior has
been initiated. These should not be considered in assigning the
diagnosis. Determining the degree of intent can be challenging.
Individuals might not acknowledge intent, especially in situations where
doing so could result in hospitalization or cause distress to loved
ones. Markers of risk include degree of planning, including selection of
a time and place to minimize rescue or interruption2, the individual's
mental state at the time of the behavior, with acute agitation being
especially concerning3, recent discharge from inpatient care5, or recent
discontinuation of a mood stabilizer such as lithium or an antipsychotic
such as clozapine in the case of schizophrenia6, 8. Examples of
environmental "triggers" include recently learning of a potentially
fatal medical diagnosis such as cancer7, experiencing the sudden and
unexpected loss of a close relative or partner, loss of employment, or
displacement from housing. Conversely, features such as talking to
others about future events or preparedness to sign a contract for safety
are less reliable indicators. In order for the criteria to be met, the
individual must have made at least one suicide attempt. Suicide attempts
can include behaviors in which, after initiating the suicide attempt,
the individual changed his or her mind or someone intervened. For
example, an individual might intend to ingest a given amount of
medication or poison, but either stop or be stopped by another before
ingesting the full amount. If the individual is dissuaded by another or
changes his or her mind before initiating the behavior, the diagnosis
should not be made. The act must not meet criteria for nonsuicidal
self-injury---that is, it should not involve repeated (at least five
times within the past 12 months) self-injurious episodes undertaken to
induce relief from a negative feeling/cognitive state or to achieve a
positive mood state. The act should not have been initiated during a
state of delirium or confusion. If the individual deliberately became
intoxicated before initiating the behavior, to reduce anticipatory
anxiety and to minimize interference with the intended behavior, the
diagnosis should be made.

Development and Course Suicidal behavior can occur at any time in the
lifespan but is rarely seen in children under the age of 5. In
prepubertal children, the behavior will often consist of a behavior
(e.g., sitting on a ledge) that a parent has forbidden

because of the risk of accident. Approximately 25%--30% of persons who
attempt suicide will go on to make more attempts4, 10.There is
significant variability in terms of frequency, method, and lethality of
attempts. However, this is not different from what is observed in other
illnesses, such as major depressive disorder, in which frequency of
episode, subtype of episode, and impairment for a given episode can vary
significantly.

Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues Suicidal behavior varies in frequency
and form across cultures9. Cultural differences might be due to method
availability (e.g., poisoning with pesticides in developing countries;
gunshot wounds in the southwestern United States) or the presence of
culturally specific syndromes (e.g., ataques de nervios, which in some
Latino groups might lead to behaviors that closely resemble suicide
attempts or might facilitate suicide attempts).

Diagnostic Markers Laboratory abnormalities consequent to the suicidal
attempt are often evident. Suicidal behavior that leads to blood loss
can be accompanied by anemia, hypotension, or shock. Overdoses might
lead to coma or obtundation and associated laboratory abnormalities such
as electrolyte imbalances.

Functional Consequences of Suicidal Behavior Disorder Medical conditions
(e.g., lacerations or skeletal trauma, cardiopulmonary instability,
inhalation of vomit and suffocation, hepatic failure consequent to use
of paracetamol) can occur as a consequence of suicidal behavior.

Comorbidity Suicidal behavior is seen in the context of a variety of
mental disorders, most commonly bipolar disorder, major depressive
disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, anxiety disorders (in
particular, panic disorders associated with catastrophic content and
PTSD flashbacks), substance use disorders (especially alcohol use
disorders), borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality
disorder, eating disorders, and adjustment disorders. It is rarely
manifested by individuals with no discernible pathology, unless it

is undertaken because of a painful medical condition with the intention
of drawing attention to martyrdom for political or religious reasons, or
in partners in a suicide pact, both of which are excluded from this
diagnosis, or when third-party informants wish to conceal the nature of
the behavior.

Nonsuicidal Self-Injury Proposed Criteria a. In the last year, the
individual has, on 5 or more days, engaged in intentional self-inflicted
damage to the surface of his or her body of a sort likely to induce
bleeding, bruising, or pain (e.g., cutting, burning, stabbing, hitting,
excessive rubbing), with the expectation that the injury will lead to
only minor or moderate physical harm (i.e., there is no suicidal
intent). Note: The absence of suicidal intent has either been stated by
the individual or can be inferred by the individual's repeated
engagement in a behavior that the individual knows, or has learned, is
not likely to result in death. b. The individual engages in the
self-injurious behavior with one or more of the following
expectations: 1. To obtain relief from a negative feeling or cognitive
state. 2. To resolve an interpersonal difficulty. 3. To induce a
positive feeling state. Note: The desired relief or response is
experienced during or shortly after the self-injury, and the individual
may display patterns of behavior suggesting a dependence on repeatedly
engaging in it. c. The intentional self-injury is associated with at
least one of the following: 1. Interpersonal difficulties or negative
feelings or thoughts, such as depression, anxiety, tension, anger,
generalized distress, or self-criticism, occurring in the period
immediately prior to the self-injurious act. 2. Prior to engaging in the
act, a period of preoccupation with the intended behavior that is
difficult to control.

3. Thinking about self-injury that occurs frequently, even when it is
not acted upon. d. The behavior is not socially sanctioned (e.g., body
piercing, tattooing, part of a religious or cultural ritual) and is not
restricted to picking a scab or nail biting. e. The behavior or its
consequences cause clinically significant distress or interference in
interpersonal, academic, or other important areas of functioning. f. The
behavior does not occur exclusively during psychotic episodes, delirium,
substance intoxication, or substance withdrawal. In individuals with a
neurodevelopmental disorder, the behavior is not part of a pattern of
repetitive stereotypies. The behavior is not better explained by another
mental disorder or medical condition (e.g., psychotic disorder, autism
spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome,
stereotypic movement disorder with selfinjury, trichotillomania
\[hair-pulling disorder\], excoriation \[skinpicking\] disorder).

Diagnostic Features The essential feature of nonsuicidal self-injury is
that the individual repeatedly inflicts shallow, yet painful injuries to
the surface of his or her body. Most commonly, the purpose is to reduce
negative emotions, such as tension, anxiety, and self-reproach, and/or
to resolve an interpersonal difficulty. In some cases, the injury is
conceived of as a deserved selfpunishment. The individual will often
report an immediate sensation of relief that occurs during the process.
When the behavior occurs frequently, it might be associated with a sense
of urgency and craving, the resultant behavioral pattern resembling an
addiction. The inflicted wounds can become deeper and more numerous. The
injury is most often inflicted with a knife, needle, razor, or other
sharp object7. Common areas for injury include the frontal area of the
thighs and the dorsal side of the forearm. A single session of injury
might involve a series of superficial, parallel cuts---separated by 1 or
2

centimeters---on a visible or accessible location. The resulting cuts
will often bleed and will eventually leave a characteristic pattern of
scars. Other methods used include stabbing an area, most often the upper
arm, with a needle or sharp, pointed knife; inflicting a superficial
burn with a lit cigarette end; or burning the skin by repeated rubbing
with an eraser2. Engagement in nonsuicidal self-injury with multiple
methods is associated with more severe psychopathology, including
engagement in suicide attempts11, 14. The great majority of individuals
who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury do not seek clinical attention5.
It is not known if this reflects frequency of engagement in the
disorder, because accurate reporting is seen as stigmatizing, or because
the behaviors are experienced positively by the individual who engages
in them, who is unmotivated to receive treatment. Young children might
experiment with these behaviors but not experience relief. In such
cases, youths often report that the procedure is painful or distressing
and might then discontinue the practice.

Development and Course Nonsuicidal self-injury most often starts in the
early teen years8 and can continue for many years. Admission to hospital
for nonsuicidal self-injury reaches a peak at 20--29 years of age and
then declines3. However, research that has examined age at
hospitalization did not provide information on age at onset of the
behavior, and prospective research is needed to outline the natural
history of nonsuicidal self-injury and the factors that promote or
inhibit its course. Individuals often learn of the behavior on the
recommendation or observation of another. Research has shown that when
an individual who engages in nonsuicidal self-injury is admitted to an
inpatient unit, other individuals may begin to engage in the behavior13.

Risk and Prognostic Factors Male and female prevalence rates of
nonsuicidal self-injury are closer to each other than in suicidal
behavior disorder, in which the female-to-male ratio is about 3:1 or
4:1. Two theories of psychopathology---based on functional behavioral
analyses---have been proposed: In the first, based on learning theory,
either positive or negative reinforcement sustains the behavior.
Positive

reinforcement might result from punishing oneself in a way that the
individual feels is deserved, with the behavior inducing a pleasant and
relaxed state or generating attention and help from a significant other,
or as an expression of anger. Negative reinforcement results from affect
regulation and the reduction of unpleasant emotions or avoiding
distressing thoughts, including thinking about suicide10. In the second
theory, nonsuicidal self-injury is thought to be a form of
self-punishment, in which self-punitive actions are engaged in to make
up for acts that caused distress or harm to others.

Functional Consequences of Nonsuicidal SelfInjury The act of cutting
might be performed with shared implements, raising the possibility of
blood-borne disease transmission.

Differential Diagnosis Borderline personality disorder. As indicated,
nonsuicidal self-injury has long been regarded as a "symptom" of
borderline personality disorder, even though comprehensive clinical
evaluations have found that most individuals with nonsuicidal
self-injury have symptoms that also meet criteria for other diagnoses,
with eating disorders and substance use disorders being especially
common. Historically, nonsuicidal self-injury was regarded as
pathognomonic of borderline personality disorder. Both conditions are
associated with several other diagnoses. Although frequently associated,
borderline personality disorder is not invariably found in individuals
with nonsuicidal self-injury. The two conditions differ in several ways.
Individuals with borderline personality disorder often manifest
disturbed aggressive and hostile behaviors, whereas nonsuicidal
self-injury is more often associated with phases of closeness,
collaborative behaviors4, 12, and positive relationships. At a more
fundamental level, there are differences in the involvement of different
neurotransmitter systems, but these will not be apparent on clinical
examination. Suicidal behavior disorder. The differentiation between
nonsuicidal selfinjury and suicidal behavior disorder is based either on
the stated goal of the behavior being a wish to die (suicidal behavior
disorder) or, in nonsuicidal self-injury, to experience relief as
described in the criteria. Depending on

the circumstances, individuals may provide reports of convenience, and
several studies report high rates of false intent declaration.
Individuals with a history of frequent nonsuicidal self-injury episodes
have learned that a session of cutting, while painful, is, in the
short-term, largely benign. Because individuals with nonsuicidal
self-injury can and do attempt and commit suicide, it is important to
check past history of suicidal behavior and to obtain information from a
third party concerning any recent change in stress exposure and mood.
Likelihood of suicide intent has been associated with the use of
multiple previous methods of self-harm. In a follow-up study of cases of
"self-harm" in males treated at one of several multiple emergency
centers in the United Kingdom, individuals with nonsuicidal self-injury
were significantly more likely to commit suicide than other teenage
individuals drawn from the same cohort6. Studies that have examined the
relationship between nonsuicidal self-injury and suicidal behavior
disorder are limited by being retrospective and failing to obtain
verified accounts of the method used during previous "attempts." A
significant proportion of those who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury
have responded positively when asked if they have ever engaged in
self-cutting (or their preferred means of self-injury) with an intention
to die. It is reasonable to conclude that nonsuicidal self-injury, while
not presenting a high risk for suicide when first manifested, is an
especially dangerous form of self-injurious behavior. This conclusion is
also supported by a multisite study of depressed adolescents who had
previously failed to respond to antidepressant medication, which noted
that those with previous nonsuicidal self-injury did not respond to
cognitive-behavioral therapy1, and by a study that found that
nonsuicidal self-injury is a predictor of substance use/misuse9.
Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder). Trichotillomania is an
injurious behavior confined to pulling out one's own hair, most commonly
from the scalp, eyebrows, or eyelashes. The behavior occurs in
"sessions" that can last for hours. It is most likely to occur during a
period of relaxation or distraction. Stereotypic self-injury.
Stereotypic self-injury, which can include head banging, self-biting, or
self-hitting, is usually associated with intense concentration or under
conditions of low external stimulation and might be associated with
developmental delay.

Excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Excoriation disorder occurs mainly
in females and is usually directed to picking at an area of the skin
that the individual feels is unsightly or a blemish, usually on the face
or the scalp. As in nonsuicidal self-injury, the picking is often
preceded by an urge and is experienced as pleasurable, even though the
individual realizes that he or she is harming himself or herself. It is
not associated with the use of any implement.

Highlights of Changes From DSMIV to DSM-5 Changes made to DSM-5
diagnostic criteria and texts are outlined in this chapter in the same
order in which they appear in the DSM5 classification. This abbreviated
description is intended to orient readers to only the most significant
changes in each disorder category. An expanded description of nearly all
changes (e.g., except minor text or wording changes needed for clarity)
is available online (www.psychiatry.org/dsm5). It should also be noted
that Section I contains a description of changes pertaining to the
chapter organization in DSM-5, the multiaxial system, and the
introduction of dimensional assessments.

Neurodevelopmental Disorders The term mental retardation was used in
DSM-IV. However, intellectual disability (intellectual developmental
disorder) is the term that has come into common use over the past two
decades among medical, educational, and other professionals, and by the
lay public and advocacy groups. Diagnostic criteria emphasize the need
for an assessment of both cognitive capacity (IQ) and adaptive
functioning. Severity is determined by adaptive functioning rather than
IQ score. The communication disorders, which are newly named from DSM-IV
phonological disorder and stuttering, respectively, include language
disorder (which combines the previous expressive and mixed
receptiveexpressive language disorders), speech sound disorder
(previously phonological disorder), and childhood-onset fluency disorder
(previously stuttering). Also included is social (pragmatic)
communication disorder, a new condition involving persistent
difficulties in the social uses of verbal and nonverbal communication.
Autism spectrum disorder is a new DSM-5 disorder encompassing the
previous DSM-IV autistic disorder (autism), Asperger's disorder,
childhood

disintegrative disorder, Rett's disorder, and pervasive developmental
disorder not otherwise specified. It is characterized by deficits in two
core domains: 1) deficits in social communication and social interaction
and 2) restricted repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and
activities. Several changes have been made to the diagnostic criteria
for attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Examples have been
added to the criterion items to facilitate application across the life
span; the age at onset description has been changed (from "some
hyperactive-impulsive or inattentive symptoms that caused impairment
were present before age 7 years" to "Several inattentive or
hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present prior to age 12"); subtypes
have been replaced with presentation specifiers that map directly to the
prior subtypes; a comorbid diagnosis with autism spectrum disorder is
now allowed; and a symptom threshold change has been made for adults, to
reflect the substantial evidence of clinically significant ADHD
impairment, with the cutoff for ADHD of five symptoms, instead of six
required for younger persons, both for inattention and for hyperactivity
and impulsivity. Specific learning disorder combines the DSM-IV
diagnoses of reading disorder, mathematics disorder, disorder of written
expression, and learning disorder not otherwise specified. Learning
deficits in the areas of reading, written expression, and mathematics
are coded as separate specifiers. Acknowledgment is made in the text
that specific types of reading deficits are described internationally in
various ways as dyslexia and specific types of mathematics deficits as
dyscalculia. The following motor disorders are included in DSM-5:
developmental coordination disorder, stereotypic movement disorder,
Tourette's disorder, persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder,
provisional tic disorder, other specified tic disorder, and unspecified
tic disorder. The tic criteria have been standardized across all of
these disorders in this chapter.

Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders Two changes were
made to Criterion A for schizophrenia: 1) the elimination of the special
attribution of bizarre delusions and Schneiderian first-rank auditory
hallucinations (e.g., two or more voices conversing), leading to the
requirement of at least two Criterion A symptoms for any

diagnosis of schizophrenia, and 2) the addition of the requirement that
at least one of the Criterion A symptoms must be delusions,
hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The DSM-IV subtypes of
schizophrenia were eliminated due to their limited diagnostic stability,
low reliability, and poor validity. Instead, a dimensional approach to
rating severity for the core symptoms of schizophrenia is included in
DSM-5 Section III to capture the important heterogeneity in symptom type
and severity expressed across individuals with psychotic disorders.
Schizoaffective disorder is reconceptualized as a longitudinal instead
of a cross-sectional diagnosis--- more comparable to schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, which are bridged by
this condition---and requires that a major mood episode be present for a
majority of the total disorder's duration after Criterion A has been
met. Criterion A for delusional disorder no longer has the requirement
that the delusions must be nonbizarre; a specifier is now included for
bizarre type delusions to provide continuity with DSM-IV. Criteria for
catatonia are described uniformly across DSM-5. Furthermore, catatonia
may be diagnosed with a specifier (for depressive, bipolar, and
psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia), in the context of a known
medical condition, or as an other specified diagnosis.

Bipolar and Related Disorders Diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorders
now include both changes in mood and changes in activity or energy. The
DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, mixed episodes---requiring that
the individual simultaneously meet full criteria for both mania and
major depressive episode---is replaced with a new specifier "with mixed
features." Particular conditions can now be diagnosed under other
specified bipolar and related disorder, including categorization for
individuals with a past history of a major depressive disorder whose
symptoms meet all criteria for hypomania except the duration criterion
is not met (i.e., the episode lasts only 2 or 3 days instead of the
required 4 consecutive days or more). A second condition constituting an
other specified bipolar and related disorder variant is that too few
symptoms of hypomania are present to meet criteria for the full bipolar
II syndrome, although the duration, at least 4 consecutive days, is
sufficient. Finally, in both this chapter and in the chapter "Depressive
Disorders," an anxious distress specifier is delineated.

Depressive Disorders To address concerns about potential overdiagnosis
and overtreatment of bipolar disorder in children, a new diagnosis,
disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is included for children up to
age 18 years who exhibit persistent irritability and frequent episodes
of extreme behavioral dyscontrol. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is now
promoted from Appendix B, "Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further
Study," in DSMIV to the main body of DSM-5. What was referred to as
dysthymia in DSM-IV now falls under the category of persistent
depressive disorder, which includes both chronic major depressive
disorder and the previous dysthymic disorder. The coexistence within a
major depressive episode of at least three manic symptoms (insufficient
to satisfy criteria for a manic episode) is now acknowledged by the
specifier "with mixed features." In DSM-IV, there was an exclusion
criterion for a major depressive episode that was applied to depressive
symptoms lasting less than 2 months following the death of a loved one
(i.e., the bereavement exclusion). This exclusion is omitted in DSM-5
for several reasons, including the recognition that bereavement is a
severe psychosocial stressor that can precipitate a major depressive
episode in a vulnerable individual, generally beginning soon after the
loss, and can add an additional risk for suffering, feelings of
worthlessness, suicidal ideation, poorer medical health, and worse
interpersonal and work functioning. It was critical to remove the
implication that bereavement typically lasts only 2 months, when both
physicians and grief counselors recognize that the duration is more
commonly 1--2 years. A detailed footnote has replaced the more
simplistic DSM-IV exclusion to aid clinicians in making the critical
distinction between the symptoms characteristic of bereavement and those
of a major depressive disorder. Finally, a new specifier to indicate the
presence of mixed symptoms has been added across both the bipolar and
the depressive disorders.

Anxiety Disorders The chapter on anxiety disorders no longer includes
obsessive-compulsive disorder (which is in the new chapter
"Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders") or posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder (which are in the new chapter
"Trauma- and Stressor-Related

Disorders"). Changes in criteria for specific phobia and social anxiety
disorder (social phobia) include deletion of the requirement that
individuals over age 18 years recognize that their anxiety is excessive
or unreasonable. Instead, the anxiety must be out of proportion to the
actual danger or threat in the situation, after cultural contextual
factors are taken into account. In addition, the 6-month duration is now
extended to all ages. Panic attacks can now be listed as a specifier
that is applicable to all DSM5 disorders. Panic disorder and agoraphobia
are unlinked in DSM-5. Thus, the former DSM-IV diagnoses of panic
disorder with agoraphobia, panic disorder without agoraphobia, and
agoraphobia without history of panic disorder are now replaced by two
diagnoses, panic disorder and agoraphobia, each with separate criteria.
The "generalized" specifier for social anxiety disorder has been deleted
and replaced with a "performance only" specifier. Separation anxiety
disorder and selective mutism are now classified as anxiety disorders.
The wording of the criteria is modified to more adequately represent the
expression of separation anxiety symptoms in adulthood. Also, in
contrast to DSM-IV, the diagnostic criteria no longer specify that onset
must be before age 18 years, and a duration statement---"typically
lasting for 6 months or more"---has been added for adults to minimize
overdiagnosis of transient fears.

Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders The chapter
"Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders" is new in DSM-5. New
disorders include hoarding disorder, excoriation (skinpicking) disorder,
substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder,
and obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical
condition. The DSM-IV diagnosis of trichotillomania is now termed
trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) and has been moved from a
DSM-IV classification of impulse-control disorders not elsewhere
classified to obsessive-compulsive and related disorders in DSM-5. The
DSM-IV "with poor insight" specifier for obsessive-compulsive disorder
has been refined to allow a distinction between individuals with good or
fair insight, poor insight, and "absent insight/delusional"
obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs (i.e., complete conviction that
obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true). Analogous "insight"
specifiers have been included for body dysmorphic disorder and hoarding
disorder. A "tic-related" specifier for obsessive-compulsive

disorder has also been added, because presence of a comorbid tic
disorder may have important clinical implications. A "muscle dysmorphia"
specifier for body dysmorphic disorder is added to reflect a growing
literature on the diagnostic validity and clinical utility of making
this distinction in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder. The
delusional variant of body dysmorphic disorder (which identifies
individuals who are completely convinced that their perceived defects or
flaws are truly abnormal appearing) is no longer coded as both
delusional disorder, somatic type, and body dysmorphic disorder; in
DSM-5, this presentation is designated only as body dysmorphic disorder
with the absent insight/delusional specifier. Individuals can also be
diagnosed with other specified obsessivecompulsive and related disorder,
which can include conditions such as body-focused repetitive behavior
disorder and obsessional jealousy, or unspecified obsessive-compulsive
and related disorder.

Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders For a diagnosis of acute stress
disorder, qualifying traumatic events are now explicit as to whether
they were experienced directly, witnessed, or experienced indirectly.
Also, the DSM-IV Criterion A2 regarding the subjective reaction to the
traumatic event (e.g., experiencing "fear, helplessness, or horror") has
been eliminated. Adjustment disorders are reconceptualized as a
heterogeneous array of stress-response syndromes that occur after
exposure to a distressing (traumatic or nontraumatic) event, rather than
as a residual category for individuals who exhibit clinically
significant distress but whose symptoms do not meet criteria for a more
discrete disorder (as in DSM-IV). DSM-5 criteria for PTSD differ
significantly from the DSM-IV criteria. The stressor criterion
(Criterion A) is more explicit with regard to events that qualify as
"traumatic" experiences. Also, DSM-IV Criterion A2 (subjective reaction)
has been eliminated. Whereas there were three major symptom clusters in
DSM-IV---reexperiencing, avoidance/numbing, and arousal---there are now
four symptom clusters in DSM-5, because the avoidance/numbing cluster is
divided into two distinct clusters: avoidance and persistent negative
alterations in cognitions and mood. This latter category, which retains
most of the DSM-IV numbing symptoms, also includes new or
reconceptualized symptoms, such as persistent negative emotional states.
The final cluster---alterations in arousal and reactivity---

retains most of the DSM-IV arousal symptoms. It also includes irritable
behavior or angry outbursts and reckless or self-destructive behavior.
PTSD is now developmentally sensitive in that diagnostic thresholds have
been lowered for children and adolescents. Furthermore, separate
criteria have been added for children age 6 years or younger with this
disorder. The DSM-IV childhood diagnosis reactive attachment disorder
had two subtypes: emotionally withdrawn/inhibited and indiscriminately
social/disinhibited. In DSM-5, these subtypes are defined as distinct
disorders: reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social
engagement disorder.

Dissociative Disorders Major changes in dissociative disorders in DSM-5
include the following: 1) derealization is included in the name and
symptom structure of what previously was called depersonalization
disorder (depersonalization/derealization disorder); 2) dissociative
fugue is now a specifier of dissociative amnesia rather than a separate
diagnosis, and 3) the criteria for dissociative identity disorder have
been changed to indicate that symptoms of disruption of identity may be
reported as well as observed, and that gaps in the recall of events may
occur for everyday and not just traumatic events. Also, experiences of
pathological possession in some cultures are included in the description
of identity disruption.

Somatic Symptom and Related Disorders In DSM-5, somatoform disorders are
now referred to as somatic symptom and related disorders. The DSM-5
classification reduces the number of these disorders and subcategories
to avoid problematic overlap. Diagnoses of somatization disorder,
hypochondriasis, pain disorder, and undifferentiated somatoform disorder
have been removed. Individuals previously diagnosed with somatization
disorder will usually have symptoms that meet DSM-5 criteria for somatic
symptom disorder, but only if they have the maladaptive thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors that define the disorder, in addition to their
somatic symptoms. Because the distinction between somatization disorder
and undifferentiated somatoform disorder was arbitrary, they are merged
in DSM-5 under somatic symptom disorder. Individuals previously
diagnosed with hypochondriasis who have

high health anxiety but no somatic symptoms would receive a DSM-5
diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder (unless their health anxiety was
better explained by a primary anxiety disorder, such as generalized
anxiety disorder). Some individuals with chronic pain would be
appropriately diagnosed as having somatic symptom disorder, with
predominant pain. For others, psychological factors affecting other
medical conditions or an adjustment disorder would be more appropriate.
Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is a new mental
disorder in DSM-5, having formerly been listed in the DSM-IV chapter
"Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention." This
disorder and factitious disorder are placed among the somatic symptom
and related disorders because somatic symptoms are predominant in both
disorders, and both are most often encountered in medical settings. The
variants of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions are
removed in favor of the stem diagnosis. Criteria for conversion disorder
(functional neurological symptom disorder) have been modified to
emphasize the essential importance of the neurological examination, and
in recognition that relevant psychological factors may not be
demonstrable at the time of diagnosis. Other specified somatic symptom
disorder, other specified illness anxiety disorder, and pseudocyesis are
now the only exemplars of the other specified somatic symptom and
related disorder classification.

Feeding and Eating Disorders Because of the elimination of the DSM-IV-TR
chapter "Disorders Usually First Diagnosed During Infancy, Childhood, or
Adolescence," this chapter describes several disorders found in the
DSM-IV section "Feeding and Eating Disorders of Infancy or Early
Childhood," such as pica and rumination disorder. The DSM-IV category
feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood has been renamed
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and the criteria are
significantly expanded. The core diagnostic criteria for anorexia
nervosa are conceptually unchanged from DSM-IV with one exception: the
requirement for amenorrhea is eliminated. As in DSM-IV, individuals with
this disorder are required by Criterion A to be at a significantly low
body weight for their developmental stage. The wording of the criterion
is changed for clarification, and guidance regarding how to judge
whether an individual is at or below a significantly low weight is

provided in the text. In DSM-5, Criterion B is expanded to include not
only overtly expressed fear of weight gain but also persistent behavior
that interferes with weight gain. The only change in the DSM-IV criteria
for bulimia nervosa is a reduction in the required minimum average
frequency of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behavior
frequency from twice to once weekly. The extensive research that
followed the promulgation of preliminary criteria for binge-eating
disorder in Appendix B of DSM-IV documented the clinical utility and
validity of binge-eating disorder. The only significant difference from
the preliminary criteria is that the minimum average frequency of binge
eating required for diagnosis is once weekly over the last 3 months,
identical to the frequency criterion for bulimia nervosa (rather than at
least 2 days a week for 6 months in DSMIV).

Elimination Disorders There have been no significant changes in this
diagnostic class from DSMIV to DSM-5. The disorders in this chapter were
previously classified under disorders usually first diagnosed in
infancy, childhood, or adolescence in DSM-IV and exist now as an
independent classification in DSM-5.

Sleep-Wake Disorders In DSM-5, the DSM-IV diagnoses named sleep disorder
related to another mental disorder and sleep disorder related to another
medical condition have been removed, and instead greater specification
of coexisting conditions is provided for each sleep-wake disorder. The
diagnosis of primary insomnia has been renamed insomnia disorder to
avoid the differentiation between primary and secondary insomnia. DSM-5
also distinguishes narcolepsy---now known to be associated with
hypocretin deficiency---from other forms of hypersomnolence
(hypersomnolence disorder). Finally, throughout the DSM-5 classification
of sleep-wake disorders, pediatric and developmental criteria and text
are integrated where existing science and considerations of clinical
utility support such integration. Breathing-related sleep disorders are
divided into three relatively distinct disorders: obstructive sleep
apnea hypopnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation.
The subtypes of circadian rhythm sleep disorders are expanded to include
advanced sleep phase type

and irregular sleep-wake type, whereas the jet lag type has been
removed. The use of the former "not otherwise specified" diagnoses in
DSM-IV have been reduced by elevating rapid eye movement sleep behavior
disorder and restless legs syndrome to independent disorders.

Sexual Dysfunctions In DSM-5, some gender-specific sexual dysfunctions
have been added, and, for females, sexual desire and arousal disorders
have been combined into one disorder: female sexual interest/arousal
disorder. All of the sexual dysfunctions (except
substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction) now require a minimum
duration of approximately 6 months and more precise severity criteria.
Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder has been added to DSM-5 and
represents a merging of vaginismus and dyspareunia, which were highly
comorbid and difficult to distinguish. The diagnosis of sexual aversion
disorder has been removed due to rare use and lack of supporting
research. There are now only two subtypes for sexual dysfunctions:
lifelong versus acquired and generalized versus situational. To indicate
the presence and degree of medical and other nonmedical correlates, the
following associated features have been added to the text: partner
factors, relationship factors, individual vulnerability factors,
cultural or religious factors, and medical factors.

Gender Dysphoria Gender dysphoria is a new diagnostic class in DSM-5 and
reflects a change in conceptualization of the disorder's defining
features by emphasizing the phenomenon of "gender incongruence" rather
than crossgender identification per se, as was the case in DSM-IV gender
identity disorder. Gender dysphoria includes separate sets of criteria:
for children and for adults and adolescents. For the adolescents and
adults criteria, the previous Criterion A (cross-gender identification)
and Criterion B (aversion toward one's gender) are merged. In the
wording of the criteria, "the other sex" is replaced by "the other
gender" (or "some alternative gender")." Gender instead of sex is used
systematically because the concept "sex" is inadequate when referring to
individuals with a disorder of sex development. In the child criteria,
"strong desire to be of the other gender"

replaces the previous "repeatedly stated desire to be...the other sex"
to capture the situation of some children who, in a coercive
environment, may not verbalize the desire to be of another gender. For
children, Criterion A1 ("a strong desire to be of the other gender or an
insistence that one is the other gender...)" is now necessary (but not
sufficient), which makes the diagnosis more restrictive and
conservative. The subtyping on the basis of sexual orientation is
removed because the distinction is no longer considered clinically
useful. A posttransition specifier has been added to identify
individuals who have undergone at least one medical procedure or
treatment to support the new gender assignment (e.g., cross-sex hormone
treatment). Although the concept of posttransition is modeled on the
concept of full or partial remission, the term remission has
implications in terms of symptom reduction that do not apply directly to
gender dysphoria.

Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders The chapter
"Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders" is new to DSM-5 and
combines disorders that were previously included in the chapter
"Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or
Adolescence" (i.e., oppositional defiant disorder; conduct disorder; and
disruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified, now categorized as
other specified and unspecified disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct
disorders) and the chapter "Impulse-Control Disorders Not Elsewhere
Classified" (i.e., intermittent explosive disorder, pyromania, and
kleptomania). These disorders are all characterized by problems in
emotional and behavioral self-control. Notably, ADHD is frequently
comorbid with the disorders in this chapter but is listed with the
neurodevelopmental disorders. Because of its close association with
conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder is listed both in this
chapter and in the chapter "Personality Disorders," where it is
described in detail. The criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are
now grouped into three types: angry/irritable mood,
argumentative/defiant behavior, and vindictiveness. Additionally, the
exclusionary criterion for conduct disorder has been removed. The
criteria for conduct disorder include a descriptive features specifier
for individuals who meet full criteria for the disorder but also present
with limited prosocial emotions. The primary change in intermittent
explosive disorder is in the type of aggressive outbursts that should be
considered: DSM-IV required physical aggression, whereas in

DSM-5 verbal aggression and nondestructive/noninjurious physical
aggression also meet criteria. DSM-5 also provides more specific
criteria defining frequency needed to meet the criteria and specifies
that the aggressive outbursts are impulsive and/or anger based in
nature, and must cause marked distress, cause impairment in occupational
or interpersonal functioning, or be associated with negative financial
or legal consequences. Furthermore, a minimum age of 6 years (or
equivalent developmental level) is now required.

Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders An important departure from
past diagnostic manuals is that the chapter on substance-related
disorders has been expanded to include gambling disorder. Another key
change is that DSM-5 does not separate the diagnoses of substance abuse
and dependence as in DSM-IV. Rather criteria are provided for substance
use disorder, accompanied by criteria for intoxication, withdrawal,
substance-induced disorders, and unspecified substance-related
disorders, where relevant. Within substance use disorders, the DSM-IV
recurrent substance-related legal problems criterion has been deleted
from DSM-5, and a new criterion---craving, or a strong desire or urge to
use a substance---has been added. In addition, the threshold for
substance use disorder diagnosis in DSM-5 is set at two or more
criteria, in contrast to a threshold of one or more criteria for a
diagnosis of DSM-IV substance abuse and three or more for DSM-IV
dependence. Cannabis withdrawal and caffeine withdrawal are new
disorders (the latter was in DSM-IV Appendix B, "Criteria Sets and Axes
Provided for Further Study"). Severity of the DSM-5 substance use
disorders is based on the number of criteria endorsed. The DSM-IV
specifier for a physiological subtype is eliminated in DSM-5, as is the
DSM-IV diagnosis of polysubstance dependence. Early remission from a
DSM-5 substance use disorder is defined as at least 3 but less than 12
months without meeting substance use disorder criteria (except craving),
and sustained remission is defined as at least 12 months without meeting
criteria (except craving). Additional new DSM-5 specifiers include "in a
controlled environment" and "on maintenance therapy" as the situation
warrants.

Neurocognitive Disorders

The DSM-IV diagnoses of dementia and amnestic disorder are subsumed
under the newly named entity major neurocognitive disorder (NCD). The
term dementia is not precluded from use in the etiological subtypes
where that term is standard. Furthermore, DSM-5 now recognizes a less
severe level of cognitive impairment, mild NCD, which is a new disorder
that permits the diagnosis of less disabling syndromes that may
nonetheless be the focus of concern and treatment. Diagnostic criteria
are provided for both of these disorders, followed by diagnostic
criteria for different etiological subtypes. In DSM-IV, individual
diagnoses were designated for dementia of the Alzheimer's type, vascular
dementia, and substance-induced dementia, whereas the other
neurodegenerative disorders were classified as dementia due to another
medical condition, with HIV, head trauma, Parkinson's disease,
Huntington's disease, Pick's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and
other medical conditions specified. In DSM-5, major or mild NCD due to
Alzheimer's disease and major or mild vascular NCD have been retained,
while new separate criteria are now presented for major or mild
frontotemporal NCD, NCD with Lewy bodies, and NCDs due to traumatic
brain injury, a substance/medication, HIV infection, prion disease,
Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, another medical condition,
and multiple etiologies, respectively. Unspecified NCD is also included
as a diagnosis.

Personality Disorders The criteria for personality disorders in Section
II of DSM-5 have not changed from those in DSM-IV. An alternative
approach to the diagnosis of personality disorders was developed for
DSM-5 for further study and can be found in Section III (see
"Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders"). For the general
criteria for personality disorder, presented in Section III, a revised
personality functioning criterion (Criterion A) has been developed based
on a literature review of reliable clinical measures of core impairments
central to personality pathology. A diagnosis of personality
disorder---trait specified, based on moderate or greater impairment in
personality functioning and the presence of pathological personality
traits, replaces personality disorder not otherwise specified and
provides a much more informative diagnosis for individuals who are not
optimally described as having a specific personality disorder. A greater
emphasis on personality functioning and trait-based criteria increases
the

stability and empirical bases of the disorders. Personality functioning
and personality traits also can be assessed whether or not the
individual has a personality disorder---a feature that provides
clinically useful information about all individuals.

Paraphilic Disorders An overarching change from DSM-IV is the addition
of the course specifiers "in a controlled environment" and "in
remission" to the diagnostic criteria sets for all the paraphilic
disorders. These specifiers are added to indicate important changes in
an individual's status. In DSM-5, paraphilias are not ipso facto mental
disorders. There is a distinction between paraphilias and paraphilic
disorders. A paraphilic disorder is a paraphilia that is currently
causing distress or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose
satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of harm, to others. A
paraphilia is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a
paraphilic disorder, and a paraphilia by itself does not automatically
justify or require clinical intervention. The distinction between
paraphilias and paraphilic disorders was implemented without making any
changes to the basic structure of the diagnostic criteria as they had
existed since DSM-III-R. The change proposed for DSM-5 is that
individuals who meet both Criterion A and Criterion B would now be
diagnosed as having a paraphilic disorder. A diagnosis would not be
given to individuals whose symptoms meet Criterion A but not Criterion
B---that is, to individuals who have a paraphilia but not a paraphilic
disorder.

Glossary of Technical Terms affect A pattern of observable behaviors
that is the expression of a subjectively experienced feeling state
(emotion). Examples of affect include sadness, elation, and anger. In
contrast to mood, which refers to a pervasive and sustained emotional
"climate," affect refers to more fluctuating changes in emotional
"weather." What is considered the normal range of the expression of
affect varies considerably, both within and among different cultures.
Disturbances in affect include blunted Significant reduction in the
intensity of emotional expression. flat Absence or near absence of any
sign of affective expression. inappropriate Discordance between
affective expression and the content of speech or ideation. labile
Abnormal variability in affect with repeated, rapid, and abrupt shifts
in affective expression. restricted or constricted Mild reduction in the
range and intensity of emotional expression. affective blunting See
AFFECT. agitation (psychomotor) See PSYCHOMOTOR AGITATION. agnosia Loss
of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells that
occurs in the absence of either impairment of the specific sense or
significant memory loss. alogia An impoverishment in thinking that is
inferred from observing speech and language behavior. There may be brief
and concrete replies to questions and restriction in the amount of
spontaneous speech (termed poverty of speech). Sometimes the speech is
adequate in amount but conveys little information because it is
overconcrete, overabstract, repetitive, or stereotyped (termed poverty
of content). amnesia An inability to recall important autobiographical
information that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.

anhedonia Lack of enjoyment from, engagement in, or energy for life's
experiences; deficits in the capacity to feel pleasure and take interest
in things. Anhedonia is a facet of the broad personality trait domain
DETACHMENT. anosognosia A condition in which a person with an illness
seems unaware of the existence of his or her illness. antagonism
Behaviors that put an individual at odds with other people, such as an
exaggerated sense of self-importance with a concomitant expectation of
special treatment, as well as a callous antipathy toward others,
encompassing both unawareness of others' needs and feelings, and a
readiness to use others in the service of self-enhancement. Antagonism
is one of the five broad PERSONALITY TRAIT DOMAINS defined in Section
III "Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders." SMALL CAPS
indicate term found elsewhere in this glossary. Glossary definitions
were informed by DSM-5 Work Groups, publicly available Internet sources,
and previously published glossaries for mental disorders (World Health
Organization and American Psychiatric Association).

antidepressant discontinuation syndrome A set of symptoms that can occur
after abrupt cessation, or marked reduction in dose, of an
antidepressant medication that had been taken continuously for at least
1 month. anxiety The apprehensive anticipation of future danger or
misfortune accompanied by a feeling of worry, distress, and/or somatic
symptoms of tension. The focus of anticipated danger may be internal or
external. anxiousness Feelings of nervousness or tenseness in reaction
to diverse situations; frequent worry about the negative effects of past
unpleasant experiences and future negative possibilities; feeling
fearful and apprehensive about uncertainty; expecting the worst to
happen. Anxiousness is a facet of the broad personality trait domain
NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY. arousal The physiological and psychological state
of being awake or reactive to stimuli. asociality A reduced initiative
for interacting with other people.

attention The ability to focus in a sustained manner on a particular
stimulus or activity. A disturbance in attention may be manifested by
easy DISTRACTIBILITY or difficulty in finishing tasks or in
concentrating on work. attention seeking Engaging in behavior designed
to attract notice and to make oneself the focus of others' attention and
admiration. Attention seeking is a facet of the broad personality trait
domain ANTAGONISM. autogynephilia Sexual arousal of a natal male
associated with the idea or image of being a woman. avoidance The act of
keeping away from stress-related circumstances; a tendency to circumvent
cues, activities, and situations that remind the individual of a
stressful event experienced. avolition An inability to initiate and
persist in goal-directed activities. When severe enough to be considered
pathological, avolition is pervasive and prevents the person from
completing many different types of activities (e.g., work, intellectual
pursuits, self-care). bereavement The state of having lost through death
someone with whom one has had a close relationship. This state includes
a range of grief and mourning responses. biological rhythms See
CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS. callousness Lack of concern for the feelings or
problems of others; lack of guilt or remorse about the negative or
harmful effects of one's actions on others. Callousness is a facet of
the broad personality trait domain ANTAGONISM. catalepsy Passive
induction of a posture held against gravity. Compare with WAXY
FLEXIBILITY. cataplexy Episodes of sudden bilateral loss of muscle tone
resulting in the individual collapsing, often occurring in association
with intense emotions such as laughter, anger, fear, or surprise.
circadian rhythms Cyclical variations in physiological and biochemical
function, level of sleep-wake activity, and emotional state. Circadian
rhythms have a cycle of about 24 hours, ultradian rhythms have a cycle

that is shorter than 1 day, and infradian rhythms have a cycle that may
last weeks or months. cognitive and perceptual dysregulation Odd or
unusual thought processes and experiences, including DEPERSONALIZATION,
DEREALIZATION, and DISSOCIATION; mixed sleep-wake state experiences; and
thought-control experiences. Cognitive and perceptual dysregulation is a
facet of the broad personality trait domain PSYCHOTICISM. coma State of
complete loss of consciousness. compulsion Repetitive behaviors (e.g.,
hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying,
counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to
perform in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be
applied rigidly. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or
reducing anxiety or distress, or preventing some dreaded event or
situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected in
a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent or
are clearly excessive. conversion symptom A loss of, or alteration in,
voluntary motor or sensory functioning, with or without apparent
impairment of consciousness. The symptom is not fully explained by a
neurological or another medical condition or the direct effects of a
substance and is not intentionally produced or feigned. deceitfulness
Dishonesty and fraudulence; misrepresentation of self; embellishment or
fabrication when relating events. Deceitfulness is a facet of the broad
personality trait domain ANTAGONISM. defense mechanism Mechanisms that
mediate the individual's reaction to emotional conflicts and to external
stressors. Some defense mechanisms (e.g., projection, splitting, acting
out) are almost invariably maladaptive. Others (e.g., suppression,
denial) may be either maladaptive or adaptive, depending on their
severity, their inflexibility, and the context in which they occur.
delusion A false belief based on incorrect inference about external
reality that is firmly held despite what almost everyone else believes
and despite what constitutes incontrovertible and obvious proof or
evidence to the contrary. The belief is not ordinarily accepted by other
members of the

person's culture or subculture (i.e., it is not an article of religious
faith). When a false belief involves a value judgment, it is regarded as
a delusion only when the judgment is so extreme as to defy credibility.
Delusional conviction can sometimes be inferred from an overvalued idea
(in which case the individual has an unreasonable belief or idea but
does not hold it as firmly as is the case with a delusion). Delusions
are subdivided according to their content. Common types are listed
below: bizarre A delusion that involves a phenomenon that the person's
culture would regard as physically impossible. delusional jealousy A
delusion that one's sexual partner is unfaithful. erotomanic A delusion
that another person, usually of higher status, is in love with the
individual. grandiose A delusion of inflated worth, power, knowledge,
identity, or special relationship to a deity or famous person. mixed
type Delusions of more than one type (e.g., EROTOMANIC, GRANDIOSE,
PERSECUTORY, SOMATIC) in which no one theme predominates. mood-congruent
See MOOD-CONGRUENT PSYCHOTIC FEATURES. mood-incongruent See
MOOD-INCONGRUENT PSYCHOTIC FEATURES. of being controlled A delusion in
which feelings, impulses, thoughts, or actions are experienced as being
under the control of some external force rather than being under one's
own control. of reference A delusion in which events, objects, or other
persons in one's immediate environment are seen as having a particular
and unusual significance. These delusions are usually of a negative or
pejorative nature but also may be grandiose in content. A delusion of
reference differs from an idea of reference, in which the false belief
is not as firmly held nor as fully organized into a true belief.
persecutory A delusion in which the central theme is that one (or
someone to whom one is close) is being attacked, harassed, cheated,
persecuted, or conspired against. somatic A delusion whose main content
pertains to the appearance or functioning of one's body.

thought broadcasting A delusion that one's thoughts are being broadcast
out loud so that they can be perceived by others. thought insertion A
delusion that certain of one's thoughts are not one's own, but rather
are inserted into one's mind. depersonalization The experience of
feeling detached from, and as if one is an outside observer of, one's
mental processes, body, or actions (e.g., feeling like one is in a
dream; a sense of unreality of self, perceptual alterations; emotional
and/or physical numbing; temporal distortions; sense of unreality).
depressivity Feelings of being intensely sad, miserable, and/or
hopeless. Some patients describe an absence of feelings and/or
dysphoria; difficulty recovering from such moods; pessimism about the
future; pervasive shame and/or guilt; feelings of inferior self-worth;
and thoughts of suicide and suicidal behavior. Depressivity is a facet
of the broad personality trait domain DETACHMENT. derealization The
experience of feeling detached from, and as if one is an outside
observer of, one's surroundings (e.g., individuals or objects are
experienced as unreal, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, or visually
distorted). detachment Avoidance of socioemotional experience, including
both WITHDRAWAL from interpersonal interactions (ranging from casual,
daily interactions to friendships and intimate relationships \[i.e.,
INTIMACY AVOIDANCE\]) and RESTRICTED AFFECTIVITY, particularly limited
hedonic capacity. Detachment is one of the five pathological PERSONALITY
TRAIT DOMAINS defined in Section III "Alternative DSM-5 Model for
Personality Disorders." disinhibition Orientation toward immediate
gratification, leading to impulsive behavior driven by current thoughts,
feelings, and external stimuli, without regard for past learning or
consideration of future consequences. RIGID PERFECTIONISM, the opposite
pole of this domain, reflects excessive constraint of impulses, risk
avoidance, hyperresponsibility, hyperperfectionism, and rigid,
rule-governed behavior. Disinhibition is one of the five pathological
PERSONALITY TRAIT DOMAINS defined in Section III "Alternative DSM-5
Model for Personality Disorders."

disorder of sex development Condition of significant inborn somatic
deviations of the reproductive tract from the norm and/or of
discrepancies among the biological indicators of male and female.
disorientation Confusion about the time of day, date, or season (time);
where one is (place); or who one is (person). dissociation The splitting
off of clusters of mental contents from conscious awareness.
Dissociation is a mechanism central to dissociative disorders. The term
is also used to describe the separation of an idea from its emotional
significance and affect, as seen in the inappropriate affect in
schizophrenia. Often a result of psychic trauma, dissociation may allow
the individual to maintain allegiance to two contradictory truths while
remaining unconscious of the contradiction. An extreme manifestation of
dissociation is dissociative identity disorder, in which a person may
exhibit several independent personalities, each unaware of the others.
distractibility Difficulty concentrating and focusing on tasks;
attention is easily diverted by extraneous stimuli; difficulty
maintaining goal-focused behavior, including both planning and
completing tasks. Distractibility is a facet of the broad personality
trait domain DISINHIBITION. dysarthria A disorder of speech sound
production due to structural or motor impairment affecting the
articulatory apparatus. Such disorders include cleft palate, muscle
disorders, cranial nerve disorders, and cerebral palsy affecting bulbar
structures (i.e., lower and upper motor neuron disorders). dyskinesia
Distortion of voluntary movements with involuntary muscle activity.
dysphoria (dysphoric mood) A condition in which a person experiences
intense feelings of depression, discontent, and in some cases
indifference to the world around them. dyssomnias Primary disorders of
sleep or wakefulness characterized by INSOMNIA or HYPERSOMNIA as the
major presenting symptom. Dyssomnias are disorders of the amount,
quality, or timing of sleep. Compare with PARASOMNIAS. dysthymia
Presence, while depressed, of two or more of the following: 1) poor
appetite or overeating, 2) insomnia or hypersomnia, 3) low energy

or fatigue, 4) low self-esteem, 5) poor concentration or difficulty
making decisions, or 6) feelings of hopelessness. dystonia Disordered
tonicity of muscles. eccentricity Odd, unusual, or bizarre behavior,
appearance, and/or speech having strange and unpredictable thoughts;
saying unusual or inappropriate things. Eccentricity is a facet of the
broad personality trait domain PSYCHOTICISM. echolalia The pathological,
parrotlike, and apparently senseless repetition (echoing) of a word or
phrase just spoken by another person. echopraxia Mimicking the movements
of another. emotional lability Instability of emotional experiences and
mood; emotions that are easily aroused, intense, and/or out of
proportion to events and circumstances. Emotional lability is a facet of
the broad personality trait domain NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY. empathy
Comprehension and appreciation of others' experiences and motivations;
tolerance of differing perspectives; understanding the effects of own
behavior on others. episode (episodic) A specified duration of time
during which the patient has developed or experienced symptoms that meet
the diagnostic criteria for a given mental disorder. Depending on the
type of mental disorder, episode may denote a certain number of symptoms
or a specified severity or frequency of symptoms. Episodes may be
further differentiated as a single (first) episode or a recurrence or
relapse of multiple episodes if appropriate. euphoria A mental and
emotional condition in which a person experiences intense feelings of
well-being, elation, happiness, excitement, and joy. fatigability
Tendency to become easily fatigued. See also FATIGUE. fatigue A state
(also called exhaustion, tiredness, lethargy, languidness, languor,
lassitude, and listlessness) usually associated with a weakening or
depletion of one's physical and/or mental resources, ranging from a
general state of lethargy to a specific, work-induced burning sensation
within one's muscles. Physical fatigue leads to an inability to continue
functioning at one's normal level of activity. Although widespread in

everyday life, this state usually becomes particularly noticeable during
heavy exercise. Mental fatigue, by contrast, most often manifests as
SOMNOLENCE (sleepiness). fear An emotional response to perceived
imminent threat or danger associated with urges to flee or fight.
flashback A dissociative state during which aspects of a traumatic event
are reexperienced as though they were occurring at that moment. flight
of ideas A nearly continuous flow of accelerated speech with abrupt
changes from topic to topic that are usually based on understandable
associations, distracting stimuli, or plays on words. When the condition
is severe, speech may be disorganized and incoherent. gender The public
(and usually legally recognized) lived role as boy or girl, man or
woman. Biological factors are seen as contributing in interaction with
social and psychological factors to gender development. gender
assignment The initial assignment as male or female, which usually
occurs at birth and is subsequently referred to as the "natal gender."
gender dysphoria Distress that accompanies the incongruence between
one's experienced and expressed gender and one's assigned or natal
gender. gender experience The unique and personal ways in which
individuals experience their gender in the context of the gender roles
provided by their societies. gender expression The specific ways in
which individuals enact gender roles provided in their societies. gender
identity A category of social identity that refers to an individual's
identification as male, female or, occasionally, some category other
than male or female. gender reassignment A change of gender that can be
either medical (hormones, surgery) or legal (government recognition), or
both. In case of medical interventions, often referred to as sex
reassignment. geometric hallucination See HALLUCINATION. grandiosity
Believing that one is superior to others and deserves special treatment;
self-centeredness; feelings of entitlement; condescension

toward others. Grandiosity is a facet of the broad personality trait
domain ANTAGONISM. grimace (grimacing) Odd and inappropriate facial
expressions unrelated to situation (as seen in individuals with
CATATONIA). hallucination A perception-like experience with the clarity
and impact of a true perception but without the external stimulation of
the relevant sensory organ. Hallucinations should be distinguished from
ILLUSIONS, in which an actual external stimulus is misperceived or
misinterpreted. The person may or may not have insight into the
nonveridical nature of the hallucination. One hallucinating person may
recognize the false sensory experience, whereas another may be convinced
that the experience is grounded in reality. The term hallucination is
not ordinarily applied to the false perceptions that occur during
dreaming, while falling asleep (hypnagogic), or upon awakening
(hypnopompic). Transient hallucinatory experiences may occur without a
mental disorder. auditory A hallucination involving the perception of
sound, most commonly of voice. geometric Visual hallucinations involving
geometric shapes such as tunnels and funnels, spirals, lattices, or
cobwebs. gustatory A hallucination involving the perception of taste
(usually unpleasant). mood-congruent See MOOD-CONGRUENT PSYCHOTIC
FEATURES. mood-incongruent See MOOD-INCONGRUENT PSYCHOTIC FEATURES.
olfactory A hallucination involving the perception of odor, such as of
burning rubber or decaying fish. somatic A hallucination involving the
perception of physical experience localized within the body (e.g., a
feeling of electricity). A somatic hallucination is to be distinguished
from physical sensations arising from an as-yet-undiagnosed general
medical condition, from hypochondriacal preoccupation with normal
physical sensations, or from a tactile hallucination. tactile A
hallucination involving the perception of being touched or of something
being under one's skin. The most common tactile

hallucinations are the sensation of electric shocks and formication (the
sensation of something creeping or crawling on or under the skin).
visual A hallucination involving sight, which may consist of formed
images, such as of people, or of unformed images, such as flashes of
light. Visual hallucinations should be distinguished from ILLUSIONS,
which are misperceptions of real external stimuli. hostility Persistent
or frequent angry feelings; anger or irritability in response to minor
slights and insults; mean, nasty, or vengeful behavior. Hostility is a
facet of the broad personality trait domain ANTAGONISM. hyperacusis
Increased auditory perception. hyperorality A condition in which
inappropriate objects are placed in the mouth. hypersexuality A stronger
than usual urge to have sexual activity. hypersomnia Excessive
sleepiness, as evidenced by prolonged nocturnal sleep, difficulty
maintaining an alert awake state during the day, or undesired daytime
sleep episodes. See also SOMNOLENCE. hypervigilance An enhanced state of
sensory sensitivity accompanied by an exaggerated intensity of behaviors
whose purpose is to detect threats. Hypervigilance is also accompanied
by a state of increased anxiety which can cause exhaustion. Other
symptoms include abnormally increased arousal, a high responsiveness to
stimuli, and a continual scanning of the environment for threats. In
hypervigilance, there is a perpetual scanning of the environment to
search for sights, sounds, people, behaviors, smells, or anything else
that is reminiscent of threat or trauma. The individual is placed on
high alert in order to be certain danger is not near. Hypervigilance can
lead to a variety of obsessive behavior patterns, as well as producing
difficulties with social interaction and relationships. hypomania An
abnormality of mood resembling mania but of lesser intensity. See also
MANIA. hypopnea Episodes of overly shallow breathing or an abnormally
low respiratory rate.

ideas of reference The feeling that causal incidents and external events
have a particular and unusual meaning that is specific to the person. An
idea of reference is to be distinguished from a DELUSION OF REFERENCE,
in which there is a belief that is held with delusional conviction.
identity Experience of oneself as unique, with clear boundaries between
self and others; stability of self-esteem and accuracy of
self-appraisal; capacity for, and ability to regulate, a range of
emotional experience. illusion A misperception or misinterpretation of a
real external stimulus, such as hearing the rustling of leaves as the
sound of voices. See also HALLUCINATION. impulsivity Acting on the spur
of the moment in response to immediate stimuli; acting on a momentary
basis without a plan or consideration of outcomes; difficulty
establishing and following plans; a sense of urgency and self-harming
behavior under emotional distress. Impulsivity is a facet of the broad
personality trait domain DISINHIBITION. incoherence Speech or thinking
that is essentially incomprehensible to others because word or phrases
are joined together without a logical or meaningful connection. This
disturbance occurs within clauses, in contrast to derailment, in which
the disturbance is between clauses. This has sometimes been referred to
a "word salad" to convey the degree of linguistic disorganization.
Mildly ungrammatical constructions or idiomatic usages characteristic of
a particular regional or cultural backgrounds, lack of education, or low
intelligence should not be considered incoherence. The term is generally
not applied when there is evidence that the disturbance in speech is due
to an aphasia. insomnia A subjective complaint of difficulty falling or
staying asleep or poor sleep quality. intersex condition A condition in
which individuals have conflicting or ambiguous biological indicators of
sex. intimacy Depth and duration of connection with others; desire and
capacity for closeness; mutuality of regard reflected in interpersonal
behavior. intimacy avoidance Avoidance of close or romantic
relationships, interpersonal attachments, and intimate sexual
relationships. Intimacy avoidance is a facet of the broad personality
trait domain DETACHMENT.

irresponsibility Disregard for---and failure to honor---financial and
other obligations or commitments; lack of respect for---and lack of
followthrough on---agreements and promises; carelessness with others'
property. Irresponsibility is a facet of the broad personality trait
domain DISINHIBITION. language pragmatics The understanding and use of
language in a given context. For example, the warning "Watch your hands"
when issued to a child who is dirty is intended not only to prompt the
child to look at his or her hands but also to communicate the admonition
"Don't get anything dirty." lethargy A state of decreased mental
activity, characterized by sluggishness, drowsiness, inactivity, and
reduced alertness. macropsia The visual perception that objects are
larger than they actually are. Compare with MICROPSIA. magical thinking
The erroneous belief that one's thoughts, words, or actions will cause
or prevent a specific outcome in some way that defies commonly
understood laws of cause and effect. Magical thinking may be a part of
normal child development. mania A mental state of elevated, expansive,
or irritable mood and persistently increased level of activity or
energy. See also HYPOMANIA. manipulativeness Use of subterfuge to
influence or control others; use of seduction, charm, glibness, or
ingratiation to achieve one's ends. Manipulativeness is a facet of the
broad personality trait domain ANTAGONISM. mannerism A peculiar and
characteristic individual style of movement, action, thought, or speech.
melancholia (melancholic) A mental state characterized by very severe
depression. micropsia The visual perception that objects are smaller
than they actually are. Compare with MACROPSIA. mixed symptoms The
specifier "with mixed features" is applied to mood episodes during which
subthreshold symptoms from the opposing pole are present. Whereas these
concurrent "mixed" symptoms are relatively

simultaneous, they may also occur closely juxtaposed in time as a waxing
and waning of individual symptoms of the opposite pole (i.e., depressive
symptoms during hypomanic or manic episodes, and vice versa). mood A
pervasive and sustained emotion that colors the perception of the world.
Common examples of mood include depression, elation, anger, and anxiety.
In contrast to affect, which refers to more fluctuating changes in
emotional "weather," mood refers to a pervasive and sustained emotional
"climate." Types of mood include dysphoric An unpleasant mood, such as
sadness, anxiety, or irritability. elevated An exaggerated feeling of
well-being, or euphoria or elation. A person with elevated mood may
describe feeling "high," "ecstatic," "on top of the world," or "up in
the clouds." euthymic Mood in the "normal" range, which implies the
absence of depressed or elevated mood. expansive Lack of restraint in
expressing one's feelings, frequently with an overvaluation of one's
significance or importance. irritable Easily annoyed and provoked to
anger. mood-congruent psychotic features Delusions or hallucinations
whose content is entirely consistent with the typical themes of a
depressed or manic mood. If the mood is depressed, the content of the
delusions or hallucinations would involve themes of personal inadequacy,
guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment. The content of
the delusion may include themes of persecution if these are based on
selfderogatory concepts such as deserved punishment. If the mood is
manic, the content of the delusions or hallucinations would involve
themes of inflated worth, power, knowledge, or identity, or a special
relationship to a deity or a famous person. The content of the delusion
may include themes of persecution if these are based on concepts such as
inflated worth or deserved punishment. mood-incongruent psychotic
features Delusions or hallucinations whose content is not consistent
with the typical themes of a depressed or manic mood. In the case of
depression, the delusions or hallucinations would not involve themes of
personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved
punishment. In the case of mania, the delusions or

hallucinations would not involve themes of inflated worth, power,
knowledge, or identity, or a special relationship to a deity or a famous
person. multiple sleep latency test Polysomnographic assessment of the
sleeponset period, with several short sleep-wake cycles assessed during
a single session. The test repeatedly measures the time to daytime sleep
onset ("sleep latency") and occurrence of and time to onset of the rapid
eye movement sleep phase. mutism No, or very little, verbal response (in
the absence of known aphasia). narcolepsy Sleep disorder characterized
by periods of extreme drowsiness and frequent daytime lapses into sleep
(sleep attacks). These must have been occurring at least three times per
week over the last 3 months (in the absence of treatment). negative
affectivity Frequent and intense experiences of high levels of a wide
range of negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression, guilt/shame,
worry, anger), and their behavioral (e.g., self-harm) and interpersonal
(e.g., dependency) manifestations. Negative Affectivity is one of the
five pathological PERSONALITY TRAIT DOMAINS defined in Section III
"Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders." negativism
Opposition to suggestion or advice; behavior opposite to that
appropriate to a specific situation or against the wishes of others,
including direct resistance to efforts to be moved. night eating
syndrome Recurrent episodes of night eating, as manifested by eating
after awakening from sleep or excessive food consumption after the
evening meal. There is awareness and recall of the eating. The night
eating is not better accounted for by external influences such as
changes in the individual's sleep-wake cycle or by local social norms.
nightmare disorder Repeated occurrences of extended, extremely
dysphoric, and well-remembered dreams that usually involve efforts to
avoid threats to survival, security or physical integrity and that
generally occur during the second half of the major sleep episode. On
awakening from the dysphoric dreams, the individual rapidly becomes
oriented and alert.

nonsubstance addiction(s) Behavioral disorder (also called behavioral
addiction) not related to any substance of abuse that shares some
features with substance-induced addiction. obsession Recurrent and
persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some time
during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted and that in most
individuals cause marked anxiety or distress. The individual attempts to
ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to neutralize
them with some other thought or action (i.e., by performing a
compulsion). overeating Eating too much food too quickly. overvalued
idea An unreasonable and sustained belief that is maintained with less
than delusional intensity (i.e., the person is able to acknowledge the
possibility that the belief may not be true). The belief is not one that
is ordinarily accepted by other members of the person's culture or
subculture. panic attacks Discrete periods of sudden onset of intense
fear or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. During
these attacks there are symptoms such as shortness of breath or
smothering sensations; palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated
heart rate; chest pain or discomfort; choking; and fear of going crazy
or losing control. Panic attacks may be unexpected, in which the onset
of the attack is not associated with an obvious trigger and instead
occurs "out of the blue," or expected, in which the panic attack is
associated with an obvious trigger, either internal or external.
paranoid ideation Ideation, of less than delusional proportions,
involving suspiciousness or the belief that one is being harassed,
persecuted, or unfairly treated. parasomnias Disorders of sleep
involving abnormal behaviors or physiological events occurring during
sleep or sleep-wake transitions. Compare with DYSSOMNIAS. perseveration
Persistence at tasks or in particular way of doing things long after the
behavior has ceased to be functional or effective; continuance of the
same behavior despite repeated failures or clear reasons for stopping.

Perseveration is a facet of the broad personality trait domain NEGATIVE
AFFECTIVITY. personality Enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to,
and thinking about the environment and oneself. PERSONALITY TRAITS are
prominent aspects of personality that are exhibited in relatively
consistent ways across time and across situations. Personality traits
influence self and interpersonal functioning. Depending on their
severity, impairments in personality functioning and personality trait
expression may reflect the presence of a personality disorder.
personality disorder---trait specified In Section III "Alternative DSM-5
Model for Personality Disorders," a proposed diagnostic category for use
when a personality disorder is considered present but the criteria for a
specific disorder are not met. Personality disorder---trait specified
(PDTS) is defined by significant impairment in personality functioning,
as measured by the Level of Personality Functioning Scale and one or
more pathological PERSONALITY TRAIT DOMAINS or PERSONALITY TRAIT FACETS.
PD-TS is proposed in DSM-5 Section III for further study as a possible
future replacement for other specified personality disorder and
unspecified personality disorder. personality functioning Cognitive
models of self and others that shape patterns of emotional and
affiliative engagement. personality trait A tendency to behave, feel,
perceive, and think in relatively consistent ways across time and across
situations in which the trait may be manifest. personality trait facets
Specific personality components that make up the five broad personality
trait domains in the dimensional taxonomy of Section III "Alternative
DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders." For example, the broad domain
antagonism has the following component facets: MANIPULATIVENESS,
DECEITFULNESS, GRANDIOSITY, ATTENTION SEEKING, CALLOUSNESS, and
HOSTILITY. personality trait domains In the dimensional taxonomy of
Section III "Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders,"
personality traits are organized into five broad domains: NEGATIVE
AFFECTIVITY, DETACHMENT, ANTAGONISM, DISINHIBITION, and PSYCHOTICISM.
Within

these five broad trait domains are 25 specific personality trait facets
(e.g., IMPULSIVITY, RIGID PERFECTIONISM). phobia A persistent fear of a
specific object, activity, or situation (i.e., the phobic stimulus) out
of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or
situation that results in a compelling desire to avoid it. If it cannot
be avoided, the phobic stimulus is endured with marked distress. pica
Persistent eating of nonnutritive nonfood substances over a period of at
least 1 month. The eating of nonnutritive nonfood substances is
inappropriate to the developmental level of the individual (a minimum
age of 2 years is suggested for diagnosis). The eating behavior is not
part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice.
polysomnography Polysomnography (PSG), also known as a sleep study, is a
multiparametric test used in the study of sleep and as a diagnostic tool
in sleep medicine. The test result is called a polysomnogram, also
abbreviated PSG. PSG monitors many body functions, including brain
(electroencephalography), eye movements (electro-oculography), muscle
activity or skeletal muscle activation (electromyography), and heart
rhythm (electrocardiography). posturing Spontaneous and active
maintenance of a posture against gravity (as seen in CATATONIA).
Abnormal posturing may also be a sign of certain injuries to the brain
or spinal cord, including the following: decerebrate posture The arms
and legs are out straight and rigid, the toes point downward, and the
head is arched backward. decorticate posture The body is rigid, the arms
are stiff and bent, the fists are tight, and the legs are straight out.
opisthotonus The back is rigid and arching, and the head is thrown
backward. An affected person may alternate between different postures as
the condition changes. pressured speech Speech that is increased in
amount, accelerated, and difficult or impossible to interrupt. Usually
it is also loud and emphatic. Frequently the person talks without any
social stimulation and may continue to talk even though no one is
listening.

prodrome An early or premonitory sign or symptom of a disorder.
pseudocyesis A false belief of being pregnant that is associated with
objective signs and reported symptoms of pregnancy. psychological
distress A range of symptoms and experiences of a person's internal life
that are commonly held to be troubling, confusing, or out of the
ordinary. psychometric measures Standardized instruments such as scales,
questionnaires, tests, and assessments that are designed to measure
human knowledge, abilities, attitudes, or personality traits.
psychomotor agitation Excessive motor activity associated with a feeling
of inner tension. The activity is usually nonproductive and repetitious
and consists of behaviors such as pacing, fidgeting, wringing of the
hands, pulling of clothes, and inability to sit still. psychomotor
retardation Visible generalized slowing of movements and speech.
psychotic features Features characterized by delusions, hallucinations,
and formal thought disorder. psychoticism Exhibiting a wide range of
culturally incongruent odd, eccentric, or unusual behaviors and
cognitions, including both process (e.g., perception, dissociation) and
content (e.g., beliefs). Psychoticism is one of the five broad
PERSONALITY TRAIT DOMAINS defined in Section III "Alternative DSM-5
Model for Personality Disorders." purging disorder Eating disorder
characterized by recurrent purging behavior to influence weight or
shape, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or
other medications, in the absence of binge eating. racing thoughts A
state in which the mind uncontrollably brings up random thoughts and
memories and switches between them very quickly. Sometimes the thoughts
are related, with one thought leading to another; other times they are
completely random. A person experiencing an episode of racing thoughts
has no control over them and is unable to focus on a single topic or to
sleep.

rapid cycling Term referring to bipolar disorder characterized by the
presence of at least four mood episodes in the previous 12 months that
meet the criteria for a manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode.
Episodes are demarcated either by partial or full remissions of at least
2 months or by a switch to an episode of the opposite polarity (e.g.,
major depressive episode to manic episode). The rapid cycling specifier
can be applied to bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. rapid eye movement
(REM) A behavioral sign of the phase of sleep during which the sleeper
is likely to be experiencing dreamlike mental activity. repetitive
speech Morphologically heterogeneous iterations of speech. residual
phase Period after an episode of schizophrenia that has partly or
completed remitted but in which some symptoms may remain, and symptoms
such as listlessness, problems with concentrating, and withdrawal from
social activities may predominate. restless legs syndrome An urge to
move the legs, usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and
unpleasant sensations in the legs (for pediatric restless legs syndrome,
the description of these symptoms should be in the child's own words).
The symptoms begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity.
Symptoms are partially or totally relieved by movement. Symptoms are
worse in the evening or at night than during the day or occur only in
the night/evening. restricted affectivity Little reaction to emotionally
arousing situations; constricted emotional experience and expression;
indifference and aloofness in normatively engaging situations.
Restricted affectivity is a facet of the broad personality trait domain
DETACHMENT. rigid perfectionism Rigid insistence on everything being
flawless, perfect, and without errors or faults, including one's own and
others' performance; sacrificing of timeliness to ensure correctness in
every detail; believing that there is only one right way to do things;
difficulty changing ideas and/or viewpoint; preoccupation with details,
organization, and order. Lack of rigid perfectionism is a facet of the
broad personality trait domain DISINHIBITION. risk taking Engagement in
dangerous, risky, and potentially self-damaging activities,
unnecessarily and without regard to consequences; lack of

concern for one's limitations and denial of the reality of personal
danger; reckless pursuit of goals regardless of the level of risk
involved. Risk taking is a facet of the broad personality trait domain
DISINHIBITION. rumination (rumination disorders) Repeated regurgitation
of food over a period of at least 1 month. Regurgitated food may be
re-chewed, reswallowed, or spit out. In rumination disorders, there is
no evidence that an associated gastrointestinal or another medical
condition (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux) is sufficient to account for
the repeated regurgitation. seasonal pattern A pattern of the occurrence
of a specific mental disorder in selected seasons of the year.
self-directedness, self-direction Pursuit of coherent and meaningful
shortterm and life goals; utilization of constructive and prosocial
internal standards of behavior; ability to self-reflect productively.
separation insecurity Fears of being alone due to rejection by and/or
separation from significant others, based in a lack of confidence in
one's ability to care for oneself, both physically and emotionally.
Separation insecurity is a facet of the broad personality trait domain
NEGATIVE AFFECTIVITY. sex Biological indication of male and female
(understood in the context of reproductive capacity), such as sex
chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, and nonambiguous internal and
external genitalia. sign An objective manifestation of a pathological
condition. Signs are observed by the examiner rather than reported by
the affected individual. Compare with SYMPTOM. sleep-onset REM
Occurrence of the rapid eye movement (REM) phase of sleep within minutes
after falling asleep. Usually assessed by a polysomnographic MULTIPLE
SLEEP LATENCY TEST. sleep terrors Recurrent episodes of abrupt terror
arousals from sleep, usually occurring during the first third of the
major sleep episode and beginning with a panicky scream. There is
intense fear and signs of autonomic arousal, such as mydriasis,
tachycardia, rapid breathing, and sweating, during each episode.

sleepwalking Repeated episodes of rising from bed during sleep and
walking about, usually occurring during the first third of the major
sleep episode. While sleepwalking, the person has a blank, staring face,
is relatively unresponsive to the efforts of others to communicate with
him or her, and can be awakened only with great difficulty. somnolence
(or "drowsiness") A state of near-sleep, a strong desire for sleep, or
sleeping for unusually long periods. It has two distinct meanings,
referring both to the usual state preceding falling asleep and to the
chronic condition that involves being in that state independent of a
circadian rhythm. Compare with HYPERSOMNIA. specific food cravings
Irresistible desire for special types of food. startle response (or
"startle reaction") An involuntary (reflexive) reaction to a sudden
unexpected stimulus, such as a loud noise or sharp movement.
stereotypies, stereotyped behaviors/movements Repetitive, abnormally
frequent, non-goal-directed movements, seemingly driven, and
nonfunctional motor behavior (e.g., hand shaking or waving, body
rocking, head banging, self-biting). stress The pattern of specific and
nonspecific responses a person makes to stimulus events that disturb his
or her equilibrium and tax or exceed his or her ability to cope.
stressor Any emotional, physical, social, economic, or other factor that
disrupts the normal physiological, cognitive, emotional, or behavioral
balance of an individual. stressor, psychological Any life event or life
change that may be associated temporally (and perhaps causally) with the
onset, occurrence, or exacerbation of a mental disorder. stupor Lack of
psychomotor activity, which may range from not actively relating to the
environment to complete immobility. submissiveness Adaptation of one's
behavior to the actual or perceived interests and desires of others even
when doing so is antithetical to one's own interests, needs, or desires.
Submissiveness is a facet of the broad personality trait domain NEGATIVE
AFFECTIVITY.

subsyndromal Below a specified level or threshold required to qualify
for a particular condition. Subsyndromal conditions (formes frustes) are
medical conditions that do not meet full criteria for a diagnosis---for
example, because the symptoms are fewer or less severe than a defined
syndrome---but that nevertheless can be identified and related to the
"full-blown" syndrome. suicidal ideas (suicidal ideation) Thoughts about
self-harm, with deliberate consideration or planning of possible
techniques of causing one's own death. suicide The act of intentionally
causing one's own death. suicide attempt An attempt to end one's own
life, which may lead to one's death. suspiciousness Expectations
of---and sensitivity to---signs of interpersonal ill intent or harm;
doubts about loyalty and fidelity of others; feelings of being
mistreated, used, and/or persecuted by others. Suspiciousness is a facet
of the broad personality trait domain DETACHMENT. symptom A subjective
manifestation of a pathological condition. Symptoms are reported by the
affected individual rather than observed by the examiner. Compare with
SIGN. syndrome A grouping of signs and symptoms, based on their frequent
cooccurrence that may suggest a common underlying pathogenesis, course,
familial pattern, or treatment selection. synesthesias A condition in
which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to
automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive
pathway. temper outburst An emotional outburst (also called a
"tantrum"), usually associated with children or those in emotional
distress, and typically characterized by stubbornness, crying,
screaming, defiance, angry ranting, a resistance to attempts at
pacification, and in some cases hitting. Physical control may be lost,
the person may be unable to remain still, and even if the "goal" of the
person is met, he or she may not be calmed. thought-action fusion The
tendency to treat thoughts and actions as equivalent.

tic An involuntary, sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement
or vocalization. tolerance A situation that occurs with continued use of
a drug in which an individual requires greater dosages to achieve the
same effect. transgender The broad spectrum of individuals who
transiently or permanently identify with a gender different from their
natal gender. transsexual An individual who seeks, or has undergone, a
social transition from male to female or female to male, which in many,
but not all cases may also involve a somatic transition by cross-sex
hormone treatment and genital surgery ("sex reassignment surgery").
traumatic stressor Any event (or events) that may cause or threaten
death, serious injury, or sexual violence to an individual, a close
family member, or a close friend. unusual beliefs and experiences Belief
that one has unusual abilities, such as mind reading, telekinesis, or
THOUGHT-ACTION FUSION; unusual experiences of reality, including
hallucinatory experiences. In general, the unusual beliefs are not held
at the same level of conviction as DELUSIONS. Unusual beliefs and
experiences are a facet of the personality trait domain PSYCHOTICISM.
waxy flexibility Slight, even resistance to positioning by examiner.
Compare with CATALEPSY. withdrawal, social Preference for being alone to
being with others; reticence in social situations; AVOIDANCE of social
contacts and activity; lack of initiation of social contact. Social
withdrawal is a facet of the broad personality trait domain DETACHMENT.
worry Unpleasant or uncomfortable thoughts that cannot be consciously
controlled by trying to turn the attention to other subjects. The
worrying is often persistent, repetitive, and out of proportion to the
topic worried about (it can even be about a triviality).

Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress Ataque de nervios Ataque de
nervios ("attack of nerves") is a syndrome among individuals of Latino
descent, characterized by symptoms of intense emotional upset, including
acute anxiety, anger, or grief; screaming and shouting uncontrollably;
attacks of crying; trembling; heat in the chest rising into the head;
and becoming verbally and physically aggressive. Dissociative
experiences (e.g., depersonalization, derealization, amnesia),
seizure-like or fainting episodes, and suicidal gestures are prominent
in some ataques but absent in others. A general feature of an ataque de
nervios is a sense of being out of control. Attacks frequently occur as
a direct result of a stressful event relating to the family, such as
news of the death of a close relative, conflicts with a spouse or
children, or witnessing an accident involving a family member. For a
minority of individuals, no particular social event triggers their
ataques; instead, their vulnerability to losing control comes from the
accumulated experience of suffering2, 3, 7. No one-to-one relationship
has been found between ataque and any specific psychiatric disorder,
although several disorders, including panic disorder, other specified or
unspecified dissociative disorder, and conversion disorder, have
symptomatic overlap with ataque1, 2, 4, 5. In community samples, ataque
is associated with suicidal ideation, disability, and outpatient
psychiatric utilization, after adjustment for psychiatric diagnoses,
traumatic exposure, and other covariates6. However, some ataques
represent normative expressions of acute distress (e.g., at a funeral)
without clinical sequelae. The term ataque de nervios may also refer to
an idiom of distress that includes any "fit"-like paroxysm of
emotionality (e.g., hysterical laughing) and may be used to indicate an
episode of loss of control in response to an intense stressor.

Related conditions in other cultural contexts: Indisposition in Haiti,

Dhat syndrome Dhat syndrome is a term that was coined in South Asia
little more than half a century ago to account for common clinical
presentations of young male patients who attributed their various
symptoms to semen loss. Despite the name, it is not a discrete syndrome
but rather a cultural explanation of distress for patients who refer to
diverse symptoms, such as anxiety, fatigue, weakness, weight loss,
impotence, other multiple somatic complaints, and depressive mood. The
cardinal feature is anxiety and distress about the loss of dhat in the
absence of any identifiable physiological dysfunction2. Dhat was
identified by patients as a white discharge that was noted on defecation
or urination7. Ideas about this substance are related to the concept of
dhatu (semen) described in the Hindu system of medicine, Ayurveda, as
one of seven essential bodily fluids whose balance is necessary to
maintain health3, 8. Although dhat syndrome was formulated as a cultural
guide to local clinical practice, related ideas about the harmful
effects of semen loss have been shown to be widespread in the general
population5, suggesting a cultural disposition for explaining health
problems and symptoms with reference to dhat syndrome. Research in
health care settings has yielded diverse estimates of the syndrome's
prevalence (e.g., 64% of men attending psychiatric clinics in India for
sexual complaints; 30% of men attending general medical clinics in
Pakistan)1, 6. Although dhat syndrome is most commonly identified with
young men from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, middle-aged men may also
be affected4. Comparable concerns about white vaginal discharge
(leukorrhea) have been associated with a variant of the concept for
women10. Related conditions in other cultural contexts: koro in
Southeast Asia, particularly Singapore and shen-k'uei ("kidney
deficiency") in China9. Related conditions in DSM-5: Major depressive
disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), generalized
anxiety disorder, somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder,
erectile disorder, early (premature) ejaculation, other specified or
unspecified sexual dysfunction, academic problem.

Khyâl cap "Khyâl attacks" (khyâl cap), or "wind attacks," is a syndrome
found among Cambodians in the United States and Cambodia2, 3, 4. Common
symptoms include those of panic attacks, such as dizziness,
palpitations, shortness of breath, and cold extremities, as well as
other symptoms of anxiety and autonomic arousal (e.g., tinnitus and neck
soreness). Khyâl attacks include catastrophic cognitions centered on the
concern that khyâl (a windlike substance) may rise in the body---along
with blood---and cause a range of serious effects (e.g., compressing the
lungs to cause shortness of breath and asphyxia; entering the cranium to
cause tinnitus, dizziness, blurry vision, and a fatal syncope). Khyâl
attacks may occur without warning, but are frequently brought about by
triggers such as worrisome thoughts, standing

up (i.e., orthostasis), specific odors with negative associations, and
agoraphobic-type cues like going to crowded spaces or riding in a car.
Khyâl attacks usually meet panic attack criteria and may shape the
experience of other anxiety and trauma- and stressor-related disorders.
Khyâl attacks may be associated with considerable disability. Related
conditions in other cultural contexts: Laos (pen lom), Tibet (srog rlung
gi nad), Sri Lanka (vata), and Korea (hwa byung)1. Related conditions in
DSM-5: Panic attack, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder,
agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, illness anxiety disorder.

Kufungisisa Kufungisisa ("thinking too much" in Shona) is an idiom of
distress and a cultural explanation among the Shona of Zimbabwe. As an
explanation, it is considered to be causative of anxiety, depression,
and somatic problems (e.g., "my heart is painful because I think too
much"). As an idiom of psychosocial distress, it is indicative of
interpersonal and social difficulties (e.g., marital problems, having no
money to take care of children)10, 11. Kufungisisa involves ruminating
on upsetting thoughts, particularly worries1. Kufungisisa is associated
with a range of psychopathology, including anxiety symptoms, excessive
worry, panic attacks, depressive symptoms,

and irritability12. In a study of a random community sample, two-thirds
of the cases identified by a general psychopathology measure were of
this complaint13. In many cultures, "thinking too much" is considered to
be damaging to the mind and body5, 2, 12, 15 and to cause specific
symptoms like headache and dizziness. "Thinking too much" may also be a
key component of cultural syndromes such as "brain fag" in Nigeria8, 9.
In the case of brain fag, "thinking too much" is primarily attributed to
excessive study, which is considered to damage the brain in particular,
with symptoms including feelings of heat or crawling sensations in the
head. Related conditions in other cultural contexts: "Thinking too much"
is a common idiom of distress and cultural explanation across many
countries and ethnic groups. It has been described in Africa2, 10, 11,
the Caribbean and Latin America3, 6, 15, and among East Asian4, 12, 13,
14 and Native American groups7. Related conditions in DSM-5: Major
depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia),
generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, persistent complex bereavement disorder
(see "Conditions for Further Study").

Maladi moun Maladi moun (literally "humanly caused illness," also
referred to as "sent sickness") is a cultural explanation in Haitian
communities for diverse medical and psychiatric disorders. In this
explanatory model, interpersonal envy and malice cause people to harm
their enemies by sending illnesses

such as psychosis2, depression7, social or academic failure, and
inability to perform activities of daily living4. The etiological model
assumes that illness may be caused by others' envy and hatred, provoked
by the victim's economic success as evidenced by a new job or expensive
purchase5. One person's gain is assumed to produce another person's
loss, so visible success makes one vulnerable to attack9. Assigning the
label of sent sickness depends on mode of onset and social status more
than presenting symptoms. The acute onset of new symptoms or an abrupt
behavioral change raises suspicions of a spiritual attack. Someone who
is attractive, intelligent, or wealthy is perceived as especially
vulnerable, and even young healthy children are at risk3. Related
conditions in other cultural contexts: Concerns about illness
(typically, physical illness) caused by envy or social conflict are
common across cultures and often expressed in the form of "evil eye"
(e.g. in Spanish, mal de ojo, in Italian, mal'occhiu)1, 6, 8. Related
conditions in DSM-5: Delusional disorder, persecutory type;
schizophrenia with paranoid features.

Nervios Nervios ("nerves") is a common idiom of distress among Latinos
in the United States and Latin America. Nervios refers to a general
state of vulnerability to stressful life experiences and to difficult
life circumstances1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12. The term nervios includes a wide
range of symptoms of emotional distress, somatic disturbance, and
inability to function10. The most common symptoms attributed to nervios
include headaches and "brain aches" (occipital neck tension),
irritability, stomach disturbances, sleep difficulties, nervousness,
easy tearfulness, inability to concentrate, trembling, tingling
sensations, and mareos (dizziness with occasional vertigo-like
exacerbations)11, 12. Nervios is a broad idiom of distress that spans
the range of severity from cases with no mental disorder to
presentations resembling adjustment, anxiety, depressive, dissociative,
somatic symptom, or psychotic disorders. "Being nervous since childhood"
appears to be more of a trait and may precede social anxiety disorder,
while "being ill with nerves" is more related than other forms of
nervios to psychiatric problems, especially dissociation7 and
depression8. Related conditions in other cultural contexts: Nevra among
Greeks in North America3, nierbi among Sicilians in North America9, and
nerves among whites in Appalachia11 and Newfoundland2. Related
conditions in DSM-5: Major depressive disorder, peristent depressive
disorder (dysthymia), generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety
disorder, other specified or unspecified dissociative disorder, somatic
symptom disorder, schizophrenia.

Shenjing shuairuo

Shenjing shuairuo ("weakness of the nervous system" in Mandarin Chinese)
is a cultural syndrome that integrates conceptual categories of
traditional Chinese medicine with the Western diagnosis of neurasthenia.
In the second, revised edition of the Chinese Classification of Mental
Disorders (CCMD-2-R), shenjing shuairuo is defined as a syndrome
composed of three out of five nonhierarchical symptom clusters: weakness
(e.g., mental fatigue), emotions (e.g., feeling vexed), excitement
(e.g., increased recollections), nervous pain (e.g., headache), and
sleep (e.g., insomnia)6. Fan nao (feeling vexed) is a form of
irritability mixed with worry and distress over conflicting thoughts and
unfulfilled desires. The third edition of the CCMD3 retains shenjing
shuairuo as a somatoform diagnosis of exclusion7. Salient precipitants
of shenjing shuairuo include work- or family-related stressors, loss of
face (mianzi, lianzi), and an acute sense of failure (e.g., in academic
performance)5, 9. Shenjing shuairuo is related to traditional concepts
of weakness (xu) and health imbalances related to deficiencies of a
vital essence (e.g., the depletion of qi \[vital energy\] following
overstraining or stagnation of qi due to excessive worry)7. In the
traditional interpretation, shenjing shuairuo results when bodily
channels (jing) conveying vital forces (shen) become dysregulated as a
result of various social and interpersonal stressors, such as the
inability to change a chronically frustrating and distressing
situation6, 10. Various psychiatric disorders are associated with
shenjing shuairuo, notably mood, anxiety, and somatic symptom disorders.
In medical clinics in China, however, up to 45% of patients with
shenjing shuairuo do not meet criteria for any DSM-IV disorder1. Related
conditions in other cultural contexts: Neurasthenia-spectrum idioms and
syndromes are present in India (ashaktapanna)12 and Japan
(shinkei-suijaku)10, among other settings. Other conditions, such as
brain fag syndrome11, burnout syndrome8, and chronic fatigue syndrome4,
are also closely related. Related conditions in DSM-5: Major depressive
disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), generalized
anxiety disorder, somatic symptom disorder, social anxiety disorder,
specific phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder.

Susto Susto ("fright") is a cultural explanation for distress and
misfortune prevalent among some Latinos in the United States and among
people in Mexico, Central America, and South America. It is not
recognized as an illness category among Latinos from the Caribbean7.
Susto is an illness attributed to a frightening event that causes the
soul to leave the body and results in unhappiness and sickness, as well
as difficulties functioning in key social roles1, 6. Symptoms may appear
any time from days to years after the fright is experienced. In extreme
cases, susto may result in death. There are no specific defining
symptoms for susto9, however, symptoms that are often reported by people
with susto include appetite disturbances, inadequate or excessive sleep,
troubled sleep or dreams, feelings of sadness, low self-worth or
dirtiness, interpersonal sensitivity, and lack of motivation to do
anything. Somatic symptoms accompanying susto may include muscle aches
and pains, cold in the extremities, pallor, headache, stomachache, and
diarrhea. Precipitating events are diverse, and include natural
phenomena, animals, interpersonal situations, and supernatural agents,
among others2. Three syndromic types of susto (referred to as cibih in
the local Zapotec language) have been identified, each having different
relationships with psychiatric diagnoses4. An interpersonal susto
characterized by feelings of loss, abandonment, and not being loved by
family, with accompanying symptoms of sadness, poor self-image, and
suicidal ideation, seemed to be closely related to major depressive
disorder. When susto resulted from a traumatic event that played a major
role in shaping symptoms and in emotional processing of the experience,
the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder appeared more
appropriate. Susto characterized by various recurrent somatic
symptoms---for which the person sought health care from several
practitioners---was thought to resemble a somatic symptom disorder.
Related conditions in other cultural contexts: Similar etiological
concepts and symptom configurations are found globally3. In the Andean
region, susto is referred to as espanto5.

Related conditions in DSM-5: Major depressive disorder, posttraumatic
stress disorder, other specified or unspecified trauma and
stressor-related disorder, somatic symptom disorders.

Taijin kyofusho Taijin kyofusho ("interpersonal fear disorder" in
Japanese) is a cultural syndrome characterized by anxiety about and
avoidance of interpersonal situations due to the thought, feeling, or
conviction that one's appearance and actions in social interactions are
inadequate or offensive to others4, 7. In the United States, the variant
involves having an offensive body odor and is termed olfactory reference
syndrome. Individuals with taijin kyofusho tend to focus on the impact
of their symptoms and behaviors on others3. Variants include major
concerns about facial blushing (erythrophobia), having an offensive body
odor (olfactory reference syndrome), inappropriate gaze (too much or too
little eye contact), stiff or awkward facial expression or bodily
movements (e.g., stiffening, trembling), or body deformity6. Taijin
kyofusho is a broader construct than social anxiety disorder in DSM-57.
In addition to performance anxiety, taijin kyofusho includes two
culture-related forms: a "sensitive type," with extreme social
sensitivity and anxiety about interpersonal interactions, and an
"offensive type," in which the major concern is offending others. As a
category, taijin kyofusho thus includes syndromes with features of body
dysmorphic disorder as well as delusional disorder. Concerns may have a
delusional quality, responding poorly to simple reassurance or
counterexample. The distinctive symptoms of taijin kyofusho occur in
specific cultural contexts and, to some extent, with more severe social
anxiety across cultures1, 2. Similar syndromes are found in Korea and
other societies that place a strong emphasis on the self-conscious
maintenance of appropriate social behavior in hierarchical interpersonal
relationships. Taijin kyofusho-- like symptoms have also been described
in other cultural contexts, including the United States, Australia, and
New Zealand. Related conditions in other cultural contexts: Taein kong
po in Korea1. Related conditions in DSM-5: Social anxiety disorder, body
dysmorphic disorder, delusional disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
olfactory reference syndrome (a type of other specified
obsessive-compulsive and related disorder). Olfactory reference syndrome
is related specifically to the jikoshu-kyofu variant of taijin kyofusho,
whose core symptom is the concern that the person emits an offensive
body odor5. This presentation is seen in various cultures outside Japan.
