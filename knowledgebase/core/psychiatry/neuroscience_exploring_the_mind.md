**THE ORIGINS OF *NEUROSCIENCE: EXPLORING***    
***THE BRAIN***   
***THE BRAIN*** 

For over 30 years, we have taught a course called Neuroscience 1:  

An Introduction to the Nervous System. “Neuro 1” has been remarkably  

successful. At Brown University, where the course originated, approxi 

mately one out of every four undergraduates takes it. For a few students,  

this is the beginning of a career in neuroscience; for others, it is the only  

science course they take in college.  

The success of introductory neuroscience refl ects the fascination and  

curiosity everyone has for how we sense, move, feel, and think. However,  

the success of our course also derives from the way it is taught and what  

is emphasized. First, there are no prerequisites, so the elements of biol 

ogy, chemistry, and physics required for understanding neuroscience are  

covered as the course progresses. This approach ensures that no students  

are left behind. Second, liberal use of commonsense metaphors, real 

world examples, humor, and anecdotes remind students that science is  

interesting, approachable, exciting, and fun. Third, the course does not  

survey all of neurobiology. Instead, the focus is on mammalian brains  

and, whenever possible, the human brain. In this sense, the course closely  

resembles what is taught to most beginning medical students. Similar  

courses are now offered at many colleges and universities by psychology,  

biology, and neuroscience departments.  

The fi rst edition of *Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain* was written to  

provide a suitable textbook for Neuro 1, incorporating the subject matter  

and philosophy that made this course successful. Based on feedback from  

our students and colleagues at other universities, we expanded the second  

edition to include more topics in behavioral neuroscience and some new  

features to help students understand the structure of the brain. In the  

third edition, we shortened chapters when possible by emphasizing prin 

ciples more and details less and made the book even more user-friendly  

by improving the layout and clarity of the illustrations. We must have  

gotten it right because the book now ranks as one of the most popular in 

troductory neuroscience books in the world. It has been particularly grati 

fying to see our book used as a catalyst for the creation of new courses in  

introductory neuroscience.  

**NEW IN THE FOURTH EDITION**    
**NEW IN THE FOURTH EDITION** 

The advances in neuroscience since publication of the third edition have  

been nothing short of breathtaking. The elucidation of the human ge 

nome has lived up to its promise to “change everything” we know about  

our brains. We now have insight into how neurons differ at the molecu 

lar level, and this knowledge has been exploited to develop revolutionary  

technologies to trace their connections and interrogate their functions.  

The genetic basis for many neurological and psychiatric diseases has been  

revealed. The methods of genetic engineering have made it possible to  

create animal models to examine how genes and genetically defi ned cir 

cuits contribute to brain function. Skin cells derived from patients have  

**vii**  
**viii** PREFACE 

been transformed into stem cells, and these have been transformed into  

neurons that reveal how cellular functions go awry in diseases and how  

the brain might be repaired. New imaging and computational methods  

now put within reach the dream of creating a “wiring diagram” for the en 

tire brain. A goal for the fourth edition was to make these and other excit 

ing new developments accessible to the fi rst-time neuroscience student.  

We authors are all active neuroscientists, and we want our readers to  

understand the allure of brain research. A unique feature of our book is  

the *Path of Discovery* boxes, in which famous neuroscientists tell stories  

about their own research. These essays serve several purposes: to give a  

fl avor of the thrill of discovery; to show the importance of hard work and  

patience, as well as serendipity and intuition; to reveal the human side  

of science; and to entertain and amuse. We have continued this tradi 

tion in the fourth edition, with contributions from 26 esteemed scientists.  

Included in this illustrious group are Nobel laureates Mario Capecchi,  

Eric Kandel, Leon Cooper, May-Britt Moser, and Edvard Moser.  

**AN OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK**  
 **AN OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK**  

*Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain* surveys the organization and function  

of the human nervous system. We present material at the cutting edge  

of neuroscience in a way that is accessible to both science and nonscience  

students alike. The level of the material is comparable to an introductory  

college text in general biology.  

The book is divided into four parts: Part I, Foundations; Part II, Sensory  

and Motor Systems; Part III, The Brain and Behavior; and Part IV, The  

Changing Brain. We begin Part I by introducing the modern fi eld of neuro 

science and tracing some of its historical antecedents. Then we take a close  

look at the structure and function of individual neurons, how they commu 

nicate chemically, and how these building blocks are arranged to form a  

nervous system. In Part II, we go inside the brain to examine the structure  

and function of the systems that serve the senses and command voluntary  

movements. In Part III, we explore the neurobiology of human behavior,  

including motivation, sex, emotion, sleep, language, attention, and mental  

illness. Finally, in Part IV, we look at how the environment modifi es the  

brain, both during development and in adult learning and memory.  

The human nervous system is examined at several different scales, rang 

ing from the molecules that determine the functional properties of neurons  

to the large systems in the brain that underlie cognition and behavior.  

Many disorders of the human nervous system are introduced as the book  

progresses, usually within the context of the specifi c neural system under  

discussion. Indeed, many insights into the normal functions of neural sys 

tems have come from the study of diseases that cause specifi c malfunctions  

of these systems. In addition, we discuss the actions of drugs and toxins on  

the brain using this information to illustrate how different brain systems  

contribute to behavior and how drugs may alter brain function.  

 **Organization of Part I: Foundations (Chapters 1–7)**  

The goal of Part I is to build a strong base of general knowledge in neurobi 

ology. The chapters should be covered sequentially, although Chapters 1  

and 6 can be skipped without a loss of continuity.  

In Chapter 1, we use an historical approach to review some basic prin 

ciples of nervous system function and then turn to the topic of how neu 

roscience research is conducted today. We directly confront the ethics of  

neuroscience research, particularly that which involves animals.    
PREFACE **ix** 

In Chapter 2, we focus mainly on the cell biology of the neuron. This is  

essential information for students inexperienced in biology, and we fi nd  

that even those with a strong biology background fi nd this review helpful.  

After touring the cell and its organelles, we go on to discuss the structural  

features that make neurons and their supporting cells unique, emphasiz 

ing the correlation of structure and function. We also introduce some of  

the feats of genetic engineering that neuroscientists now use routinely to  

study the functions of different types of nerve cell.  

Chapters 3 and 4 are devoted to the physiology of the neuronal mem 

brane. We cover the essential chemical, physical, and molecular properties  

that enable neurons to conduct electrical signals. We discuss the princi 

ples behind the revolutionary new methods of optogenetics. Throughout  

the chapter, we appeal to students’ intuition by using a commonsense  

approach, with a liberal use of metaphors and real-life analogies.  

Chapters 5 and 6 cover interneuronal communication, particularly  

chemical synaptic transmission. Chapter 5 presents the general prin 

ciples of chemical synaptic transmission, and Chapter 6 discusses the  

neurotransmitters and their modes of action in greater detail. We also  

describe many of the modern methods for studying the chemistry of syn 

aptic transmission. Later chapters do not assume an understanding of  

synaptic transmission at the depth of Chapter 6, however, so this chapter  

can be skipped at the instructor’s discretion. Most coverage of psycho 

pharmacology appears in Chapter 15, after the general organization of  

the brain and its sensory and motor systems have been presented. In our  

experience, students wish to know where, in addition to how, drugs act on  

the nervous system and behavior.  

Chapter 7 covers the gross anatomy of the nervous system. Here we focus  

on the common organizational plan of the mammalian nervous system by  

tracing the brain’s embryological development. (Cellular aspects of develop 

ment are covered in Chapter 23.) We show that the specializations of the  

human brain are simple variations on the basic plan that applies to all mam 

mals. We introduce the cerebral cortex and the new fi eld of connectomics.  

Chapter 7’s appendix, An Illustrated Guide to Human Neuroanatomy,  

covers the surface and cross-sectional anatomy of the brain, the spinal  

cord, the autonomic nervous system, the cranial nerves, and the blood  

supply. A self-quiz will help students learn the terminology. We recom 

mend that students become familiar with the anatomy in the guide before  

moving on to Part II. The coverage of anatomy is selective, emphasizing  

the relationship of structures that will be covered in later chapters. We  

fi nd that students love to learn the anatomy.  

 **Organization of Part II: Sensory and Motor Systems**    
**(Chapters 8–14)**  

Part II surveys the systems within the brain that control sensation and  

movement. In general, these chapters do not need to be covered sequen 

tially, except for Chapters 9 and 10 on vision and Chapters 13 and 14 on  

the control of movement.  

We chose to begin Part II with a discussion of the chemical senses—smell  

and taste—in Chapter 8\. These are good systems for illustrating the gen 

eral principles and problems in the encoding of sensory information, and  

the transduction mechanisms have strong parallels with other systems.  

Chapters 9 and 10 cover the visual system, an essential topic for all  

introductory neuroscience courses. Many details of visual system organi 

zation are presented, illustrating not only the depth of current knowledge  

but also the principles that apply across sensory systems.   
**x** PREFACE 

Chapter 11 explores the auditory system, and Chapter 12 introduces  

the somatic sensory system. Audition and somatic sensation are such  

important parts of everyday life; it is hard to imagine teaching introduc 

tory neuroscience without discussing them. The vestibular sense of bal 

ance is covered in a separate section of Chapter 11\. This placement offers  

 instructors the option to skip the vestibular system at their discretion.  

In Chapters 13 and 14, we discuss the motor systems of the brain.  

Considering how much of the brain is devoted to the control of movement,  

this more extensive treatment is clearly justifi ed. However, we are well  

aware that the complexities of the motor systems are daunting to stu 

dents and instructors alike. We have tried to keep our discussion sharply  

focused, using numerous examples to connect with personal experience.  

 **Organization of Part III: The Brain and Behavior**    
**(Chapters 15–22)**  

Part III explores how different neural systems contribute to different be 

haviors, focusing on the systems where the connection between the brain  

and behavior can be made most strongly. We cover the systems that  

control visceral function and homeostasis, simple motivated behaviors  

such as eating and drinking, sex, mood, emotion, sleep, consciousness,  

language, and attention. Finally, we discuss what happens when these  

 systems fail during mental illness.  

Chapters 15–19 describe a number of neural systems that orchestrate  

widespread responses throughout the brain and the body. In Chapter 15,  

we focus on three systems that are characterized by their broad infl uence  

and their interesting neurotransmitter chemistry: the secretory hypo 

thalamus, the autonomic nervous system, and the diffuse modulatory  

systems of the brain. We discuss how the behavioral manifestations of  

various drugs may result from disruptions of these systems.  

In Chapter 16, we look at the physiological factors that motivate specifi c  

behaviors, focusing mainly on recent research about the control of eating  

habits. We also discuss the role of dopamine in motivation and addiction,  

and we introduce the new fi eld of “neuroeconomics.” Chapter 17 inves 

tigates the infl uence of sex on the brain, and the infl uence of the brain  

on sexual behavior. Chapter 18 examines the neural systems believed to  

underlie emotional experience and expression, specifi cally emphasizing  

fear and anxiety, anger, and aggression.  

In Chapter 19, we investigate the systems that give rise to the rhythms of  

the brain, ranging from the rapid electrical rhythms during sleep and wake 

fulness to the slow circadian rhythms controlling hormones, temperature,  

alertness, and metabolism. We next explore aspects of brain processing  

that are highly developed in the human brain. Chapter 20 investigates the  

neural basis of language and Chapter 21 discusses changes in brain activity  

associated with rest, attention, and consciousness. Part III ends with a dis 

cussion of mental illness in Chapter 22\. We introduce the promise of molecu 

lar medicine to develop new treatments for serious psychiatric disorders.  

 **Organization of Part IV: The Changing Brain**    
**(Chapters 23–25)**  

Part IV explores the cellular and molecular basis of brain development  

and learning and memory. These subjects represent two of the most excit 

ing frontiers of modern neuroscience.  

Chapter 23 examines the mechanisms used during brain development  

to ensure that the correct connections are made between neurons. The  

cellular aspects of development are discussed here rather than in Part I   
PREFACE **xi** 

for several reasons. First, by this point in the book, students fully appre 

ciate that normal brain function depends on its precise wiring. Because  

we use the visual system as a concrete example, the chapter must also  

follow a discussion of the visual pathways in Part II. Second, we survey  

aspects of experience-dependent development of the visual system that  

are regulated by behavioral state, so this chapter is placed after the early  

chapters of Part III. Finally, an exploration of the role of the sensory  

environment in brain development in Chapter 23 is followed in the next  

two chapters by discussions of how experience-dependent modifi cations  

of the brain form the basis for learning and memory. We see that many of  

the mechanisms are similar, illustrating the unity of biology.  

Chapters 24 and 25 cover learning and memory. Chapter 24 focuses on  

the anatomy of memory, exploring how different parts of the brain con 

tribute to the storage of different types of information. Chapter 25 takes  

a deeper look into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of learning and  

memory, focusing on changes in synaptic connections.  

**HELPING STUDENTS LEARN**  
**HELPING STUDENTS LEARN**  

*Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain* is not an exhaustive study. It is  

intended to be a readable textbook that communicates to students the  

important principles of neuroscience clearly and effectively. To help stu 

dents learn neuroscience, we include a number of features designed to  

enhance comprehension:  

• **Chapter Outlines and Introductory and Concluding Remarks.** 

These elements preview the organization of each chapter, set the stage,  

and place the material into broader perspective.  

• **Of Special Interest Boxes.** These boxes are designed to illuminate  

the relevance of the material to the students’ everyday lives.  

• **Brain Food Boxes.** More advanced material that might be optional  

in many introductory courses is set aside for students who want to go  

deeper.  

• **Path of Discovery Boxes.** These essays, written by leading research 

ers, demonstrate a broad range of discoveries and the combination of  

hard work and serendipity that led to them. These boxes both personal 

ize scientifi c exploration and deepen the reader’s understanding of the  

chapter material and its implications. 

• **Key Terms and Glossary**. Neuroscience has a language of its own,  

and to comprehend it, one must learn the vocabulary. In the text of  

each chapter, important terms are highlighted in boldface type. To fa 

cilitate review, these terms appear in a list at the end of each chapter  

in the order in which they appeared in the text, along with page ref 

erences. The same terms are assembled at the end of the book, with  

defi nitions, in a glossary.  

• **Review Questions.** At the end of each chapter, a brief set of ques 

tions for review are specifi cally designed to provoke thought and help  

students integrate the material.  

• **Further Reading.** We include a list of several recent review articles  

at the end of each chapter to guide study beyond the scope of the  

textbook.  

• **Internal Reviews of Neuroanatomical Terms.** In Chapter 7, where  

nervous system anatomy is discussed, the narrative is interrupted  

periodically with brief self-quiz vocabulary reviews to enhance under 

standing. In Chapter 7’s appendix, an extensive self-quiz is provided in  

the form of a workbook with labeling exercises.    
**xii** PREFACE 

• **References and Resources.** At the end of the book, we provide  

selected readings and online resources that will lead students into the  

research literature associated with each chapter. Rather than includ 

ing citations in the body of the chapters, where they would compro 

mise the readability of the text, we have organized the references and  

 resources by chapter and listed them at the end of the book.  

• **Full-Color Illustrations.** We believe in the power of illustrations—not  

those that “speak a thousand words” but those that each make a single  

point. The fi rst edition of this book set a new standard for illustrations  

in a neuroscience text. The fourth edition refl ects improvements in the  

pedagogical design of many fi gures from earlier editions and includes  

many superb new illustrations as well.

 Sequencing the human genome was a truly monumen tal achievement, completed in 2003\. The Human Genome  Project identifi ed all of the approximately 25,000 genes in

human DNA. We now live in what has been called the “post genomic era,” in which information about the genes ex   
pressed in our tissues can be used to diagnose and treat  diseases. Neuroscientists are using this information to tackle  long-standing questions about the biological basis of neuro   
logical and psychiatric disorders as well as to probe deeper  into the origins of individuality. The logic goes as follows. The  brain is a product of the genes expressed in it. Differences  in gene expression between a normal brain and a diseased  brain, or a brain of unusual ability, can be used to identify the  molecular basis of the observed symptoms or traits.    
The level of gene expression is usually defi ned as the  number of mRNA transcripts synthesized by different cells  and tissues to direct the synthesis of specifi c proteins. Thus,  the analysis of gene expression requires comparing the rela   
tive abundance of various mRNAs in the brains of two groups

One way to perform such a compari son is to use DNA *microarrays*, which are created by robotic  machines that arrange thousands of small spots of synthetic  DNA on a microscope slide. Each spot contains a unique  DNA sequence that will recognize and stick to a different spe

BOX 16.2 **OF SPECIAL INTEREST Marijuana and the Munchies** 

**Of Special Interest Boxes** Wondering how key concepts  

A well-known consequence of marijuana intoxica tion is stimulation of appetite, an effect known by users  as “the munchies.” The active ingredient in marijuana is  D9\-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which alters neuronal func   
tions by stimulating a receptor called cannabinoid receptor  1 (CB1). CB1 receptors are abundant throughout the brain,  so it is overly simplistic to view these receptors as serving  only appetite regulation. Nevertheless, “medical marijuana” is  often prescribed (where legal) as a means to stimulate ap   
petite in patients with chronic diseases, such as cancer and  AIDS. A compound that inhibits CB1 receptors, rimonabant,  was also developed as an appetite suppressant. However,  human drug trials had to be discontinued because of psy   
chiatric side effects. Although this fi nding underscores the  fact that these receptors do much more than mediate the  munchies, it is still of interest to know where in the brain CB1  receptors act to stimulate appetite. Not surprisingly, the CB1  receptors are associated with neurons in many regions of the  brain that control feeding, such as the hypothalamus, and  some of the orexigenic effects of THC are related to changing  the activity of these neurons. However, neuroscientists were  surprised to learn in 2014 that much of the appetite stimula   
tion comes from enhancing the sense of smell, at least in    
mice. Collaborative research conducted by neuroscientists in  France and Spain, countries incidentally known for their ap   
preciation of good tastes and smells, revealed that activation  of CB1 receptors in the olfactory bulb increases odor detec tion and is necessary for the increase in food intake stimu   
lated in hungry mice by cannabinoids.   
In Chapter 8, we discussed how smells activate neurons  in the olfactory bulb which, in turn, relay information to the ol   
factory cortex. The cortex also sends feedback projections to  the bulb that synapse on inhibitory interneurons called *gran ule cells*. By activating the inhibitory granule cells, this feed   
back from the cortex dampens ascending olfactory activity.  These corticofugal synapses use glutamate as a neurotrans   
mitter. The brain’s own endocannabinoids (anandamide and  2-arachidonoylglycerol) are synthesized under fasting condi   
tions, and they inhibit glutamate release by acting on CB1  receptors on the corticofugal axon terminals. Reducing gran   
ule cell activation by glutamate in the bulb has the net effect  of enhancing the sense of smell (Figure A). It remains to be  determined if the munchies arise from enhanced olfaction in  marijuana users, but a simple experiment, such as holding  your nose while eating, confi rms that much of the hedonic  value of food derives from the sense of smell.   
appear in the real world? These boxes complement the text by showing some of the more prac tical applications of concepts.  

Topics include brain disorders,  human case studies, drugs, new  technology, and more.

 How did I fi rst get the idea to pursue gene targeting in  mice? From a simple observation. Mike Wigler, now at Cold  Spring Harbor Laboratory, and Richard Axel, at Columbia  University, had published a paper in 1979 showing that ex   
posing mammalian cells to a mixture of DNA and calcium  phosphate would cause some cells to take up the DNA in  functional form and express the encoded genes. This was  exciting because they had clearly demonstrated that exog   
enous, functional DNA could be introduced into mammalian  cells. But I wondered why their effi ciency was so low. Was it  a problem of delivery, insertion of exogenous DNA into the  chromosome, or expression of the genes once inserted into  the host chromosome? What would happen if purifi ed DNA  was directly injected into the nucleus of mammalian cells in  culture?    
To fi nd out, I converted a colleague’s electrophysiology  station into a miniature hypodermic needle to directly inject  DNA into the nucleus of a living cell using mechanical micro   
manipulators and light microscopy (Figure A). The procedure  worked with amazing effi ciency (Capecchi, 1980). With this  method, the frequency of successful integration was now  one in three cells rather than one in a million cells as for   
merly. This high effi ciency directly led to the development  

of transgenic mice through the injection and random inte gration of exogenous DNA into chromosomes of fertilized  mouse eggs, or zygotes. To achieve the high effi ciency of  expression of the exogenous DNA in the recipient cell, I had  to attach small fragments of viral DNA, which we now un   
derstand to contain enhancers that are critical in eukaryotic  gene expression.    
But what fascinated me most was our observation that  when many copies of a gene were injected into a cell nucleus,  all of these molecules ended up in an ordered head-to-tail  arrangement, called a *concatemer* (Figure B). This was as   
tonishing and could not have occurred as a random event.  We went on to unequivocally prove that homologous recom   
bination, the process by which chromosomes share genetic  information during cell division, was responsible for the in   
corporation of the foreign DNA (Folger et al., 1982). These  experiments demonstrated that all mammalian somatic cells  contain a very effi cient machinery for swapping segments of  DNA that have similar sequences of nucleotides. Injection of  a thousand copies of a gene sequence into the nucleus of a  cell resulted in chromosomal insertion of a concatemer con   
taining a thousand copies of that sequence, all oriented in  the same direction. This simple observation directly led me to

**KEY TERMS** Introduction    
the anatomical study of brain cells had to await a method to harden the  tissue without disturbing its structure and an instrument that could  produce very thin slices. Early in the nineteenth century, scientists dis covered how to harden, or “fi x,” tissues by immersing them in formalde   
hyde, and they developed a special device called a *microtome* to make  very thin slices.    
These technical advances spawned the fi eld of **histology**, the micro scopic study of the structure of tissues. But scientists studying brain  structure faced yet another obstacle. Freshly prepared brain tissue has  a uniform, cream-colored appearance under the microscope, with no  differences in pigmentation to enable histologists to resolve individual  cells. The fi nal breakthrough in neurohistology was the introduction of  stains that selectively color some, but not all, parts of the cells in brain  tissue.    
One stain still used today was introduced by the German neurologist  Franz Nissl in the late nineteenth century. Nissl showed that a class of  basic dyes would stain the nuclei of all cells as well as clumps of material  surrounding the nuclei of neurons (Figure 2.1). These clumps are called  *Nissl bodies*, and the stain is known as the **Nissl stain**. The Nissl stain is  extremely useful for two reasons: It distinguishes between neurons and  glia, and it enables histologists to study the arrangement, or **cytoarchi**   
**tecture**, of neurons in different parts of the brain. (The prefi x *cyto-* is  from the Greek word for “cell.”) The study of cytoarchitecture led to the  realization that the brain consists of many specialized regions. We now  know that each region performs a different function.    
**The Nucleus.** Its name derived from the Latin word for “nut,” the **nucleus** of the cell is spherical, centrally located, and about 5–10  m across. It  is contained within a double membrane called the *nuclear envelope*. The  nuclear envelope is perforated by pores about 0.1  m across.    
Within the nucleus are **chromosomes** which contain the genetic ma terial **DNA** ( **deoxyribonucleic acid**). Your DNA was passed on to you  from your parents and it contains the blueprint for your entire body. The  DNA in each of your neurons is the same, and it is the same as the DNA  in the cells of your liver and kidney and other organs. What distinguishes  a neuron from a liver cell are the specifi c parts of the DNA that are used  to assemble the cell. These segments of DNA are called **genes** .    
Each chromosome contains an uninterrupted double-strand braid of  DNA, 2 nm wide. If the DNA from the 46 human chromosomes were laid  out straight, end to end, it would measure more than 2 m in length. If we  were to compare this total length of DNA to the total string of letters that  make up this book, the genes would be analogous to the individual words.  Genes are from 0.1 to several micrometers in length.    
The “reading” of the DNA is known as **gene expression**. The fi nal  product of gene expression is the synthesis of molecules called **proteins** ,  which exist in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, perform many different  functions, and bestow upon neurons virtually all of their unique charac   
teristics. **Protein synthesis**, the assembly of protein molecules, occurs  in the cytoplasm. Because the DNA never leaves the nucleus, an interme   
diary must carry the genetic message to the sites of protein synthesis in  the cytoplasm. This function is performed by another long molecule called

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 

Back in 1993, when we began in earnest to write the fi rst edition of this  

textbook, we had the good fortune to work closely with a remarkably  

dedicated and talented group of individuals—Betsy Dilernia, Caitlin and  

Rob Duckwall, and Suzanne Meagher—who helped us bring the book to  

fruition. Betsy continued as our developmental editor for the fi rst three  

editions. We attribute much of our success to her extraordinary efforts  

to improve the clarity and consistency of the writing and the layout of  

the book. Betsy’s well-deserved retirement caused considerable conster 

nation among the author team, but good fortune struck again with the  

recruitment of Tom Lochhaas for this new edition. Tom, an accomplished  

author himself, shares Betsy’s attention to detail and challenged us to not  

rest on our laurels. We are proud of the fourth edition and very grateful to  

Tom for holding us to a high standard of excellence. We would be remiss  

for not thanking him also for his good cheer and patience despite a chal 

lenging schedule and occasionally distracted authors.  

It is noteworthy that despite the passage of time— *21 years\!*—we were  

able to continue working with Caitlin, Rob, and Suzanne in this edition.  

Caitlin’s and Rob’s Dragonfl y Media Group produced the art, with help  

and coordination from Jennifer Clements, and the results speak for them 

selves. The artists took our sometimes fuzzy concepts and made them a  

beautiful reality. The quality of the art has always been a high priority  

for the authors, and we are very pleased that they have again delivered  

an art program that ensures we will continue to enjoy the distinction of  

having produced the most richly illustrated neuroscience textbook in the  

world. Finally, we are forever indebted to Suzanne, who assisted us at  

every step. Without her incredible assistance, loyalty, and dedication to  

this project, the book would never have been completed. That statement  

is as true today as it was in 1993\. Suzanne, you are—still—the best\!  

For the current edition, we have the pleasure of acknowledging a new  

team member, Linda Francis. Linda is an editorial project manager at  

Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, and she worked closely with us from start  

to fi nish, helping us to meet a demanding schedule. Her effi ciency, fl ex 

ibility, and good humor are all greatly appreciated. Linda, it has been a  

pleasure working with you.  

In the publishing industry, editors seem to come and go with alarming  

frequency. Yet one senior editor at Lippincott Williams & Wilkins stayed  

the course and continued to be an unwavering advocate for our project:  

Emily Lupash. We thank you Emily and the entire staff under your direc 

tion for your patience and determination to get this edition published.  

We again would like to acknowledge the architects and current trustees  

of the undergraduate neuroscience curriculum at Brown University. We  

thank Mitchell Glickstein, Ford Ebner, James McIlwain, Leon Cooper,  

James Anderson, Leslie Smith, John Donoghue, Bob Patrick, and  

John Stein for all they did to make undergraduate neuroscience great  

at Brown. Similarly, we thank Sebastian Seung and Monica Linden  

for their innovative contributions to introductory neuroscience at the  

Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Monica, who is now on the faculty

helped us to improve the new edition by informing us about recent re 

search, pointing out errors in earlier editions, and suggesting better ways  

to describe or illustrate concepts. Special thanks to Peter Kind of the  

University of Edinburgh and Weifeng Xu of MIT.  

We are very grateful to our many colleagues who contributed “Path of

We thank our loved ones, not only for standing by us as countless week 

ends and evenings were spent preparing this book, but also for their  

 encouragement and helpful suggestions for improving it.  

Finally, we wish to thank the thousands of students we have had the  

privilege to teach neuroscience over the past 35 years.

axons. Axons are the “wires” of the nervous system and conduct electrical  

impulses generated by brain cells. Thus, this image reveals some of the  

paths of long-range communication between different parts of the brain.  

The image, acquired at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical  

Imaging at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was processed  

by a computer algorithm to display bundles of axons traveling together  

as pseudo-colored noodles. The colors vary depending on the direction of  

water diffusion. (Source: Courtesy of Satrajit Ghosh and John Gabrieli,

**Part One Chapter Opener: Neurons and their neurites.** Serial  

images were taken using an electron microscope of a small piece of the  

retina as thin slices were shaved off. Then, a computer algorithm, aided  

by thousands of people worldwide playing an online game called EyeWire,  

reconstructed each neuron and their synaptic connections—the “connec 

tome” of this volume of tissue. In this image, the neurons are pseudo 

colored by the computer, and their neurites, the axons and dendrites from  

each cell, are displayed in their entirety. (Source: Courtesy of Sebastian  

Seung, Princeton University, and Kris Krug, Pop Tech.) 

**Part Two Chapter Opener: The mouse cerebral cortex.** The cere 

bral cortex lies just under the skull. It is critical for conscious sensory  

perception and voluntary control of movement. The major subcortical  

input to the cortex arises from the thalamus, a structure that lies deep  

inside the brain. Stained red are thalamic axons that bring to the cortex  

information about the whiskers on the animal’s snout. These are clus 

tered into “barrels” that each represent a single whisker. The neurons  

that project axons back to the thalamus have been genetically engineered  

to fl uoresce green. Blue indicates the nuclei of other cells stained with a  

DNA marker. (Source: Courtesy of Shane Crandall, Saundra Patrick, and

becomes apparent during adolescence or early adulthood and persists for  

life. Symptoms may arise in part from shrinkage of specifi c parts of the  

brain, including the cerebral cortex. High-resolution magnetic resonance  

imaging of the brains of adolescents with schizophrenia has been used  

to track the location and progression of tissue loss. In this image, the  

regions of gray matter loss are color coded. Severe tissue loss, up to 5%  

annually, is indicated in red and pink. Regions colored blue are relatively  

stable over time. (Source: Courtesy of Arthur Toga and Paul Thompson,

**Part Four Chapter Opener: Neurons of the hippocampus.** The hip 

pocampus is a brain structure that is critical for our ability to form memo 

ries. One way that information is stored in the brain is by modifi cation of  

synapses, the specialized junctions between the axons of one neuron and  

the dendrites of another. Synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus has been  

studied to reveal the molecular basis of memory formation. This image  

shows the neurites of a subset of hippocampal neurons using a time hon 

ored method introduced in 1873 by Italian scientist Emilio Golgi. (Source:

**INTRODUCTION** 

*Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain come joys, delights,*  

*laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations.*  

*And by this, in an especial manner, we acquire wisdom and knowledge,*  

*and see and hear and know what are foul and what are fair, what are*  

*bad and what are good, what are sweet and what are unsavory. . . . And*  

*by the same organ we become mad and delirious, and fears and terrors*  

*assail us. . . . All these things we endure from the brain when it is not*  

*healthy. . . . In these ways I am of the opinion that the brain exercises the*  

*greatest power in the man.* 

—Hippocrates, *On the Sacred Disease* (Fourth century B.C.E.) 

It is human nature to be curious about how we see and hear; why some  

things feel good and others hurt; how we move; how we reason, learn, re 

member, and forget; and the nature of anger and madness. Neuroscience  

research is unraveling these mysteries, and the conclusions of this re 

search are the subject of this textbook. 

The word “neuroscience” is young. The Society for Neuroscience, an  

association of professional neuroscientists, was founded only relatively  

recently in 1970\. The study of the brain, however, is as old as science  

itself. Historically, the scientists who devoted themselves to an under 

standing of the nervous system came from different scientifi c disciplines:  

medicine, biology, psychology, physics, chemistry, mathematics. The  

neuroscience revolution occurred when scientists realized that the best  

hope for understanding the workings of the brain would come from an  

interdisciplinary approach, a combination of traditional approaches to  

yield a new synthesis, a new perspective. Most people involved in the  

scientifi c investigation of the nervous system today regard themselves  

as neuroscientists. Indeed, while the course you are now taking may be  

sponsored by the psychology or biology department at your university or  

college and may be called biopsychology or neurobiology, you can bet that  

your instructor is a neuroscientist. 

The Society for Neuroscience is one of the largest and fastest growing  

associations of professional scientists. Far from being overly specialized,  

the fi eld is as broad as nearly all of natural science, with the nervous  

system serving as the common point of focus. Understanding how the  

brain works requires knowledge about many things, from the structure of  

the water molecule to the electrical and chemical properties of the brain  

to why Pavlov’s dog salivated when a bell rang. This book explores the  

brain with this broad perspective. 

We begin the adventure with a brief tour of neuroscience. What have  

scientists thought about the brain over the ages? Who are the neuroscien 

tists of today, and how do they approach studying the brain? 

**THE ORIGINS OF NEUROSCIENCE**   
**THE ORIGINS OF NEUROSCIENCE**

You probably already know that the nervous system—the brain, spinal  

cord, and nerves of the body—is crucial for life and enables you to sense,  

move, and think. How did this view arise? 

Evidence suggests that even our prehistoric ancestors appreciated that  

the brain was vital to life. The archeological record includes many homi 

nid skulls, dating back a million years and more, that bear signs of fatal  

cranial damage likely infl icted by other hominids. As early as 7000 years  

ago, people were boring holes in each other’s skulls (a process called    
**CHAPTER 1** NEUROSCIENCE: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE **5** 

 *trepanation*), evidently with the aim not to kill but to cure (Figure 1.1).  

These skulls show signs of healing after the operation, indicating that  

this procedure had been carried out on live subjects rather than being  

a ritual conducted after death. Some individuals apparently survived  

multiple skull surgeries. What those early surgeons hoped to accomplish  

is not clear, although it has been speculated that this procedure may have  

been used to treat headaches or mental disorders, perhaps by giving the  

evil spirits an escape route. 

Recovered writings from the physicians of ancient Egypt, dating back  

almost 5000 years, indicate that they were well aware of many symp 

toms of brain damage. However, it is also very clear that the heart, not  

the brain, was considered to be the seat of the soul and the repository of  

memories. Indeed, while the rest of the body was carefully preserved for  

the afterlife, the brain of the deceased was simply scooped out through  

the nostrils and discarded\! The view that the heart was the seat of con sciousness and thought was not seriously challenged until the time of  Hippocrates. 

**Views of the Brain in Ancient Greece** 

Consider the idea that the different parts of your body look different  because they serve different purposes. The structures of the feet and  hands are very different, for example, because they perform very dif ferent functions: We walk on our feet and manipulate objects with  our hands. Thus, there appears to be a very clear *correlation between  structure and function*. Differences in appearance predict differences  in function. 

What can we glean about function from the structure of the head?  Quick inspection and a few simple experiments (like closing your eyes)  reveal that the head is specialized for sensing the environment with the  eyes and ears, nose, and tongue. Even crude dissection can trace the  nerves from these organs through the skull into the brain. What would  you conclude about the brain from these observations? 

If your answer is that the brain is the organ of sensation, then you  have reached the same conclusion as several Greek scholars of the  fourth century B.C.E. The most infl uential scholar was Hippocrates  (460–379 B.C.E.), the father of Western medicine, who believed that  the brain was not only involved in sensation but was also the seat of  intelligence. 

This view was not universally accepted, however. The famous Greek  philosopher Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) clung to the belief that the heart  was the center of intellect. What function did Aristotle reserve for the  brain? He believed it was a radiator for cooling blood that was overheated  by the seething heart. The rational temperament of humans was thus  explained by the large cooling capacity of our brain. 

**Views of the Brain During the Roman Empire** 

The most important fi gure in Roman medicine was the Greek physician  and writer Galen (130–200 C.E.), who embraced the Hippocratic view of  brain function. As physician to the gladiators, he must have witnessed  the unfortunate consequences of spine and brain injuries. However,  Galen’s opinions about the brain were probably infl uenced more by his  many careful animal dissections. Figure 1.2 is a drawing of the brain of  a sheep, one of Galen’s favorite subjects. Two major parts are evident:  the *cerebrum* in the front and the *cerebellum* in the back. (The structure  of the brain is described in Chapter 7.) Just as we can deduce function

alive. The arrows indicate two sites of  trepanation. (Source: Alt et al., 1997,  Fig. 1a.)

from the structure of the hands and feet, Galen tried to deduce func 

tion from the structure of the cerebrum and the cerebellum. Poking the  

freshly dissected brain with a fi nger reveals the cerebellum is rather hard    
Ventricles ▲ FIGURE 1.3   
**A dissected sheep brain showing the  ventricles.**  
and the cerebrum rather soft. From this observation, Galen suggested  that the cerebrum must receive sensations while the cerebellum must  command the muscles. Why such a distinction? He recognized that to  form memories, sensations must be imprinted in the brain. Naturally,  this must occur in the doughy cerebrum. 

As improbable as his reasoning may seem, Galen’s deductions were  not that far from the truth. The cerebrum, in fact, is largely concerned  with sensation and perception, and the cerebellum is primarily a move ment control center. Moreover, the cerebrum is a repository of memory.  We will see that this is not the only example in the history of neuro science in which the right general conclusions were reached for the  wrong reasons. 

How does the brain receive sensations and move the limbs? Galen cut  open the brain and found that it is hollow (Figure 1.3). In these hollow  spaces, called *ventricles* (like the similar chambers in the heart), there is  fl uid. To Galen, this discovery fi t perfectly with the prevailing theory that  the body functioned according to a balance of four vital fl uids, or humors.  Sensations were registered and movements initiated by the movement of  humors to or from the brain ventricles via the nerves, which were believed  to be hollow tubes, like the blood vessels. 

**Views of the Brain from the Renaissance to the  Nineteenth Century** 

Galen’s view of the brain prevailed for almost 1500 years. During  the Renaissance, the great anatomist Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564)  added more detail to the structure of the brain (Figure 1.4). However,  the ventricular theory of brain function remained essentially un 

challenged. Indeed, the whole concept was strengthened in the early  seventeenth century, when French inventors built hydraulically con trolled mechanical devices. These devices supported the notion that  the brain could be machinelike in its function: Fluid forced out of the  ventricles through the nerves might literally “pump you up” and cause  the movement of the limbs. After all, don’t the muscles bulge when  they contract? 

▲FIGURE 1.4

is from *De humani corporis fabrica* by    
Vesalius (1543). The subject was proba

was taken to be anatomically correct in    
depicting the ventricles. (Source: Finger,

▲FIGURE 1.5   
**The brain according to Descartes.**    
This drawing appeared in a 1662    
publication by Descartes, who thought    
that hollow nerves from the eyes    
projected to the brain ventricles. The    
mind influenced the motor response by    
controlling the pineal gland (H), which    
worked like a valve to control the    
movement of animal spirits through the    
nerves that inflated the muscles.    
(Source: Finger, 1994, Fig. 2.16.)

A chief advocate of this fl uid–mechanical theory of brain func 

tion was the French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes  

(1596–1650). Although he thought this theory could explain the brain  

and behavior of other animals, Descartes believed it could not possi 

bly account for the full range of *human* behavior. He reasoned that  

unlike other animals, people possess intellect and a God-given soul.  

Thus, Descartes proposed that brain mechanisms control only human  

behavior that is like that of the beasts. Uniquely human mental capa 

bilities exist outside the brain in the “mind.” Descartes believed that  

the mind is a spiritual entity that receives sensations and commands  

movements by communicating with the machinery of the brain via the  

pineal gland (Figure 1.5). Today, some people still believe that there  

is a “mind–brain problem,” that somehow the human mind is distinct  

from the brain. However, as we shall see in Part III, modern neurosci 

ence research supports a different conclusion: The mind has a physical  

basis, which is the brain. 

Fortunately, other scientists during the seventeenth and eighteenth  

centuries broke away from the traditional focus on the ventricles and  

began examining the brain’s substance more closely. They observed, for  example, two types of brain tissue: the *gray matter* and the *white matter* (Figure 1.6). What structure–function relationship did they propose?  White matter, because it was continuous with the nerves of the body, was  correctly believed to contain the fi bers that bring information to and from  the gray matter. 

By the end of the eighteenth century, the nervous system had been  completely dissected and its gross anatomy described in detail. Scientists  recognized that the nervous system has a central division, consisting of  the brain and spinal cord, and a peripheral division, consisting of the  network of nerves that course through the body (Figure 1.7). An impor 

tant breakthrough in neuroanatomy came with the observation that the  same general pattern of bumps (called *gyri*) and grooves (called *sulci* and  *fi ssures*) can be identifi ed on the surface of the brain in every individual  (Figure 1.8). This pattern, which enables the parceling of the cerebrum  into *lobes*, led to speculation that different functions might be localized  to the different bumps on the brain. The stage was now set for the era of  cerebral localization.

marks can be found on all human brains.

**Nineteenth-Century Views of the Brain** 

Let’s review how the nervous system was understood at the end of the  

eighteenth century: 

• Injury to the brain can disrupt sensations, movement, and thought and  

can cause death. 

• The brain communicates with the body via the nerves. 

• The brain has different identifi able parts, which probably perform  

 different functions. 

• The brain operates like a machine and follows the laws of nature. 

During the next 100 years, more would be learned about the function of  

the brain than had been learned in all of previous recorded history. This  

work provided the solid foundation on which modern neuroscience rests.  

Now we’ll look at four key insights gained during the nineteenth century.   
**CHAPTER 1** NEUROSCIENCE: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE **9** 

**Nerves as Wires.** In 1751, Benjamin Franklin published a pamphlet  

 titled *Experiments and Observations on Electricity*, which heralded a new  

understanding of electrical phenomena. By the turn of the century, Italian  

scientist Luigi Galvani and German biologist Emil du Bois-Reymond had  

shown that muscles can be caused to twitch when nerves are stimulated  

electrically and that the brain itself can generate electricity. These discov 

eries fi nally displaced the notion that nerves communicate with the brain  

by the movement of fl uid. The new concept was that the nerves are “wires”  

that conduct electrical signals to and from the brain. 

Unresolved was whether the signals to the muscles causing move 

ment use the same wires as those that register sensations from the skin.  

Bidirectional communication along the same wires was suggested by  

the observation that when a nerve in the body is cut, there is usually a  

loss of both sensation and movement in the affected region. However, it  

was also known that within each nerve of the body there are many thin  

 fi laments, or *nerve fi bers*, each one of which could serve as an individual  

wire carrying information in a different direction. 

This question was answered around 1810 by Scottish physician  

Charles Bell and French physiologist François Magendie. A curious ana 

tomical fact is that just before the nerves attach to the spinal cord, the  

fi bers divide into two branches, or roots. The dorsal root enters toward  

the back of the spinal cord, and the ventral root enters toward the front  

(Figure 1.9). Bell tested the possibility that these two spinal roots carry  

information in different directions by cutting each root separately and  

observing the consequences in experimental animals. He found that cut 

ting only the ventral roots caused muscle paralysis. Later, Magendie was  

able to show that the dorsal roots carry sensory information into the spi 

nal cord. Bell and Magendie concluded that within each nerve is a mix 

ture of many wires, some of which bring information into the brain and  

spinal cord and others that send information out to the muscles. In each

**Spinal nerves and spinal nerve roots.**  Thirty-one pairs of nerves leave the spinal  cord to supply the skin and the muscles.  Cutting a spinal nerve leads to a loss of  sensation and a loss of movement in the  affected region of the body. Incoming  sensory fibers (*red* ) and outgoing motor  fibers (*blue*) divide into spinal roots where  the nerves attach to the spinal cord. Bell  and Magendie found that the ventral roots  contain only motor fibers and the dorsal  roots contain only sensory fibers.  
**10 PART ONE** FOUNDATIONS 

sensory and motor nerve fi ber, transmission is strictly one-way. The two  

kinds of fibers are bundled together for most of their length, but they are  

anatomically segregated where they enter or exit the spinal cord. 

**Localization of Specifi c Functions to Different Parts of the Brain.** If dif 

ferent functions are localized in different spinal roots, then perhaps dif 

ferent functions are also localized in different parts of the brain. In 1811,  

Bell proposed that the origin of the motor fi bers is the cerebellum and the  

destination of the sensory fi bers is the cerebrum. 

How would you test this proposal? One way is to use the same approach  

that Bell and Magendie employed to identify the functions of the spinal  

roots: to destroy these parts of the brain and test for sensory and motor  

defi cits. This approach, in which parts of the brain are systematically  

destroyed to determine their function, is called the *experimental ablation*  

*method*. In 1823, the esteemed French physiologist Marie-Jean-Pierre  

▲ FIGURE 1.10   
**A phrenological map.** According to Gall  and his followers, different behavioral  traits could be related to the size of  different parts of the skull. (Source:  Clarke and O’Malley, 1968, Fig. 118.) 

▲ FIGURE 1.11   
**Paul Broca (1824–1880).** By carefully  studying the brain of a man who had  lost the faculty of speech after a brain  lesion (see Figure 1.12), Broca became  convinced that different functions could  be localized to different parts of the  cerebrum. (Source: Clarke and O’Malley,  1968, Fig. 121.)  
Flourens used this method in a variety of animals (particularly birds) to  show that the cerebellum does indeed play a role in the coordination of  movement. He also concluded that the cerebrum is involved in sensation  and perception, as Bell and Galen before him had suggested. Unlike his  predecessors, however, Flourens provided solid experimental support for  his conclusions. 

What about all those bumps on the brain’s surface? Do they perform  different functions as well? The idea that they do was irresistible to a  young Austrian medical student named Franz Joseph Gall. Believing  that bumps on the surface of the skull refl ect bumps on the surface of  the brain, Gall proposed in 1809 that the propensity for certain personal 

ity traits, such as generosity, secretiveness, and destructiveness, could  be related to the dimensions of the head (Figure 1.10). To support his  claim, Gall and his followers collected and carefully measured the skulls  of hundreds of people representing an extensive range of personality  types, from the very gifted to the criminally insane. This new “science”  of correlating the structure of the head with personality traits was called  *phrenology*. Although the claims of the phrenologists were never taken  seriously by the mainstream scientifi c community, they did capture the  popular imagination of the time. In fact, a textbook on phrenology pub 

lished in 1827 sold over 100,000 copies. 

One of the most vociferous critics of phrenology was Flourens, the same  man who had shown experimentally that the cerebellum and cerebrum  perform different functions. His grounds for criticism were sound. For one  thing, the shape of the skull is not correlated with the shape of the brain.  In addition, Flourens performed experimental ablations showing that  particular traits are not isolated to the portions of the cerebrum specifi ed  by phrenology. Flourens also maintained, however, that all regions of the  cerebrum participate equally in all cerebral functions, a conclusion later  shown to be erroneous. 

The person usually credited with tilting the scales of scientifi c opinion  fi rmly toward localization of functions in the cerebrum was French neu rologist Paul Broca (Figure 1.11). Broca was presented with a patient who  could understand language but could not speak. After the man’s death in  1861, Broca carefully examined his brain and found a lesion in the left  frontal lobe (Figure 1.12). Based on this case and several others like it,  Broca concluded that this region of the human cerebrum was specifi cally  responsible for the production of speech. 

Solid experimental support for cerebral localization in animals quickly  followed. German physiologists Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig showed  in 1870 that applying small electrical currents to a circumscribed region    
**CHAPTER 1** NEUROSCIENCE: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE **11** 

of the exposed surface of the brain of a dog could elicit discrete move ments. Scottish neurologist David Ferrier repeated these experiments  with monkeys. In 1881, he showed that removal of this same region of the  cerebrum causes paralysis of the muscles. Similarly, German physiolo gist Hermann Munk using experimental ablation found evidence that the  

occipital lobe of the cerebrum was specifi cally required for vision. As you will see in Part II of this book, we now know that there is a very  clear division of labor in the cerebrum, with different parts performing  very different functions. Today’s maps of the functional divisions of the  cerebrum rival even the most elaborate of those produced by the phre nologists. The big difference is that unlike the phrenologists, scientists  today require solid experimental evidence before attributing a specifi c  function to a portion of the brain. All the same, Gall seems to have had  in part the right general idea. It is natural to wonder why Flourens, the  pioneer of brain localization of function, was misled into believing that  the cerebrum acted as a whole and could not be subdivided. This gifted  experimentalist may have missed cerebral localization for many different  reasons, but it seems clear that one reason was his visceral disdain for  Gall and phrenology. He could not bring himself to agree even remotely  with Gall, whom he viewed as a lunatic. This reminds us that science,  for better or worse, was and still is subject to both the strengths and the  weaknesses of human nature. 

**The Evolution of Nervous Systems.** In 1859, English biologist Charles  Darwin (Figure 1.13) published *On the Origin of Species*. This landmark  work articulates a theory of evolution: that species of organisms evolved  from a common ancestor. According to his theory, differences among  species arise by a process Darwin called *natural selection*. As a result  of the mechanisms of reproduction, the physical traits of the offspring  are sometimes different from those of the parents. If such traits hold an  advantage for survival, the offspring themselves will be more likely to  survive to reproduce, thus increasing the likelihood that the advanta 

geous traits are passed on to the next generation. Over the course of many  generations, this process led to the development of traits that distinguish  species today: fl ippers on harbor seals, paws on dogs, hands on raccoons,  and so on. This single insight revolutionized biology. Today, scientifi c evi 

dence in many fi elds ranging from anthropology to molecular genetics  overwhelmingly supports the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin included behavior among the heritable traits that could evolve.  For example, he observed that many mammalian species show the same  reaction when frightened: The pupils of the eyes get bigger, the heart  races, hairs stand on end. This is as true for a human as it is for a dog.  To Darwin, the similarities of this response pattern indicated that these  different species evolved from a common ancestor that possessed the  same behavioral trait, which was advantageous presumably because it  facilitated escape from predators. Because behavior refl ects the activity of  the nervous system, we can infer that the brain mechanisms that under lie this fear reaction may be similar, if not identical, across these species. The idea that the nervous systems of different species evolved from  common ancestors and may have common mechanisms is the rationale  for relating the results of animal experiments to humans. For example,  many of the details of electrical impulse conduction along nerve fi bers  were discovered fi rst in the squid but are now known to apply equally  well to humans. Most neuroscientists today use *animal models* to ex amine processes they wish to understand in humans. For example, rats  show clear signs of addiction if they are repeatedly given the chance to

**Different brain specializations in monkeys and rats.** (a) The brain of the  macaque monkey has a highly evolved sense of sight. The boxed region receives  information from the eyes. When this region is sliced open and stained to show  metabolically active tissue, a mosaic of “blobs” appears. The neurons within the  blobs are specialized to analyze colors in the visual world. (b) The brain of a rat  has a highly evolved sense of touch to the face. The boxed region receives infor mation from the whiskers. When this region is sliced open and stained to show  the location of the neurons, a mosaic of “barrels” appears. Each barrel is special ized to receive input from a single whisker on the rat’s face.

self-administer cocaine. Consequently, rats provide a valuable animal  model for research focused on understanding how psychoactive drugs  exert their effects on the nervous system. 

On the other hand, many behavioral traits are highly specialized for  the environment (or niche) a species normally occupies. For example,  monkeys swinging from branch to branch have a keen sense of sight,  while rats slinking through underground tunnels have poor vision but  a highly evolved sense of touch using their snout whiskers. Adaptations  are refl ected in the structure and function of the brain of every species.  By comparing the specializations of the brains of different species, neuro 

scientists have been able to identify which parts of the brain are special ized for different behavioral functions. Examples for monkeys and rats  are shown in Figure 1.14. 

**The Neuron: The Basic Functional Unit of the Brain.** Technical advances  in microscopy during the early 1800s gave scientists their fi rst opportu nity to examine animal tissues at high magnifi cations. In 1839, German  zoologist Theodor Schwann proposed what came to be known as the *cell*  

*theory*: All tissues are composed of microscopic units called *cells*. Although cells in the brain had been identifi ed and described, there  was still controversy at that time about whether the individual “nerve    
**CHAPTER 1** NEUROSCIENCE: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE **13** 

cell” was actually the basic unit of brain function. Nerve cells usually  

have a number of thin projections, or processes, that extend from a cen 

tral cell body (Figure 1.15). Initially, scientists could not decide whether  

the processes from different cells fuse together as do blood vessels in the  

circulatory system. If this were true, then the “nerve net” of connected  

nerve cells would represent the elementary unit of brain function. 

Chapter 2 presents a brief history of how this issue was resolved. Suffi ce  

it to say that by 1900, the individual nerve cell, now called the *neuron*,  

was recognized to be the basic functional unit of the nervous system. 

**NEUROSCIENCE TODAY**   
**NEUROSCIENCE TODAY** 

The history of modern neuroscience is still being written, and the  

accomplishments to date form the basis for this textbook. We will discuss  

the most recent developments in the coming chapters. Before we do, let’s  

take a look at how brain research is conducted today and why it is so  

 important to society. 

**Levels of Analysis** 

History has clearly shown that understanding how the brain works is a  big challenge. To reduce the complexity of the problem, neuroscientists  break it into smaller pieces for systematic experimental analysis. This  is called the *reductionist approach*. The size of the unit of study defi nes  what is often called the *level of analysis*. In ascending order of complexity,  these levels are molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral, and cognitive. 

**Molecular Neuroscience.** The brain has been called the most complex  piece of matter in the universe. Brain matter consists of a fantastic variety  of molecules, many of which are unique to the nervous system. These differ ent molecules play many different roles that are crucial for brain function:  messengers that allow neurons to communicate with one another, sentries  that control what materials can enter or leave neurons, conductors that  orchestrate neuron growth, archivists of past experiences. The study of the  brain at this most elementary level is called *molecular neuroscience*. 

**Cellular Neuroscience.** The next level of analysis is cellular neuroscience,  which focuses on studying how all those molecules work together to give  neurons their special properties. Among the questions asked at this level  are: How many different types of neurons are there, and how do they  differ in function? How do neurons infl uence other neurons? How do neu 

rons become “wired together” during fetal development? How do neurons  perform computations? 

**Systems Neuroscience.** Constellations of neurons form complex circuits  that perform a common function, such as vision or voluntary movement.  Thus, we can speak of the “visual system” and the “motor system,” each  of which has its own distinct circuitry within the brain. At this level of  analysis, called *systems neuroscience*, neuroscientists study how different  neural circuits analyze sensory information, form perceptions of the ex 

ternal world, make decisions, and execute movements. 

**Behavioral Neuroscience.** How do neural systems work together to pro duce integrated behaviors? For example, are different forms of memory  accounted for by different systems? Where in the brain do “mind-altering”  drugs act, and what is the normal contribution of these systems to the    
▲ FIGURE 1.15   
**An early depiction of a nerve cell.**  Published in 1865, this drawing by  German anatomist Otto Deiters shows  a nerve cell, or neuron, and its many  projections, called *neurites*. For a time  it was thought that the neurites from  different neurons might fuse together  like the blood vessels of the circulatory  system. We now know that neurons are  distinct entities that communicate using  chemical and electrical signals. (Source:  Clarke and O’Malley, 1968, Fig. 16.)  
**14 PART ONE** FOUNDATIONS 

regulation of mood and behavior? What neural systems account for  

gender-specifi c behaviors? Where are dreams created and what do they  

reveal? These questions are studied in behavioral neuroscience. 

**Cognitive Neuroscience.** Perhaps the greatest challenge of neuroscience  

is understanding the neural mechanisms responsible for the higher levels  

of human mental activity, such as self-awareness, imagination, and lan 

guage. Research at this level, called *cognitive neuroscience*, studies how  

the activity of the brain creates the mind. 

**Neuroscientists** 

“Neuroscientist” sounds impressive, kind of like “rocket scientist.” But  

we were all students once, just like you. For whatever reason—maybe  

we wanted to know why our eyesight was poor, or why a family member  

suffered a loss of speech after a stroke—we came to share a thirst for  

knowledge of how the brain works. Perhaps you will, too. 

Being a neuroscientist is rewarding, but it does not come easily. Many  

years of training are required. One may begin by helping out in a research  

lab during or after college and then going to graduate school to earn a  

Ph.D. or an M.D. (or both). Several years of post-doctoral training usually  

follow, learning new techniques or ways of thinking under the direction  

of an established neuroscientist. Finally, the “young” neuroscientist is  

ready to set up shop at a university, institute, or hospital. 

Broadly speaking, neuroscience research (and neuroscientists) may be  

divided into three types: *clinical*, *experimental*, and *theoretical*. Clinical  

research is mainly conducted by physicians (M.D.s). The main medical  

specialties associated with the human nervous system are neurology,  

psychiatry, neurosurgery, and neuropathology (Table 1.1). Many who  

conduct clinical research continue in the tradition of Broca, attempting  

to deduce from the behavioral effects of brain damage the functions of  

various parts of the brain. Others conduct studies to assess the benefi ts  

and risks of new types of treatment. 

Despite the obvious value of clinical research, the foundation for  

all medical treatments of the nervous system continues to be laid by  

experimental neuroscientists, who may hold either an M.D. or a Ph.D. The  

experimental approaches to studying the brain are so broad that they in 

clude almost every conceivable methodology. Neuroscience is highly inter 

disciplinary; however, expertise in a particular methodology may distin 

guish one neuroscientist from another. Thus, there are *neuroanatomists*,  

who use sophisticated microscopes to trace connections in the brain;  

*neurophysiologists*, who use electrodes to measure the brain’s electrical  

activity; *neuropharmacologists*, who use drugs to study the chemistry of

brain function; *molecular neurobiologists*, who probe the genetic material  of neurons to fi nd clues about the structure of brain molecules; and so on.  Table 1.2 lists some of the types of experimental neuroscientists. 

Theoretical neuroscience is a relatively young discipline, in which  researchers use mathematical and computational tools to understand  the brain at all levels of analysis. In the tradition of physics, theoretical  neuroscientists attempt to make sense of the vast amounts of data gen 

erated by experimentalists, with the goals of helping focus experiments  on questions of greatest importance and establishing the mathematical  principles of nervous system organization. 

**The Scientifi c Process** 

Neuroscientists of all stripes endeavor to establish truths about the  nervous system. Regardless of the level of analysis they choose, they  work according to a scientifi c process consisting of four essential steps:   observation, replication, interpretation, and verifi cation. 

**Observation.** Observations are typically made during experiments de signed to test a particular hypothesis. For example, Bell hypothesized  that the ventral roots contain the nerve fi bers that control the muscles.  To test this idea, he performed an experiment in which he cut these fi bers  and then observed whether or not muscular paralysis resulted. Other  types of observation derive from carefully watching the world around us,  or from introspection, or from human clinical cases. For example, Broca’s  careful observations led him to correlate left frontal lobe damage with the  loss of the ability to speak. 

**Replication.** Any observation, whether experimental or clinical, must be  replicated. Replication simply means repeating the experiment on dif ferent subjects or making similar observations in different patients, as  many times as necessary to rule out the possibility that the observation  occurred by chance. 

**Interpretation.** Once the scientist believes the observation is correct, he  or she interprets it. Interpretations depend on the state of knowledge  (or ignorance) at the time and on the scientist’s preconceived notions    
**16 PART ONE** FOUNDATIONS 

(or “mind set”). Interpretations therefore do not always withstand the test  

of time. For example, at the time he made his observations, Flourens was  

unaware that the cerebrum of a bird is fundamentally different from that  

of a mammal. Thus, he wrongly concluded from experimental ablations in  

birds that there was no localization of certain functions in the cerebrum  

of mammals. Moreover, as mentioned before, his profound distaste for  

Gall surely also colored his interpretation. The point is that the correct  

interpretation often is not made until long after the original observations.  

Indeed, major breakthroughs sometimes occur when old observations are  

reinterpreted in a new light. 

**Verifi cation.** The final step of the scientifi c process is verifi cation. This  

step is distinct from the replication the original observer performed.  

Verifi cation means that the observation is suffi ciently robust that any  

competent scientist who precisely follows the protocols of the original  

observer can reproduce it. Successful verifi cation generally means that  

the observation is accepted as fact. However, not all observations can  

be verifi ed, sometimes because of inaccuracies in the original report or  

 insuffi cient replication. But failure to verify usually stems from the fact  

that unrecognized variables, such as temperature or time of day, contrib 

uted to the original result. Thus, the process of verifi cation, if affi rmative,  

establishes new scientifi c fact, or, if negative, suggests new interpreta 

tions for the original observation. 

Occasionally, one reads in the popular press about a case of scien 

tifi c fraud. Researchers face keen competition for limited research funds  

and feel considerable pressure to “publish or perish.” In the interest of  

expediency, a few have actually published “observations” they in fact  

never made. Fortunately, such instances of fraud are rare, thanks to the  

scientifi c process. Before long, other scientists fi nd they are unable to  

verify the fraudulent observations and question how they could have been  

made in the fi rst place. The fact that we can fi ll this book with so much  

knowledge about the nervous system stands as a testament to the value  

of the scientifi c process. 

**The Use of Animals in Neuroscience Research** 

Most of what we know about the nervous system has come from experi 

ments on animals. In most cases, the animals are killed so their brains  

can be examined neuroanatomically, neurophysiologically, and/or neuro 

chemically. The fact that animals are sacrifi ced for the pursuit of human  

knowledge raises questions about the ethics of animal research. 

**The Animals.** Let’s begin by putting the issue in perspective. Throughout  

history, humans have considered animals and animal products as renew 

able natural resources that can be used for food, clothing, transporta 

tion, recreation, sport, and companionship. The animals used in research,  

education, and testing have always been a small fraction of those used  

for other purposes. For example, in the United States, the number of ani 

mals used in all types of biomedical research is very small compared to  

the number killed for food. The number used specifi cally in neuroscience  

research is much smaller still. 

Neuroscience experiments are conducted using many different spe 

cies, ranging from snails to monkeys. The choice of species is generally  

dictated by the question under investigation, the level of analysis, and  

the extent to which the knowledge gained can be related to humans. As a  

rule, the more basic the process under investigation, the more distant can   
**CHAPTER 1** NEUROSCIENCE: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE **17** 

be the evolutionary relationship with humans. Thus, experiments aimed  

at understanding the molecular basis of nerve impulse conduction can  

be carried out with a distantly related species, such as the squid. On the  

other hand, understanding the neural basis of movement and perceptual  

disorders in humans has required experiments with more closely related  

species, such as the macaque monkey. Today, more than half of the ani 

mals used for neuroscience research are rodents—mice and rats—that  

are bred specifi cally for this purpose. 

**Animal Welfare.** In the developed world today, most educated adults have  

a concern for animal welfare. Neuroscientists share this concern and work  

to ensure that animals are well treated. Society has not always placed  

such value on animal welfare, however, as refl ected in some of the scien 

tifi c practices of the past. For example, in his experiments early in the  

nineteenth century, Magendie used unanesthetized puppies (for which he  

was later criticized by his scientifi c rival Bell). Fortunately, heightened  

awareness of animal welfare has more recently led to signifi cant improve 

ments in how animals are treated in biomedical research. 

Today, neuroscientists accept certain moral responsibilities toward  

their animal subjects: 

1\. Animals are used only in worthwhile experiments that promise to  

 advance our knowledge of the nervous system. 

2\. All necessary steps are taken to minimize pain and distress experienced  

by the experimental animals (use of anesthetics, analgesics, etc.). 

3\. All possible alternatives to the use of animals are considered. 

Adherence to this ethical code is monitored in a number of ways. First,  

research proposals must pass a review by the Institutional Animal Care  

and Use Committee (IACUC), as mandated by U.S. federal law. Members  

of this committee include a veterinarian, scientists in other disciplines,  

and nonscientist community representatives. After passing the IACUC  

review, proposals are evaluated for scientifi c merit by a panel of expert  

neuroscientists. This step ensures that only the most worthwhile projects  

are carried out. Then, when neuroscientists submit their observations for  

publication in the professional journals, the papers are carefully reviewed  

by other neuroscientists for both scientifi c merit and animal welfare con 

cerns. Reservations about either issue can lead to rejection of the paper,  

which in turn can lead to a loss of funding for the research. In addition  

to these monitoring procedures, federal law sets strict standards for the  

housing and care of laboratory animals. 

**Animal Rights.** Most people accept the necessity for animal experimenta 

tion to advance knowledge, as long as it is performed humanely and with  

the proper respect for animals’ welfare. However, a vocal and increasingly  

violent minority seeks the total abolition of animal use for human pur 

poses, including experimentation. These people subscribe to a philosophi 

cal position often called *animal rights*. According to this way of thinking,  

animals have the same legal and moral rights as humans. 

If you are an animal lover, you may be sympathetic to this position.  

But consider the following questions. Are you willing to deprive yourself  

and your family of medical procedures that were developed using ani 

mals? Is the death of a mouse equivalent to the death of a human being?  

Is keeping a pet the moral equivalent of slavery? Is eating meat the moral  

equivalent of murder? Is it unethical to take the life of a pig to save the  

life of a child? Is controlling the rodent population in the sewers or the  

roach population in your home morally equivalent to the Holocaust?   
**18 PART ONE** FOUNDATIONS 

If your answer is no to any of these questions, then you do not subscribe  

to the philosophy of animal rights. *Animal welfare*—a concern that all  

responsible people share—must not be confused with animal rights. 

Animal rights activists have vigorously pursued their agenda against  

animal research, sometimes with alarming success. They have manipulated  

public opinion with repeated allegations of cruelty in animal experiments  

that are grossly distorted or blatantly false. They have vandalized laborato 

ries, destroying years of hard-won scientifi c data and hundreds of thousands  

of dollars of equipment (that you, the taxpayer, had paid for). With threats  

of violence they have driven some researchers out of science altogether. 

Fortunately, the tide is turning. Thanks to the efforts of a number of  

people, scientists and nonscientists alike, the false claims of the extrem 

ists have been exposed, and the benefi ts to humankind of animal research  

have been extolled (Figure 1.16). Considering the staggering toll in terms  

of human suffering that results from disorders of the nervous system,  

neuroscientists take the position that it is our responsibility to wisely  

use all the resources nature has provided, including animals, to gain an  

understanding of how the brain functions in health and in disease. 

Recently, a surgical technique perfected on animals was used to remove  

a malignant tumor from a little girl's brain. We lost some lab animals.  

But look what we saved.

**The Cost of Ignorance: Nervous System Disorders** 

Modern neuroscience research is expensive, but the cost of ignorance  

about the brain is far greater. Table 1.3 lists some of the disorders that  

affect the nervous system. It is likely that your family has felt the impact  

of one or more of these. Let’s look at a few brain disorders and examine  

their effects on society. 

Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease are both characterized  

by progressive degeneration of specifi c neurons in the brain. Parkinson’s  

disease, which results in a crippling impairment of voluntary move   
ment, currently affects over 500,000 Americans.1 Alzheimer’s disease  

leads to dementia, a state of confusion characterized by the loss of ability  

to learn new information and to recall previously acquired knowledge.    
Dementia affects an estimated 18% of people over age 85\.2 The number  

of Americans with dementia totals well over 4 million. Indeed, demen 

tia is now recognized as not an inevitable outcome of aging, as was once  

believed, but as a sign of brain disease. Alzheimer’s disease progresses  

mercilessly, robbing its victims fi rst of their mind, then of control over  

basic bodily functions, and fi nally of their life; the disease is always fatal.  

In the United States, the annual cost of care for people with dementia is  

greater than $100 billion and rising at an alarming rate. 

Depression and schizophrenia are disorders of mood and thought.  

Depression is characterized by overwhelming feelings of dejection,

worthlessness, and guilt. Over 30 million Americans will experience a  

major depressive illness at some time in their lives. Depression is the  

leading cause of suicide, which claims more than 30,000 lives each year    
in the United States.3   
Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by delu 

sions, hallucinations, and bizarre behavior. This disease often strikes at  

the prime of life—adolescence or early adulthood—and can persist for  

life. Over 2 million Americans suffer from schizophrenia. The National  

Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimates that mental disorders,  

such as depression and schizophrenia, cost the United States in excess of  

$150 billion annually. 

Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Stroke  

victims who do not die, over half a million every year, are likely to be per   
manently disabled. The annual cost of stroke nationwide is $54 billion.4   
Alcohol or drug addiction affects virtually every family in the United  

States. The cost in terms of treatment, lost wages, and other consequences    
exceeds $600 billion per year.5   
These few examples only scratch the surface. *More Americans are*  

*hospitalized with neurological and mental disorders than with any other*  

*major disease group, including heart disease and cancer*. 

The economic costs of brain dysfunction are enormous, but they pale  

in comparison with the staggering emotional toll on victims and their  

families. The prevention and treatment of brain disorders require an  

understanding of normal brain function, and this basic understanding is  

the goal of neuroscience. Neuroscience research has already contributed  

to the development of increasingly effective treatments for Parkinson’s  

disease, depression, and schizophrenia. New strategies are being tested  

to rescue dying neurons in people with Alzheimer’s disease and those who  

have had a stroke. Major progress has been made in our understanding  

of how drugs and alcohol affect the brain and how they lead to addictive  

behavior. The material in this book demonstrates that a lot is known  

about the function of the brain. But what we know is insignifi cant com 

pared with what is still left to be learned. 

**CONCLUDING REMARKS**   
**CONCLUDING REMARKS** 

The historical foundations of neuroscience were established by many peo 

ple over many generations. Men and women today are working at all levels  

of analysis, using all types of technology, to shed more light on the func 

tions of the brain. The fruits of this labor form the basis for this textbook. 

The goal of neuroscience is to understand how nervous systems func 

tion. Many important insights can be gained from a vantage point out 

side the head. Because the brain’s activity is refl ected in behavior, careful  

behavioral measurements inform us of the capabilities and limitations  

of brain function. Computer models that reproduce the brain’s compu 

tational properties can help us understand how these properties might  

arise. From the scalp, we can measure brain waves, which tell us some 

thing about the electrical activity of different parts of the brain during

various behavioral states. New computer-assisted imaging techniques  

enable researchers to examine the structure of the living brain as it sits  

in the head. And using even more sophisticated imaging methods, we are  

beginning to see which different parts of the human brain become active  

under different conditions. But none of these noninvasive methods, old  

or new, can fully substitute for experimentation with living brain tissue.  

We cannot make sense of remotely detected signals without being able to  

see how they are generated and what their signifi cance is. To understand  

*how* the brain works, we must open the head and examine what’s inside— 

neuroanatomically, neurophysiologically, and neurochemically. 

The pace of neuroscience research today is truly breathtaking, raising  

hopes that soon we will have new treatments for the wide range of ner 

vous system disorders that debilitate and cripple millions of people annu 

ally. However, despite the progress in recent decades and the centuries  

preceding them, we still have a long way to go before we fully understand  

how the brain performs all of its amazing feats. But this is the fun of  

being a neuroscientist: Because our ignorance of brain function is so vast,  

a startling new discovery lurks around virtually every corner.

**INTRODUCTION**   
**INTRODUCTION**  

All tissues and organs in the body consist of cells. The specialized func 

tions of cells and how they interact determine the functions of organs.  

The brain is an organ—to be sure, the most sophisticated and complex  

organ that nature has devised. But the basic strategy for unraveling its  

functions is no different from that used to investigate the pancreas or the  

lung. We must begin by learning how brain cells work individually and  

then see how they are assembled to work together. In neuroscience, there  

is no need to separate *mind* from *brain*; once we fully understand the  

individual and concerted actions of brain cells, we will understand our  

mental abilities. The organization of this book refl ects this “neurophiloso 

phy.” We start with the cells of the nervous system—their structure, func 

tion, and means of communication. In later chapters, we will explore how  

these cells are assembled into circuits that mediate sensation, perception,  

movement, speech, and emotion.  

This chapter focuses on the structure of the different types of cells in  

the nervous system: *neurons* and *glia*. These are broad categories, within  

which are many types of cells that differ in structure, chemistry, and  

function. Nonetheless, the distinction between neurons and glia is impor 

tant. Although there are approximately equal numbers of neurons and  

glia in the adult human brain (roughly 85 billion of each type), neurons  

are responsible for most of the unique functions of the brain. It is the  

**neurons** that sense changes in the environment, communicate these  

changes to other neurons, and command the body’s responses to these  

sensations. **Glia**, or **glial cells**, contribute to brain function mainly by  

insulating, supporting, and nourishing neighboring neurons. If the brain  

were a chocolate chip cookie and the neurons were chocolate chips, the  

glia would be the cookie dough that fi lls all the other space and suspends  

the chips in their appropriate locations. Indeed, the term *glia* is derived  

from the Greek word for “glue,” giving the impression that the main  

function of these cells is to keep the brain from running out of our ears\!  

Although this simple view belies the importance of glial function, as we  

shall see later in this chapter, we are confi dent that neurons perform  

most information processing in the brain, so neurons receive most of our  

attention.  

Neuroscience, like other fi elds, has a language all its own. To use this  

language, you must learn the vocabulary. After you have read this chap 

ter, take a few minutes to review the key terms list and make sure you  

understand the meaning of each term. Your neuroscience vocabulary will  

grow as you work your way through the book.  

 **THE NEURON DOCTRINE**    
**THE NEURON DOCTRINE**

To study the structure of brain cells, scientists have had to overcome  

several obstacles. The fi rst was the small size. Most cells are in the  

range of 0.01–0.05 mm in diameter. The tip of an unsharpened pencil  

lead is about 2 mm across; neurons are 40–200 times smaller. (For a  

review of the metric system, see Table 2.1.) Because neurons cannot be  

seen by the naked eye, cellular neuroscience could not progress before  

the development of the compound microscope in the late seventeenth  

century. Even then, obstacles remained. To observe brain tissue using a  

microscope, it was necessary to make very thin slices, ideally not much  

thicker than the diameter of the cells. However, brain tissue has a con 

sistency like a bowl of Jell-O: not fi rm enough to make thin slices. Thus,

the anatomical study of brain cells had to await a method to harden the tissue without disturbing its structure and an instrument that could produce very thin slices. Early in the nineteenth century, scientists dis covered how to harden, or “fi x,” tissues by immersing them in formalde hyde, and they developed a special device called a *microtome* to make  

very thin slices.  

These technical advances spawned the fi eld of **histology**, the micro scopic study of the structure of tissues. But scientists studying brain  structure faced yet another obstacle. Freshly prepared brain tissue has  a uniform, cream-colored appearance under the microscope, with no  differences in pigmentation to enable histologists to resolve individual  cells. The fi nal breakthrough in neurohistology was the introduction of  stains that selectively color some, but not all, parts of the cells in brain  tissue.  

One stain still used today was introduced by the German neurologist  Franz Nissl in the late nineteenth century. Nissl showed that a class of  basic dyes would stain the nuclei of all cells as well as clumps of material  surrounding the nuclei of neurons (Figure 2.1). These clumps are called  *Nissl bodies*, and the stain is known as the **Nissl stain**. The Nissl stain is  extremely useful for two reasons: It distinguishes between neurons and  glia, and it enables histologists to study the arrangement, or **cytoarchi** 

**tecture**, of neurons in different parts of the brain. (The prefi x *cyto-* is  from the Greek word for “cell.”) The study of cytoarchitecture led to the  realization that the brain consists of many specialized regions. We now  know that each region performs a different function.  

 **The Golgi Stain**  

The Nissl stain, however, could not tell the whole story. A Nissl-stained  neuron looks like little more than a lump of protoplasm containing a

nucleus. Neurons are much more than that, but how much more was  

not recognized before Italian histologist Camillo Golgi devised a new  

method (Figure 2.2). In 1873, Golgi discovered that soaking brain tis 

sue in a silver chromate solution, now called the **Golgi stain**, makes  

a small percentage of neurons become darkly colored in their entirety  

(Figure 2.3). This revealed that the neuronal cell body, the region of the  

neuron around the nucleus that is shown with the Nissl stain, is actu 

ally only a small fraction of the total structure of the neuron. Notice in  

Figures 2.1 and 2.3 how different histological stains can provide strik 

ingly different views of the same tissue. Today, neurohistology remains  

an active fi eld in neuroscience, along with its credo: “The gain in brain is  

mainly in the stain.”  

The Golgi stain shows that neurons have at least two distinguishable  

parts: a central region that contains the cell nucleus and numerous thin  

tubes that radiate away from the central region. The swollen region con 

taining the cell nucleus has several names that are used interchangeably:  

**cell body**, **soma** (plural: somata), and **perikaryon** (plural: perikarya).  

▲ FIGURE 2.2   
**Camillo Golgi (1843–1926).**  (Source: Finger, 1994, Fig. 3.22.)   
The thin tubes that radiate from the soma are called **neurites** and are of  two types: **axons** and **dendrites** (Figure 2.4).  

The cell body usually gives rise to a single axon. The axon is of uni form diameter throughout its length, and any branches from it generally  extend at right angles. Because axons can extend over great distances  in the body (a meter or more), histologists of the day immediately recog nized that axons must act like “wires” that carry the output of the neu rons. Dendrites, on the other hand, are rarely longer than 2 mm. Many  dendrites extend from the cell body and generally taper to a fi ne point.

Early histologists recognized that because dendrites come in contact with  

many axons, they must act as the antennae of the neuron to receive in 

coming signals, or input.  

 **Cajal’s Contribution**  

Golgi invented the stain, but a Spanish contemporary used it to great 

est effect. Santiago Ramón y Cajal was a skilled histologist and artist  

who learned about Golgi’s method in 1888 (Figure 2.5). In a remark 

able series of publications over the next 25 years, Cajal used the Golgi  

stain to work out the circuitry of many regions of the brain (Figure 2.6).  

Curiously, Golgi and Cajal drew completely opposite conclusions about  

neurons. Golgi championed the view that the neurites of different cells  

are fused together to form a continuous reticulum, or network, similar  

to the arteries and veins of the circulatory system. According to this  reticular theory, the brain is an exception to the cell theory, which  states that the individual cell is the elementary functional unit of  all animal tissues. Cajal, on the other hand, argued forcefully that  the neurites of different neurons are not continuous with each other  and *communicate by contact*, *not continuity*. This idea that cell theory  also applies to neurons came to be known as the **neuron doctrine** .  Although Golgi and Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in 1906, they re 

mained rivals to the end.  

The scientifi c evidence over the next 50 years strongly supported the  neuron doctrine, but fi nal proof had to wait for the electron microscope  in the 1950s (Box 2.1). With the increased resolving power of the electron  microscope, it was fi nally possible to show that the neurites of different  neurons are not continuous with one another (Figure 2.7). Thus, our start 

ing point in the exploration of the brain must be the individual neuron.

BOX 2.1 **OF SPECIAL INTEREST** 

**Advances in Microscopy**  

 The human eye can distinguish two points only if they  are separated by more than about one-tenth of a millimeter  (100  m). Thus, we can say that 100  m is near the limit  of resolution for the unaided eye. Neurons have a diameter  of about 20  m, and neurites can be as small as a frac 

tion of a micrometer. The light microscope, therefore, was a  necessary development before neuronal structure could be  studied. But this type of microscopy has a theoretical limit  imposed by the properties of microscope lenses and visible  light. With the standard light microscope, the limit of resolu 

tion is about 0.1  m. Because the space between neurons  is only 0.02  m (20 nm), it’s no wonder that two esteemed  scientists, Golgi and Cajal, disagreed about whether neurites  were continuous from one cell to the next. This question  could not be answered until about 70 years ago when the  electron microscope was developed and applied to biological  specimens.  

The electron microscope uses an electron beam instead  of light to form images, dramatically increasing the resolving  power. The limit of resolution for an electron microscope is  about 0.1 nm—a million times better than the unaided eye  and a thousand times better than a light microscope. Our  insights into the fi ne structure of the inside of neurons—the  ultrastructure—have all come from electron microscopic ex 

amination of the brain.  

Today, microscopes on the leading edge of technology  use laser beams to illuminate tissue and computers to cre ate digital images (Figure A). Neuroscientists now routinely  introduce into neurons molecules that fl uoresce when il luminated by laser light. The fl uorescence is recorded by

sensitive detectors, and the computer takes these data and  reconstructs the image of the neuron. Unlike the traditional  methods of light and electron microscopy, which require tis sue fi xation, these new techniques give neuroscientists the  ability to peer into brain tissue that is still alive. Furthermore,  they have allowed “super-resolution” imaging, breaking the  limits imposed by traditional light microscopy to reveal struc tures as small as 20 nm across.

**THE PROTOTYPICAL NEURONTHE PROTOTYPICAL NEURON**    
**CHAPTER 2** NEURONS AND GLIA **29** 

As we have seen, the neuron (also called a *nerve cell*) consists of several  parts: the soma, the dendrites, and the axon. The inside of the neuron is  separated from the outside by the *neuronal membrane*, which lies like a  circus tent on an intricate internal scaffolding, giving each part of the cell  its special three-dimensional appearance. Let’s explore the inside of the  neuron and learn about the functions of the different parts (Figure 2.8).  

 **The Soma**  

We begin our tour at the soma, the roughly spherical central part of the  neuron. The cell body of the typical neuron is about 20  m in diameter.  The watery fl uid inside the cell, called the **cytosol**, is a salty, potassium rich solution that is separated from the outside by the neuronal mem brane. Within the soma are a number of membrane-enclosed structures  called **organelles** .  

The cell body of the neuron contains the same organelles found in all  animal cells. The most important ones are the nucleus, the rough endo plasmic reticulum, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi appara tus, and the mitochondria. Everything contained within the confi nes of  the cell membrane, including the organelles but excluding the nucleus, is  referred to collectively as the **cytoplasm** .  

**The Nucleus.** Its name derived from the Latin word for “nut,” the **nucleus** of the cell is spherical, centrally located, and about 5–10  m across. It  is contained within a double membrane called the *nuclear envelope*. The  

nuclear envelope is perforated by pores about 0.1  m across.  Within the nucleus are **chromosomes** which contain the genetic ma terial **DNA** ( **deoxyribonucleic acid**). Your DNA was passed on to you  from your parents and it contains the blueprint for your entire body. The  DNA in each of your neurons is the same, and it is the same as the DNA  in the cells of your liver and kidney and other organs. What distinguishes  a neuron from a liver cell are the specifi c parts of the DNA that are used  to assemble the cell. These segments of DNA are called **genes** .  Each chromosome contains an uninterrupted double-strand braid of  DNA, 2 nm wide. If the DNA from the 46 human chromosomes were laid  out straight, end to end, it would measure more than 2 m in length. If we  were to compare this total length of DNA to the total string of letters that  make up this book, the genes would be analogous to the individual words.  Genes are from 0.1 to several micrometers in length.  

The “reading” of the DNA is known as **gene expression**. The fi nal  product of gene expression is the synthesis of molecules called **proteins** ,  which exist in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, perform many different  functions, and bestow upon neurons virtually all of their unique charac 

teristics. **Protein synthesis**, the assembly of protein molecules, occurs  in the cytoplasm. Because the DNA never leaves the nucleus, an interme diary must carry the genetic message to the sites of protein synthesis in  the cytoplasm. This function is performed by another long molecule called  **messenger ribonucleic acid**, or **mRNA**. mRNA consists of four differ ent nucleic acids strung together in various sequences to form a chain.  The detailed sequence of the nucleic acids in the chain represents the  information in the gene, just as the sequence of letters gives meaning to  a written word.  

The process of assembling a piece of mRNA that contains the informa tion of a gene is called **transcription**, and the resulting mRNA is called

the *transcript* (Figure 2.9a). Interspersed between protein-coding genes  are long stretches of DNA whose functions remain poorly understood.  Some of these regions, however, are known to be important for regulat ing transcription. At one end of the gene is the **promoter**, the region  where the RNA-synthesizing enzyme, *RNA polymerase*, binds to initiate  transcription. The binding of the polymerase to the promoter is tightly  regulated by other proteins called **transcription factors**. At the other  end is a sequence of DNA called the *terminator*,or *stop sequence*,that the  

RNA polymerase recognizes as the end point for transcription.  In addition to the non-coding regions of DNA that flank the genes,  there are often additional stretches of DNA within the gene itself that  cannot be used to code for protein. These interspersed regions are called  *introns*, and the coding sequences are called *exons*. Initial transcripts con tain both introns and exons, but then, by a process called **RNA splicing** ,    
**32 PART ONE** FOUNDATIONS 

the introns are removed and the remaining exons are fused together  

(Figure 2.9b). In some cases, specifi c exons are also removed with the  

introns, leaving an “alternatively spliced” mRNA that actually encodes a  

different protein. Thus, transcription of a single gene can ultimately give  

rise to several different mRNAs and protein products.  

mRNA transcripts emerge from the nucleus via pores in the nuclear  

envelope and travel to the sites of protein synthesis elsewhere in the neu 

ron. At these sites, a protein molecule is assembled much as the mRNA  

molecule was: by linking together many small molecules into a chain. In  

the case of protein, the building blocks are **amino acids**, of which there  

are 20 different kinds. This assembling of proteins from amino acids  

under the direction of the mRNA is called **translation** .  

The scientifi c study of this process, which begins with the DNA of the  

nucleus and ends with the synthesis of protein molecules in the cell, is  

known as *molecular biology*. The “central dogma” of molecular biology is  

summarized as follows:  

 Transcription Translation  

 DNA mRNA Protein  

**Neuronal Genes, Genetic Variation, and Genetic Engineering.** Neurons  

differ from other cells in the body because of the specific genes they express  

as proteins. A new understanding of these genes is now possible because  

the human **genome**—the entire length of DNA that comprises the genetic  

information in our chromosomes—has been sequenced. We now know the  

25,000 “words” that comprise our genome, and we know where these genes  

can be found on each chromosome. Furthermore, we are learning which  

genes are expressed uniquely in neurons (Box 2.2). This knowledge has  

paved the way to understanding the genetic basis of many diseases of the  

nervous system. In some diseases, long stretches of DNA that contain sev 

eral genes are missing; in others, genes are duplicated, leading to overex 

pression of specifi c proteins. These sorts of mishaps, called *gene copy num* 

*ber variations*, often occur at the moment of conception when paternal and  

maternal DNA mix to create the genome of the offspring. Some instances  

of serious psychiatric disorders, including autism and schizophrenia, were  

recently shown to be caused by gene copy number variations in the af 

fected children. (Psychiatric disorders are discussed in Chapter 22.)  

Other nervous system disorders are caused by *mutations*—“typographical  

errors”—in a gene or in the fl anking regions of DNA that regulate the gene’s  

expression. In some cases, a single protein may be grossly abnormal or  

missing entirely, disrupting neuronal function. An example is fragile X syn 

drome, a disorder that manifests as intellectual disability and autism and  

is caused by disruption of a single gene (discussed further in Chapter 23).  

Many of our genes carry small mutations, called *single nucleotide polymor* 

*phisms*, which are analogous to a minor misspelling caused by a change in  

a single letter. These are usually benign, like the difference between “color”  

and “colour”—different spelling, same meaning. However, sometimes the  

mutations can affect protein function (consider the difference between  

“bear” and “bare”—same letters, different meaning). Such single nucleotide  

polymorphisms, alone or together with others, can affect neuronal function.  

Genes make the brain, and understanding how they contribute to neu 

ronal function in both healthy and diseased organisms is a major goal of  

neuroscience. An important breakthrough was the development of tools  

for **genetic engineering**—ways to change organisms by design with  

gene mutations or insertions. This technology has been used most in mice  

because they are rapidly reproducing mammals with a central nervous

**Expressing One’s Mind in the Post-Genomic Era**  

 Sequencing the human genome was a truly monumen tal achievement, completed in 2003\. The Human Genome  Project identifi ed all of the approximately 25,000 genes in  human DNA. We now live in what has been called the “post genomic era,” in which information about the genes ex pressed in our tissues can be used to diagnose and treat  diseases. Neuroscientists are using this information to tackle  long-standing questions about the biological basis of neuro logical and psychiatric disorders as well as to probe deeper  into the origins of individuality. The logic goes as follows. The  brain is a product of the genes expressed in it. Differences  in gene expression between a normal brain and a diseased  brain, or a brain of unusual ability, can be used to identify the  

molecular basis of the observed symptoms or traits.  The level of gene expression is usually defi ned as the  number of mRNA transcripts synthesized by different cells

and tissues to direct the synthesis of specifi c proteins. Thus,  the analysis of gene expression requires comparing the rela tive abundance of various mRNAs in the brains of two groups  of humans or animals. One way to perform such a compari son is to use DNA *microarrays*, which are created by robotic  machines that arrange thousands of small spots of synthetic  DNA on a microscope slide. Each spot contains a unique  DNA sequence that will recognize and stick to a different spe cifi c mRNA sequence. To compare the gene expression in  two brains, one begins by collecting a sample of mRNAs from  each brain. The mRNA of one brain is labeled with a chemical

system similar to our own. Today, it is common in neuroscience to hear about **knockout mice**, in which one gene has been deleted (or “knocked  out”). Such mice can be used to study the progression of a disease, like frag ile X, with the goal of correcting it. Another approach has been to generate  **transgenic mice**, in which genes have been introduced and overexpressed;  these new genes are called *transgenes*. **Knock-in mice** have also been cre 

ated in which the native gene is replaced with a modifi ed transgene.  We will see many examples in this book of how genetically engineered  animals have been used in neuroscience. The discoveries that allowed  genetic modifi cation of mice have revolutionized biology. The researchers  who did this work were recognized with the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology  or Medicine: Martin Evans of Cardiff University, Oliver Smithies of the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Mario Capecchi of the  University of Utah (Box 2.3).

BOX 2.3 **PATH OF DISCOVERY** 

**Gene Targeting in Mice**  

***by Mario Capecchi***  

 How did I fi rst get the idea to pursue gene targeting in  mice? From a simple observation. Mike Wigler, now at Cold  Spring Harbor Laboratory, and Richard Axel, at Columbia  University, had published a paper in 1979 showing that ex 

posing mammalian cells to a mixture of DNA and calcium  phosphate would cause some cells to take up the DNA in  functional form and express the encoded genes. This was  exciting because they had clearly demonstrated that exog 

enous, functional DNA could be introduced into mammalian  cells. But I wondered why their effi ciency was so low. Was it  a problem of delivery, insertion of exogenous DNA into the  chromosome, or expression of the genes once inserted into  the host chromosome? What would happen if purifi ed DNA  was directly injected into the nucleus of mammalian cells in  culture?  

To fi nd out, I converted a colleague’s electrophysiology  station into a miniature hypodermic needle to directly inject  DNA into the nucleus of a living cell using mechanical micro manipulators and light microscopy (Figure A). The procedure  worked with amazing effi ciency (Capecchi, 1980). With this  method, the frequency of successful integration was now  one in three cells rather than one in a million cells as for merly. This high effi ciency directly led to the development

of transgenic mice through the injection and random inte gration of exogenous DNA into chromosomes of fertilized  mouse eggs, or zygotes. To achieve the high effi ciency of  expression of the exogenous DNA in the recipient cell, I had  to attach small fragments of viral DNA, which we now un derstand to contain enhancers that are critical in eukaryotic  gene expression.  

But what fascinated me most was our observation that  when many copies of a gene were injected into a cell nucleus,  all of these molecules ended up in an ordered head-to-tail  arrangement, called a *concatemer* (Figure B). This was as 

tonishing and could not have occurred as a random event.  We went on to unequivocally prove that homologous recom bination, the process by which chromosomes share genetic  information during cell division, was responsible for the in corporation of the foreign DNA (Folger et al., 1982). These  experiments demonstrated that all mammalian somatic cells  contain a very effi cient machinery for swapping segments of  DNA that have similar sequences of nucleotides. Injection of  a thousand copies of a gene sequence into the nucleus of a  cell resulted in chromosomal insertion of a concatemer con taining a thousand copies of that sequence, all oriented in  the same direction. This simple observation directly led me to

envision mutating any chosen gene, in any chosen manner,  in living mice by gene targeting.  

Excited by this possibility, in 1980, I submitted a grant  to the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposing to  directly alter gene DNA sequences in mammalian cultured  cells by homologous recombination. They rejected the pro 

posal, and their arguments were not unreasonable. They  argued that the probability of the exogenously added DNA  sequence ever fi nding the DNA sequence similar enough  to enable homologous recombination in living mammalian  cells (containing 3   10 9 nucleotide base pairs) was van 

ishingly small. Fortunately, my grant application contained  two other proposals that the NIH reviewers liked, and they  funded those projects. I used those funds to support the  gene targeting project. Four years later, we had results sup 

porting our ability to do gene targeting in cultured mam malian cells. I then resubmitted a new NIH grant application  to the same review panel, now proposing to extend gene  targeting to generating mutant mice. Their evaluation sheet  in response began this way: “We are glad you didn’t follow  our advice.”  

It took 10 years to develop gene targeting in mice (Thomas  & Capecchi, 1987). Prior to this success, we had to under stand the homologous recombination machinery in eukary otic cells. Also, because the frequency of gene targeting was  low, if we were to be successful in transferring our technology  to mice, we needed mouse embryonic stem cells capable of  contributing to the formation of the germ line—the sperm and  eggs—in mature animals. I was getting depressed from our  lack of success using cells derived from embryonal carcinoma    
**CHAPTER 2** NEURONS AND GLIA **35** 

(EC). Then I heard a rumor that Martin  

Evans in Cambridge, England was  

isolating more promising cells, which  

he called *EK cells*, that resembled  

EC cells but were derived from a nor 

mal mouse embryo rather than from  

tumors. I called him and asked if the  

rumor was correct, and he said it was.  

My next question was whether I could  

come to his laboratory to learn how  

to work with those cells, and his an 

swer again was yes. Christmas time,  

1985, was beautiful in Cambridge. My  

wife, who worked with me, and I had  

a wonderful couple of weeks learning  

how to maintain these marvelous cells  

and use them to generate mice capa 

ble of germ line transmission.  

Investigators often have a pre 

conceived idea about the particular  

role of their gene of interest in mouse biology, and they are  usually very surprised by results when the gene is knocked  out. Gene targeting has taken us in many new directions,  including most recently pursuing the role of microglia, cells  that migrate into the brain after being generated in the bone  marrow along with immune and blood cells. Mutating these  cells in mice results in a pathology remarkably similar to the  human condition called trichotillomania, a type of obsessive 

compulsive disorder characterized by strong urges to pull  out one’s hair. Amazingly, transplanting normal bone mar row into mutant mice permanently cures them of this path ological behavior (Chen et al., 2010). Now, we are deeply  immersed in trying to understand the mechanism of how  microglia control neural circuit output and, more impor tantly, exploring the intimate relationship between the im mune system (in this case microglia) and neuropsychiatric  disorders such as depression, autism, schizophrenia, and  Alzheimer’s disease.

material in the form of amino acids.  

In neurons, many ribosomes are attached to stacks of membrane called  

**rough endoplasmic reticulum**, or **rough ER** (Figure 2.10). Rough ER  

abounds in neurons, far more than in glia or most other non-neuronal  

cells. In fact, we have already been introduced to rough ER by another  

name: Nissl bodies. This is the organelle stained with the dyes that Nissl  

introduced over 100 years ago.  

Rough ER is a major site of protein synthesis in neurons, but not all  

ribosomes are attached to rough ER. Many are freely fl oating and are

**Rough endoplasmic reticulum, or  rough ER.**   
called *free ribosomes*. Several free ribosomes may appear to be attached  by a thread; these are called **polyribosomes**. The thread is a single  strand of mRNA, and the associated ribosomes are working on it to make  multiple copies of the same protein.  

What is the difference between proteins synthesized on the rough ER  and those synthesized on the free ribosomes? The answer appears to de pend on the intended fate of the protein molecule. If it is destined to re side within the cytosol of the neuron, then the protein’s mRNA transcript  shuns the ribosomes of the rough ER and gravitates toward the free ri bosomes (Figure 2.11a). However, if the protein is destined to be inserted  into the membrane of the cell or an organelle, then it is synthesized on  the rough ER. As the protein is being assembled, it is threaded back  and forth through the membrane of the rough ER, where it is trapped  (Figure 2.11b). It is not surprising that neurons have so much rough ER  because, as we shall see in later chapters, special membrane proteins are  what give these cells their remarkable information-processing abilities.  

**Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Golgi Apparatus.** The remain der of the cytosol of the soma is crowded with stacks of membranous or ganelles that look a lot like rough ER without the ribosomes, so much so  that one type is called **smooth endoplasmic reticulum**, or **smooth ER**.  Smooth ER is heterogeneous and performs different functions in different  locations. Some smooth ER is continuous with rough ER and is believed  to be a site where the proteins that jut out from the membrane are care fully folded, giving them their three-dimensional structure. Other types  of smooth ER play no direct role in the processing of protein molecules  but instead regulate the internal concentrations of substances such as  calcium. (This organelle is particularly prominent in muscle cells, where  

it is called *sarcoplasmic reticulum*, as we will see in Chapter 13.)  The stack of membrane-enclosed disks in the soma that lies farthest from  the nucleus is the **Golgi apparatus**, fi rst described in 1898 by Camillo  Golgi (Figure 2.12). This is a site of extensive “post-translational” chemical  processing of proteins. One important function of the Golgi apparatus is  believed to be the sorting of certain proteins that are destined for delivery  to different parts of the neuron, such as the axon and the dendrites.  

**The Mitochondrion.** Another very abundant organelle in the soma is  the **mitochondrion** (plural: mitochondria). In neurons, these sausage shaped structures are about 1  m long. Within the enclosure of their outer  membrane are multiple folds of inner membrane called *cristae* (singular:  crista). Between the cristae is an inner space called *matrix* (Figure 2.13a).
