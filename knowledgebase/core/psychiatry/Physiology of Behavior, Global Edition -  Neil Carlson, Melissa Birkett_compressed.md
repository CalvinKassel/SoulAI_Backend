Key Features • Chapter-opening vignettes describe the experience of
people whose lives are impacted by various disorders related to---among
others---behavior, learning, sleep, and ingestion. These vignettes set
the tone and introduce students to a key concept discussed in the
chapter. • Thought Questions at the end of each module provide students
with real-world behavioral neuroscience challenges. Students determine
appropriate courses of action by applying concepts learned, which
develops their critical thinking abilities.

Also available separately for purchase is Revel for Physiology of
Behavior. Revel is an interactive learning environment that deeply
engages students and prepares them for class. Media and assessment
integrated directly within the authors' narrative lets students read,
explore interactive content, and practice in one continuous learning
path. Thanks to the dynamic reading experience in Revel, students come
to class prepared to discuss, apply, and learn from instructors and from
each other. Critical Concepts features have been added to each chapter
in this Revel, with goals of highlighting important topics in
neuroscience and providing opportunities to explore them in greater
depth.

THIRTEENTH EDITION

• End-of-chapter Review Questions help students reinforce connections
across topics and allow instructors to monitor class progress, and
intervene when necessary.

Physiology of Behavior

The thirteenth edition of Physiology of Behavior offers a comprehensive
and systematic approach to behavioral neuroscience. Neil Carlson and
Melissa Birkett draw upon their experience of teaching and working with
students to create this accessible portrait of the dynamic interaction
between biology and behavior. The textbook presents not only the
advances made in research methods but also the discoveries these methods
have revealed. Further, this edition includes a new chapter, "Disorders
of the Developing Nervous System," which highlights disorders such as
autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Preface

I

wrote the first edition of Physiology of Behavior over 30 years ago.
When I did so, I had no idea I would someday be writing the thirteenth
edition. I'm still having fun, so I hope to do a few more. The
interesting work coming out of my colleagues' laboratories---a result of
their creativity and hard work---has given me something new to say with
each edition. Because there was so much for me to learn, I enjoyed
revising this edition just as much as writing the first one. That is
what makes writing new editions interesting: learning something new and
then trying to find a way to convey the information to the reader. In
this edition, Melissa Birkett updated content to reflect new research
developments, and formulated a separate chapter on disorders of the
developing nervous system. Together, we drew upon our teaching and
experience working with students to create a comprehensive and
accessible guide for students of behavioral neuroscience. The first part
of the book is concerned with foundations of behavioral neuroscience:
the history of the field, the structure and functions of neurons,
neuroanatomy, psychopharmacology, and research methods. The second part
is concerned with inputs and outputs that guide behavior: the sensory
systems and the motor system. The third part deals with classes of
species-typical behavior: sleep, reproduction, emotional behavior, and
ingestion. The chapter on reproductive behavior includes parental
behavior as well as courting and mating. The chapter on emotion includes
a discussion of fear, anger and aggression, communication of emotions,
and feeling emotions. The chapter on ingestive behavior includes the
neural and metabolic bases of drinking and eating. The fourth part of
the book explores learning, including research on synaptic plasticity,
the neural mechanisms that are responsible for perceptual learning and
stimulus-response learning (including classical and operant
conditioning), human amnesia, and the role of the hippocampal formation
in relational learning. The final part of the book examines the neural
basis of human communication as well as neurological, mental, and
behavioral disorders. Behavioral disorders are addressed in four
chapters; the first is a new chapter combining information about
development of the nervous system with information about disorders of
development, autism spectrum disorders, and
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; the second discusses
schizophrenia and the affective disorders; the third discusses stress
and anxiety; and the fourth discusses substance abuse. Each chapter
begins with a Case Study, which describes the experience of people whose
lives are impacted by an important issue in neuroscience. Other case
studies are included within the text of the chapters. Learning
Objectives to guide your reading are

A01_CARL0287_13_GE_FM.indd 11

found at the beginning of each major section of the text. The learning
objectives can help you identify and understand the key points from each
section and are also summarized at the end of each module. Thought
Questions are also located at the end of each module and are designed to
stimulate your thinking about what you have learned. Chapter Review
Questions conclude each chapter. They provide useful reviews of each
chapter and a more comprehensive opportunity to test your understanding.
In Revel, Critical Concepts features have been added to each chapter,
with goals of highlighting important topics in neuroscience and
providing opportunities to explore them in greater depth.

New to This Edition The research reported in this edition reflects both
the enormous advances made in research methods and the discoveries these
methods have revealed. In neuroscience, as soon as a new method is
developed in one laboratory, it is adopted by other laboratories and
applied to a wide range of problems. Researchers are combining
techniques that converge upon the solution to a problem and use many
methods, often in collaboration with other laboratories. The art in this
book continues to evolve. For this thirteenth edition, the art has been
updated to improve accessibility, as well as to keep up with the latest
findings and studies in the field. We have always striven to be as up to
date and as accurate as possible. We hope the new art in this edition
reflects that ongoing effort. You'll notice that many of the chapters
contain new headings and subheadings, as well as more concise learning
objectives. We believe that this approach will help the reader to more
easily identify main themes and concepts. The following list summarizes
some of the updates new to this edition.

Chapter 1: Introduction • New research on adult neurogenesis has been
added. • Epigenetics is included as an important concept in behavioral
neuroscience. • New media content has been incorporated into Revel.

Chapter 2: Structure and Functions of Cells of the Nervous System • New
media content has been incorporated into Revel.

Chapter 3: Structure of the Nervous System • Figures were revised. •
Information about development of the nervous system was moved to Chapter
15.

About the Authors Neil R. Carlson pursued his undergraduate studies at
the University of Illinois. He had planned to study nuclear physics, but
when he discovered in an introductory psychology course that psychology
was really a science, he decided that was what he wanted to do. Before
changing his major, Carlson talked with several professors and visited
their laboratories, and when he saw what physiological psychologists do,
he knew that he had found his niche. He stayed on at Illinois and
received his Ph.D. Then, after a two-year postdoctoral fellowship at the
University of Iowa, Carlson came to the University of Massachusetts,
where he taught throughout his entire career. He retired from UMass in
the fall of 2004 but continues to keep up with developments in the field
of behavioral neuroscience and to revise this book. As an undergraduate
psychology major at Cornell Univer­ sity, Melissa A. Birkett discovered
courses in biopsychology, behavior, endocrinology, and evolutionary
psychology. There, she was introduced to interdisciplinary research
incorporating multiple perspectives in the challenging task of
understanding behavior. She became interested in

A01_CARL0287_13_GE_FM.indd 14

learning about behavior and its underlying mechanisms. She worked as an
undergraduate research a­ssistant in several laboratories on projects
ranging from insect behavior to sleep in undergraduates. Those formative
experiences and interactions with several influential research mentors
convinced her to pursue a career in research. Birkett completed her
Ph.D. in the Neuroscience and Behavior program at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst (where Neil Carlson was a faculty member at the
time). In 2007, she became a faculty member at Northern Arizona
University in the Department of Psychological Sciences, and in 2018
joined the psychology department at Southern Oregon University. Birkett
currently conducts research related to the stress response and teaches
undergraduate courses in psychology, research methods, statistics,
behavioral neuroscience, and psychopharmacology. Each year, she
supervises student researchers and seeks to provide them with the kinds
of opportunities she found valuable as a student. Her work has been
recognized with awards for outstanding teaching and teaching innovation,
and she has contributed to several publications on best practices in
teaching neuroscience.

One day, while playing with her father in the garden, five-year-old
Anika suddenly stopped as her right arm twitched a little. For the next
few days, Anika's parents observed her closely and noticed the
occurrence of similar episodes, which she had no memory of. An
examination by a doctor revealed Anika had s­ eizures, a phenomenon when
electrical energy which neurons use to communicate, gets out of control
(you will read more about seizures in Chapter 16). When this happens,
people are briefly unable to control their behavior and often develop
involuntary movements. Sometimes, if neurons that make up the motor
system are involved, a seizure can cause a convulsion, which is
uncontrollable activity of the muscles. When a person experiences more
than one seizure, the condition is termed as epilepsy. In Anika's case,
the doctor concluded, after examining her brain's electrical activity
and the brain images, that she had ­Rasmussen encephalitis. This is a
rare inflammatory condition that typically impairs only one of the brain
hemispheres, and it usually affects young children. Rasmussen
encephalitis responds poorly to medications and the most effective
strategy is to surgically remove the affected hemisphere to prevent
catastrophic effects of the

At the end of the twentieth century, many researchers believed that the
brain was incapable of change in adulthood. However, some
neuroscientists suggested the cells and connections of the adult brain
were flexible, or plastic, and attempted to change the view of the brain
that had been held for more than a century. Changing this widely held
view was not an easy process. Though they were equipped with
revolutionary new data, the researchers were criticized for years, and
their data and methods were questioned. Eventually, the data
accumulated, and the scientific consensus became that the adult brain
continues to experience neural changes. This change in understanding
about the brain has been met with optimism and excitement. Therapies for
brain injury and mental illness have been developed based on this new
understanding of brain changes. The adult brain modifies connections
between the cells in the brain, called neurons, throughout a lifetime.
Dozens of researchers are making new discoveries every year about
neurogenesis, the generation of new neurons particularly in specific
regions of the adult brain. New debates about

epileptic activity on the rest of the brain. Anika's seizure activity
was concentrated in the left hemisphere of her brain and the treatment
of choice for her would be to remove the left hemisphere. Anika's
parents were anxious about the consequences of such a drastic treatment;
however, the doctor assured them that this strategy had proven to be
highly beneficial in the long run. Initially, the surgery leads to
several motor and cognitive deficits but with intense ­rehabilitation,
such patients can restore the lost functions and avoid gross cognitive
abnormalities. Such remarkable recovery is possible due to one of the
key features of the brain's p ­ hysiology---­plasticity, when networks of
brain cells change through growth and ­reorganization forming new
connections and circuits. ­Incremental training of the affected body part
helps the brain learn the lost ­motor functions. Plasticity occurs
throughout life as a r­esult of learning, experiences, and memory
formation. However, it is most effective in the early years of one's
life, making surgical interventions for conditions such as Rasmussen
encephalitis successful and rendering patients both seizure free and
adapted to life. Source: Adam L. Hartman and J. Helen Cross, Timing of
Surgery in ­Rasmussen Syndrome: Is Patience a Virtue?, Epilepsy Currents,

neurogenesis have also arisen and understanding of this phenomenon
remains incomplete (Kempermann et al., 2018). Some researchers have
reported little to no evidence of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of
the hippocampus (an area of the brain typically associated with
neurogenesis) of adult humans, and suggested that neurogenesis in this
region declines throughout childhood in our species (Sorrells et al.,
2018). In contrast, other researchers report evidence that neurogenesis
in this region continues throughout the human lifespan, well into older
adulthood in healthy individuals (Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019; Boldrini
et al., 2018). Researchers previously believed that the adult brain also
lost a large number of neurons during aging. These losses were thought
to underlie the inevitable cognitive decline of older adulthood.
Re-examination of this idea, along with additional data and development
of new methods and technology, has produced a new consensus for a
relatively modest (2-4 percent) decline in neurons in typical aging.
Researchers are also currently r­ e-evaluating long-held ideas about
differences in the number of neurons

in parts of the brain between men and women, the effects of chronic
alcohol use on damage to neurons, and changes in neurons associated with
mental illness and neurological disorders. The neuroscience community is
actively engaged in understanding these apparently conflicting results,
and as one neuroscientist has summarized the situation, "It is important
to keep an open mind and to be inquisitive and creative, in order to
separate truths from myths" (von Bartheld, 2018, p. 12). Behavioral
neuroscience is a dynamic and everchanging field. As you read, consider
not only the facts, but also the research process used to obtain those
facts, and the exciting possibility that there is still much to learn
about the brain and the nervous system. The last frontier in this
world---and perhaps the greatest one---lies within us. The human nervous
system makes possible all that we can do, all that we can know, and all
that we can experience. Its complexity is immense, and the task of
studying it and understanding it dwarfs all previous explorations our
species has undertaken.

Foundations of Behavioral Neuroscience Behavioral neuroscience was
formerly known as physiological psychology, and it is still sometimes
referred to by that name. In fact, the first psychology textbook,
written by Wilhelm Wundt in the late nineteenth century, was titled
Principles of Physiological Psychology. In recent years, the explosion
of information from experimental biology, chemistry, animal behavior,
psychology, computer science, and other fields has contributed to
creating the diverse interdisciplinary field of behavioral neuroscience.
This united effort is due to the realization that the ultimate function
of the nervous system is behavior. When we ask our students what they
think the ultimate function of the brain is, they often say "thinking,"
or "logical reasoning," or "perceiving," or "remembering things." The
nervous system does perform these functions, but they all support a
single primary function: control of movement. (Note that movement
includes speech and other forms of communication, an important category
of human behavior.) The basic function of perception is to inform us of
what is happening in our environment so that our behaviors will be
adaptive and useful: Perception without the ability to act would be
useless. Once perceptual abilities evolved, they could be used for
purposes other than guiding behavior. For example, we can enjoy a
beautiful sunset or a great work of art without our perception causing
us to do anything in particular. And thinking can often take place
without causing any overt behavior. However, the ability to think
evolved because it permits us

M01_CARL0287_13_GE_C01.indd 17

to perform complex behaviors that accomplish useful selfpreserving
goals. And whereas reminiscing about things that happened in our past
can be an enjoyable pastime, the ability to learn and remember
evolved---again---because it permitted our ancestors to profit from
experience and perform behaviors that were useful to them. The growing
field of behavioral neuroscience has been formed by scientists who have
combined the experimental methods of psychology with those of physiology
and have applied them to the issues that concern researchers in many
different fields. Research in neuroscience includes topics in perceptual
processes, control of movement, sleep and waking, reproductive
behaviors, ingestive behaviors, emotional behaviors, learning, and
language. In recent years we have begun to study the neuroscience
underlying significant human health concerns, such as substance abuse
and neurological and mental disorders. These topics are discussed in
subsequent chapters.

The Goals of Research LO 1.1

Compare the roles of generalization and reduction in behavioral
neuroscience research.

The goal of all scientists is to explain the phenomena they study. But
what do we mean by explain? Scientific explanation takes two forms:
generalization and reduction. Generalization refers to explanations as
examples of general laws, which are revealed through experiments.
Reduction refers to explanations of complex phenomena in terms of
simpler ones. Behavioral neuroscientists seek to explain behavior by
studying the physiological processes that control it. But behavioral
neuroscientists cannot just be reductionists. It is not enough to
observe behaviors and correlate them with physiological events that
occur at the same time. We also need to understand the function of a
given behavior. For example, mice, like many other mammals, often build
nests. Behavioral observations show that mice will build nests under two
conditions: when the air temperature is low and when the animal is
pregnant. A nonpregnant mouse will build a nest only if the temperature
is cool, whereas a pregnant mouse will build one regardless of the
temperature. The same behavior occurs for different reasons.
Nest-building behavior is controlled by two different physiological
mechanisms. Nest building can be studied as a behavior related to the
process of temperature regulation, or it can be studied in the context
of parental behavior. Although the same set of brain mechanisms will
control the movements that a mouse makes in building a nest in both
cases, these mechanisms will be activated by different parts of the
brain. One part receives information from the body's temperature
detectors, and the other part is influenced by hormones that are present
in the body

Roots of Behavioral Neuroscience LO 1.2

Summarize historical and contemporary contributions to behavioral
neuroscience from various scientific disciplines.

This section traces some of the discoveries of the past that have
contributed to the field of behavioral neuroscience today and have
helped advance our understanding of mind, brain, and behavior.
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE ANCIENT WORLD: ROLE OF THE HEART AND BRAIN Study
of (or speculation

about) the physiology of behavior has its roots in antiquity. A papyrus
scroll from around 1700 b.c.e. contains surgical records of head
injuries and the oldest surviving descriptions of the brain,
cerebrospinal fluid, meninges, and skull (Feldman and Goodrich, 1999).
Because its movement was necessary for life and because emotions caused
it to beat more strongly, ancient Egyptian, Indian, and Chinese cultures
considered the heart to be the seat of thought and emotions. The ancient
Greeks did too, but Hippocrates (460--370 b.c.e.) concluded that this
role should be assigned to the brain.

during pregnancy. It is not enough to observe behaviors and correlate
them with physiological events that occur at the same time. We must
understand the overall function of a given behavior. Sometimes,
physiological mechanisms can tell us something about psychological
processes such as language, memory, or mood. For example, damage to a
particular part of the brain can cause very specific impairments in a
person's language abilities. The nature of these impairments suggests
how these abilities are organized in the brain. When the damage involves
a brain region that is important in analyzing speech sounds, it also
produces deficits in spelling. This finding suggests that the ability to
recognize a spoken word and the ability to spell it rely on related
brain mechanisms. Damage to another region of the brain can produce
extreme difficulty in reading unfamiliar words by sounding them out, but
it does not impair the person's ability to read words with which they
are already familiar. This finding suggests that reading comprehension
can take two routes: one that is related to speech sounds and another
that is primarily a matter of visual recognition of whole words. In
practice, the research efforts of behavioral neuroscientists involve
both forms of explanation: generalization and reduction. Ideas for
experiments are stimulated by the investigator's knowledge both of
psychological generalizations about behavior and of physiological
mechanisms. A good behavioral neuroscientist must therefore be an expert
in the study of behavior and the study of physiology.

Not all ancient Greek scholars agreed with Hippocrates. Aristotle
(384--322 b.c.e.), for example, thought the brain served to cool the
passions of the heart. Galen (130--200 c.e.) dissected and studied the
brains of cattle, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, weasels, monkeys, and apes
(Finger, 1994), and concluded that Aristotle's theory about the brain's
role was "utterly absurd, since in that case Nature would not have
placed the encephalon \[brain\] so far from the heart, . . . and she
would not have attached the sources of all the senses \[the sensory
nerves\] to it" (Galen, 1968 translation, p. 387). (See Figure 1.1.)
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PHILOSOPHY: THE MIND-- BODY QUESTION From the
earliest historical times,

human beings have believed that they possess something intangible that
animates them: a mind, or a soul, or a spirit. We each also have a
physical body, with muscles that move it and sensory organs such as eyes
and ears that perceive information about the world around us. Within our
bodies the nervous system plays a central role, receiving information
from the sensory organs and controlling the movements of the muscles.
But what role does the mind play? Does it control the nervous system? Is
it a part of the nervous system? Is it physical and tangible, like the
rest of the body, or is it a spirit that will always remain hidden? This
puzzle has historically been called the mind--body question.
Philosophers have been trying to answer it for many centuries, and more
recently scientists have taken up the task. In general, people have
followed two different approaches: dualism and monism. Dualism is a
belief in the dual nature of reality, which means that mind and body are
separate. From a dualist perspective the body is made of ordinary
matter, but the mind is not. Monism is a belief that everything in the
universe consists of matter and energy and that the mind is a phenomenon
produced by the workings of the nervous system. (See Figure 1.2.)

25/11/21 8:05 AM

Introduction 19

Figure 1.2 The Mind--Body Question Monism and dualism pose two possible
answers to the mind--body question.

Mind is produced by the brain

The French philosopher René Descartes's (1596--1650) speculations
concerning the roles of the mind and brain in the control of behavior
provide a good starting point in the modern history of behavioral
neuroscience. To Descartes, animals were mechanical devices. He believed
their behavior was controlled by environmental stimuli. His view of the
human body was much the same: It was a machine. As Descartes observed,
some movements of the human body were automatic and involuntary. For
example, if a person's finger touched a hot object, the arm would
immediately withdraw from the source of stimulation. Reactions like this
did not require participation of the mind; they occurred automatically.
Descartes called these actions ­reflexes. (See Figure 1.3.) Like most
philosophers of his time, Descartes was a dualist and believed that each
person possessed a mind--- a uniquely human attribute that was not
subject to the laws of the universe. But his thinking differed from that
of his predecessors in one important way: He was the first to suggest
that a link exists between the human mind and its purely physical
housing, the brain. He believed that the mind controlled the movements
of the body, while the body, through its sense organs, supplied the mind
with information about what was happening in the environment. In
particular, he hypothesized that this interaction took place in the
pineal body, a small organ situated on top of the brain stem, buried
beneath the cerebral hemispheres. He noted that the brain contained
hollow chambers (the ventricles) that were filled with fluid, and he
hypothesized that this fluid was under pressure. When the mind decided
to perform an action, it tilted the pineal body in a particular
direction like a little joystick, causing fluid to flow from

M01_CARL0287_13_GE_C01.indd 19

Dualism Mind is separate from the brain

the brain into the appropriate set of nerves. This flow of fluid caused
muscles to inflate and move. As you'll learn in the rest of this
section, it did not take long for biologists to disprove Descartes's
belief about the brain using pressurized fluid to control behavior.
Speculating about the nature of the mind can get us only so far. If we
could answer the mind--body question simply by thinking about it,
philosophers would have done so long ago. Behavioral neuroscientists
take an empirical, monistic approach to the study of human nature. Most
neuroscientists believe that once we understand the workings of the
human body---and, in particular, the

Figure 1.3 Descartes's Model Descartes believed that the "soul" (what we
now call the mind) controls the movements of the muscles through its
influence on the pineal body. According to his theory, the eyes sent
visual information to the brain, where it could be examined by the soul.
When the soul decided to act, it would tilt the pineal body (labeled H
in the diagram), which would divert pressurized fluid through nerves to
the appropriate muscles. Oxford Science Archive/Heritage Images/The

will be resolved. We will be able to explain how we perceive, how we
think, how we remember, and how we behave. We will even be able to
explain the nature of our own self-awareness. CONTRIBUTIONS FROM
PHYSIOLOGY: ELECTRICAL COMMUNICATION IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM Luigi

Galvani (1737--1798), an Italian physiologist, found that electrically
stimulating a frog's nerve contracted the muscle to which it was
attached. Contraction occurred even when the nerve and muscle were
detached from the rest of the body, so the ability of the muscle to
contract and the ability of the nerve to send a message to the muscle
were characteristics of these tissues themselves. Contrary to
Descartes's description, the brain did not inflate muscles by directing
pressurized fluid through the nerve. Galvani's experiment prompted
others to study the nature of the message transmitted by the nerve and
the means by which muscles contracted. One of the most important figures
in the development of experimental physiology was Johannes Müller
(1801--1858), a German physiologist. Müller applied experimental
techniques to physiology. Previously, most natural scientists had been
limited to observation and classification. Although these activities are
essential, Müller insisted that major advances in our understanding of
the workings of the body would be achieved only by experimentally
removing or isolating animals' organs, testing their responses to
various chemicals, and otherwise altering the environment to see how the
organs responded. His most important contribution to the study of the
physiology of behavior was his doctrine of specific nerve ­energies.
Müller observed that although all nerves carry the same basic
message---an electrical impulse---we perceive the messages of different
nerves in different ways. For example, messages carried by the optic
nerves produce sensations of visual images, and those carried by the
auditory nerves produce sensations of sounds. How can different
sensations arise from the same basic message? Müller's answer was that
the messages occur in different channels. The portion of the brain that
receives messages from the optic nerves interprets the activity as
visual stimulation, even if the nerves are actually stimulated
mechanically. (For example, when we rub our eyes, we see flashes of
light.) Because different parts of the brain receive messages from
different nerves, the brain must be functionally divided: Some parts
perform some functions, while other parts perform others. In 1870,
German physiologists Gustav Fritsch (1838-- 1927) and Eduard Hitzig
(1838--1907) used electrical stimulation as a tool for understanding the
physiology of the brain. They applied weak electrical current to the
exposed surface of a dog's brain and observed the effects of the
stimulation. They found that stimulating different portions

M01_CARL0287_13_GE_C01.indd 20

of a specific region of the brain caused specific muscles to contract on
the opposite side of the body. We now refer to this region as the
primary motor cortex, and we know that nerve cells there communicate
directly with those that cause muscular contractions. We also know that
other regions of the brain communicate with the primary motor cortex to
control behaviors. For example, regions of the brain involved in speech
communicate with the portion of the primary motor cortex that controls
the muscles of the lips, tongue, and throat, which we use to speak.
German physicist and physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821--1894)
studied many physiological processes and was the first scientist to
attempt to measure the speed of conduction through nerves. Scientists
had previously believed that such conduction was identical to the
conduction that occurs in wires, traveling at approximately the speed of
light. But Helmholtz found that neural conduction was much slower---only
about 27.4 meters per second. This measurement proved that neural
conduction was more than a simple electrical message, as we will see in
Chapter 2. CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ANATOMY: STRUCTURE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
Müller's advocacy of experi-

mentation and the logical deductions from his doctrine of specific nerve
energies set the stage for other scientists to perform experiments
directly on the brain. Pierre Flourens (1794--1867), a French
researcher, did just that. Flourens removed various parts of animals'
brains and observed their behavior. By seeing what the animal could no
longer do, he could infer the function of the missing portion of the
brain. This method is called experimental ablation. Flourens claimed to
have discovered the regions of the brain that control heart rate and
breathing, purposeful movements, and visual and auditory reflexes. Soon
after Flourens performed his experiments, Paul Broca (1824--1880), a
French surgeon, applied the principle of experimental ablation to the
human brain. He did not intentionally remove parts of human brains to
see how they worked but observed the behavior of people whose brains had
been damaged by strokes. In 1861 he performed an autopsy on the brain of
a man who had had a stroke that resulted in the loss of the ability to
speak. Broca's observations led him to conclude that a portion of the
cerebral cortex on the front part of the left side of the brain performs
functions that are necessary for speech. This came to be known as
Broca's area. (See Figure 1.4.) Other physicians soon obtained evidence
supporting his conclusions. As you will learn in Chapter 14, the control
of speech is not localized to only one particular region of the brain.
Speech requires many different functions, which are organized throughout
the brain. Nonetheless, the method of experimental ablation remains
important to our understanding of the brains of both humans and
laboratory animals.

Jan Purkinje (1787--1869), a Czech physiologist, studied both the
central and peripheral nervous systems in the middle of the nineteenth
century. He discovered Purkinje fibers---neurons terminating on cardiac
cells responsible for controlling contractions of the heart. He also
used the microscope to investigate the structure of neurons in many
regions of the brain, which included discovering Purkinje cells in the
cerebellum (Chvátal, 2017). Late in the nineteenth century, Spanish
anatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852--1934) used the Golgi staining
technique (described in Chapter 5) to examine individual neurons of the
brain. His drawings of neurons (made under magnification from a
microscope) from the brain, spinal cord, and retina depicted the
detailed structures of these cells for the first time. Cajal proposed
that the nervous system consisted of billions of discrete, individual
neurons, in opposition to the predominant idea of the time that the
nervous system was a continuous network. In 1906, he was awarded the
Nobel Prize for his work describing the structure of the nervous system.
Figure 1.5 shows one of his drawings. CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH
CONTRIBUTIONS

Twentieth-century developments in experimental physiology included many
important inventions, such as sensitive amplifiers to detect weak
electrical signals, neurochemical techniques to analyze chemical changes
within and between cells, and histological techniques to visualize cells
and their constituents. These and many other important developments are
discussed in detail in subsequent chapters. Briefly, highlights in
contributions to neuroscience during the twentieth century include
discoveries ranging from the electrical and chemical messages used by
neurons, to the circuits and brain structures involved in a wide variety

M01_CARL0287_13_GE_C01.indd 21

of behaviors, such as the mirror neuron system for coordinating social
behavior (described in Chapter 8). Other developments contributed to new
brain-based treatments for disorders such as severe depression and
Parkinson's disease (Chapters 16 and 17). The twenty-first century has
already witnessed several important advances and discoveries. As
researchers continue to refine their understanding of the structures and
functions of the brain, new discoveries about pathways and circuits
abound. For example, the 2014 Nobel Prize was awarded to John O'Keefe
(1939--), May-Britt Moser (1963--), and Edvard Moser (1962) for work on
spatial positioning systems in the brain (also called the brain's global
positioning system, or GPS). In 2017, Jeffrey Hall (1945--), Michael
Rosbash (1944--), and Michael Young (1949--) received the Nobel Prize
for their work describing the molecular mechanisms controlling circadian
rhythms. New genetic techniques have spurred many exciting discoveries
in neuroscience as well. The development of optogenetics provides
researchers with the ability to

22 Chapter 1 selectively activate single neurons and observe changes in
behavior---using light! (See Chapter 5.) The development of CRISPR-Cas9
techniques have enabled precise editing of genetic material (DNA). This
technique uses an enzyme (Cas9) to cut out pieces of DNA paired with a
set of replacement directions (guide RNA) to create modified genes. The
impact of this technique on behavioral neuroscience is just beginning to
be understood. The field of epigenetics focuses on the role of the
environment in the expression of genes. Researchers continue to learn
more about how environmental-dependent gene expression can have a
profound impact on an individual's behavior. As behavioral neuroscience
continues to progress as an interdisciplinary field, efforts such as the
European Human Brain Project, which is working to develop a computer
simulation of the brain, and the Brain Research through Advancing
Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative in the United States
will continue to bring together

groups of researchers from biology, chemistry, engineering, psychology,
physiology, and other fields. Behavioral neuroscience, after all, has
its roots---and its future---in interdisciplinary research. DIVERSITY IN
NEUROSCIENCE Neuroscience is a diverse interdisciplinary field whose
researchers work around the globe. The Society for Neuroscience was
founded in 1969, with 500 members committed to developing a professional
organization for scientists and physicians devoted to understanding the
brain and nervous system. This international organization now has
approximately 37,000 members from over 90 different countries. Reviewing
the list of Nobel Prizes related to neuroscience research in Table 1.1,
you'll notice the names of men and women from several different
countries. The field is currently striving to increase diversity through
inclusivity of women and underrepresented groups in the sciences.

Module Review: Foundations of Behavioral Neuroscience The Goals of
Research LO 1.1 Compare the roles of generalization and reduction in
behavioral neuroscience research. To explain the results of behavioral
neuroscience research, generalization can be used to reveal general laws
of behavior. Reduction can be used to explain complex phenomena in terms
of smaller, discrete phenomena. Both are critical to understanding human
behavior.

Roots of Behavioral Neuroscience LO 1.2 Summarize historical and
contemporary contributions to behavioral neuroscience from various
scientific disciplines. Ancient scholars disagreed on the importance of
the brain in behavior, and some attributed thought and emotion to the
heart. The mind--body question

M01_CARL0287_13_GE_C01.indd 22

influenced both historical (dualist) and contemporary (monist) views of
the brain. French philosopher Descartes described reflexes but believed
that other behavior was the product of pressurized fluid causing muscles
to contract. Early physiologists influenced the study of electrical
components of neural communication. Müller proposed the doctrine of
specific nerve energies while Fritsch and Hitzig studied the effects of
electrical stimulation of different brain regions. Galvani discovered
that nerves convey electrical messages, and von Helmholtz refined that
understanding to begin to account for chemical communication between
cells. Advances in research revealed the structure of the brain and the
cells of the nervous system. Flourens and Broca studied the functions of
brain regions using ablation. Purkinje and Cajal studied the structures
and functions of specific sets of neurons. Contemporary research
continues

Thought Question Today, behavioral neuroscience actively applies a
computational approach to complex topics in brain

Natural Selection and Evolution Following the tradition of Müller and
von Helmholtz, other biologists continued to observe, classify, and
think about what they saw, to arrive at new conclusions. One of the most
important and influential of these scientists was Charles Darwin
(1809--1882). (See Figure 1.6.) Darwin formulated the principles of
natural selection and the theory of evolution, which revolutionized
biology at the time and continues to shape the field of behavioral
neuroscience today. In science, a theory is an explanation that is
strongly supported by multiple lines of research with many converging
results.

Functionalism and the Inheritance of Traits LO 1.3

Describe the role of natural selection in the evolution of behavioral
traits.

Darwin's theory emphasizes that all of an organism's
­characteristics---its structure, its coloration, its behavior--- have
functional significance. For example, the strong talons and sharp beaks
that eagles possess permit the birds to catch and eat prey. Caterpillars
that eat green leaves are themselves green, and their color makes it
difficult for birds to see them against their usual background. Mother
mice construct nests, which keep their offspring warm and out of harm's
way. The behavior itself is not inherited. What is inherited is a
structure---the brain---that causes the behavior to occur. Darwin's
theory gave rise to functionalism, the principle that characteristics of
living organisms perform useful functions. So, to understand the
physiological basis of various behaviors, we must first understand what
these behaviors accomplish (their function). This means that we must
understand something about the natural history of the species being
studied so that the behaviors can be seen in context. To understand the
workings of something as complex as a nervous system, we should know
what its functions are. Organisms of today are the result of a long
series of changes due to genetic variability. Strictly speaking, we
cannot say that any physiological

M01_CARL0287_13_GE_C01.indd 23

physiology and in regulation of behavior. The interface of computational
technologies with the human brain may potentially expand human
capabilities beyond biological norms as well as aid patients with
devastating brain disorders. Which behavioral "superpower" would you
want to have and where would you start if you were to develop such a
project?

in these areas and others, particularly with regard to the genetic and
molecular bases of behavior. Today, behavioral neuroscience is a
diverse, international, and interdisciplinary field.

mechanisms of living organisms have a purpose. But they do have
functions, and these we can try to determine. For example, the forelimb
structures shown in Figure 1.7 are adapted for different functions in
different species of mammals. Adaptations also occur in brain
structures. For example, male songbirds such as the white-crowned
sparrow possess highly developed brain structures (such as the robust
nucleus of the archistriatum, high vocal center, and Area X) that differ
from some of their close, non-songbird relatives. (See Figure 1.7.) The
songbirds' unique structures allow them to learn and produce songs in
response to complex social and environmental stimuli. The function of
male song behavior in these species is to attract a mate and deter
rivals. The non-songbirds lack these brain structures and their
associated functions (Beecher and Brenowitz, 2005). Among the various
songbirds, in species in which only the males sing, males have larger
song brain structures compared to females. In species in which both
sexes sing duets, there is no difference between the size of the
structures in males and females (Brenowitz, 1997).

Darwin formulated his theory of evolution to explain the means by which
species acquired their adaptive characteristics. The cornerstone of this
theory is the principle of natural selection. Darwin noted that members
of a species were not all identical and that some of the differences
they exhibited were inherited by their offspring. If an individual's
characteristics permit it to reproduce more successfully, some of the
individual's offspring will inherit the favorable characteristics and
will themselves produce more offspring. As a result, the characteristics
will become more prevalent in that species. He observed that animal
breeders were able to develop strains that possessed particular traits
by mating together only animals that possessed the desired traits. If
artificial selection, controlled by animal breeders, could produce so
many varieties of dogs, cats, and livestock, perhaps natural selection
could be responsible for the development of species. Over the course of
time in the natural world, it was the environment, not the choices of
the animal breeder, that shaped the process of evolution. Darwin and his
fellow scientists knew nothing about the mechanism by which the
principle of natural selection works. In fact, the principles of
molecular genetics were

DM

(f) 

not discovered until the middle of the twentieth century. Briefly, here
is how the process works: Every sexually reproducing multicellular
organism consists of a large number of cells, each of which contains
chromosomes. Chromosomes are large, complex molecules that contain the
recipes for producing the proteins that cells need to grow and to
perform their functions. In essence, the chromosomes contain the
blueprints for the construction (that is, the embryological development)
of a particular member of a particular species. If the plans are
altered, a different organism is produced. The plans do get altered from
time to time; mutations occur. Mutations are accidental changes in the
chromosomes of sperm or eggs that join together and develop into new
organisms. For example, a random mutation of a chromosome in a cell of
an animal's testis or ovary could produce a mutation that affects that
animal's offspring. Most mutations are deleterious; the offspring either
fails to survive or survives with detrimental effects of the mutation.
Some mutations are beneficial and confer a selective advantage to the
organism that possesses them. An individual with a selective advantage
is more likely than other members of its species to live long enough to

25/11/21 8:06 AM

Introduction 25

reproduce and pass on its chromosomes to its own offspring. Many
different kinds of traits can confer a selective advantage: resistance
to a particular disease, the ability to digest new kinds of food, more
effective weapons for defense or for procurement of prey, and even a
more attractive appearance to potential mates. The traits that can be
altered by mutations are physical ones; chromosomes make proteins, which
affect the structure and chemistry of cells. But the effects of these
physical alterations can be seen in an animal's behavior. This means
that the process of natural selection can act on behavior indirectly.
For example, if a particular mutation results in changes in the brain
that cause a small animal to change its behavior and freeze when it
perceives a nearby movement, that animal is more likely to escape
undetected when a predator passes nearby. This tendency makes the animal
more likely to survive and produce offspring, passing on genes related
to freezing behavior to future generations. Other mutations are not
immediately favorable, but because they do not put their possessors at a
disadvantage, they are inherited by at least some members of the
species. As a result of thousands of such mutations, the members of a
particular species possess a variety of genes, and are all at least
somewhat different from one another. Variety is a definite advantage for
a species. Different environments provide optimal habitats for different
kinds of organisms. When the environment changes, species must adapt or
run the risk of becoming extinct. If some members of the species possess
assortments of genes that provide characteristics permitting them to
adapt to the new environment, their offspring will survive, and the
species will continue. An understanding of the principle of natural
selection plays some role in the thinking of every scientist who
undertakes research in behavioral neuroscience. Some researchers
explicitly consider the genetic mechanisms of various behaviors and the
physiological processes on which these behaviors depend. Others are
concerned with comparative aspects of behavior and its physiological
basis; they compare the nervous systems of animals from a variety of
species to make hypotheses about the evolution of brain structure and
the behavioral capacities that correspond to this evolutionary
development. But even though many researchers do not directly study
evolution, the principle of natural selection guides the thinking of
behavioral neuroscientists. We ask ourselves what the selective
advantage of a particular trait might be. We think about how nature
might have used a physiological mechanism that already existed to
perform more complex functions in more complex organisms. When we
entertain hypotheses, we ask ourselves whether a particular explanation
makes sense in an evolutionary perspective.

Evolution of Human Brains LO 1.4

Identify factors involved in the evolution of human brains.

To evolve means to develop gradually. The process of ­evolution is a
gradual change in the structure and ­physiology of a species as a result
of natural selection. New species evolve when organisms develop novel
characteristics that can take advantage of unexploited opportunities in
the environment. Appearance of the earliest humans can be traced back to
the Cenozoic period, when tropical forests covered much of the land
areas. In these forests our most direct ancestors, the primates,
evolved. The first primates were small and preyed on insects and small
cold-blooded vertebrates such as lizards and frogs. They had grasping
hands that permitted them to climb about in small branches of the
forest. Over time, larger species developed, with larger, forward-facing
eyes (and the brains to analyze what the eyes saw), which facilitated
moving among the trees and capturing prey. The evolution of
fruit-bearing trees provided an opportunity for fruit-eating primates.
In fact, the original advantage of color vision (and the associated
sensory regions of the brain) was probably the ability to discriminate
ripe fruit from green leaves in order to eat the fruit before it
spoiled---or some other animals got to it first. And because fruit is
such a nutritious form of food, its availability provided an opportunity
that could be exploited by larger primates, which were able to travel
farther in quest of food. The first hominids (humanlike apes) appeared
in Africa. They appeared not in dense tropical forests but in drier
woodlands and in the savanna. Our fruit-eating ancestors continued to
eat fruit, but they evolved characteristics that enabled them to gather
roots and tubers as well, to hunt and kill game, and to defend
themselves against other predators. They made tools that could be used
to hunt, produce clothing, and construct dwellings; they discovered the
many uses of fire; they domesticated dogs, which greatly increased their
ability to hunt and helped warn of attacks by predators; and they
developed the ability to communicate symbolically, by means of spoken
words. Figure 1.8 shows the primate family tree. Our closest living
relatives---the only hominids besides ourselves who have survived---are
the chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. DNA analysis shows that
genetically, there is very little difference between these four species.
For example, humans and chimpanzees share almost 99 percent of their
DNA. The first hominid to leave Africa did so around 1.7 million years
ago. This species, Homo erectus ("upright man"), scattered across Europe
and Asia. One branch of Homo erectus appears to have been the ancestor
of Homo neanderthalis, which inhabited Western Europe between 120,000
and 30,000 years ago. Neanderthals resembled modern humans. They made
tools out of stone and wood

and discovered the use of fire. Our own species, Homo sapiens, evolved
in East Africa around 100,000 years ago. Some of our ancestors migrated
to other parts of Africa and out of Africa to Asia, Polynesia,
Australia, Europe, and the Americas. (See Figure 1.9.) Humans possessed
several characteristics that allowed them to compete with other species.
Their agile hands enabled them to make and use tools. Their excellent
color vision helped them to spot ripe fruit, prey, and dangerous
predators. Their mastery of fire enabled them to cook food, provide
warmth, and frighten nocturnal predators. Their upright posture and
bipedalism (ability to walk using two rear limbs) made it possible for
them to walk long distances efficiently, with their eyes far enough from
the ground to see long distances across the plains. Bipedalism also
permitted them to carry tools and food with them, which meant that they
could bring fruit, roots, and pieces of meat back to their tribe. Their
linguistic abilities enabled them to combine the collective knowledge of
all the members of the tribe, to make plans, to pass information on to
subsequent generations, and to form complex civilizations that
established their status as the dominant species. All of these
characteristics required a primate brain capable of these complex
abilities. Sophisticated primate brains developed within the constraints
of the size of a mother's birth canal, and an

M01_CARL0287_13_GE_C01.indd 26

upright posture limits the size of a woman's birth canal. A newborn
primate's head is about as large as it can safely be. Because a baby's
brain is not large or complex enough to perform the physical and
intellectual abilities of an adult, the brain must continue to grow
after the baby is born. In fact, all mammals (and all birds, for that
matter) require parental care for a period of time while the nervous
system develops. The fact that young mammals (particularly young humans)
are guaranteed to be exposed to the adults who care for them means that
a period of apprenticeship is possible. Consequently, the evolutionary
process did not have to produce a brain that consisted solely of
specialized circuits of neurons that performed specialized tasks.
Instead, it produced a primate brain with an abundance of neural
circuits that could be modified by experience. Adults would nourish and
protect their offspring and provide them with the skills they would need
as adults. Some specialized circuits were necessary (for example, those
involved in analyzing the complex sounds we use for speech), but, by and
large, the primate brain is more similar to a generalpurpose,
programmable computer. What counts, as far as intellectual ability goes,
is having a brain with plenty of neurons that are available for
behavior, learning, remembering, reasoning, and making plans.

Number of cerebral cortex neurons (billions)

compared the brains of several species of rodents and primates and found
that primate brains contain more neurons per gram than rodent brains.
(See Figure 1.10.) Reflecting on their results, the researchers
concluded that "our standing among primates as the proud owners of the
largest living brain assures that, at least among primates, we enjoy the
largest number of neurons from which to derive cognition and behavior as
a whole" (Herculano-Houzel, 2009, p. 10). Can you predict what types of
functions these additional neurons might be devoted to in humans? What
types of genetic changes were responsible for the evolution of the human
brain? This question will be addressed in more detail in Chapter 15, but
evidence suggests that the most important principle is slowing the
process of brain development, allowing more time for growth. As we will
see, the prenatal period of cell division in the brain is prolonged in
humans, which results in a brain that weighs an average of 350 g and
contains approximately 86 billion neurons (Azevedo et al., 2009). After
birth the brain continues to grow. Production of new neurons almost
ceases, but those that are already present grow and establish
connections with each other, and other brain cells, which protect and
support neurons, begin to proliferate. Not until late adolescence does
the human brain reach its adult size of approximately 1,400 g---about
four times the weight of a newborn's brain. This prolongation of
maturation is known as neoteny (roughly translated as "extended youth").

Module Review: Natural Selection and Evolution Functionalism and the
Inheritance of Traits LO 1.3 Describe the role of natural selection in
the evolution of behavioral traits. Natural selection is the process
responsible for evolution of structures with specific functions. Members
of a species possess a variety of structures. If the structures permit
an individual to reproduce more successfully, its offspring will also
have these structures, and they will become more prevalent in the
population. An example of inherited structures responsible for behavior
is the set of brain structures responsible for male song behavior in
some species of songbirds.

Ethical Issues in Research with Humans and Other Animals This book
contains many facts about what is currently known about the structure
and function of the nervous system. Where do these facts come from? They
are the result of carefully designed experiments that can include
computer simulations, individual cells, and often humans and other
animals. Neuroscience research involving humans and other animals is
subject to important ethical considerations and oversight. This section
addresses these issues in more detail.

Research with Animals LO 1.5

Outline reasons for the use of animals in behavioral neuroscience
research.

Much of the research described in this book involves experimentation on
living animals. Any time we use another species of animals for our own
purposes, we should be sure that what we are doing is both humane and
worthwhile. It is important that a good case can be made that research
in behavioral neuroscience qualifies on both counts. Humane treatment is
a matter of procedure. We know how to maintain laboratory animals in
good health in comfortable, sanitary conditions. We know how to
administer anesthetics and analgesics so that animals do not suffer
during or after

M01_CARL0287_13_GE_C01.indd 28

complex vision, and language required a more complex primate brain.
Primate brains contain many more neurons per gram than other species.
These additional cells are responsible for behavior, learning,
remembering, reasoning, and making plans. Additional brain development
occurs after birth and throughout an extended period of development and
parental care in humans.

Thought Question Kavoi and Jameela (2011) reported that a part of the
brain responsible for olfaction, the olfactory bulb, is larger in dogs
than in humans, even after accounting for differences in overall brain
size. Using the principles of natural or artificial selection,
hypothesize how dogs came to have this larger structure in their brain
and predict how it might impact their behavior.

surgery, and we know how to prevent infections with proper surgical
procedures and the use of antibiotics. Most industrially developed
societies have strict regulations about the care of animals and require
approval of the experimental procedures that are used on them. There is
no excuse for mistreating animals in our care. In fact, the vast
majority of laboratory animals are treated humanely and many animal
researchers are also strong animal welfare advocates. Whether an
experiment is worthwhile can be difficult to say. We use animals for
many purposes. We eat their meat and eggs, and we drink their milk; we
turn their hides into leather; we extract insulin and other hormones
from their organs to treat people's diseases; we train them to do useful
work on farms or to entertain us. Even having a pet is a form of
exploitation; it is we---not they---who decide that they will live in
our homes. The fact is we have been using other animals throughout the
history of our species. Pet ownership has the potential to cause much
more suffering among animals than scientific research does. Pet owners
are not required to receive permission from a board of experts that
includes a veterinarian to house their pets, nor are they subject to
periodic inspections to be sure that their home is clean and sanitary,
that their pets have enough space to exercise properly, or that their
pets' diets are appropriate. Scientific researchers are required to have
all those things. The disproportionate amount of concern that animal
rights activists show toward the use of animals in research and
education is puzzling, particularly because this is the one
indispensable use of animals. We

can survive without eating animals, we can live without hunting, we can
do without furs; but without using animals for research and for training
future researchers, we cannot make progress in understanding and
treating diseases. In not too many years scientists will probably have
developed a vaccine that will prevent the further spread of diseases
such as Ebola virus disease, malaria, or AIDS. Even diseases that we
have already conquered would impact new lives if drug companies could no
longer use animals to develop and test new treatments. If they were
deprived of animals, these companies could no longer extract hormones
used to treat human diseases, and they could not prepare many of the
vaccines we now use to prevent disease. Our species is beset by medical,
psychological, and behavioral problems, many of which can be solved only
through biological research. Consider some of the major neurological
disorders. Strokes, like the one experienced by Jeremiah at the
beginning of this chapter, are caused by bleeding or obstruction of a
blood vessel within the brain, and often leave people partly paralyzed,
unable to read, write, or converse with their friends and ­family. Basic
animal research on the means by which nerve cells communicate with each
other has led to important discoveries about the causes of the death of
brain cells. This research was not directed toward a specific practical
goal; the potential benefits actually came as a surprise to the
investigators. Experiments based on these results have shown that if a
blood vessel leading to the brain is blocked for a few minutes, the part
of the brain that is nourished by that vessel will die. However, the
brain damage can be prevented by first administering a drug that
interferes with a particular kind of neural communication. This research
is important, because it may lead to medical treatments that can help to
reduce the brain damage caused by strokes. But it involves operating on
a laboratory animal, such as a rat, and pinching off a blood vessel.
(The animals are anesthetized.) Some of the animals will sustain brain
damage, and all will be euthanized so that their brains can be examined.
However, you will probably agree that research like this is just as
legitimate as using animals for food. As you will learn later in this
book, research with laboratory animals has produced important
discoveries about the possible causes or potential treatments of
neurological and mental disorders, including Parkinson's disease,
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, ­obsessive-compulsive
disorder, anorexia nervosa, obesity, and substance abuse. Although much
progress has been made, these problems persist, and they cause much
human suffering. Unless we continue our research with laboratory
animals, they will not be solved. Some people have suggested that
instead of using laboratory animals in our research, we could use tissue

M01_CARL0287_13_GE_C01.indd 29

cultures or computers. While these techniques can be used to pursue some
research questions, unfortunately, tissue cultures or computers are not
substitutes for complex, living organisms. We have no way to study
behavioral problems such as substance abuse in tissue cultures, nor can
we program a computer to simulate the workings of an animal's nervous
system. (If we could, that would mean we already had all the answers.)
OVERSIGHT OF ANIMAL RESEARCH

LO 1.6

Identify mechanisms for oversight of animal research.

In the United States, any institution that receives federal research
funding to use animals in research is required to have an Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The IACUC is typically composed
of a veterinarian, scientists who work with animals, non-scientist
members, and community members not affiliated with the institution. This
group reviews all proposals for research involving animals, with the
intent of ensuring humane and ethical treatment of all animals involved.
Even noninvasive research with animals (such as fieldwork or
observational studies) must pass review and be approved by the IACUC.
This approval process ensures not only the welfare of the animals, but
also that the research is compliant with local, state, and federal
regulations.

Research with Humans LO 1.7

Discuss ethical considerations in research with human participants.

Not all neuroscience research is conducted with animal models. Much of
what we currently understand about the brain and behavior is the result
of research with human participants. In addition to humane research
conditions, research with human participants must also include informed
consent and precautions to protect the identity of the participants.
Informed consent describes the process in which researchers must inform
any potential participant about the nature of the study, how any data
will be collected and stored, and what the anticipated benefits and
costs of participating will be. Only after obtaining this information
can the participant make an informed decision about whether to
participate in a study. Violating the informed consent process can have
ethical, legal, and financial consequences. In 2010, the case of
Havasupai Tribe v. Arizona Board of Regents was settled, including the
return of biological samples and a payment of \$700,000 to the Havasupai
tribe after six years of dispute. The settlement was issued in response
to a vague and incomplete informed consent process that resulted in the
use of blood samples originally intended for research on diabetes being
used in contested research

involving factors related to schizophrenia (Van Assche et al., 2013).
Protecting the identity of participants is crucial for all research with
human participants, and particularly important in behavioral
neuroscience research investigating potentially sensitive topics (for
example, the use of illicit drugs in studies of brain changes in
substance abuse). An emerging interdisciplinary field, neuroethics, is
devoted to better understanding implications of and developing best
practices in ethics for neuroscience research with human participants. A
2014 report from a panel of national experts explored the ethical
challenges of neuroscience research by investigating (1) neuroimaging
and brain privacy; (2) dementia, personality, and changed preferences;
(3) cognitive enhancement and justice; and (4) deep brain stimulation
research and the ethically difficult history of psychosurgery
(Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, 2014). The
panel recommendations included integrating ethics and science through
education at all levels. OVERSIGHT OF HUMAN RESEARCH

LO 1.8

Identify mechanisms for oversight of human research.

Much like animal research, research with human volunteers is essential
to advancing our knowledge of the brain in health and disease. Also
similar to animal research, work with human participants is subject to
strict regulation and must be reviewed and approved by a board of
experts and

laypeople. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) functions similarly to
the IACUC to ensure ethical treatment of volunteers in research. (See
Figure 1.11.) The IRB is typically composed of scientific experts,
laypeople, and members of the community. This group is tasked with
protecting human research participants.

The Future of Neuroscience: Careers and Strategies for Learning What is
behavioral neuroscience, and what do behavioral neuroscientists do? What
are the best ways to learn more about this diverse and exciting field?
By the time you finish this book, you will have a much richer answer to
these questions. The next section will describe the field---and careers
open to those who specialize in it. Likewise, we want to provide you
with some strategies to help you learn as you study this fascinating
discipline.

Careers in Neuroscience LO 1.9

Identify careers in behavioral neuroscience.

Behavioral neuroscience belongs to a larger field that is simply called
neuroscience. Neuroscientists concern themselves with all aspects of the
nervous system: its anatomy, chemistry, physiology, development, and
functioning. The research of neuroscientists ranges from the study of
molecular genetics to the study of social behavior. Behavioral
neuroscientists study all behavioral phenomena that can be observed in
humans and animals. They attempt to understand the role of the nervous
system, interacting with the rest of the body (especially the endocrine
system, which secretes hormones), in controlling behavior. They study
such topics as sensory processes, sleep, emotional behavior, ingestive
behavior, aggressive behavior, sexual behavior, parental behavior, and
learning and memory. They also study animal models of symptoms that
humans experience, such as anxiety, depression, phobia, and obsessions
and compulsions. Although the original name for the field described in
this book was physiological psychology, several other terms are now in
general use, such as biological psychology, biopsychology,
psychobiology, and---the most common one--- behavioral neuroscience. Two
other fields often overlap with that of behavioral neuroscience:
neurology and cognitive neuroscience. Neurologists are physicians who
diagnose and treat diseases of the nervous system. Most neurologists are
solely involved in the practice of medicine, but some engage in
research. They study the behavior of people whose brains have been
damaged by natural causes,

M01_CARL0287_13_GE_C01.indd 31

by society. For example, if you wish to create a drug or a ­device that
would eliminate aggression in humans, identify the ethical challenges
you would encounter. Think about the main ethical issue in this case and
ask your friends if they agree or not.

using advanced brain-imaging techniques to study the activity of various
regions of the brain as a person participates in various behaviors. This
research is also carried out by cognitive neuroscientists---researchers
with a Ph.D. (usually in psychology) and specialized training in the
principles and procedures of neurology. Most professional behavioral
neuroscientists have received a Ph.D. from a graduate program in
psychology or from an interdisciplinary program. Programs can include
faculty members from departments such as psychology, biology, chemistry,
biochemistry, or computer science. Most professional behavioral
neuroscientists are employed by colleges and universities, where they
are engaged in teaching and research. Others are employed by
institutions devoted to research---for example, in laboratories owned
and operated by national governments or by private philanthropic
organizations. A few work in industry, usually for pharmaceutical
companies that are interested in assessing the effects of drugs on
behavior. To become a professor or independent researcher, one must
receive a doctorate---usually a Ph.D., although some people turn to
research after receiving an M.D. Most behavioral neuroscientists spend
two years or more in a postdoctoral position after completing their
graduate degree, working in the laboratory of a senior scientist to gain
more research experience. During this time they write articles
describing their research findings and submit them for publication in
scientific journals. These publications are an important factor in
obtaining an independent position. Not all people who are engaged in
neuroscience research have doctoral degrees. Research technicians with
bachelor's or master's level degrees perform essential--- and
intellectually rewarding---services working with senior scientists.
Technicians can continue to gain experience and education on the job,
enabling them to assume responsibility for managing and completing
projects independently. (See Figure 1.12).

High School

Students interested in neuroscience may take courses in biology,
chemistry, psychology, or other sciences in high school.

College

Students interested in neuroscience may study biology, chemistry,
psychology, neuroscience, or other related areas. Some students work as
research assistants in laboratories and develop mentored relationships
with researchers. College graduates interested in neuroscience can work
as research technicians or assistants.

Graduate Training

Students can pursue advanced graduate t­raining for one or more years
after college. Graduate ­training typically involves advanced coursework
and more ­independent research. Graduate students are e ­ xpected to
conduct research (with the guidance of a research mentor) and
disseminate the results of their work. After completing a graduate
program, individuals may teach in a secondary or postsecondary
institution, ­conduct research, or work in industry.

Postgraduate Training

Postgraduate positions are more independent and often involve additional
training in specialized research areas or with specialized research
techniques. After completing postgraduate training, individuals may
teach in a secondary or postsecondary institution, ­conduct research, or
work in industry.

recent years) have been learning a lot about how it works. It is
impossible to summarize this progress in a few simple sentences;
therefore, this book contains a lot of information. We have tried to
organize this information logically, telling you what you need to know
in the order in which you need to know it. (To understand some things,
you sometimes need to understand other things first.) We have also tried
to write as clearly as possible, making examples as simple and as vivid
as we can. Still, you cannot expect to fully understand the information
in this book by simply giving it a passive read; you will have to do
some work. Learning about behavioral neuroscience involves much more
than memorizing facts. Of course, there are facts to be memorized: names
of parts of the nervous system, names of chemicals and drugs, scientific
terms for particular phenomena and procedures used to investigate them,
and so on. But the quest for information is nowhere near completed; we
know only a small fraction of what we have to learn. And almost
certainly, many of the "facts" that we now accept will someday be shown
to be incorrect. If all you do is learn facts, where will you be when
these facts are revised? Our goal is to offer some practical advice
about studying. You have been studying throughout your academic career,
and you have undoubtedly learned some useful strategies along the way.
Even if you have developed efficient and effective study skills, at
least consider the possibility that there might be some ways to improve
them. This section is intended to provide you with suggestions to
maximize your learning about behavioral neuroscience. These suggestions
are supported by empirical research on learning. • Write notes that
organize information into meaningful groups; don't just highlight.
Connecting new information to prior knowledge is an important means for
learning. To do this will require actively thinking about the new
information at hand and finding ways to link it to your current
understanding. This is an active and involved process that will take
some time and effort. Highlighting or underlining without combining the
information into your own notes is passive and does not facilitate
learning and retention the way that writing or typing your own notes
does. Previous research has demonstrated that highlighting and
underlining alone do not improve test scores, and in some cases may even
be detrimental to learning (Dunlosky et al., 2013). • Teach yourself by
teaching someone else. After reading a section or chapter, consider how
you would teach the information to someone else---a classmate, a friend,
or maybe a curious family member. This activity will help you to think
about the most important aspects of the section. Nestojko and colleagues
(2014) found that students who prepared to teach others about the
content of a complex reading assignment performed better on a later test
than students who had prepared themselves for a test on the reading.

M01_CARL0287_13_GE_C01.indd 33

• Study in the environment you will be tested in or vary your study
environments. State-dependent learning theory says that information
learned in one environment is most readily recalled in the same
environment. The rationale behind this performance-boosting effect of
environment is that the context (e.g., the color of the walls, the
chair, the people around you) provides important cues that help you
recall what was previously learned in that environment. If you're not
able to study in the same environment as you will be tested, you can try
to incorporate as many of the same elements as possible (e.g., use the
same computer, pens, procedure for note taking, etc.) or you can study
in many different environments (e.g., at home, in the student union, in
your residence hall) so that you will not become dependent on any one
single cue or set of cues when you are tested. In an interesting test of
state dependent learning, Godden and Baddeley (1975) tested college
student scuba divers on information they read while underwater or on
land. Students recalled information learned underwater the best in an
underwater test. The students performed most poorly on the tests of
information in a different context (for example, information learned
underwater but tested on land). • Study with the absolute minimum of
distractions. Your brain works best when it focuses on one challenging
task (like learning about neuroscience!) at a time (Hattie and Yates,
2014). Turn off televisions, social media, and phones whenever possible,
and try to study in a quiet environment. Lee and colleagues (2012)
assigned college students learning about science, history, and politics
to three groups: reading in silence, reading with a TV show playing in
the background that students could ignore, and reading with a TV show
playing in the background that students would later be tested on so that
they would be sure to pay attention to both the TV show and their
assigned study material. Students were instructed to read and answer
multiple choice questions. As you might have guessed, students who tried
to read and pay attention to the TV show performed the worst on the
test. • Don't cram! Spread out your study sessions. Studying new
information in two shorter but separated sessions leads to more
effective recall than studying in one long session. Don't cram. Instead,
plan to study something new once, then study it again a different day
before being asked to recall or apply it on a final test or assignment.
Though you should plan your own study sessions around your schedule and
based on assignment or test due dates in your class, some cognitive
spacing has already been built into this book for you. While there is no
"one size fits all" time period for spacing out reading and study
sessions, one to several days is a good rule of thumb (Carpenter et al.,
2012).

25/11/21 8:06 AM

34 Chapter 1 • Study the most challenging topic first or last. Classic
studies in psychology revealed that when people were asked to learn long
lists of words, the first words learned (the primacy effect) and the
last words learned (the recency effect) were the most likely to be
recalled. The same principles can hold true for learning about
behavioral neuroscience. For example, if you are reading about the
cortex, the thalamus, and the meninges in Chapter 3, and you already
know most of the parts of the meninges, but are not feeling confident
about your understanding of the cortex and thalamus, plan to study the
cortex first, then the meninges and finally the thalamus information. •
Use mnemonics. Mnemonics are shortcuts for helping retain new
information. For example, you could try story chaining by inventing a
short story to link together discrepant items; method of loci to use
images of physical locations enabling you to position items along an
imaginary walk; and acrostics to use a word to represent a list (such as
FPOT for the lobes of the cortex: frontal, parietal, occipital,
temporal) (Hattie and Yates, 2014). • Draw a picture. Trying to learn a
new term or concept? Try drawing a picture of it. Drawing improved
memory for new information compared to copying definitions, improved
memory in younger and older learners, and was effective when people
spent only four seconds drawing. Researchers attribute the improved
learning to the involvement of motor activity and active elaboration
involved in drawing (Fernandes et al., 2018; Meade et al., 2018). How
this book is organized: • The text, animations, interactives, and
illustrations are integrated as closely as possible. In our experience,

one of the most frustrating aspects of reading some books is not knowing
when to look at an illustration. Here, everything is presented to you as
you need it. • Each chapter begins with a case study that profiles a
person's real-life experience and a list of learning objectives. The
case studies are meant to personalize and make more relatable the
concepts we will discuss in the chapter. The learning objectives are
included to help you focus on the key ideas included in the chapter. •
You will notice that some words in the text are italicized, and others
are printed in boldface. Italics mean that either the word is being
stressed for emphasis or it is a new term. Terms in bold (listed in the
glossary of this book) are key terms that are part of the vocabulary of
the behavioral neuroscientist. You will see many of these terms used
again in later chapters. • At the end of each section, you will find two
different types of review activities: module reviews and thought
questions. The module reviews will remind you of key points from the
chapter, and the thought questions will challenge you to apply what you
have learned to a new context or to expand your thinking on a relevant
topic. Finally, there are chapter review questions at the end of each
chapter to help you assess your understanding of the concepts. Now that
you have a sense of what the field of behavioral neuroscience entails,
welcome to the rest of this book! The next chapter starts with the
structure and functions of neurons and supporting cells, the most
important elements of the nervous system.

Kathryn was getting desperate. She was healthy, ate well, and stayed
active with sports and regular exercise. She went to the gym almost
every day for cardio classes and swimming. But lately she had been
having trouble keeping up with her usual schedule. At first, she started
getting tired toward the end of her exercise classes. Her arms,
particularly, seemed to get heavy. Then when she started swimming, it
was hard to lift her arms over her head. She did not have any other
symptoms, so she told herself that she needed more sleep. Over the next
few weeks, things only got worse. Her exercise classes were more and
more difficult to complete. Her instructor became concerned and
suggested that Kathryn see her doctor. She made an appointment, but her
doctor found nothing wrong with her. She was not sick, showed no signs
of an infection, and seemed to be generally healthy. Her doctor asked
how things were going at work. Kathryn explained that she had been
experiencing a particularly stressful month at her job. Kathryn and her
physician agreed that increased stress could be the cause of her
problem. The doctor did not prescribe any medication, but asked Kathryn
to make another appointment if she did not feel better soon. She did
feel better for a while, but then all of a sudden her symptoms got
worse. She quit going to the gym and even had trouble finishing a day at
work. One afternoon she tried to look up at the clock on the wall and

see---her eyelids were drooping, and her head felt incredibly heavy.
Just then, one of her supervisors came over and asked her to report on
the progress she had made on a new project. As she spoke, she found
herself getting weaker and weaker. It even felt as if breathing took a
lot of effort. She managed to finish the conversation, but immediately
afterward she went home. She called her physician, who arranged for her
to go to the hospital to be seen by a neurologist. The neurologist
listened to a description of Kathryn's symptoms and examined her
briefly. The neurologist thought she might know what was wrong. She
prepared an injection and gave it to Kathryn. She started questioning
Kathryn about her job. Kathryn answered slowly, her voice almost a
whisper. As the questions continued, she realized that it was getting
easier and easier to talk. She straightened her back and took a deep
breath. She stood up and raised her arms above her head. "Look," she
said, her excitement growing. "I can do this again. I've got my strength
back! What did you give me? Am I cured?" The neurologist smiled
ruefully. "I wish it were that simple," she said. "No, I'm afraid you
aren't cured, but now we know what is causing your weakness. There is a
treatment. The injection I gave you lasts only for a few minutes, but I
can give you some pills that have effects that last much longer."
Indeed, as she was talking, Kathryn felt herself weakening, and she sat
down again.

38 Chapter 2 All we are capable of doing---perceiving, thinking,
learning, remembering, acting---is made possible by the integrated
activity of the cells of the nervous system. To understand how the
nervous system controls behavior, we need to understand its parts---the
cells that compose it. In Kathryn's case, the cells of her nervous
system were not functioning appropriately, causing her symptoms of
fatigue. Kathryn was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. The term
literally means "grave muscle weakness." It is an uncommon disorder, but
many experts believe that mild cases go undiagnosed. Although there are
drug treatments for myasthenia gravis, unfortunately there is currently
no cure. Developing new treatment options could benefit more people like
Kathryn and improve the quality of their lives (Binks et al., 2016;
Breiner et al., 2016). Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease. For
unknown reasons the immune system breaks down proteins in the nervous
system that allow cells to receive messages. Understanding the structure
and function of the cells of the nervous system allowed the neurologist
to diagnose and treat Kathryn. Kathryn's case highlights many of the key
topics you will learn about in this chapter, including communication
within and between cells of the nervous system. To learn more about the
specific cells involved in myasthenia gravis, look ahead to the section
"Termination of the Postsynaptic Potentials" on acetylcholine.

Figure 2.1 The Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems

The central nervous system (in pink) includes the brain and spinal cord.
The peripheral nervous system (in blue) includes all of the nerves that
relay information between the central nervous system and the rest of the
body. Brain Spinal cord Nerves

Cells of the Nervous System Just how many nerve cells, or neurons, are
there in the human brain? The best estimate is around 86 billion
neurons. Our brains contain approximately the same number of
non-neuronal cells too (Azevedo et al., 2009; von Bartheld et al.,
2016). The rest of the human nervous system contains even more cells.
The cells comprise the two basic divisions of the nervous system: the
central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.

The Nervous System: An Overview LO 2.1

Contrast features of the central and peripheral nervous systems.

The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and the spinal
cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of the nerves and
most of the sensory organs. (See Figure 2.1.) The CNS communicates with
the rest of the body through nerves attached to the brain and to the
spinal cord. Nerves are bundles of thousands of individual neurons, all
wrapped in a tough, protective membrane. Under a microscope, nerves look
something like electrical cables,

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 38

containing many bundles of wires. (See Figure 2.2.) Like the individual
wires in a cable, nerve fibers transmit messages through the nerve, from
a sense organ to the brain or from the brain to a muscle or gland.
Information, in the form of light, sound, odors, tastes, or contact with
objects, is gathered from the environment by specialized cells of the
PNS called sensory neurons. Motor behavior requires contracting muscles,
which are controlled by motor neurons in the PNS. Between sensory
neurons and motor neurons are the interneurons---neurons that lie
entirely within the CNS. Local interneurons form circuits with nearby
neurons and analyze small pieces of information. Relay interneurons
connect circuits of local interneurons in one region of the brain with
those in other regions. Through these connections, circuits of neurons
throughout the brain perform functions essential to tasks such as
perceiving, learning, remembering, deciding, and controlling complex
behaviors. (See Figure 2.3.) The rest of this module describes the most
important cells of the nervous system---neurons and their supporting
cells---and the blood--brain barrier, which chemically isolates cells in
the CNS from the rest of the body.

Structure and Functions of Cells of the Nervous System 39

Nerve

Neurons come in many shapes and varieties, according to the specialized
jobs they perform. Most neurons have, in one form or another, the
following four structures or regions: (1) cell body, or soma; (2)
dendrites; (3) axon; and (4) terminal buttons.

Bundle of axons

SOMA

Figure 2.2 Nerves A nerve consists of a membrane sheath encasing bundles
of axons.

The soma (cell body) contains the nucleus and much of the machinery
involved in the life processes of the cell. (See Figure 2.4.) Soma shape
can vary in different kinds of neurons.

DENDRITES Dendron is the Greek word for tree, and the

Figure 2.3 Sensory, Motor, and Interneurons These three types of neurons
relay information between the central and peripheral nervous systems. In
this example, the person sees the glass of water, and sensory nerves
relay the sensory information toward the central nervous system. The
motor output from the central nervous system allows the person to lift
the glass to take a drink.

Neurons LO 2.2

The neuron is the basic information-processing and
information-transmitting unit of the nervous system.

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 39

branched dendrites of the neuron look a lot like trees. (See Figure
2.4.) Neurons communicate with one another, and dendrites receive these
messages. Dendrites function much like antennas to receive messages from
other neurons. Just like an antenna can receive a message over a
distance (think of an antenna that detects radio or Wi-Fi signals),
dendrites receive neural messages that are transmitted across the
synapse (also referred to as the synaptic cleft), a small space between
the terminal buttons (described later) of the sending cell and a portion
of the somatic or dendritic membrane of the receiving cell.
Communication at a synapse typically proceeds in one direction: from the
terminal button (on the presynaptic cell, or sending cell) to the
membrane of the other cell (the postsynaptic cell, or receiving cell).
There are exceptions to this pattern, and as we will see in Chapter 4,
some synapses pass information in both directions. AXON The axon is a
long, thin tube. The outer surface of the axon carries information from
the cell body to the terminal buttons. The axon functions much like an
electrical cord carrying an electrical message from an outlet to an
appliance. (See Figure 2.4.) However, the basic message the axon carries
is called an action potential, and it involves both an electrical and a
chemical component. This is an important concept and will be described
in more detail later in the chapter. An action potential is a brief
electrical and chemical event that starts at the end of the axon near
the cell body at a point called the axon hillock, and travels to the
ends of the terminal buttons. In any given axon an action potential is
always exactly the same size and duration. If an action potential
reaches a point where the axon branches, it splits but does not diminish
in size. Each branch receives a full-strength action potential. Like
dendrites, axons and their branches come in different shapes. Axons can
be extremely long relative to their diameter and the size of the soma.
For example, the longest axon in a human stretches from the foot to the
base of the brain. Because some distant parts of the neuron may need
items that can be produced only in the soma, there must be a system that
can transport these items rapidly and efficiently inside the axon (like
a subway system). This process is axoplasmic transport. Action
potentials occur along the surface of the axon, but axoplasmic transport
moves substances

along "tracks" that run inside the length of the axon. (See Figure 2.5.)
This form of transport is accomplished by molecules of a protein called
kinesin. In the cell body, kinesin molecules, which resemble a pair of
legs and feet, attach to

the item being transported down the axon. The kinesin molecule then
walks down a microtubule, carrying the cargo to its destination (Yildiz
et al., 2004). Energy for this process is supplied by adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) molecules

Figure 2.5 Axoplasmic Transport This figure shows how kinesin molecules
transport cargo along the cytoskeleton from the soma to the terminal
button. Another protein, dynein, carries cargo from the terminal buttons
to the soma.

produced by the mitochondria. Another protein, dynein, carries
substances from the terminal buttons to the soma, a process known as
retrograde axoplasmic transport. Anterograde axoplasmic transport is
remarkably fast, moving contents at up to 500 millimeters (mm) per day.
Retrograde axoplasmic transport is about half as fast as anterograde
transport.

Most axons divide and branch many times. At the ends of the branches are
little knobs called terminal buttons. Terminal buttons have a very
important function: When an action potential traveling down the axon
reaches them, they secrete a chemical called a neurotransmitter. This
neurotransmitter (there are many different ones) either excites or
inhibits the receiving cell and helps determine whether an action
potential occurs in the receiving cell's axon. The release of
neurotransmitters from the terminal buttons is similar to being asked to
open an oven while something delicious is cooking. The axon sends a
message to the terminal buttons (check the oven) and a chemical message
is released to diffuse into the synapse, relaying a message from the
presynaptic cell to the postsynaptic cell (the smell of the food from
the open oven diffuses across a kitchen, alerting another person of the
meal to come). Details of this process will be described later in this
chapter. An individual neuron receives information from the terminal
buttons of axons of other neurons---and the terminal buttons of its
axons form synapses with other neurons. A neuron may receive information
from dozens or even hundreds of other neurons, each of which can form a
large number of synaptic connections with it. Figure 2.7 illustrates the
nature of these connections. As you can see, terminal buttons can form
synapses on the membrane of the dendrites or the soma (or even another
axon, as you'll see at the end of this chapter).

TERMINAL BUTTONS

MYELIN SHEATH The axon is often covered by a myelin sheath. Myelin is a
fatty substance that provides insulation for the electrical message
carried along the axon membrane, much like insulation on a wire isolates
an electrical current. (See Figures 2.4 and 2.5). Bundles of myelinated
axons appear as white matter in the brain and in nerves. In the brain,
these bundles of myelinated axons are sometimes referred to as tracts.
When looking at brain tissue that has been removed from the skull and
sectioned, the bundles appear white because of the fat content in the
myelin. Specialized neuroimaging techniques can be used to visualize the
myelin-dense white matter tracts in the brains of living organisms.
These techniques often add color overlays to the tracts to help
researchers better identify them in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
images (See Figure 2.6.)

an MRI scan and a female head. The fibers transmit action potentials

OTHER CELL STRUCTURES Figure 2.8 illustrates the inter-

nal structure of a typical neuron. Let's start from the outside of the
neuron and work our way in. Much like your skin, the cell membrane
defines the boundary of the neuron. It consists of a double layer of
lipid (fatlike) molecules. Embedded in the membrane are a variety of
protein molecules that have special functions. Some proteins detect
substances outside the cell (such as hormones) and pass information
about the presence of these substances to the interior of the cell.
Other proteins control access to the interior of the cell, allowing some
substances to enter but preventing others from entering. Still other
proteins act as transporters, using energy to transport certain
molecules into or out of the cell. Because the proteins that are found
in the membrane of the neuron are especially important for transmitting
information, their characteristics will be discussed in more detail
later in this chapter. The interior of the neuron contains a framework
of protein strands. Much like the bones of your skeletal system, this
framework, called the cytoskeleton, gives the neuron its shape. The
cytoskeleton is made of three kinds of protein strands, linked to each
other to form a cohesive mass. The thickest of these strands,
microtubules, are bundles of 13 protein filaments arranged around a
hollow core. In addition to providing structural support to the neuron,
the microtubules form the "tracks" for axoplasmic transport. (See Figure
2.5.) Cytoplasm is a semiliquid, jellylike substance that fills the
space surrounded by the membrane, including the

soma. It contains small, specialized structures, just as the human body
contains specialized organs. The generic term for these structures is
organelle, or "little organ." Some important organelles are described
next. Deep inside the cell is the nucleus. The nucleus is enclosed by
the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains the chromosomes. Chromosomes
consist of long strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The chromosomes
have an important function: They function like cookbooks and contain the
recipes for making proteins. Portions of the chromosomes, called genes,
contain the individual recipes for individual proteins.

Terminal button

Genes are responsible for initiating the process of ­protein synthesis in
the cell. An overview of protein synthesis is described next, followed
by additional ­ details in the subsequent paragraphs. When they are ­
active, the genes help produce another complex mol­ ecule, m ­ essenger r­
ibonucleic acid (mRNA). The mRNA copies the ­information stored by the
gene. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus with the copied information and
attaches to r­ibosomes in the soma. The ribosomes use the copied
information from the mRNA to synthesize proteins for the call. (See
Figure 2.9.)

Protein synthesis a two-step process. In the first step of the process,
transcription, information from DNA (which cannot leave the nucleus) is
transcribed into a portable form: mRNA. mRNA takes this information to
the ribosomes for the second step of the process: translation. During
translation, the ribosomes use the information from the mRNA to create
proteins from sequences of amino acids. To help you remember the process
of protein production, compare it to making a cake from a top-secret
recipe. Imagine that the recipe for the cake is found in a rare cookbook
in a library, and you cannot remove the cookbook from the library. You
can go into the library and take a picture of the recipe with the camera
on your cell phone. Now you have the information in a new, more portable
form. Next, you bring the picture of the recipe home with you to your
kitchen. There, you use the recipe information to combine raw
ingredients like flour, eggs, and milk into the cake batter that you
will bake. In this example, the cookbook locked in the library is like
the DNA stored in the nucleus. The process of photographing the cookbook
and removing the recipe information from the library represents
transcription of information from DNA in the nucleus to a new, more
portable form of information, mRNA. Taking the photo home and using the
information it contains to assemble raw materials into a final product
represents translation as the mRNA leaves the nucleus and

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 43

Ribosome

takes information to the ribosomes, which the ribosomes then use to
create proteins. Proteins are important to cell functions. In addition
to providing structure, proteins serve as enzymes, which direct the
chemical processes of a cell by controlling chemical reactions. Enzymes
are the cell's construction and demolition crews: They join particular
molecules together or split them apart. In this way, enzymes determine
what gets made from the raw materials in the cell and determine which
molecules remain intact. Found in the cytoplasm, mitochondria use
nutrients such as glucose to provide the cell with energy to perform its
functions. Mitochondria produce a chemical called ­adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), which can be used throughout the cell as an energy source.
Mitochondria perform a vital role in the economy of the cell. Many of
the biochemical steps involved in extracting energy by breaking down
nutrients take place within mitochondria, and are controlled by enzymes
located there. Most cell biologists believe that many eons ago,
mitochondria were free-living organisms that came to "infect" larger
cells. Because the mitochondria could extract energy more efficiently
than the cells they infected, the mitochondria became useful to the
cells and eventually became a permanent part of them. Because of their
role in generating usable energy, mitochondria can be considered the
"power plants" of neurons.

Supporting Cells LO 2.3

Compare supporting cells in the central and peripheral nervous systems.

Neurons constitute only about half the volume of the CNS. The rest of
the CNS contains of a variety of supporting cells. Neurons have a very
high rate of metabolism but have no means of storing nutrients, and they
must constantly be supplied with nutrients and oxygen or they will
quickly die. Because of this, the cells that support and protect neurons
are critical to our existence. SUPPORTING CELLS OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS
­SYSTEM The most important supporting cells of the CNS

are the neuroglia, or "nerve glue." Glia (also called glial cells) do
much more than just hold the nervous system together. Glial cells have a
wide variety of important functions in the nervous system. Neurons lead
a very sheltered existence. They are buffered physically and chemically
from the rest of the body by the glial cells. Glial cells surround
neurons and hold them in place, regulating their supply of nutrients and
some of the chemicals they need to exchange messages with other neurons.
Glial cells also insulate neurons from one another so that neural
messages do not get scrambled; destroy and remove pathogens or dead
neurons; are involved in growth, repair, and development of the nervous
system; and can be involved in synaptic communication. Here we will
focus on introducing three important types of glial cells: astrocytes,
oligodendrocytes, and

microglia. Additional types of glia have been recently discovered but
the full extent of their function in the nervous system is not yet known
(Dimou and Götz, 2014). Astrocytes Astrocyte means "star cell," a name
that refers to the shape of these cells. Astrocytes provide physical
support to neurons and clean up debris within the brain. (See Figures
2.10 and 2.13.) They produce some of the chemicals that neurons need to
fulfill their functions. They help to control the chemical composition
of the fluid surrounding neurons by actively taking up or releasing
substances whose concentrations must be kept within critical levels. The
somatic and dendritic membranes of neurons are largely surrounded by
astrocytes, and astrocytes are involved in providing nourishment to
neurons. In addition, astrocytes function as "neuron glue" and help hold
neurons in place. These cells also surround and isolate synapses,
limiting the dispersion of neurotransmitters that are released by the
terminal b ­ uttons. When cells in the central nervous system die,
certain kinds of astrocytes clear away the debris. These cells are able
to travel around the CNS. When these astrocytes contact a piece of
debris from a dead neuron, they engulf and digest it. This process is
called phagocytosis. If there is a lot of injured tissue to be cleaned
up, astrocytes will divide and produce enough new cells to do the job.
Once the dead tissue has been broken down, a framework of astrocytes
will be left to fill in the vacant area, and a specialized kind of
astrocyte will form scar tissue, walling off the area.

Figure 2.10 Structure and Location of Astrocytes The processes of
astrocytes surround capillaries and neurons of the central nervous
system. Astrocytes regulate chemicals in the synapses (upper panel) and
the chemical composition of the fluid surrounding neurons (lower panel).

Structure and Functions of Cells of the Nervous System 45

Oligodendrocytes The principal functions of oligodendrocytes are to
provide support to axons and to produce the myelin sheath, which
insulates most axons from one another. Myelin, 80 percent lipid and 20
percent protein, is produced by the oligodendrocytes in the form of a
tube surrounding the axon. This tube does not form a continuous sheath.
Instead, it consists of a series of segments, each approximately 1 mm
long, with a small (1--2 μm) portion of uncoated axon between the
segments. (A micrometer, abbreviated μm, is one-millionth of a meter, or
one-thousandth of a millimeter.) The bare portion of axon is called a
node of Ranvier, after the person who discovered it. The myelinated
axon, then, resembles a string of elongated beads. A given
oligodendrocyte produces up to 50 segments of myelin. During the
development of the CNS, oligodendrocytes form arms shaped like oars or
canoe paddles. Each of these paddle-shaped arms then wraps itself many
times around a segment of an axon and, while doing so, produces layers
of myelin. Each paddle becomes a segment of an axon's myelin sheath.
(See Figure 2.11.) Microglia As their name indicates, microglia are the
smallest of the glial cells. Like some types of astrocytes, they act as
phagocytes, engulfing and breaking down dead and dying neurons. But, in
addition, they serve as part of the immune system in the brain,
protecting the brain from invading microorganisms. Microglia are
primarily responsible for the inflammatory reaction in response to brain
damage, such as in a traumatic brain injury (Corps et al., 2014; Loane
and Kumar, 2016). SUPPORTING CELLS OF THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM In
the central nervous system, the oligodendro-

cytes support axons and produce myelin. In the peripheral

nervous system, the Schwann cells perform the same functions. Most axons
in the PNS are myelinated in segments, just as neurons are in the CNS.
Each myelin segment consists of a single Schwann cell wrapped many times
around the axon. In the CNS the oligodendrocytes grow paddleshaped arms
that wrap around multiple axons. In the PNS a Schwann cell provides
myelin for only one axon, and the entire Schwann cell---not just a part
of it---surrounds the axon. (See Figure 2.12.) Schwann cells also differ
from their CNS counterparts, the oligodendrocytes, in an important way.
A nerve consists of a bundle of many myelinated axons, all covered in a
sheath of tough, elastic connective tissue. If damage occurs to such a
nerve, Schwann cells help digest the dead and dying axons. Then the
Schwann cells arrange themselves in a series of cylinders that act as
guides for regrowth of the axons. The distal portions of the severed
axons die, but the stump of each severed axon grows sprouts, which then
spread in all directions. If one of these sprouts encounters a cylinder
provided by a Schwann cell, the sprout will grow through the tube
quickly (at a rate of up to 3--4 mm a day), while the other,
nonproductive sprouts wither away. If the cut ends of the nerve are
still located close enough to each other, the axons will reestablish
connections with the muscles and sense organs they previously served.
Unfortunately, the glial cells of the CNS are not as cooperative as the
supporting cells of the PNS. If axons in the brain or spinal cord are
damaged, new sprouts will form, as in the PNS. However, the budding
axons encounter scar tissue produced by the astrocytes, and they cannot
cross this barrier. Even if the sprouts could get through, the axons
would not reestablish their original connections without guidance
similar to that provided by the Schwann cells of the PNS. During
development, axons have two modes of growth. The first mode causes them
to elongate so that they reach their target, which could be as far away
as the other end of the brain or spinal cord. Schwann cells provide this
signal to injured axons. The second mode causes axons to stop elongating
and begin sprouting terminal buttons because they have reached their
target. Liuzzi and Lasek (1987) found that even when astrocytes do not
produce scar tissue, they appear to produce a chemical signal that
instructs regenerating axons to begin the second mode of growth: to stop
elongating and

08/11/2021 14:18

46 Chapter 2 start sprouting terminal buttons. This means that the
difference in the regenerative properties of axons in the CNS and the
PNS results from differences in the characteristics of the supporting
cells, not from differences in the axons. Not all myelin is the same.
The chemical composition of myelin differs between the CNS and PNS. This
has an important implication in multiple sclerosis. The autoimmune
attack in multiple sclerosis is specific to myelin produced by
oligodendrocytes in the CNS. The following case of Dr. C. illustrates
the brain changes and symptoms that result from this disorder.

One evening, after dinner with her spouse at her favorite restaurant,
Dr. C. stumbled and almost fell. This was the final straw: A retired
neurologist, she realized that she had been ignoring some symptoms that
she should have recognized earlier. Her symptoms fit those of multiple
sclerosis. She had occasionally experienced double vision, sometimes
felt unsteady on her feet, and noticed tingling sensations in her right
hand. None of these symptoms was serious, and they lasted for only a
short while, so she ignored them---or perhaps denied to herself that
they were important. After her formal diagnosis, Dr. C. lived with
multiple sclerosis for more than two decades. She ultimately died of a
heart attack. A few weeks after Dr. C.'s death, a group of medical
students and neurological residents gathered in an autopsy room at the
medical school. Dr. D., the school's neuropathologist, displayed a
stainless-steel tray on which were lying a brain and a spinal cord.
"These belonged to Dr. C.," he said. "Several years ago, she donated her
organs to the medical school." Everyone looked at the brain more
intently, knowing that it had belonged to a skilled physician and
teacher whom they all knew by reputation, if not personally. Dr. D.
showed the students MRI scans. He pointed out some white spots that
appeared on one scan. "This scan clearly shows some white-matter
lesions, but they are gone on the next one, taken six months later. And
here is another one, but it's gone on the next scan. The immune system
attacked the myelin sheaths in a particular region, and then glial cells
cleaned up the debris. Once the myelin is gone, the axons can no longer
conduct their messages." He put on a pair of gloves, picked up Dr. C.'s
brain, and cut it in several slices. He picked one up. "Here, see this?"
He pointed out a spot of discoloration in a band of white matter. "This
is a sclerotic plaque---a patch that feels harder than the surrounding
tissue. There are many of them, located throughout the brain and spinal
cord, which is why the disease is called multiple sclerosis." Dr. D. put
the spinal cord down and said, "Who can tell me the basis of this
disorder?" One of the students spoke up. "It's an autoimmune disease.
The immune system gets sensitized to the body's own myelin protein and
periodically attacks it, causing a variety of different neurological
symptoms. Some say that a childhood viral illness somehow causes the
immune system to start seeing the protein as foreign." "That's right,"
said Dr. D. "The primary criterion for the diagnosis of multiple
sclerosis is the presence of neurological symptoms that repeatedly come
and go over time. The symptoms

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 46

don't all occur at once, and they can be caused only by damage to
several different parts of the nervous system, which means that they
can't be the result of a stroke."

The Blood--Brain Barrier LO 2.4

Assess the function of the blood--brain barrier.

Over 100 years ago, Paul Ehrlich (1854--1915) discovered that if a blue
dye is injected into an animal's bloodstream, all tissues except the
brain and spinal cord will be tinted blue. However, if the same dye is
injected into the fluid-filled ventricles of the brain, the blue color
will spread throughout the CNS (Bradbury, 1979). This experiment
demonstrates that a barrier exists between the blood and the fluid that
surrounds the cells of the brain: the blood--brain barrier. Some
substances can cross the blood--brain barrier and enter the CNS, but
others cannot. The blood--brain barrier is selectively permeable. In
most of the body the cells that line the smallest blood vessels, the
capillaries, do not fit together absolutely tightly. Small gaps between
the capillary cells permit the free exchange of most substances between
the blood and the fluid outside the capillaries that surrounds the cells
of the body. In the CNS the capillaries don't have gaps, and many
substances cannot leave the blood to enter the brain. The walls of the
capillaries in the brain make up the blood--brain barrier. (See Figure
2.13.) Some substances must be actively transported through the

Figure 2.13 The Blood--Brain Barrier The blood--brain barrier is
selectively permeable. Some substances, such as water molecules, can
pass through the cells of the capillaries passively. Other molecules
require expending energy to move between the tightly packed cells of the
capillaries. Astrocytes further strengthen the barrier by closely
regulating any substances entering the brain from the capillaries. In
the rest of the body, larger gaps between the cells in the capillaries
allow greater movement of substances in and out of tissues.

capillary walls by special proteins. For example, glucose transporters
bring the brain its fuel, and other transporters rid the brain of toxic
waste products (Rubin and Staddon, 1999; Zlokovic, 2008). What is the
function of the blood--brain barrier? Transmitting messages from place
to place in the brain depends on a delicate balance between substances
within neurons and those in the extracellular fluid that surrounds them.
If the composition of the extracellular fluid is changed even slightly,
the transmission of these messages will be disrupted, which means that
brain functions will be disrupted. The presence of the blood--brain
barrier makes it easier to regulate the composition of this fluid. In
addition, many of the foods that we eat contain chemicals that would
interfere with the transmission of information

between neurons. The blood--brain barrier prevents these chemicals from
reaching the brain. The blood--brain barrier is not uniform everywhere
in the nervous system. In several places the barrier is more permeable,
allowing substances that are excluded elsewhere to cross freely. For
example, the area postrema is a part of the brain that controls
vomiting. The blood--brain barrier is much weaker there, permitting
neurons in this region to detect the presence of toxic substances in the
blood. (A barrier around the area postrema prevents substances from
diffusing from this region into the rest of the brain.) A poison that
enters the circulatory system from the stomach can stimulate the area
postrema to initiate vomiting. With luck, the poison can be expelled
from the stomach before causing too much damage.

Module Review: Cells of the Nervous System The Nervous System: An
Overview LO 2.1 Contrast features of the central and peripheral nervous
systems. The central nervous system (CNS) contains the brain and spinal
cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes the nerves and most
sensory organs outside the brain and spinal cord. The PNS communicates
with the CNS via nerves that relay sensory and motor information between
the brain and spinal cord, and the rest of the body.

Neurons LO 2.2 Distinguish among the structures of a neuron. Neurons
include four basic structures: the soma, dendrites, axon, and terminal
buttons. The soma contains the nucleus and many of the organelles. The
dendrites are branched structures attached to the soma that receive
messages from other neurons. The axon is a long, thin extension of the
soma that conveys a message to the terminal buttons. The myelin sheath
insulates the electrical message carried along the axon membrane. The
terminal buttons are extensions of the axon that convert the message to
a chemical form by releasing neurotransmitters into the synapse. Other
important structures include the cell membrane, cytoskeleton, cytoplasm,
nucleus, and mitochondria.

Supporting Cells LO 2.3 Compare supporting cells in the central and
peripheral nervous systems. In the CNS, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes,
and microglia support neurons by creating an environment conducive

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 47

to neuronal function, providing a myelin sheath, and activating immune
responses. In the PNS, Schwann cells provide myelin and facilitate
recovery from injury to neurons.

The Blood--Brain Barrier LO 2.4 Assess the function of the blood--brain
barrier. The blood--brain barrier protects the CNS, selectively
permitting only some substances to enter. The barrier is made of
capillary walls and helps regulate the composition of fluids in the
brain, protecting neuronal transmission. Capillaries in the brain are
surrounded by astrocytes, which also help regulate contents of the fluid
surrounding the capillaries. The blood--brain barrier is more permeable
in the area postrema, permitting neurons in this region to detect the
presence of toxic substances in the blood.

Thought Question While the blood--brain barrier helps prevent pathogens
from entering the brain, it can also prevent therapeutic molecules from
entering. Developing drugs that target sites in the brain can be
complicated by the difficulty of getting the molecules past the
blood--brain barrier to treat symptoms such as those of Alzheimer 's and
Parkinson's diseases. Imagine that you have been selected to research
techniques to enhance drug delivery across the blood--brain barrier.
What strategies might you test and why?

Communication Within a Neuron Building on an understanding of the
structure and function of neurons, we will next explore how neurons
communicate. This module describes the nature of communication within a
neuron---the ways in which neurons establish a membrane potential and
generate an action potential beginning at the axon hillock and traveling
along the axon to the terminal buttons, informing them to release some
neurotransmitter. As we will see in this module, an action potential
consists of a series of alterations in the membrane of the axon that
permit small charged particles called ions to move between the inside
and outside of the axon. These ion exchanges produce electrical
currents. The next module will describe synaptic transmission---how the
message is then conveyed to other neurons.

Neural Communication: An Overview LO 2.5

Explain the process of neural communication in a reflex.

Before discussing the action potential, let's step back and see how
neurons can interact to produce a useful behavior, such as a reflex. In
Figures 2.14 and 2.15 (and in subsequent figures that illustrate simple
neural circuits), neurons are depicted as several-sided stars. The
points of these stars represent dendrites, and only one or two terminal
buttons are shown at the end of the axon. The sensory neuron in this
example detects painful stimuli. When its dendrites are stimulated (such
as by contact

with a hot object), it sends messages down the axon to the terminal
buttons, which are located in the spinal cord. (See Figure 2.14.) The
terminal buttons of the sensory neuron release a neurotransmitter that
excites the interneuron, causing it to send messages down its axon. The
terminal buttons of the interneuron release a neurotransmitter that
excites the motor neuron, which sends messages down its axon. The axon
of the motor neuron joins a nerve and travels to a muscle. When the
terminal buttons of the motor neuron release their neurotransmitter, the
muscle cells contract, causing the hand to move away from the hot
object. So far, all of the synapses have had excitatory effects. Now
let's see the effect of inhibitory synapses. Imagine that you pick up a
cup of a steaming hot liquid. As you pick up the cup, the heat from the
liquid causes pain in your hand. The pain caused by the heat triggers a
withdrawal reflex that tends to make you drop the cup. Yet you manage to
hold it long enough to get to a table and put it down. What prevented
your withdrawal reflex from making you drop the cup on the floor? The
pain from the hot cup increases the activity of excitatory synapses on
the motor neurons, which tends to cause your hand to pull away from the
cup. However, this excitation is counteracted by inhibition, supplied by
another source: the brain. Your brain contains neural circuits that
recognize what a disaster it would be if you dropped the cup on the
floor. These neural circuits send information to the spinal cord that
prevents the withdrawal reflex from making you drop the cup. Figure 2.15
shows how this information reaches the spinal cord. An axon from a
neuron in the brain reaches the spinal cord, where its terminal buttons
form synapses with an inhibitory interneuron. When the neuron in the

which decreases the activity of the motor neuron, blocking the
withdrawal reflex. This circuit provides an example of a contest between
two competing tendencies: to drop the cup and to hold onto it. Reflexes
are generally more complicated than this description, and the mechanisms
that inhibit them are even more so. Thousands of neurons are involved in
this process. The few neurons shown in Figure 2.15 represent many
others: Dozens of sensory neurons detect the hot object, hundreds of
interneurons are stimulated by their activity, hundreds of motor neurons
produce the contraction--- and thousands of neurons in the brain must
become active to be able to inhibit the reflex. This simplified model
provides an overview of the process of neural communication, which is
described in more detail throughout the rest of this chapter.

Electrical Potentials of Axons LO 2.6

Describe membrane potential, resting potential, hyperpolarization,
depolarization, and the action potential.

Next, we will examine the nature of the message that is conducted along
the axon. This message consists of changes in electrical charge. An axon
at rest is negatively charged inside the membrane. Researchers have
developed electrical recording techniques using very small sensors
called microelectrodes that can be inserted into a neuron to record
changes in electrical activity across the axon membrane (see Chapter 5).
When inserted into an axon at rest, the microelectrode will detect a
negative charge inside the membrane. Most neurons are approximately 70
units, or -70 mV, more negatively charged inside the axon compared to
outside. Any difference in charge (positive or negative) across

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 49

the membrane is called the membrane potential. The term potential refers
to a stored-up source of energy---in this case, electrical energy. When
the neuron is at rest and not involved in communicating with any other
neurons, the membrane potential remains at approximately -70 mV, which
is called the neuron's resting potential. When the inside of an axon
becomes more negative (from resting potential) relative to the outside,
it is called hyperpolarization. When the inside of the axon becomes more
positive (from resting potential) relative to the outside, the neuron is
depolarized. A hyperpolarized axon is less likely to send an electrical
message. A depolarized axon is more likely to send an electrical
message. Each neuron has a threshold of excitation, or a set point, for
depolarization to trigger the main electrical event in an axon---the
action potential. The action potential is a burst of rapid
depolarization followed by hyperpolarization. This spread of
depolarization followed by hyperpolarization begins at the point where
the soma meets the axon (the axon hillock) and travels all the way to
the end of the terminal buttons, triggering the terminal buttons to
release neurotransmitters into the synapse. The following sections will
describe the events contributing to the action potential.

The Membrane Potential LO 2.7

Summarize how diffusion, electrostatic pressure, and the
sodium--potassium pump help establish membrane potential.

To understand what causes the action potential to occur, we must first
understand the reasons for the existence of the membrane potential. The
membrane potential is affected by two opposing forces: diffusion and
electrostatic pressure.

50 Chapter 2 When a spoonful of sugar is carefully poured into a
container of water, it settles to the bottom. After a time the sugar
dissolves, but it remains close to the bottom of the container. After a
much longer time (probably several days) the molecules of sugar
distribute themselves evenly throughout the water, even if no one stirs
the liquid. The process whereby molecules distribute themselves evenly
throughout the medium in which they are dissolved is called diffusion.
When there are no forces or barriers to prevent them from doing so,
molecules will diffuse from regions of high concentration to regions of
low concentration. Molecules are constantly in motion, and their rate of
movement is proportional to the temperature. Only at absolute zero \[0 K
(kelvin) = --273.15° C = --459.7° F\] do molecules cease their random
movement. At all other temperatures they move around, colliding and
veering off in different directions and pushing one another away. The
result of these collisions in the example of sugar and water is to force
sugar molecules upward (and to force water molecules downward), away
from the regions where they were most concentrated.

THE FORCE OF DIFFUSION

When some substances are dissolved in water, they split into two
particles, each with an opposing electrical charge. Substances with this
property are called electrolytes. The charged particles are called ions.
Ions are of two basic types: Cations have a positive charge, and anions
have a negative charge. For example, when sodium chloride (NaCl, table
salt) is dissolved in water, many of the molecules split into sodium
cations (Na +) and chloride anions (Cl--). Particles with the same kind
of charge repel each other (+ repels +, and - repels -), but particles
with different charges are attracted to each other (+ and - attract).
This means that anions repel anions, cations repel cations, but anions
and cations attract each other. The force exerted by this attraction or
repulsion is called electrostatic pressure. Just as the force of
diffusion moves molecules from regions of high concentration to regions
of low concentration, electrostatic pressure moves ions from place to
place: Cations are pushed away from regions with an excess of cations,
and anions are pushed away from regions with an excess of anions. (See
Figure 2.16.) THE FORCE OF ELECTROSTATIC PRESSURE

IONS IN THE EXTRACELLULAR AND INTRACELLULAR FLUID The fluid inside cells
is called intracellular fluid,

while the fluid surrounding cells is called extracellular fluid.
Intracellular and extracellular fluids contain different ions. The
forces of diffusion and electrostatic pressure contributed by these ions
help create the membrane potential. It is important to know the relative
concentrations of ions in the intracellular and extracellular fluids in
order to understand the membrane potential.

themselves throughout a medium.

Electrostatic pressure pushes ions of opposite charges together and
pushes ions with the same charges apart.

There are several important ions in these fluids. These include: organic
anions (symbolized by A--), chloride ions (Cl--), sodium ions (Na+), and
potassium ions (K+). Organic anions are found only in the intracellular
fluid and cannot leave the cell. Although the other three ions are found
in both the intracellular and extracellular fluids, K+ is found
predominantly in the intracellular fluid, whereas Na+ and Cl-- are found
predominantly in the extracellular fluid. The sizes of the boxes in
Figure 2.17 represent the relative concentrations of these four ions.
One way to remember which ion is found where is to recall that the fluid
that surrounds our cells is similar to seawater, which is predominantly
a solution of salt, NaCl. The primitive ancestors of our cells lived in
the ocean, and the seawater was their extracellular fluid. Our
extracellular fluid still resembles seawater. Let's consider the ions in
Figure 2.17, examining the forces of diffusion and electrostatic
pressure exerted on each type of ion and reasoning why each ion is
located where it is. A--, the organic anion, is unable to pass through
the membrane of the axon. It is located where it is because the membrane
is impermeable to it. The potassium ion K+ is concentrated within the
axon, and the force of diffusion tends to push it out of the cell.
However, the outside of the cell is charged positively with respect to
the inside, so electrostatic pressure tends to force this cation inside.
The two opposing forces balance, and potassium ions tend to remain where
they are. (See Figure 2.17.) The chloride ion Cl-- is in greatest
concentration outside the axon. The force of diffusion pushes this ion
inward. However, because the inside of the axon is negatively charged,
electrostatic pressure pushes this anion outward. Again, two opposing
forces balance each other. (See Figure 2.17.) The sodium ion Na+ is also
in greatest concentration outside the axon, so it, like Cl--, is pushed
into the cell by the force of diffusion. But unlike chloride, the sodium
ion is positively charged and the negative charge inside the axon
attracts Na+. (See Figure 2.17.)

How can Na + remain highly concentrated in the extracellular fluid, even
though both forces (diffusion and electrostatic pressure) tend to push
it inside the cell? The answer is this: Another force, provided by the
sodium--potassium pump, continuously pushes Na+ out of the axon. The
sodium--potassium pump consists of a large number of protein molecules
embedded in the membrane, driven by energy provided by ATP produced by
the mitochondria. These molecules, known as sodium--potassium
transporters, exchange Na+ for K+, pumping three sodium ions out for
every two potassium ions they pump in. (See Figure 2.18.) Because the
membrane is not very permeable to Na+, sodium--potassium transporters
very effectively keep the intracellular concentration of Na+ low. By
transporting K+ into the cell, they also increase the intracellular
concentration of K+ a small amount. The transporters that make up the
sodium--potassium pump use considerable energy: up to 40 percent of a
neuron's metabolic resources. Neurons, muscle cells, glia---in fact,
most cells of the body---have sodium--potassium transporters in their
membrane. THE SODIUM--POTASSIUM PUMP

the membrane is not very permeable to this ion, and sodium--potassium
transporters continuously pump out Na+, keeping the intracellular level
of Na+ low. But imagine what would happen if the membrane suddenly
became permeable to Na+. The forces of diffusion and electrostatic

4.  

When the threshold of excitation is met, the sodium channels in the
membrane open, and Na+ rushes in, propelled by the forces of diffusion
and electrostatic pressure. The opening of these channels is triggered
by depolarization. The influx of sodium ions produces a rapid change in
the membrane potential, from --70 mV to +40 mV. Opening
voltage-dependent potassium channels requires a greater level of
depolarization, and they begin to open later than the sodium channels.
At about the time the action potential reaches its peak (in
approximately 1 msec), the sodium channels become refractory and cannot
open again until the resting membrane potential is reached.
Voltage-dependent potassium channels in the membrane are open, letting
K+ ions move freely through the membrane. At this time, the inside of
the axon is positively charged, so K+ is driven out of the cell by
diffusion and by electrostatic pressure. This outflow of cations causes
the membrane potential to return toward its normal value. As it does so,
the potassium channels begin to close again.

Structure and Functions of Cells of the Nervous System 53

pressure would cause Na+ to rush into the cell. This sudden influx
(inflow) of positively charged ions would drastically change the
membrane potential by depolarization. This is precisely what causes the
action potential: A brief increase in the permeability of the membrane
to Na+ (allowing these ions to rush into the cell) is immediately
followed by a brief increase in the permeability of the membrane to K+
(allowing these ions to rush out of the cell). What is responsible for
these brief increases in permeability? Specialized protein molecules
embedded in the membrane create ion channels, which contain passages for
ions (also called pores) that can open or close. When an ion channel is
open, specific ions can flow through the pore to enter or leave the
cell. (See Figures 2.17 and 2.19.) Neural membranes contain thousands of
ion channels. For example, each sodium channel can admit up to 100
million ions per second when it is open. The permeability of a membrane
to a particular ion at a given moment is determined by the number of ion
channels that are open. The action potential consists of a series of
changes in opening and closing of ion channels and the resulting
redistribution of ions. (See Figure 2.20.) First, the membrane potential
must reach the threshold of excitation. Then, sodium channels in the
membrane open, and Na+ rushes in, propelled by the forces of diffusion
and electrostatic pressure. These sodium channels are called
voltage-dependent ion channels (or voltage-sensitive ion channels, or
voltage-gated ion channels) because they are only opened by changes in
the membrane potential. At this point, the interior of the cell starts
to become more positive. Next, voltage-dependent potassium channels
begin to open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. These potassium
channels require a greater level of depolarization before they begin to
open, and they begin to open later than the sodium channels. Remember
that the interior of the cell is positively charged, so K+ is driven out
of the cell by diffusion and by electrostatic pressure. At about this
time (1 millisecond \[msec\] after they open), the sodium channels
become refractory, which means the channels cannot open again until the
membrane once more reaches the resting potential. The outflow of cations
causes the membrane potential to return toward its normal resting value.
As it does so, the potassium channels begin to close again. At this
time, the sodium channels reset (are no longer refractory). The membrane
briefly becomes more negative than its resting value (-70 mV) and only
gradually returns to resting potential as the potassium channels finally
close. Eventually, sodium--potassium transporters remove the Na+ ions
that leaked in and retrieve the K+ ions that leaked out. (See Figure
2.20.)

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 53

Conduction of the Action Potential LO 2.9

Describe conduction of the action potential.

Now that you've read about the resting membrane potential and the action
potential, let's next consider the movement of the message down the
axon, or conduction of the action potential. As the action potential
travels along the axon, it remains constant in size. (See Figure 2.21.)
A basic law of axonal conduction is the all-or-none law. This law states
that an action potential either occurs or does not occur, and, once
triggered, it is transmitted down the axon to its end. An action
potential always remains the exact same size, without growing or
diminishing. And when an action potential reaches a point where the axon
branches, it splits but does not diminish in size. An axon will transmit
an action potential in either direction, or even in both directions, if
it is started in the middle of the axon's length. However, because
action potentials in living animals start at the end attached to the
soma, action potentials normally travel one way. Action potentials in
axons convey the varying strength of muscular contractions and the
degree of light detected by the neurons in the eye. But if action
potentials are all-or-none events and every action potential is exactly
the same size, how can they represent in a continuous fashion
information that varies, such as strong to weak muscle contraction, or
bright to dim light? The answer is surprising: Variable information is
represented by an axon's rate of firing action potentials. A high rate
of firing causes a strong muscular

Figure 2.21 Conduction of the Action Potential When an action potential
is triggered, its size remains the same as it travels down the axon. The
graphs at the top of the figure represent the size (amplitude) of the
action potential as it moves along the axon from left to right. Figure
2.20 provides more detail about the graph of an action potential.
Conduction of the action potential can be measured using microelectrodes
inserted along the axon, as shown in this figure.

contraction, and a strong stimulus (such as a bright light) causes a
high rate of firing in axons that serve the eyes. For example, an axon
might respond to a dim light such as a candle by firing 10 identical
action potentials in a unit of time (a low rate of firing). The same
axon might respond to a bright spotlight by firing 100 identical action
potentials in the same unit of time (a high rate of firing). The rate
law refers to the principle that variations in the intensity of a
stimulus or other information being transmitted in an axon are
represented by variations in the rate at which the axon fires. (See
Figure 2.22.) As an example, imagine that every time you clap your
hands, the sound occurs at the exact same volume. To show your
enthusiasm for a great performance, you might clap your hands very
quickly for 30 seconds (a high rate of firing). To show your response to
a performance you didn't enjoy as much, you might only clap your hands a
few times, slowly, for 30 seconds (a low rate of firing). You are using
the same method of communication (clapping, or in the case of a neuron,
sending action potentials), but you are varying the rate to convey
different messages. Figure 2.22 shows an example of differences in
firing rates corresponding to a weak visual stimulus (a dim candle) and
a strong visual stimulus (a bright floodlight). Most axons in mammalian
nervous systems are myelinated. Segments of the axons are covered by a
myelin sheath produced by the oligodendrocytes of the CNS or the Schwann
cells of the PNS. These segments are separated by gaps in the
myelination, called the nodes of Ranvier. Conduction of an action
potential in a myelinated axon is somewhat different from conduction in
an unmyelinated axon. Schwann cells and the oligodendrocytes of the CNS
wrap tightly around the axon, leaving no measurable extracellular fluid
between them and the axon. The only place where a myelinated axon comes
into contact with the extracellular fluid is at a node of Ranvier. In
the myelinated areas, there can be no inward flow of Na+ when the sodium
channels open because there is no contact with extracellular sodium. The
axon conducts the electrical message from the action potential to the
next node of Ranvier. The electrical message is conducted passively, the
way an electrical signal is conducted through an insulated cable. The
electrical message gets smaller as it passes down the axon, but it is
still large enough to trigger

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 54

a new action potential at the next node. This decrease in the size of
the electrical message is called decremental conduction. The action
potential gets retriggered, or repeated, at each node of Ranvier, and
the electrical message that results is conducted decrementally along the
myelinated area to the next node. Transmission of this message,
appearing to jump from node to node, is called saltatory conduction,
from the Latin saltare, "to dance." (See Figure 2.23.) Saltatory
conduction has two advantages. The first advantage is economic. Sodium
ions enter axons during action potentials, and these ions must
eventually be removed. Sodium--potassium transporters must be located
along the entire length of unmyelinated axons because Na+ enters
everywhere. However, because Na+ only enters myelinated axons at the
nodes of Ranvier, much less gets in, and consequently much less has to
be pumped out again. This way, myelinated axons need much less energy to
maintain their sodium balance. The second advantage of saltatory
conduction is speed. Conducting an action potential is faster in a
myelinated axon because the transmission between the nodes is very fast.
The other option to increase speed of action potential propagation is to
increase the diameter of the neuron. However, even very large
unmyelinated neurons cannot propagate an action potential as quickly as
a small myelinated neuron. Myelin is a valuable addition to a neuron.
Increased speed allows an animal to react faster and (undoubtedly) to
think faster.

LO 2.8 Summarize the series of ion movements

in a reflex. A simple withdrawal reflex is made up of a sensory neuron
that detects the stimulus, a spinal interneuron that excites a motor
neuron, and a motor neuron that causes the withdrawal behavior. This
reflex can be modified by input from the brain that can prevent the
withdrawal behavior by inhibiting the motor neuron.

Electrical Potentials of Axons LO 2.6 Describe membrane potential,
resting potential, hyperpolarization, depolarization, and the action
potential. Resting potential in most neurons is approximately -70 mV, or
70 units (mV) more negative compared to outside. In general,
hyperpolarization occurs when the inside of the neuron becomes more
negative (for example, -100 mV), and depolarization occurs when the
inside of the cell becomes more positive (for example, +20 mV). An
action potential occurs when a neuron is depolarized beyond its
threshold of excitation. An action potential is a burst of
depolarization followed by hyperpolarization that conducts like a wave
along the axon, starting at the point where the axon meets the soma and
continuing to the terminal buttons.

The Membrane Potential LO 2.7 Summarize how diffusion, electrostatic
pressure, and the sodium--potassium pump help establish membrane
potential. The difference in charge between the inside and the outside
of the axonal membrane is generated by the force of diffusion,
electrostatic pressure, and the activity of sodium--potassium pumps. The
force of diffusion describes the process by which molecules distribute
themselves evenly throughout the medium in which they are dissolved.
Electrostatic pressure describes the phenomenon in which like charges
repel and opposite charges are attracted to each other. The
sodium--potassium pump helps maintain the resting membrane potential by
pumping sodium ions out and potassium ions into the cell.

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 55

during the action potential. After reaching the threshold of excitation,
the voltagedependent sodium channels open, allowing sodium to enter the
cell. Sodium ion movement into the cell is driven by the forces of
diffusion and electrostatic pressure. This depolarizes the axonal
membrane. After approximately 1 msec, the sodium channels become
refractory. The positive charge inside the cell next opens
voltage-dependent potassium channels. Potassium exits the cell due to
the forces of diffusion and electrostatic pressure due to the now
positive charge on the inside of the cell. As potassium exits and
diffuses away from the cell, the cell becomes hyperpolarized and
eventually becomes even more negative than the resting potential. The
potassium channels close, stopping potassium ions from exiting the cell,
and the sodium--potassium pumps become active, helping to reestablish
resting potential.

Conduction of the Action Potential LO 2.9 Describe conduction of the
action potential. After being initiated at the axon hillock, the action
potential travels toward the terminal buttons. The all-or-none law
states that an action potential either occurs or does not occur, and,
once triggered, is conducted along the axon to the terminals. In an
unmyelinated axon, the action potential proceeds along the axon but is
subject to decremental conduction. In a myelinated axon, the action
potential is conducted via saltatory conduction, which speeds the
message, reduces decremental conduction, and renews the action potential
at the nodes of Ranvier. To vary the strength of the message conveyed by
the action potential, the rate law explains that although each action
potential event is identical, a stronger message can be conveyed by
firing action potentials at a higher rate.

Thought Question Have you ever received a local anesthetic to relieve
pain from an injury or during a painful procedure? Local anesthetics
such as Novocaine or Lidocaine produce their numbing effects by blocking
sodium channels along the axons of sensory neurons. Explain how blocking
these channels could reduce sensory function in these neurons.

56 Chapter 2

Communication Between Neurons With an understanding of the basic
structure of neurons and the nature of communication within the neuron,
it is time to examine the ways neurons can communicate with each other.
These communications make it possible for circuits of neurons to gather
sensory information, make plans, and initiate behaviors. The primary
means of communication between neurons is synaptic transmission---the
transmission of messages from one neuron to another across a synapse. As
we have seen, these messages are carried by neurotransmitters that are
released by terminal buttons of the sending, or presynaptic, cell. These
neurotransmitters diffuse across the fluid-filled gap between the
terminal buttons and the membranes of the neurons with which they form
synapses, called the postsynaptic cells. Neurotransmitters then produce
postsynaptic potentials---brief depolarizations or hyperpolarizations
that increase or decrease the rate of firing of the axon of the
postsynaptic neuron. Neurotransmitters exert their effects on cells by
attaching to a particular region of a receptor molecule called the
binding site. A molecule of the chemical fits into the binding site the
way a key fits into a lock: The shape of the binding site and the shape
of the molecule of the neurotransmitter are complementary. (See Figure
2.24.) A chemical that attaches to a binding site is called a ligand.
Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring ligands, produced and released
by neurons. But other chemicals found in nature (primarily in plants or
in the poisonous venoms of animals) can serve as ligands too. In
addition, artificial ligands can be produced in the laboratory. These
chemicals are discussed in Chapter 4, which deals with drugs and their
effects. One important characteristic of ligands is that they only bind
to receptors. They cannot enter into a neuron through a binding site,
although they may open ion channels that ions can use to enter or exit
the cell. This concept will be discussed in more detail later in this
section.

Structure of Synapses LO 2.10 Identify the presynaptic structures
involved in synaptic communication. Synapses are junctions between the
terminal buttons at the ends of the axonal branches of one neuron and
the membrane of another. Many synapses occur on the smooth surface of a
dendrite or on dendritic

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 56

spines---small protrusions that stud the dendrites of several types of
large neurons in the brain. Some synapses can occur on the soma and on
other axons. (See Figure 2.25.) Let's examine a basic synapse in more
detail. The presynaptic membrane, located at the end of the terminal
button, faces the postsynaptic membrane, located on the neuron that
receives the message, across the synapse. The synapse contains
extracellular fluid through which the neurotransmitter diffuses. As you
may notice in Figure 2.26, two prominent structures are located in the
cytoplasm of the terminal button: mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. We
also see microtubules, which are responsible for transporting material
between the soma and terminal button. The presence of mitochondria
implies that the terminal button needs energy to perform its functions.
Synaptic vesicles are small, rounded structures made of membrane and
filled with molecules. A terminal button can contain from a few hundred
to nearly a million synaptic vesicles. Synaptic vesicles are found in
greatest numbers around the part of the presynaptic membrane that faces
the synaptic cleft, the region from which neurotransmitter is released.
Many terminal buttons contain two types of synaptic vesicles: large and
small. Small synaptic vesicles (found in all terminal buttons) contain
molecules of the neurotransmitter. They range in number from a few dozen
to several hundred. The membrane of small synaptic vesicles consists of
approximately 10,000 lipid molecules

part of the presynaptic membrane that faces the synaptic cleft---near
the release zone, the region from which the neurotransmitter is
released. In many terminal buttons we see a scattering of large,
dense-core synaptic vesicles.

(c) 

These vesicles contain one of a number of different peptides, the
functions of which are described later in this chapter. Small synaptic
vesicles are produced in the soma and are carried by fast axoplasmic
transport to the terminal button. As we will see, some are also produced
from recycled material in the terminal button. Large synaptic vesicles
are produced only in the soma and are transported through the axoplasm
to the terminal buttons.

Release of Neurotransmitters LO 2.11 Describe the process of
neurotransmitter release. When the cell secretes molecules of
neurotransmitter, it uses a process called exocytosis. In exocytosis,
the membrane-wrapped product migrates to the inside of the outer
membrane of the cell, fuses with the membrane, and bursts, spilling its
contents into the fluid surrounding the cell. As we will see, neurons
communicate with one another by secreting chemicals by this means. When
action potentials are conducted down an axon (and down all of its
branches), something happens inside all of the terminal buttons: A
number of small synaptic vesicles located just inside the presynaptic
membrane fuse with the membrane and then break open, spilling their
contents into the synaptic cleft through exocytosis. In Figure 2.27, the
axon has just been stimulated, and synaptic vesicles in the terminal
button are in the process of releasing the neurotransmitters. Note that
some vesicles are fused with the presynaptic membrane, forming the shape
of an omega (Ω).

How does an action potential cause synaptic vesicles to release
neurotransmitters? The process begins when a population of synaptic
vesicles becomes "docked" against the presynaptic membrane, ready to
release their neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. Docking is
accomplished when clusters of protein molecules attach to other protein
molecules located in the presynaptic membrane. (See Figure 2.27.) The
release zone of the presynaptic membrane contains voltage-dependent
calcium channels. When the membrane of the terminal button is
depolarized by an arriving action potential, the calcium channels open.
Like sodium ions, calcium ions (Ca2+) are located in highest
concentration in the extracellular fluid. When the voltage-dependent
calcium channels open, Ca2+ flows into the cell, propelled by
electrostatic pressure and the force of diffusion. The entry of Ca2+ is
an essential step in neural communication. If neurons are placed in a
solution that contains no calcium ions, an action potential no longer
causes the release of a neurotransmitter. (Calcium transporters, similar
in operation to sodium--potassium transporters, later remove the
intracellular Ca2+.)

Figure 2.27 Release of a Neurotransmitter An action potential opens
calcium channels, which allow calcium ions to enter and bind with the
protein embedded in the membrane of synaptic vesicles docked at the
release zone. The fusion pores open, and the neurotransmitter is
released into the synaptic cleft.

Structure and Functions of Cells of the Nervous System 59

As we will see later in this chapter and in subsequent chapters of this
book, calcium ions play many important roles in biological processes
within cells. Calcium ions can bind with various types of proteins,
changing their characteristics. Some of the calcium ions that enter the
terminal button bind with the clusters of protein molecules that join
the membrane of the synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane.
This event makes the segments of the clusters of protein molecules move
apart, producing a fusion pore---a hole through both membranes that
enables them to fuse together. The process of fusion takes approximately
0.1 msec. (Look again at Figure 2.27.) Research indicates that there are
three distinct pools of synaptic vesicles (Rizzoli and Betz, 2005).
Release-ready vesicles are docked against the inside of the presynaptic
membrane, ready to release their contents when an action potential
arrives. These vesicles constitute less than 1 percent of the total
number found in the terminal. Vesicles in the recycling pool constitute
10--15 percent of the total pool of vesicles, and those in the reserve
pool make up the remaining 85--90 percent. If the axon fires at a low
rate, only vesicles from the release-ready pool will be called on. If
the rate of firing increases, vesicles from the recycling pool and
finally from the reserve pool will release their contents. What happens
to the leftover membrane of the synaptic vesicles after they have broken
open and released the neurotransmitter they contain? It appears that
many vesicles in the ready-release pool use a process known as kiss and
run. These synaptic vesicles release most or all of their
neurotransmitter, the fusion pore closes, and the vesicles break away
from the presynaptic membrane and get filled with neurotransmitter
again. Other vesicles (primarily those in the recycling pool) merge and
recycle and consequently lose their identity. The membranes of these
vesicles merge with the presynaptic membrane. Little buds of membrane
then pinch off into the cytoplasm and become synaptic vesicles. The
appropriate proteins are inserted into the membrane of these vesicles,
and the vesicles are filled with molecules of the neurotransmitter. The
membranes of vesicles in the reserve pool are recycled through a process
of bulk endocytosis. (Endocytosis means "the process of entering a
cell.") Large pieces of the membrane of the terminal button fold inward,
break off, and enter the cytoplasm. New vesicles are formed from small
buds that break off of these pieces of membrane. The recycling process
takes less than a second for the ready-release pool, a few seconds for
the recycling pool, and a few minutes for the reserve pool. (See Figure
2.28.)

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 59

Figure 2.28 Recycling Synaptic Vesicle Membrane After the synaptic
vesicles have released a neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft, the
following takes place: In kiss and run, a vesicle fuses with the
presynaptic membrane, releases the neurotransmitter, reseals, leaves the
docking site, becomes refilled with the neurotransmitter, and mixes with
other vesicles in the terminal button. In merge and recycle, the vesicle
completely fuses with the postsynaptic membrane, losing its identity.
Extra membrane from fused vesicles pinches off into the cytoplasm and
forms vesicles, which are filled with the neurotransmitter. The
membranes of vesicles in the reserve pool are recycled through a process
of bulk endocytosis. Large pieces of the membrane of the terminal button
fold inward, break off, and enter the cytoplasm. New vesicles are formed
from small buds that break off of these pieces of membrane.

molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft and attach to the binding
sites of special protein molecules located in the postsynaptic membrane,
called postsynaptic receptors. Once binding occurs, the postsynaptic
receptors open neurotransmitterdependent ion channels (sometimes called
ligand-gated ion channels), which permit the passage of specific ions
into or out of the cell. The presence of the neurotransmitter in the
synaptic cleft allows particular ions to pass through the postsynaptic
membrane, changing the local membrane potential. Notice that
neurotransmitter molecules bind to specific binding sites on the
receptors and cannot enter into the postsynaptic cell--- only ions can
enter the cell through ion channels. Neurotransmitters open ion channels
by at least two different methods: direct and indirect. The direct
method is simpler, so we will describe it first. Figure 2.29 illustrates
a neurotransmitter-dependent ion channel that is equipped with its own
binding site. When a molecule of the appropriate neurotransmitter
attaches to it, the ion channel opens. The formal name for this
combination receptor/ion channel is an ionotropic receptor.

to the membrane---a G protein. When a molecule of the neurotransmitter
binds with a metabotropic receptor, the receptor activates a G protein
situated inside the membrane next to the receptor. When activated, the G
protein activates an enzyme that stimulates the production of a chemical
called a second messenger. (The neurotransmitter is the first
messenger.) Molecules of the second messenger travel through the
cytoplasm, attach themselves to nearby ion channels, and cause them to
open. Compared with the effects produced by ionotropic receptors, those
produced by metabotropic receptors (also called G-protein-coupled
receptors) take longer to begin and last longer. (See Figure 2.30.) The
original second messenger to be discovered was cyclic AMP, a chemical
that is synthesized from ATP. Since then, several other second
messengers have been discovered. As you will see in later chapters,
second messengers play an important role in both synaptic and
nonsynaptic communication. And they can do more than open ion channels.
For example, they can travel to the nucleus or other regions of the
neuron and initiate biochemical changes that affect the functions of the
cell. They can even turn specific genes on or off, controlling the
production of particular proteins.

Postsynaptic Potentials The indirect method of opening ion channels is
more complicated. Ligand binding to some receptors does not open ion
channels directly but instead starts a chain of chemical events. These
receptors are called metabotropic receptors because they involve steps
that require that the cell expend metabolic energy. Metabotropic
receptors are located in close proximity to another protein attached

LO 2.13 Compare EPSPs and IPSPs in postsynaptic cells. As we mentioned
earlier, postsynaptic potentials can be either depolarizing (excitatory)
or hyperpolarizing (inhibitory). What determines the nature of the
postsynaptic potential at a particular synapse is not the
neurotransmitter itself. Instead, it is determined by the
characteristics of the

postsynaptic receptors---more specifically, by the particular type of
ion channel they open. There are four major types of
neurotransmitterdependent ion channels found in the postsynaptic
membrane: sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl--), and calcium
(Ca2+). (See Figure 2.31.) The neurotransmitter-dependent sodium channel
is the most important source of excitatory postsynaptic potentials. As
we have seen, sodium--potassium transporters concentrate sodium outside
the cell, waiting for the forces of diffusion and electrostatic pressure
to push it in. When sodium channels are opened, the result is a
depolarization---an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). (See
Figure 2.31a.) We also saw that sodium--potassium transporters maintain
a small surplus of potassium ions inside the cell. If potassium channels
open, some of these cations will follow this gradient and leave the
cell. Because K+ is positively charged, its outflow will hyperpolarize
the membrane, producing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).
(See Figure 2.31b.) At many synapses, inhibitory neurotransmitters open
the chloride channels, instead of (or in addition to) potassium
channels. The effect of opening chloride channels depends on the
membrane potential of the neuron. If the membrane is at the resting
potential, nothing happens, because (as we saw earlier) the forces of
diffusion and electrostatic pressure balance perfectly for the chloride
ion. However, if the membrane potential has already been depolarized by
the activity of excitatory synapses located nearby, then opening
chloride channels will permit Cl-- to enter the cell. The influx of
anions (negatively charged ions) will bring the membrane potential

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 61

21

Effects

back to its normal resting condition. In this way, opening chloride
channels helps neutralize EPSPs. (See Figure 2.31c.) The fourth type of
neurotransmitter-dependent ion channel is the calcium channel. Calcium
ions (Ca2+), being positively charged and being located in highest
concentration outside the cell, move like sodium ions. Opening calcium
channels depolarizes the membrane, producing EPSPs. But calcium does
even more. For example, when calcium enters the terminal button, it
triggers the migration of synaptic vesicles and the release of the
neurotransmitter. In the dendrites of the postsynaptic cell, calcium
binds with and activates special enzymes. These enzymes have a variety
of effects, including the production of biochemical and structural
changes in the postsynaptic neuron. (See Figure 2.31d.)

Effects of Postsynaptic Potentials: Neural Integration LO 2.14 Summarize
neural integration of EPSPs and IPSPs. The interaction of the effects of
excitatory and inhibitory synapses on a particular neuron is called
neural integration. The rate at which a neuron fires actional potentials
is controlled by the relative activity of the excitatory and inhibitory
synapses on its dendrites and soma. If the activity of excitatory
synapses goes up, the rate of action potential firing will increase. If
the activity of inhibitory synapses goes up, the rate of action
potential firing will decrease. Figure 2.32 illustrates the effects of
excitatory and inhibitory synapses on a postsynaptic neuron. The left
panel shows what happens when several excitatory synapses become

active at the same time, the EPSPs they produce (shown in red) summate
as they travel toward the axon, and the axon fires. (b) If several
inhibitory synapses are active at the same time, the IPSPs they produce
(shown in blue) diminish the size of the EPSPs and prevent the axon from

Activity of excitatory synapses produces EPSPs (red) in postsynaptic
neuron

Axon hillock reaches threshold of excitation; action potential is

active. The release of a neurotransmitter produces depolarizing EPSPs in
the dendrites of the neuron. These EPSPs (represented in red) are then
transmitted down the dendrites, across the soma, to the axon hillock
located at the base of the axon. If the depolarization is still strong
enough to rise above the threshold of excitation when it reaches this
point, the axon will fire an action potential. (See Figure 2.32a.) Let's
consider what would happen if, at the same time, inhibitory synapses
also become active. IPSPs are hyperpolarizing---they bring the membrane
potential away from the threshold of excitation and tend to cancel the
effects of EPSPs. (See Figure 2.32b.) Note that neural inhibition (that
is, an inhibitory postsynaptic potential) does not always produce
behavioral inhibition. For example, suppose a group of neurons inhibits
a particular movement. If these neurons are inhibited, they will no
longer suppress the behavior. Inhibiting the inhibitory neurons makes
the behavior more likely to occur. Of course, the same is true for
neural excitation. Excitation of neurons that inhibit a behavior
suppresses that behavior. For example, when we are dreaming, a
particular set of inhibitory neurons in the brain becomes active and
prevents us from getting up and acting out our dreams. (As we will see
in Chapter 9, if these neurons are damaged, people will act out their
dreams.) Neurons are elements in complex circuits. Without knowing the
details of these circuits, you cannot predict the effects of exciting or
inhibiting one set of neurons on behavior.

IPSPs counteract EPSPs; action potential is not triggered in axon (b)

Termination of Postsynaptic Potentials LO 2.15 Explain how postsynaptic
potentials are terminated. Postsynaptic potentials are depolarizations
or hyperpolarizations caused by the activation of postsynaptic receptors
with molecules of a neurotransmitter. Postsynaptic potentials are
terminated by two mechanisms: reuptake and enzymatic deactivation of
neurotransmitter molecules. REUPTAKE The postsynaptic potentials
produced by most neurotransmitters are terminated by reuptake. This
process is an extremely rapid removal of neurotransmitter from the
synaptic cleft by the terminal button. The neurotransmitter does not
return in the vesicles that get pinched off the membrane of the terminal
button. Instead, the membrane contains special transporter molecules
that draw on the cell's energy reserves to force molecules of the
neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft directly into the
cytoplasm---just as sodium--potassium transporters move Na + and K +
across the membrane. When an action potential arrives, the terminal
button releases a small amount of neurotransmitter into the synaptic
cleft and then takes it back, giving the postsynaptic receptors only a
brief exposure to the neurotransmitter. (See Figure 2.33.)

ENZYMATIC DEACTIVATION Enzymatic deactivation is accomplished by an
enzyme that destroys molecules of the neurotransmitter. For example,
postsynaptic potentials are terminated in this way for acetylcholine
(ACh) and for neurotransmitters that consist of peptide molecules.
Transmission at synapses on muscle fibers and at some synapses between
neurons in the CNS is mediated by ACh. Postsynaptic potentials produced
by ACh are short lived because the postsynaptic membrane at these
synapses contains an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE). AChE
destroys ACh by breaking it into its constituents: choline and acetate.
Because neither of these substances is capable of activating
postsynaptic receptors, the postsynaptic potential is terminated once
the molecules of ACh are broken apart. Kathryn, the woman featured in
the case study that opened this chapter, had progressive muscular
weakness. As her neurologist discovered, Kathryn had myasthenia gravis,
a disease in which the immune system destroys ACh receptors, reducing
the amount of information conveyed from the ACh system to the muscles,
and resulting in muscle weakness. Her physician administered Kathryn a
drug that blocks AChE. The result of administering this drug was to
increase the amount of ACh available in the synapse (because it was not
broken down by AChE).

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 63

Although she still lacked a large number of ACh receptors, the increased
ACh in the synapse sufficiently flooded her remaining ACh receptors and
amplified the message to her muscles. As a result, Kathryn's ACh system
could once again convey messages to her muscles, and her muscle weakness
was reversed.

Autoreceptors LO 2.16 Distinguish autoreceptors from postsynaptic
receptors. Postsynaptic receptors detect the presence of a
neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft and initiate excitatory or
inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. But the postsynaptic membrane is not
the only place where receptors respond to neurotransmitters. Many
neurons also possess receptors that respond to the neurotransmitter that
they themselves release, called autoreceptors, from the Greek auto,
meaning "self" or "same." Autoreceptors are part of a negative feedback
mechanism that allows presynaptic cells to monitor the amount of
neurotransmitter they release into the synapse and adjust the amounts to
fine-tune their chemical message. This system prevents the presynaptic
cell from releasing too much or too little neurotransmitter.

08/11/2021 14:18

64 Chapter 2 Autoreceptors can be located on the membrane of any part of
the cell, but we will focus on those located on the terminal button. In
most cases, these autoreceptors do not control ion channels. When
stimulated by a molecule of the neurotransmitter, autoreceptors do not
produce changes in the membrane potential of the terminal button.
Instead, they regulate internal processes, including the synthesis and
release of the neurotransmitter. In most cases the effects of
autoreceptor activation are inhibitory. When a neurotransmitter binds to
an autoreceptor, it typically decreases the rate of synthesis or release
of the neurotransmitter from the presynaptic cell. Most researchers
believe that autoreceptors are part of a regulatory system that controls
the amount of neurotransmitter that is released. If too much
neurotransmitter is released, the autoreceptors inhibit both production
and release. If too little neurotransmitter is released, the rates of
production and release go up.

Other Types of Synapses LO 2.17 Identify synapses other than those
involved in neural integration. So far, the discussion of synaptic
activity has referred only to the effects of postsynaptic excitation or
inhibition. These effects occur when terminal synapses occur on
postsynaptic dendrites or somas. Synapses can also occur on axons. These
synapses work differently. Axoaxonic synapses do not contribute directly
to neural integration. Instead, they alter the amount of
neurotransmitter released by the terminal buttons of the postsynaptic
axon. They can produce presynaptic modulation: presynaptic inhibition or
presynaptic facilitation. The release of a neurotransmitter by a
terminal button is initiated by an action potential. Normally, a
particular terminal button releases a fixed amount of neurotransmitter
each time an action potential arrives. However, the release of a
neurotransmitter can be modulated by the activity of axoaxonic synapses.
If the activity of the axoaxonic synapse decreases the release of the
neurotransmitter, the effect is called presynaptic inhibition. If it
increases the release, it is called presynaptic facilitation. (See
Figure 2.34.) By the way, as we will see in Chapter 4, a psychoactive
chemical in marijuana exerts its effects on the brain by binding with
presynaptic receptors. Many very small neurons have extremely short
processes and apparently lack axons. These neurons form dendrodendritic
synapses, or synapses between dendrites. Because these neurons lack long
axonal processes, they do not transmit information from place to place
within the

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 64

brain. Most investigators believe that they perform regulatory
functions, perhaps helping to organize the activity of groups of
neurons. Some larger neurons also form dendrodendritic synapses. Some of
these synapses are chemical, indicated by the presence of synaptic
vesicles in one of the juxtaposed dendrites and a postsynaptic
thickening in the membrane of the other. Other synapses are electrical.
The membranes of the cells meet and almost touch, forming a gap
junction. The membranes on both sides of a gap junction contain channels
that permit ions to diffuse from one cell to another. Thus, changes in
the membrane potential of one neuron induce changes in the membrane of
the other. Although most gap junctions in vertebrate synapses are
dendrodendritic, gap junctions at postsynaptic dendrites and somas can
also occur. Gap junctions are common in invertebrates. Their functions
in the vertebrate nervous system are currently under investigation.
Electrical synapses appear to play important roles in the vertebrate
retina, olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, suprachiasmatic
nucleus, hypothalamus, medulla, spinal cord, and parts of the thalamus
and enteric nervous system (part of the nervous system in the
gastrointestinal system) (Nagy et al., 2017).

Nonsynaptic Chemical Communication LO 2.18 Describe examples of
nonsynaptic communication. Neurotransmitters are released by terminal
buttons of neurons and bind with receptors in the membrane of another
cell located a very short distance away. The communication at each
synapse is private and typically only involves the presynaptic and
postsynaptic cell in the synapse. Neuromodulators are chemicals released
by neurons that travel farther and are dispersed more widely than are
neurotransmitters. Most neuromodulators are peptides, chains of amino
acids. Neuromodulators are secreted in larger amounts and diffuse for
longer distances, modulating the activity of many neurons in a
particular part of the brain. For example, neuromodulators affect
general behavioral states such as vigilance, fearfulness, and
sensitivity to pain. Chapter 4 discusses the most important
neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in greater detail. Hormones are
secreted by cells of endocrine glands or by cells located in various
organs, such as the stomach, the intestines, the kidneys, and the brain.
Cells that secrete hormones release these chemicals into the
extracellular fluid. The hormones are then distributed to the rest of
the body through the bloodstream. Hormones affect the activity of cells
(including neurons) that contain specialized receptors located either on
the surface of their membrane or deep within their nuclei. Cells that
contain receptors for a particular hormone are referred to as target
cells for that hormone, and only these cells respond to its presence.
Many neurons contain hormone receptors, and hormones are able to affect
behavior by stimulating the receptors and changing the activity of these
neurons. For example, a sex hormone, testosterone, increases the
aggressiveness of most male mammals. Peptide hormones exert their
effects on target cells by stimulating metabotropic receptors located in
the membrane. The second messenger that is generated travels to the
nucleus of the cell, where it initiates changes in the cell's
physiological processes. Steroid hormones consist of very small
fat-soluble molecules. Examples of steroid hormones include the sex
hormones secreted by the ovaries and testes and the hormones secreted by
the adrenal cortex. Because steroid hormones are soluble in lipids, they
pass easily through the cell membrane. They travel to the nucleus, where
they attach themselves to receptors located there. The receptors,

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 65

stimulated by the hormone, then direct the machinery of the cell to
alter its protein production. (See Figure 2.35.) In the past few years,
investigators have discovered the presence of steroid receptors in
terminal buttons and around the postsynaptic membrane of some neurons.
These steroid receptors influence synaptic transmission, and they do so
rapidly. Exactly how they work is still not known.

Figure 2.35 Action of Steroid Hormones Steroid hormones affect their
target cells by means of specialized receptors in the nucleus. Once a
receptor binds with a molecule of a steroid hormone, it causes genetic
mechanisms to initiate protein synthesis.

Module Review: Communication Between Neurons Structure of Synapses LO
2.10 Identify the presynaptic structures involved in synaptic
communication. The presynaptic membrane faces the postsynaptic membrane
across the synaptic cleft. Presynaptic cells contain synaptic vesicles
filled with neurotransmitters. Transport proteins fill vesicles with the
neurotransmitters, and trafficking proteins are involved in releasing
neurotransmitters and recycling the vesicles.

Release of Neurotransmitters LO 2.11 Describe the process of
neurotransmitter release. Following an action potential,
neurotransmitter is released from vesicles in the presynaptic cell that
move and dock with the terminal membrane. Docking and creating a fusion
pore is triggered by the influx of calcium ions. The neurotransmitter is
released into the synaptic gap through the fusion pore. Following
release, the membranes of the vesicles are recycled and return to the
pool of available vesicles.

Activation of Receptors LO 2.12 Contrast ionotropic and metabotropic
receptors. Ionotropic receptors open ion channels in direct response to
the binding of a ligand. Metabotropic receptors can indirectly open ion
channels through the use of a G protein. Metabotropic receptors can also
activate a second messenger system that can communicate with the nucleus
or other regions of the neuron and initiate biochemical changes that
affect the functions of the cell. Second messengers can also turn
specific genes on or off to initiate or terminate production of
particular proteins.

Postsynaptic Potentials LO 2.13 Compare EPSPs and IPSPs in postsynaptic
cells. In the postsynaptic cell, an EPSP is a depolarization resulting
from the entry of sodium or calcium ions into the cell through a
neurotransmitter-dependent ion channel. In the dendrites of the
postsynaptic cell, calcium can also bind with enzymes that have a
variety of effects. An IPSP is a hyperpolarization resulting from the
exit of potassium ions from or the entry of chloride ions into the cell
through a neurotransmitter-dependent ion channel.

M02_CARL0287_13_GE_C02.indd 66

Effects of Postsynaptic Potentials: Neural Integration LO 2.14 Summarize
neural integration of EPSPs and IPSPs. Neurons receive multiple
subthreshold EPSPs and IPSPs. The neuron integrates these messages. If
the integrated messages result in depolarization beyond the threshold of
excitation for the cell, the neuron will fire an action potential. If
the messages are IPSPs or do not reach the threshold of excitation, the
neuron will not fire an action potential.

Termination of Postsynaptic Potentials LO 2.15 Explain how postsynaptic
potentials are terminated. Postsynaptic potentials can be terminated by
removing a neurotransmitter from the synapse through reuptake
transporters or through enzymatic deactivation.

Autoreceptors LO 2.16 Distinguish autoreceptors from postsynaptic
receptors. Postsynaptic receptors are located on the postsynaptic
membrane and serve to convey a message to the postsynaptic cell.
Postsynaptic receptors can be ionotropic or metabotropic. Autoreceptors
are metabotropic receptors located on the presynaptic membrane that help
regulate the amount of neurotransmitter that is released.

Other Types of Synapses LO 2.17 Identify synapses other than those
involved in neural integration. Axoaxonic synapses can modulate the
release of neurotransmitters into a synapse via presynaptic inhibition
or facilitation. Dendrodendritic synapses likely perform regulatory
functions. Gap junctions between neurons permit changes in the membrane
potential of one neuron to induce changes in the membrane of the other.

Nonsynaptic Chemical Communication LO 2.18 Describe examples of
nonsynaptic communication. Neuromodulators are chemicals released by
neurons that travel farther and are dispersed more widely than are
neurotransmitters. Hormones are secreted by cells of endocrine glands or
by cells located in various organs.

The hormones are then distributed to the rest of the body through the
bloodstream.

Thought Question Many drugs that change behavior produce their effects
by interacting with receptor sites or reuptake sites. For example, some
antidepressant drugs and stimulant

drugs block the reuptake of neurotransmitters. Describe the effect of
blocking reuptake at the synapse. Will the amount of neurotransmitter

10-year old Yumi began experiencing disabling fear and anxiety whenever
her parents left the house. She would be in severe distress every time
they had a night out, or even if they popped out for a moment to get
groceries from a local store. She started having difficulties in school
as crammed classrooms made her ­anxious and she could no longer
concentrate on what her teachers were saying. One day she left school
early, ran home, and decided to never go to school again. Yumi's doctor
prescribed medications to manage her anxiety, and Yumi was able to
return to school. Everything was going well for Yumi till she joined a
university, when her anxiety came back. This time, however, her symptoms
changed. Every time, before an anxiety attack would strike, Yumi could
smell the same distinctive and strong odor nobody else around her could
sense. Her usual medications, although provided some relief, were not as
effective as before. Yumi's doctor tried to change her therapy but
nothing seemed to work. The doctor then decided to do brain imaging and
found that Yumi had a tumor in the right hemisphere that was compressing
the brain structures responsible for emotional processing. Typically, if
the tumor is possible to remove safely

Ryan's story illustrates the importance of understanding the structures
and functions of the nervous system. The overall goal of neuroscience
research is to increase our understanding of how the nervous system
works. With this knowledge, we may be able to improve health and
wellbeing for people like Ryan and many others. To understand the
results of this research, you must be familiar with the basic structure
of the nervous system. This chapter contains only part of the large body
of information about nervous system structures and their associated
functions. In Chapter 2, you learned about some of the smallest units of
the nervous system: neurons and supporting cells. In this chapter,
you'll learn about larger structures of the nervous system that are made
up of neurons and supporting cells.

destroying healthy brain tissue, surgery is the treatment of choice.
Yumi had her tumor removed through a successful surgery and in about
three months, her anxiety started to gradually subside. She continued to
take her medication but at a much lower dose. In two years, Yumi did not
even need any further medications. She was able to return to her
university and succeed in her studies. Yumi's story highlights an
important aspect of brain ­physiology---how a particular brain region
relates to a distinct function. In her case, at first, it was the
compression of one of the brain structures involved in emotional
processing, especially fear and ­anxiety. However, as the tumor grew over
the years, it affected other nearby structures involved in processing of
the sense of smell and, thus, led to new symptoms such as phantom smell.
Such cases that result in a damage of specific parts of the brain help
to understand how neuroanatomy relates to regulation of emotions,
behavior as well as other functions such as sensory and motor. Source:

The second and third modules describe the central and peripheral nervous
systems, respectively.

Basic Features of the Nervous System The nervous system is divided into
two main parts: the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous
system. The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and
spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of the cranial
nerves, spinal nerves, and peripheral ganglia. The CNS is encased in
bone: The brain is covered by the tough, bony skull,

and the spinal cord is contained within the vertebral column. (See
Figure 3.1.) The brain is made up of neurons, glia, and other supporting
cells and floats in a pool of ­cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The brain
requires a large supply of blood and is chemically protected by the
blood--brain barrier. The brain continuously receives approximately 20
percent of the blood flow from the heart. Other parts of the body, such
as the skeletal muscles or digestive system, receive varying quantities
of blood, depending on their needs. In contrast, the brain always
receives its share. The brain can store only a small amount of its fuel
(primarily glucose), so consistent blood supply is essential. A 1-second

Apply anatomical terms to the nervous system.

Before beginning a detailed description of the nervous system, let's
discuss the terms that are used to describe it. Early anatomists named
most brain structures according to their similarity to objects they were
familiar with: amygdala, or "almond-shaped object"; hippocampus, or "sea
horse"; genu, or "knee"; cortex, or "tree bark"; pons, or "bridge";
uncus, or "hook," to give a few examples. Knowing these roots can
sometimes make the terms easier to remember. For example, knowing that
cortex means "bark" (of a tree) can help you to remember that the cortex
is the outer layer of the brain (and of other structures, like the
kidneys, too). When describing features of a structure as complex as the
brain, it's helpful to use terms to indicate directions. Directions in
the nervous system are usually described relative to the neuraxis, an
imaginary line drawn through the length of the central nervous system,
ranging from the bottom of the spinal cord up to the front of the brain.
First, let's consider an animal with a straight neuraxis. Figure 3.2
shows an alligator and two humans. This alligator is linear, and we can
draw a straight line that starts between its eyes and continues down the
center of its spinal cord. The front end is anterior, and the tail is
posterior. The terms rostral (toward the nose and mouth) and caudal
(toward the tail) are also used, especially when referring specifically
to the brain. The top of the head and the back are part of the dorsal
surface, while the ventral (front) surface faces the ground. (Dorsum
means "back," and ventrum means "belly.") These directions are somewhat
more complicated in humans because as we stand upright, our neuraxis
bends, so the top of the head is perpendicular to the back.
Neuroanatomists also use the terms superior and inferior. In the brain,
superior means "above," and inferior means "below." For example, the
superior colliculi are located above the inferior colliculi. The frontal
views of both the alligator and the human illustrate the terms lateral
(toward the side) and medial (toward the middle,). Two other useful
anatomical terms are ipsilateral and contralateral. Ipsilateral refers
to structures on the same side of the body. If we say that the olfactory
bulb projects axons to the ipsilateral hemisphere, we mean that axons
originating in the left olfactory bulb of the brain terminate in the
left hemisphere, and axons originating in the right olfactory bulb
terminate in the right hemisphere. Contralateral refers to structures on
opposite sides of the body. If we say that a particular region in the
left hemisphere of the brain controls movements of the contralateral
hand, we mean that the region controls movements of the right hand.

open. To be able to convey information about what we find, researchers
slice it in a standard way. Figure 3.2 shows the human nervous system.
The nervous system is usually sliced in three standard ways: 1.
Coronally, like slicing a loaf of bread, creating cross sections (also
known as frontal sections when referring to the brain). A coronal cut to
the middle of the brain would divide the brain into front and back
halves. 2. Parallel to the ground, creating horizontal sections. A
parallel cut to the middle of the brain would result in cutting off the
upper half of the brain. 3. Perpendicular to the ground and parallel to
the neuraxis, creating sagittal sections. The midsagittal plane divides
the brain into two symmetrical right and left halves. Figure 3.2a shows
a midsagittal cut.

Note that because of our upright posture, human cross sections of the
spinal cord are parallel to the ground.

The Meninges and Ventricular System LO 3.2

Compare the locations and functions of the meninges and ventricular
system.

The entire nervous system---brain, spinal cord, cranial and spinal
nerves, and peripheral ganglia---is covered by tough connective tissue.
The protective sheaths around the brain and spinal cord are referred to
as the meninges (from the Greek word for "membrane"). The meninges
consist of three layers, which are shown in Figure 3.3. The outer layer,
called dura mater, is durable, thick, tough, and flexible but
unstretchable. The middle layer of the meninges, the arachnoid membrane,
gets its name from the weblike appearance of the arachnoid trabeculae
that protrude from it (from the Greek arachne, meaning "spider";
trabecula means "track"). The arachnoid membrane, soft and spongy, lies
beneath the dura

mater. Closely attached to the brain and spinal cord, and following
every surface convolution, is the pia mater ("pious mother"). The
smaller surface blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord are contained
within this layer. Between the pia mater and arachnoid membrane is a gap
called the subarachnoid space. This space is filled with cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF). The peripheral nervous system is covered with two layers of
meninges. The middle layer (arachnoid membrane), with its associated
pool of CSF, covers only the brain and spinal cord. Outside the central
nervous system, the outer and inner layers (dura mater and pia mater)
fuse and form a sheath that covers the spinal nerves, cranial nerves,
and the peripheral ganglia. The ventricular system of the brain consists
of a series of hollow, interconnected chambers called ventricles
("little bellies"), which are filled with CSF. (See Figure 3.4.) The
largest two chambers, the lateral ventricles, are connected to the third
ventricle. The third ventricle is located at the midline of the brain,
and its walls divide the surrounding parts of the brain into symmetrical
halves. A bridge of neural tissue called the massa intermedia crosses
through the middle of the third ventricle and makes a convenient
landmark. The cerebral aqueduct, a long tube, connects the third
ventricle to the fourth ventricle. The ventricles are more than just
empty spaces in the brain. They serve the very important function of
producing and containing CSF. CSF is made by special tissue with a rich
blood supply called the choroid plexus, which extends into all four of
the ventricles. Once CSF is produced by the choroid plexus in the
lateral ventricles, it flows into the third ventricle. More CSF is
produced in this ventricle, and it then flows through the cerebral
aqueduct to the fourth ventricle, where still more CSF is produced. The
CSF leaves the fourth ventricle through small openings that connect with
the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain. The CSF then flows through
the subarachnoid space around the CNS, where it is reabsorbed into the
blood supply through the arachnoid granulations. The brain is very soft
and jellylike. The considerable weight of a human brain (approximately
1400 g), along with its delicate construction, requires that it be
protected

from shock. Fortunately, the intact brain within a living human is very
well protected. It floats in a bath of CSF contained within the
subarachnoid space. Because the brain is completely immersed in liquid,
its net weight is reduced to approximately 80 g. As a result, pressure
on the base of the brain is considerably reduced. The CSF surrounding
the brain and spinal cord also helps reduce the shock to the CNS that
would be caused by sudden head movement. Occasionally, the flow of CSF
is interrupted at some point in its route of passage. For example, a
brain tumor growing in the midbrain may push against the cerebral
aqueduct, blocking the flow of CSF, or an infant may be born with a
cerebral aqueduct that is too small to accommodate a normal flow of CSF.
This occlusion results in greatly increased pressure within the
ventricles,

because the choroid plexus continues to produce CSF. The walls of the
ventricles then expand and produce a condition known as obstructive
hydrocephalus (hydrocephalus means "waterhead"). If the obstruction
remains and if nothing is done to reverse the increased intracerebral
pressure, blood vessels will be occluded, and ­permanent---perhaps
fatal---brain damage will occur. Fortunately, a surgeon can usually
operate on the person, drilling a hole through the skull and inserting a
shunt tube into one of the ventricles. The tube is then placed beneath
the skin and connected to a pressure relief valve that is implanted in
the abdominal cavity. When the pressure in the ventricles becomes
excessive, the valve permits the CSF to escape into the abdomen, where
it is eventually reabsorbed into the blood supply. (See Figure 3.5.)

Module Review: Basic Features of the Nervous System Anatomical
Directions LO 3.1 Apply anatomical terms to the nervous system. Anterior
and rostral refer to the front of the nervous system. Posterior and
caudal refer to the back of the nervous system. Dorsal refers to the top
of the brain, head, and the back, while ventral refers to the "belly"
side of the nervous system. Superior means above, and inferior means
below. Medial refers to a position along the midline, and lateral refers
to a position to the side. A frontal section is the result of a coronal
cut; a horizontal section is the result of a cut parallel to the ground,
and a sagittal section results from a cut that is perpendicular to the
ground and parallel to the neuraxis in the human brain.

is the middle layer of the meninges. The pia mater is the inner layer of
the meninges. The ventricular system consists of four ventricles filled
with cerebrospinal fluid. CSF is generated by the choroid plexus within
the ventricles. CSF flows from the lateral ventricles, to the third
ventricle, along the cerebral aqueduct, and into the fourth ventricle.
CSF then flows into the subarachnoid space and is reabsorbed into the
blood. CSF functions to protect the brain by distributing its weight and
absorbing shock.

Thought Question When studying the brain, many neuroscientists use a
reference tool called a brain atlas. Just like a road atlas can help you
find your way to a new location, a brain atlas can help a researcher
find a location in the brain. Instead of using compass directions like
north, south, east, and west, a brain atlas uses anatomical directions,
like anterior and posterior, and section directions, like coronal or
sagittal. Practice using anatomical direction terms by writing
directions for navigating from the center of the brain to the cortex
located at the most anterior point of the brain, or from the ventral
surface of the brain to the most caudal point in the cortex.

Structure and Function of the Central Nervous System (CNS) Understanding
the basic features of the central nervous system can make learning about
the locations of important structures easier. Table 3.1 summarizes many
of the terms introduced in this section and includes some of the major
structures found in each part of the brain. The table shows the major
divisions (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) and subdivisions
(telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon,
myelencephalon) of the brain, along with the ventricles and principal
brain structures found within them. Figure 3.6 shows the locations of
many of the corresponding structures in the adult, human brain. These
structures will be described in the remainder of the chapter, and will
be organized by subdivisions.

Identify the locations and functions of the structures of the

The forebrain contains two subdivisions: the telencephalon and the
diencephalon. (See Figure 3.7.) We will begin with the structures of the
telencephalon. Diencephalon structures will be discussion in the
following module. The telencephalon includes most of the two symmetrical
cerebral hemispheres. These hemispheres make up the cerebrum. The
cerebral hemispheres are made up of the cerebral cortex, the limbic
system, and the basal ganglia. The limbic system and basal ganglia are
primarily in the subcortical regions of the brain, located beneath the
cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex surrounds the cerebral hemispheres
like the bark of a tree. In humans, the cerebral cortex appears folded,
or convoluted. These convolutions, consisting of sulci (small grooves),
fissures (large grooves), and gyri (bulges between adjacent sulci or

fissures), help enlarge the surface area of the cortex, compared with a
smooth brain of the same size. The presence of these convolutions
triples the area of the cerebral cortex. The total surface area is
approximately 2360 cm2 (2.5 ft.2), and the thickness is approximately 3
mm. The cerebral cortex consists mostly of glia and the cell bodies,
dendrites, and interconnecting axons of neurons. Because cell bodies
predominate, giving the cerebral cortex a grayish tan appearance, it is
referred to as gray matter. (See Figure 3.8.) Beneath the cerebral
cortex are millions of axons that connect the neurons of the cerebral
cortex with those located elsewhere in the brain. The large
concentration of myelin gives this tissue, called white matter, an
opaque white appearance. Lobes of the Cerebral Cortex Discussing the
various regions of the cerebral cortex is easier if we have names for
them. The cerebral cortex is divided into four areas, or lobes, named
for the bones of the skull that cover them: the frontal lobe, parietal
lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe. The brain contains two of each
lobe, with one lobe in each hemisphere. The frontal lobe (the "front")
includes everything in front of the central sulcus. The parietal lobe
(the "wall") is located on the side of the cerebral hemisphere, just
behind the central sulcus, caudal to the frontal lobe. The temporal lobe
(the "temple") juts forward from the base of the brain, ventral to the
frontal and parietal lobes. The occipital lobe (from the Latin ob, "in
back of," and caput, "head") lies at the very back of the brain, caudal
to the parietal and temporal lobes. Figure 3.9 shows these lobes in
three views of the cerebral hemispheres: a ventral view (a view from the
bottom), a midsagittal view (a view of the inner surface of the right
hemisphere after the left hemisphere has been removed), and a lateral
view.

Sensory Cortex Three areas of the cerebral cortex receive information
from the sensory organs. The primary visual cortex, which receives
visual information, is located in the occipital lobe at the back of the
brain, on the inner surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres---primarily on
the upper and lower banks of the calcarine fissure. (Calcarine means
"spur-shaped." See Figure 3.10.) The primary auditory cortex, which
receives auditory information, is located in the temporal lobes, on the
lower surface of a deep fissure in the side of the brain---the lateral
fissure. (See the inset in Figure 3.10.) The primary somatosensory
cortex, a vertical strip of cortex just caudal to the central sulcus in
the parietal lobe, receives information from the body senses. (See
Figure 3.10.) The base of the somatosensory cortex and a portion of the
insular cortex, which is normally hidden from view by the frontal and
temporal lobes, receive information about taste. Except for olfaction
(smell) and gustation (taste), sensory information from the body or the
environment is sent to the primary sensory cortex of the contralateral
hemisphere. For example, the primary somatosensory cortex of the left
hemisphere learns what the right hand is holding, and the left primary
visual cortex learns what is happening toward the person's right.
Sensory Association Cortex The regions of primary sensory and motor
cortex occupy only a small part of the cerebral cortex. The rest of the
cerebral cortex accomplishes what is done between sensation and action:
perceiving, learning and remembering, planning, and acting. These
processes take place in the association areas of the cerebral cortex.
The central sulcus provides an important dividing line between the
rostral and caudal regions of the cerebral cortex. (Look once more at
Figure 3.10.) The rostral region is involved in movement-related
activities, such as

M03_CARL0287_13_GE_C03.indd 76

planning and performing behaviors. The caudal region is involved in
perceiving and learning. Each primary sensory area of the cerebral
cortex sends information to adjacent regions, called the sensory
association cortex. Circuits of neurons in the sensory association
cortex analyze the information received from the primary sensory cortex,
where perception takes place and memories are stored. The regions of the
sensory association cortex located closest to the primary sensory areas
receive information from only one sensory system. For example, the
region closest to the primary visual cortex analyzes visual information
and stores visual memories. Regions of the sensory association cortex
located far from the primary sensory areas receive information from more
than one sensory system and are involved in several kinds of perceptions
and memories. These regions make it possible to integrate information
from more than one sensory system. For example, we can learn the
connection between the sight of a particular face and the sound of a
particular voice. (Look again at Figure 3.10.) If people sustain damage
to the somatosensory association cortex, their deficits are related to
somatosensation and the environment in general. For example, they may
have difficulty perceiving the shapes of objects that they can touch but
not see, they may be unable to name parts of their bodies (see the
following case of Mr. M.), or they may have trouble drawing maps or
following them. Although people who sustain damage to the visual
association cortex will not become blind, they may be unable to
recognize objects by sight. People who sustain damage to the auditory
association cortex may have difficulty perceiving speech or even
producing meaningful speech of their own. People who sustain damage to
regions of the association cortex at the junction of the three posterior
lobes, where

the somatosensory, visual, and auditory functions overlap, may have
difficulty reading or writing. Some of these examples are described in
Chapter 13. Mr. M., a city bus driver, stopped to pick up a passenger.
The passenger asked him a question, and Mr. M. suddenly realized that he
didn't understand what she was saying. He could hear her, but her words
made no sense. He opened his mouth to reply. He made some sounds, but
the look on the woman's face told him that she couldn't understand what
he was trying to say. He turned off the engine and looked around at the
passengers and tried to tell them he needed help. Although he was unable
to say anything, they understood that something was wrong, and one of
them called an ambulance. An MRI scan showed that Mr. M. had sustained
an intracerebral hemorrhage---a kind of stroke caused by the rupture of
blood vessels in the brain. The stroke had damaged his left parietal
lobe. Mr. M. gradually regained the ability to talk and understand the
speech of others, but some deficits remained. A neurologist examined
Mr. M. several weeks after his stroke. The dialogue went something like
this: "Show me your hand." "My hand . . . my hand." Looks at his arms,
then touches his left forearm. "Show me your chin." "My chin." Looks at
his arms, looks down, puts his hand on his abdomen. "Show me your right
elbow." "My right . . ." (points to the right with his right thumb)
"elbow." Looks up and down his right arm, finally touches his right
shoulder. Mr. M. could understand that the physician was asking him to
point out parts of his body and could repeat the names of the body parts
when he heard them, but he could not identify which body parts these
names referred to. This deficit, which sometimes follows damage to the
left parietal lobe, is called autotopagnosia, or "poor knowledge of
one's own topography." The parietal lobes are involved with space: the
right primarily with external space and the left with one's body and
personal space. You will learn more about disorders such as this one in
Chapter 13, which includes brain mechanisms of language.

Motor Cortex The region of the cerebral cortex that is most directly
involved in the control of movement is the primary motor cortex, located
just in front of the primary somatosensory cortex. Neurons in different
parts of the primary motor cortex are connected to muscles in different
parts of the body. The connections, like those of the sensory regions of
the cerebral cortex, are contralateral. This means that the left primary
motor cortex controls the right side of the body and vice versa. For
example, if a surgeon places an electrode on the surface of the primary
motor cortex and stimulates the neurons there with a weak electrical
current, the result will be movement of a particular part of the body.
Moving the electrode to a different spot will cause a different part of
the body to move. (Look again at Figure 3.10.) You can think of the
strip of primary motor

movement. (We will see shortly who is the "player" of this piano.) Motor
Association Cortex Just as regions of the sensory association cortex of
the posterior part of the brain are involved in perceiving and
remembering, the frontal association cortex is involved in the planning
and execution of movements. The motor association cortex (also known as
the premotor cortex) is located just rostral to the primary motor
cortex. Because this region controls the primary motor cortex, it
directly controls behavior. If the primary motor cortex is the keyboard
of the piano, then the motor association cortex is the piano player. The
rest of the frontal lobe, rostral to the motor association cortex, is
known as the prefrontal cortex. This region of the brain is less
involved with the control of movement and more involved in formulating
plans and strategies. (See Figure 3.9c.) Lateralization in the Cerebral
Cortex Although the two cerebral hemispheres cooperate, they do not

identical functions. Some functions are lateralized--- located primarily
on one side of the brain. In general, the left hemisphere participates
in the analysis of information---the extraction of the elements that
make up the whole of an experience. This ability makes the left
hemisphere particularly good at recognizing serial events---events whose
elements occur one after the other---and controlling sequences of
behavior. (In a few people, the functions of the left and right
hemispheres are reversed.) The serial functions that are performed by
the left hemisphere include verbal activities, such as talking,
understanding the speech of other people, reading, and writing. These
abilities are disrupted by damage to the various regions of the left
hemisphere. (We will say more about language and the brain in Chapter
14.) In contrast, the right hemisphere is specialized for synthesis,
which means that it is particularly good at putting isolated elements
together to perceive things as a whole. For example, our ability to draw
sketches (especially of three-dimensional objects), read maps, and
construct complex objects out of smaller elements depends heavily on
circuits of neurons that are located in the right

connections that link different regions of the two hemispheres.
Surgically severing the corpus callosum creates a condition called split
brain that is described in more detail in Chapter 14. Figure 3.11 shows
the bundles of axons that constitute the corpus callosum, obtained using
diffusion tensor imaging, a special neuroimaging method described in
Chapter 5. Another form of cerebral cortex, the limbic cortex, is
located around the medial edge of the cerebral hemispheres (limbus means
"border"). The cingulate gyrus, an important region of the limbic
cortex, can be seen in Figure 3.12. The limbic cortex, along with other
parts of the brain, forms the limbic system. The limbic system also
includes the hippocampus ("sea horse") and the amygdala ("almond"),
located next to the lateral ventricle in the temporal lobe. The fornix
("arch") is a bundle of axons that connects the hippocampus with other
regions of the brain, including the mammillary bodies ("breast-shaped"),
protrusions on the base of the brain that contain parts of the
hypothalamus. (See Figure 3.12.) We now know that parts of the limbic
system (notably, the hippocampal formation and the region of limbic
cortex that surrounds it) are involved in learning and memory. The
amygdala and some regions of the limbic cortex are specifically involved
in emotions: feelings and expressions of emotions, emotional memories,
and recognition of the signs of emotions in other people. (See Chapter
11.)

hemisphere. Damage to the right hemisphere disrupts these abilities. As
we go about our daily lives, we are not aware of the fact that each
hemisphere perceives the world differently. Although the two cerebral
hemispheres perform somewhat different functions, our perceptions and
our memories are unified. This unity is accomplished by the corpus
callosum, a large band of axons that connects corresponding parts of the
cerebral cortex of the left and right hemispheres: The left and right
temporal lobes are connected, the left and right parietal lobes are
connected, and so on. Because of the corpus callosum, each region of the
association cortex knows what is happening in the corresponding region
of the opposite side of the brain. The corpus callosum also makes a few

Identify the locations and functions of the structures of the
diencephalon.

The second major division of the forebrain, the diencephalon, is located
between the telencephalon and the mesencephalon and surrounds the third
ventricle. Its two most important structures are the thalamus and the
hypothalamus. (See Figure 3.13 and Figure 3.14.) The thalamus (from the
Greek thalamos, "inner chamber") makes up the dorsal part of the
diencephalon. It is located near the middle of the cerebral hemispheres,
immediately medial and caudal to the basal ganglia. (Look again at
Figure 3.13 and Figure 3.14.) The thalamus has two lobes, connected by a
bridge of gray matter called the massa intermedia. Most neural input to
the cerebral cortex is received from the thalamus, and much of the
cortical surface can be divided into regions that receive projections
from specific parts of the thalamus. The thalamus is divided into
several nuclei. Some thalamic nuclei receive sensory information from
the sensory systems. The neurons in these nuclei then relay the sensory
information to specific sensory projection areas of the cerebral cortex.
For example, the lateral geniculate nucleus receives information from
the eye and sends axons to the primary visual cortex, and the medial
geniculate nucleus receives information from the inner ear and sends
axons to the primary auditory cortex. Other thalamic nuclei project to
specific regions of the cerebral cortex, but they do not relay sensory
information. For example, the ventrolateral nucleus receives information
from the cerebellum and projects it to the THALAMUS

that contains the chromosomes, and---as in this case---to a collection
of neurons located within the brain.) The major parts of the basal
ganglia are the caudate nucleus, the putamen, and the globus pallidus
(the "nucleus with a tail," the "shell," and the "pale globe"). (See
Figure 3.13.) The basal ganglia are involved in the control of movement.
For example, Parkinson's disease is caused by the degeneration of
certain neurons located in the midbrain that send axons to the caudate
nucleus and the putamen (see Chapter 16). The symptoms of this disease
are weakness, tremors, limb rigidity, poor balance, and difficulty in
initiating movements.

primary motor cortex. Still other nuclei receive information from one
region of the cerebral cortex and relay it to another region. Several
nuclei are involved in controlling the general excitability of the
cerebral cortex. To accomplish this task, these nuclei have widespread
projections to all cortical regions. The hypothalamus is located beneath
the thalamus. Although the hypothalamus is a relatively small structure,
it is an important one. It controls the autonomic nervous system and the
endocrine system and organizes behaviors related to the survival of the
species, including fighting, escape, eating, and reproduction. The
hypothalamus is located on both sides of the ventral portion of the
third ventricle. The hypothalamus is a complex structure, containing
many nuclei and fiber tracts. Figure 3.15 indicates its location and
size. Note that the pituitary gland is attached to the base of the
hypothalamus via the pituitary stalk. Just in front of the pituitary
stalk is the optic chiasm, where half of the axons in the optic nerves
(from the eyes) cross from one side of the brain to the other. The
hypothalamus controls many behaviors, such as drinking and sleeping.
Much of the endocrine system is controlled by hormones produced by cells
in the hypothalamus. A special system of blood vessels directly connects
the hypothalamus with the anterior pituitary gland. (See Figure 3.15.)
The hypothalamic hormones are secreted by specialized

HYPOTHALAMUS

neurons called neurosecretory cells, located near the base of the
pituitary stalk. These hormones stimulate the anterior pituitary gland
to secrete its hormones. For example, gonadotropin-releasing hormone
causes the anterior pituitary gland to secrete the gonadotropic
hormones, which play a role in reproductive physiology and behavior.
Most of the hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary gland control
other endocrine glands. For example, the gonadotropic hormones stimulate
the gonads (ovaries and testes) to release male or female sex hormones.
These hormones affect cells throughout the body, including some in the
brain. Two other anterior pituitary hormones--- prolactin and
somatotropic hormone (growth hormone)--- do not control other glands but
act as the final messenger. The hypothalamus also produces and controls
the secretion of the hormones of the posterior pituitary gland. These
hormones include oxytocin and vasopressin. Oxytocin and vasopressin have
a number of different physiological and behavioral effects, including
pair bonding and parental behavior, which you can read more about in
Chapter 10. They are produced by neurons in the hypothalamus whose axons
travel down the pituitary stalk and terminate in the posterior pituitary
gland. The hormones are carried in vesicles through the axoplasm of
these neurons and collect in the terminal buttons in the posterior
pituitary gland. When these axons fire, the hormone contained within
their terminal buttons is released and enters the circulatory system.

The Midbrain: Mesencephalon LO 3.5

Identify the locations and functions of the structures of the
mesencephalon.

The midbrain (also called the mesencephalon) surrounds the cerebral
aqueduct and consists of two major parts: the tectum and the tegmentum.
(See Figure 3.16a.) The tectum ("roof") is located in the dorsal portion
of the mesencephalon. Its principal structures are the superior
colliculi and the inferior colliculi, which appear as four bumps on the
dorsal surface of the brain stem. The brain stem includes the midbrain
and the hindbrain, and it is called the brain stem because it looks just
like that: a stem. Figure 3.16 shows several views of the brain stem:

lateral and posterior views of the brain stem inside a semitransparent
brain, an enlarged view of the brain stem with part of the cerebellum
cut away to reveal the inside of the fourth ventricle, and a cross
section through the midbrain. The inferior colliculi are a part of the
auditory system. The superior colliculi are part of the visual system.
In mammals, they are primarily involved in visual reflexes and reactions
to moving stimuli. The tegmentum ("covering") consists of the portion of
the mesencephalon beneath the tectum. It includes the rostral end of the
reticular formation, several nuclei controlling eye movements, the
periaqueductal gray matter, the red nucleus, the substantia nigra, and
the ventral tegmental area. (See Figure 3.16d.) TEGMENTUM

Structure of the Nervous System

The reticular formation is a large structure consisting of many nuclei
(over 90 in all). It is also characterized by a diffuse, interconnected
network of neurons with complex dendritic and axonal processes
(reticulum means "little net"). The reticular formation occupies the
core of the brain stem, from the lower border of the medulla to the
upper border of the midbrain. The reticular formation receives sensory
information by means of various pathways and projects axons to the
cerebral cortex, thalamus, and spinal cord. It plays a role in sleep and
arousal, attention, muscle tone, movement, and various vital reflexes.
The periaqueductal gray matter is so called because it consists mostly
of cell bodies of neurons ("gray matter," as contrasted with the "white
matter" of axon bundles) that surround the cerebral aqueduct as it
travels from the third to the fourth ventricle. (See Figure 3.16d.) The
periaqueductal gray matter contains neural circuits that control
sequences of movements that constitute species-typical behaviors, such
as fighting and mating. As we will see in Chapter 7, opiates such as
morphine decrease an organism's sensitivity to pain by stimulating
receptors on neurons located in this region. The red nucleus and
substantia nigra ("black substance") are important components of the
motor system. (See Figure 3.16d.) A bundle of axons that arises from the
red nucleus constitutes one of the two major fiber systems that bring
motor information from the cerebral cortex and cerebellum to the spinal
cord. The substantia nigra contains neurons whose axons project to the
caudate nucleus and putamen, parts of the basal ganglia. Generation of
these neurons causes the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

The Hindbrain: Metencephalon and Myelencephalon LO 3.6

Contrast the locations and functions of the structures of the
metencephalon and myelencephalon.

The hindbrain, which surrounds the fourth ventricle, consists of two
major divisions: the metencephalon and the myelencephalon. METENCEPHALON
The metencephalon consists of the cerebellum and the pons. The
cerebellum is critical in coordinating movements while the pons is
important in sleep/ wake regulation.

Cerebellum The cerebellum ("little brain"), with its two hemispheres,
resembles a miniature version of the cerebrum. It is covered by the
cerebellar cortex and has a set of deep cerebellar nuclei. These nuclei
receive projections from the cerebellar cortex and themselves send
projections

M03_CARL0287_13_GE_C03.indd 83

83

out of the cerebellum to other parts of the brain. Each ­hemisphere of
the cerebellum is attached to the dorsal surface of the pons by bundles
of axons: the superior, ­middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles
("little feet"). (See ­Figure 3.16c.) Musicians, artists, and athletes
owe much to their cerebellums. The cerebellum receives visual, auditory,
vestibular, and somatosensory information, and it also receives
information about individual muscle movements being directed by the
brain. The cerebellum integrates this information and modifies the motor
outflow, exerting a coordinating and smoothing effect on the movements.
Cerebellar damage results in jerky, poorly coordinated, exaggerated
movements, and extensive cerebellar damage makes it impossible even to
stand. Chapter 8 discusses the anatomy and functions of the cerebellum
in more detail. Pons The pons, a large bulge in the brain stem, lies
between the mesencephalon and medulla oblongata, immediately ventral to
the cerebellum. Pons means "bridge," but it does not really look like
one. The pons contains, in its core, a portion of the reticular
formation, including some nuclei that appear to be important in sleep
and arousal. It also contains a large nucleus that relays information
from the cerebral cortex to the cerebellum. MYELENCEPHALON The
myelencephalon contains one major structure, the medulla oblongata
(literally, "oblong marrow"), usually just called the medulla. This
structure is the most caudal portion of the brain stem, and its lower
border is the rostral end of the spinal cord. (Refer again to Figure
3.16c.) The medulla contains part of the reticular formation, including
nuclei that control vital functions such as regulation of the
cardiovascular system, respiration, and skeletal muscle tone.

The Spinal Cord LO 3.7

Describe the structure and functions of the spinal cord.

The spinal cord is a long, tube-like structure, wider at the top than
the bottom. The principal functions of the spinal cord are to distribute
motor fibers to the effector organs of the body (glands and muscles) and
to collect somatosensory information to be passed on to the brain. The
spinal cord can sometimes function independently of the brain. For
example, some reflex circuits involve only the spinal cord and not the
brain. (See Chapter 8 and Figure 3.17.) The spinal cord is protected by
the vertebral column, which is composed of 24 individual vertebrae of
the cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), and lumbar (lower back) regions
and the fused vertebrae that make up the sacral and coccygeal

24/11/21 12:19 PM

84 Chapter 3 portions of the column (located in the pelvic region). The
spinal cord passes through a hole in each of the vertebrae (the spinal
foramens). Figure 3.18 illustrates the divisions and structures of the
spinal cord and the vertebral column. The spinal cord is only about
two-thirds as long as the vertebral column. The rest of the space is
filled by spinal roots that make up the cauda equina ("horse's tail").
To produce the caudal block that is sometimes used in pelvic surgery or
childbirth, a local anesthetic can be injected into the CSF contained
within the sac of dura mater surrounding the cauda equina. The drug
blocks conduction in the axons of the cauda equina. Figure 3.18a shows a
portion of the spinal cord, with the layers of the meninges that wrap
it. Small bundles of fibers emerge from each side of the spinal cord in
two straight lines along its dorsolateral and ventrolateral surfaces.
Groups of these bundles fuse together and become the 31 paired sets of
dorsal roots and ventral roots. The dorsal and ventral roots join
together as they pass through the intervertebral foramens and become
spinal nerves. Figure 3.18b shows a cross section of the spinal cord.
Like the brain, the spinal cord consists of white matter and gray
matter. Unlike the brain's white matter, the spinal cord's white matter
(consisting of ascending and descending bundles of myelinated axons) is
on the outside and the gray matter (mostly neural cell bodies and short,
unmyelinated axons) is on the inside. In Figure 3.18b, ascending tracts
are indicated in blue and descending tracts are indicated in red.

Module Review: Structure and Function of the Central Nervous System The
Forebrain: Telencephalon LO 3.3 Identify the locations and functions of
the structures of the telencephalon. The forebrain includes the
telencephalon, which contains the cerebral cortex, limbic system, and
basal ganglia. The cerebral cortex is responsible for sensory and motor
functions, auditory and visual processing, and executive functions. The
limbic system is responsible for motivation, emotion, and some forms of
learning. The basal ganglia are involved in the control of movement.

The Forebrain: Diencephalon LO 3.4 Identify the locations and functions
of the structures of the diencephalon. The diencephalon includes the
thalamus, hypothalamus, and pituitary gland. The thalamus is involved in
conveying information to various locations of the brain. The
hypothalamus is involved in regulation of the endocrine system and the
autonomic nervous system. The pituitary gland is also involved in
regulation of the endocrine system.

The Midbrain: Mesencephalon LO 3.5 Identify the locations and functions
of the structures of the mesencephalon. The mesencephalon (midbrain) is
located in the brain region surrounding the cerebral aqueduct and
contains the tectum and tegmentum. The tectum is located in the dorsal
portion of the mesencephalon. The tectum contains the superior and
inferior colliculi. The superior colliculi are involved in visual
processing. The inferior colliculi are involved in auditory processing.
The tegmentum is located below the tectum and contains the reticular

substantia nigra. The reticular formation is involved in sensory
processing, sleep, attention, muscle tone, movement, and reflexes. The
periaqueductal gray matter is involved in species-typical behavior and
pain perception. The red nucleus and substantia nigra are involved in
motor control.

The Hindbrain: Metencephalon and Myelencephalon LO 3.6 Contrast the

myelencephalon. The metencephalon and myelencephalon (hindbrain)
surround the fourth ventricle. The metencephalon contains the
cerebellum, which is involved in balance and coordinated movements, and
the pons, which is involved in receiving information from the cortex and
sleep regulation. The myelencephalon contains the medulla oblongata,
which is involved in regulating vital functions.

The Spinal Cord LO 3.7 Describe the structure and functions of the
spinal cord. The spinal cord is contained within the vertebral column
and functions to relay sensory information to the brain from the body,
relay motor information from the brain to the body, and coordinate
reflexive behaviors.

Cranial Nerves LO 3.8

Identify the functions of the cranial nerves.

Twelve pairs of cranial nerves are attached to the ventral surface of
the brain. Most of these nerves serve sensory and motor functions of the
head and neck region. One of them, the tenth, or vagus nerve, regulates
the functions of organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. It is
called the vagus ("wandering") nerve because its branches wander
throughout the thoracic and abdominal cavities. (The word vagabond has
the same root.) Figure 3.19 presents a

red and that afferent (sensory) fibers are drawn in blue. As we
mentioned in the previous section, cell bodies of sensory nerve fibers
that enter the brain and spinal cord (except for the visual system) are
located outside the central nervous system. Somatosensory information
(and the sense of taste) is received, via the cranial nerves, from
unipolar neurons. Auditory, vestibular, and visual information is
received via fibers of bipolar neurons (see Chapter 2). Olfactory
information is received via the olfactory bulbs, which receive
information from the olfactory receptors in the nose.

Spinal Nerves LO 3.9

Differentiate the afferent and efferent axons of the spinal nerves.

The spinal nerves begin at the junction of the dorsal and ventral roots
of the spinal cord. The nerves leave the vertebral column and travel to
the muscles or sensory receptors they innervate (or supply), branching
repeatedly as they go. Branches of spinal nerves often follow blood
vessels, especially those branches that innervate skeletal muscles.
Let's consider the pathways by which sensory information enters the
spinal cord and motor information leaves it. The cell bodies of all
axons that bring sensory information into the brain and spinal cord are
located outside the CNS.

24/11/21 12:19 PM

Structure of the Nervous System

(The sole exception is the visual system, where the retina of the eye is
a part of the brain.) These incoming axons are referred to as afferent
axons, meaning that the direction of information is inward, toward the
CNS. The cell bodies that give rise to the axons that bring
somatosensory information to the spinal cord reside in the dorsal root
ganglia, rounded swellings of the dorsal root. (See Figure 3.20.) The
axonal stalk divides close to the cell body, sending one limb into the
spinal cord and the other limb out to the sensory organ. Note that all
of the axons in the dorsal root convey somatosensory information. Cell
bodies that give rise to the ventral root are located within the gray
matter of the spinal cord. The axons of these multipolar neurons leave
the spinal cord via a ventral root, which joins a dorsal root to make a
spinal nerve. The axons that leave the spinal cord through the ventral
roots control muscles and glands. They are referred to as efferent
axons, meaning that the direction of information is outward, away from
the CNS.

The Autonomic Nervous System LO 3.10 Compare the sympathetic and
parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system. The part of
the PNS that we have discussed so far---the part that receives sensory
information from the sensory organs and that controls movements of the
skeletal muscles--- is called the somatic nervous system. The other
branch of the PNS---the autonomic nervous system (ANS)---is

87

concerned with the regulation of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and
glands. Smooth muscle is found in the skin, in blood vessels, in the
eyes, and in the walls and sphincters of the gut, gallbladder, and
urinary bladder, and its regulation is critical for keeping us alive.
The ANS consists of two anatomically separate systems: the sympathetic
division and the parasympathetic division. With few exceptions, organs
of the body are innervated by both of these subdivisions, and each has a
different effect. For example, the sympathetic division speeds the heart
rate, whereas the parasympathetic division slows it. S Y M PAT H E T I C
D I V I S I O N O F T H E A N S T h e sympathetic division is most
involved in activities associated with the expenditure of energy from
reserves that are stored in the body. For example, when an organism is
excited, the sympathetic nervous system increases blood flow to skeletal
muscles, stimulates the secretion of epinephrine (resulting in increased
heart rate and a rise in blood sugar level), and causes piloerection
(erection of fur in mammals that have it and production of "goosebumps"
in humans). Sometimes the sympathetic division is described as
coordinating fight, flight, or freeze responses to a stressor. The cell
bodies of sympathetic motor neurons are located in the gray matter of
the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord (the sympathetic
nervous system is also known as the thoracolumbar system). The fibers of
these neurons exit via the ventral roots. After joining the spinal
nerves, the fibers branch off and pass into

sympathetic ganglia (not to be confused with the dorsal root ganglia).
Figure 3.21 shows the relationship of these ganglia to the spinal cord.
Note that individual sympathetic ganglia are connected to the
neighboring ganglia above and below to form the sympathetic ganglion
chain. The axons that leave the spinal cord through the ventral root
belong to the preganglionic neurons. Sympathetic preganglionic axons
enter the ganglia of the sympathetic chain. Most of the axons form
synapses there, but others pass through these ganglia and travel to one
of the sympathetic ganglia located among the internal organs. With one
exception, all sympathetic preganglionic axons form synapses with
neurons located in one of the ganglia. The neurons with which they form
synapses are called postganglionic neurons. The postganglionic neurons
send axons to the target organs, such as the intestines, stomach,
kidneys, or sweat glands. (See Figure 3.21.) The parasympathetic
division of the ANS supports activities that are involved with increases
in the body's supply of stored energy. These activities include
salivation, gastric and intestinal motility, secretion of digestive
juices, and increased blood flow to the gastrointestinal system.
Sometimes the parasympathetic division is described as coordinating the
rest and relax responses after the body has been stressed. Cell bodies
that give rise to preganglionic axons in the parasympathetic nervous
system are located in two PARASYMPATHETIC DIVISION OF THE ANS

regions: the nuclei of some of the cranial nerves (especially the vagus
nerve) and the intermediate horn of the gray matter in the sacral region
of the spinal cord. Because of this, the parasympathetic division of the
ANS can also be referred to as the craniosacral system. Parasympathetic
ganglia are located close to target organs, and their postganglionic
fibers are relatively short. The terminal buttons of both preganglionic
and postganglionic neurons in the parasympathetic nervous system secrete
acetylcholine. Table 3.2 summarizes the major divisions of the PNS.

Marco Pantani, one of the most talented road racing cyclists, had died
of substance abuse. To cope with challenges, he had resorted to using
cocaine as well as drinking alcohol. One day, Marco was found dead in a
small hotel in Italy and the coroner concluded that he had suffered a
heart failure due to cocaine overdose. Cocaine is a psychoactive drug
that is typically inhaled or injected. Upon reaching the brain, it
alters the physiology of special molecules that neurons use for
communication---­ neurotransmitters (you will read more about
neurotransmitters in this chapter). Cocaine potentiates several
neurotransmitters involved in pleasure and reward functions in the
brain, which makes the drug highly addictive. Other recreational drugs,
such as alcohol, also modulate neurotransmitters. Alcohol mostly

signals and thus, produces feelings of relaxation as well as of
alleviating fear and anxiety. It also modulates other neurotransmitters
involved in pleasure and reward. But what happens if you mix two
psychoactive drugs as in the case of Marco Pantani? It is now known that
when alcohol is combined with ­cocaine, the liver forms a new
metabolite---cocaethylene. This new ­ metabolite, once it reaches the
brain, produces similar effects to those of cocaine alone but more
potent at times. Cocaethylene is also highly toxic for the heart as
compared to cocaine alone, and often leads to fatal cardiac emergencies.
Such toxic effects of recreational drugs are so powerful that even elite
endurance athletes with the strongest hearts in the world are not immune
to them.

Psychopharmacology and Neurotransmitters 93

As you read, keep in mind the number of individuals impacted by the
therapeutic and recreational drugs described in this chapter. For
example, in 2017, 140.6 million people in the United States used
alcohol, 48.7 million were cigarette smokers, 30.5 million used an
illicit drug, 4 million received substance abuse treatment, and 3.5
million received treatment for depression, such as the use of
antidepressant drugs (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, 2018). To convey an understanding of psychopharmacology,
the chapter begins with the basic principles of psychopharmacology.
Then, the second module examines the sites of action. The last module of
the chapter summarizes key neurotransmitters and neuromodulators
responsible for the effects of psychoactive drugs. This chapter does not
contain all this book has to say about the subject of
psychopharmacology. Throughout the book, you will learn about the use of
drugs to investigate the nature of neural circuits involved in the
control of perception, memory, and behavior. Chapters 17 and 18 discuss
the use of drugs to study and treat disorders such as schizophrenia,
depression, and anxiety disorders, and Chapter 19 discusses the
physiology of substance abuse.

Principles of Psychopharmacology Chapter 2 introduced you to the cells
of the nervous system, and Chapter 3 described its basic structure. Now
it is time to build on this information in the context of
psychopharmacology. Psychopharmacology is the study of

the effects of drugs on the nervous system and behavior. This module
includes an overview of the field of psychopharmacology and descriptions
of pharmacokinetics, drug effectiveness, placebos, and the effects of
repeatedly taking a drug (also called chronic use).

An Overview of Psychopharmacology LO 4.1

Differentiate between the terms drug, drug effect, and site of action.

What is a drug? Like many words, this one has several different
meanings. In one context it refers to a medication that we would obtain
from a pharmacist---a chemical that has a therapeutic effect on a
disease or its symptoms. In another context, the word refers to a
chemical that people are likely to abuse, such as heroin or cocaine. The
definition of a drug that will be used in this book (and the one
generally accepted by pharmacologists) is "an exogenous chemical not
necessary for normal cellular functioning that significantly alters the
functions of certain cells of the body when taken in relatively low
doses." Because the topic of this chapter is psychopharmacology, we will
focus only on chemicals (also known as psychoactive drugs) that alter
the functions of cells in the nervous system. (See Figure 4.1.) The word
exogenous is key to our understanding of drugs in this chapter. In this
context, exogenous means produced outside the body, so it rules out
chemical messengers produced by the body, such as neurotransmitters,
neuromodulators, or hormones. Chemical messengers produced by the body
are not drugs. This definition of a drug also rules out essential
nutrients, such as proteins, fats,

constituents of a healthy diet. Finally, it states that drugs are
effective in low doses. This qualification is important because large
quantities of almost any substance---even common substances such as the
salt you might add to your food---will alter the functions of cells. As
we will see in this chapter, drugs have effects and sites of action.
Drug effects are the changes we can observe in an individual's
physiological processes and behavior. For example, the effects of
codeine, morphine, and other opiates include decreased sensitivity to
pain, slowed digestion, sedation, muscular relaxation, pupil
constriction, and at high doses, euphoria. Sites of action are the
locations where drug molecules bind with molecules located on or in
cells of the body, to affect some biochemical processes of these cells.
For example, the sites of action for opiates are specialized receptors
in the membrane of some neurons. When opiate molecules attach to and
activate these receptors, the drugs alter the activity of these neurons
and produce their effects. This chapter considers both the effects of
drugs and their sites of action. Psychopharmacology is an important
field of neuroscience. It has been responsible for the development of
psychotherapeutic drugs, which are used to treat psychological and
behavioral disorders. It has also provided tools that enable researchers
to study the functions of cells of the nervous system and the behaviors
controlled by particular neural circuits. Together, research on drug
effects and sites of action helps build a more comprehensive
understanding from cellular to behavioral effects of drugs.

Pharmacokinetics LO 4.2

Describe the steps of pharmacokinetics.

Pharmacokinetics includes the steps by which drugs are (1) absorbed, (2)
distributed within the body, (3) metabolized, and (4) excreted. You can
think of these steps as describing the life cycle of a drug molecule in
the body. First, drug molecules are absorbed into the body based on how
they are administered. For example, if a drug is taken orally, it is
absorbed through the lining of the digestive system. After being
absorbed, drug molecules are distributed throughout the body by blood in
the circulatory system, including the central nervous system (CNS),
where many

sites of action are located. At the same time, drug molecules are being
metabolized, or deactivated, by enzymes. Most drug metabolizing
(deactivating) enzymes are located in the liver. Finally, drug molecules
are excreted and removed from the body, typically by the kidneys. (See
Figure 4.2.) ABSORPTION: ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION There are many routes
to administer a drug into the body. One way is by injection. The drug is
dissolved or suspended in a liquid and injected through a hypodermic
needle. The fastest route is intravenous (IV) injection---injection into
a vein. The drug is absorbed and distributed immediately, reaching the
brain within a few seconds. The disadvantages of IV injections are the
increased care and skill they require in comparison to most other forms
of injection and the fact that the entire dose reaches the bloodstream
at once. If an individual is especially sensitive to the drug, there may
be little time to administer another drug to counteract its effects.
Getting a drug into circulation using an intraperitoneal (IP) injection
is rapid but not as rapid as an IV injection. The drug is injected
through the abdominal wall into the peritoneal cavity---the space that
surrounds the stomach, intestines, liver, and other abdominal organs. IP
injection is commonly used to administer drugs to small laboratory
animals. An intramuscular (IM) injection is made directly into a large
muscle, such as those found in the upper arm, thigh, or buttocks. The
drug is absorbed into the bloodstream through the capillaries that
supply the muscle. A drug can also be injected beneath the skin by
subcutaneous (SC) injection. Additional injection methods are sometimes
used to deliver a drug directly into the brain or the cerebrospinal
fluid. As we saw in Chapter 2, the blood--brain barrier prevents certain
chemicals from leaving capillaries and entering the brain. Some drugs
cannot cross the blood--brain barrier. For these drugs to reach the
brain, they must be injected directly into the brain or cerebrospinal
fluid of the brain's ventricular system. To study the effects of a drug
in a specific region of the brain (for example, in a particular nucleus
of the hypothalamus), a researcher could inject a very small amount of
the drug directly into the brain. This procedure, known as intracerebral
administration, is described in more detail in Chapter 5. To achieve
widespread distribution of a drug in the brain, a researcher

can get past the blood--brain barrier by injecting the drug into a
cerebral ventricle. The drug is then absorbed into the brain tissue,
where it can exert its effects. This route, intracerebroventricular
(ICV) administration, is used very rarely in h ­ umans---primarily to
deliver antibiotics directly to the brain to treat certain types of
infections. Because the drug does not pass through any other parts of
the body before reaching its sites of action, intracerebral and ICV
administration produce very rapid drug effects. Oral administration is
often used with therapeutic drugs, such as in the methadone example at
the beginning of the chapter. Oral administration is relatively easy
(compared to the technical skill required for an injection), and the
drug molecules tend to reach their sites of action slowly. In oral
administration, the drug molecules are absorbed into the blood through
the digestive tract. After being absorbed, some of the drug molecules
undergo firstpass metabolism in the liver, reducing the number of active
drug molecules available to produce an effect in the rest of the body.
Some chemicals cannot be administered orally because they are destroyed
by stomach acid or digestive enzymes or because they are not absorbed
from the digestive system into the bloodstream. For example, insulin, a
peptide hormone, must be injected and is ineffective if taken orally.
Sublingual administration involves placing a drug beneath the tongue.
Using this form of administration, the drug is absorbed into the
bloodstream through the capillaries that supply the mucous membrane that
lines the mouth. For example, some drugs used to treat migraine
headaches are administered this way, resulting in a faster onset of
therapeutic effects (compared to oral administration) and less risk of
irritating the stomach. The lungs provide another route for drug
administration: inhalation. Nicotine, freebase cocaine, and psychoactive
compounds in marijuana are inhaled through smoking. In addition, many
general anesthetics are gases that are administered through inhalation.
The route from the lungs to the brain is very short and does not involve
first-pass metabolism. Drugs administered through inhalation produce
very rapid effects. Some drugs can be absorbed directly through the
skin, so they can be given by topical administration. Natural or
artificial steroid hormones can be administered in this way, and so can
nicotine (when used as a treatment to help people stop smoking). The
mucous membrane lining the nasal passages also provides a route for
topical administration. Commonly abused drugs such as cocaine and other
stimulants are often sniffed so that they come into contact with the
nasal mucosa. This route delivers the drug to the brain very rapidly.
Note that sniffing or "snorting" (also called insufflation) is not the
same route of administration as inhalation. When powdered drugs are
sniffed, they enter circulation through the mucous membrane of the nasal
passages, not the lungs.

D I S T R I B U T I O N : E N T RY O F D R U G S I N T O T H E BRAIN
Drugs exert their effects only when they reach

their sites of action. In the case of drugs that affect behavior, most
of these sites are located on or in cells of the CNS. The previous
section described the routes by which drugs can be introduced into the
body. Except for intracerebral or intracerebroventricular
administration, the routes of drug administration vary only in the speed
at which a drug enters the circulatory system. But what happens next?
Drug molecules must reach sites of action in the nervous system to
produce changes in behavior. The most important factor that determines
the rate at which a drug reaches sites of action within the brain is
lipid solubility, or the ability of fat-based molecules to pass through
cell membranes (see Chapter 2). The blood--brain barrier is a barrier
only for water-soluble molecules. Molecules that are soluble in lipids
pass through the cells that line the capillaries in the CNS, and they
rapidly distribute themselves throughout the brain. For example, heroin
(diacetylmorphine) is more lipid soluble than morphine. Because it is
highly lipid soluble, an intravenous injection of heroin produces more
rapid effects than an injection of morphine. Even though the molecules
of the two drugs are equally effective when they reach their sites of
action in the brain, the fact that heroin molecules get there faster
means that they produce a more intense "rush," and this explains why the
abuse potential of heroin is greater than that of morphine.

Drug Effectiveness LO 4.3

Identify why drugs vary in effectiveness and how these differences can
be measured.

Drugs vary widely in their effectiveness. The effects of a small dose of
a relatively effective drug can equal or exceed the effects of larger
amounts of a relatively ineffective drug. But why do drugs vary in their
effectiveness? There are two key reasons: sites of action and the
affinity of a drug with its site of action. First, different
drugs---even those that produce the same behavioral effects---may have
different sites of action. For example, oxycodone (OxyContin) and
aspirin have analgesic effects, but oxycodone suppresses the activity of
neurons in the spinal cord and brain that are involved in pain
perception, and aspirin reduces the production of a chemical involved in
transmitting information from damaged tissue to pain-sensitive neurons.
Because the drugs produce their effects via different sites of action, a
given dose of oxycodone produces greater pain relief than the same dose
of aspirin. The second reason that drugs vary in their effectiveness has
to do with the affinity of a drug with its site of action. Most drugs of
interest to psychopharmacologists exert their effects by binding at
sites of action in the CNS--- such as presynaptic or postsynaptic
receptors, transporter molecules, or by interacting with enzymes
involved in the production or deactivation of neurotransmitters. Drugs
vary widely in their affinity---the readiness with which two molecules
join together---for the sites to which they attach. A drug with a high
affinity will produce effects at a relatively low concentration, but a
drug with a low affinity must be administered in higher doses to produce
the same effect. Even two drugs with identical sites of action can vary
in their effectiveness if they have different affinities for their
binding sites. Also, because most drugs have

M04_CARL0287_13_GE_C04.indd 96

Figure 4.4 A Dose-Response Curve Increasingly larger doses of the drug
produce increasingly larger effects until the maximum effect is reached.
After that point, increasing increments in the dose do not produce any
increments in the drug's effect. However, the risk of adverse side
effects increases. high After this point, increasing the dose does not
produce a stronger effect

Effect of drug

Drugs do not remain in the body forever. Many are metabolized and
deactivated by enzymes, and all are eventually excreted, primarily by
the kidneys. The liver plays an especially active role in enzymatic
deactivation of drugs, but some deactivating enzymes are also found in
the blood. The brain also contains enzymes that destroy some drugs. In
some cases, enzymes transform molecules of a drug into other forms that
themselves are biologically active. Occasionally, the transformed
molecule is even more active than the one that is administered. In such
cases, the effects of a drug can have a very long duration. For example,
fluoxetine (Prozac) is used to treat symptoms of depression. The effects
of this drug can last a long time, in part, because some of the
metabolized molecules are active in the body for even longer than the
original drug molecule (Altamura et al., 1994; Jannuzzi et al., 2002).

METABOLISM AND EXCRETION

multiple effects, a drug can have high affinities for some of its sites
of action and low affinities for others. The most useful drugs often
have a high affinity for sites of action that produce therapeutic
effects and a low affinity for sites of action that produce toxic side
effects. One of the goals of research by drug companies is to find or
create chemicals with just this pattern of effects. The best way to
measure the effectiveness of a drug is to plot a dose-response curve. To
do this, individuals are given various doses of a drug, usually defined
as milligrams of drug per kilogram of an individual's body weight, and
the effects of the drug are plotted. Because the molecules of most drugs
distribute themselves throughout the blood and then throughout the rest
of the body, a larger individual will require a larger quantity of a
drug to achieve the same concentration as a smaller quantity will
produce in a smaller individual. Increasingly higher doses of a drug
will produce increasingly greater effects until the point of maximum
effect is reached. At this point, increasing the dose of the drug does
not produce any more effect. (See Figure 4.4.) Most drugs have more than
one effect. Opiates such as morphine, codeine, or oxycodone produce
analgesia (reduced sensitivity to pain), but they also depress the
activity of neurons in the medulla that control heart rate and
respiration. A physician who prescribes an opiate to relieve a patient's
pain wants to administer a dose that is large enough to produce
analgesia but not large enough to depress heart rate and
respiration---effects that could be fatal. Figure 4.5 shows two
dose-response curves, one for the analgesic effects of morphine and one
for the drug's depressant effects on respiration. The difference between
these curves indicates the drug's margin of safety. The most desirable
drugs have a large margin of safety.

and that for its adverse side effects. Dose-response curve for the

One measure of a drug's margin of safety is its therapeutic index. This
measure is obtained by administering varying doses of the drug to a
group of laboratory animals or human volunteers. Two numbers are
obtained: the dose that produces the desired effects in 50 percent of
the individuals and the dose that produces toxic effects in 50 percent
of the individuals. The therapeutic index is the ratio of these two
numbers. For example, if the toxic dose is five times higher than the
effective dose, then the therapeutic index is 5.0. The lower the
therapeutic index, the more careful a physician must be in prescribing
the drug. For example, barbiturates are older drugs that were previously
used to treat anxiety but had relatively low therapeutic indexes---as
low as 2 or 3. In contrast, newer antianxiety drugs such as Valium are
considered safer and have therapeutic indexes of well over 100. As a
consequence, an overdose of a barbiturate is much more likely to have
tragic effects than a similar overdose of Valium.

Effects of Repeated Administration LO 4.4

Differentiate between tolerance, sensitization, and withdrawal effects
following repeated use of a drug.

Often, when a drug is administered repeatedly, its effects change. In
most cases, its effects will diminish---a phenomenon known as tolerance.
In other cases, a drug becomes more and more effective the more it is
administered---a phenomenon known as sensitization. Let's consider
tolerance first. Tolerance is seen in many drugs that are commonly
abused. For example, a regular user of heroin must take larger and
larger amounts of the

M04_CARL0287_13_GE_C04.indd 97

drug for it to be effective. And once a person has taken heroin
regularly enough to develop tolerance, that individual will likely
experience withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly stop taking the drug.
Withdrawal symptoms are primarily the opposite of the effects of the
drug itself. For example, heroin produces euphoria; withdrawal from it
produces dysphoria---a feeling of anxious misery. Heroin also produces
relaxation; withdrawal from it produces agitation. Christopher's case at
the beginning of the chapter highlighted one withdrawal effect of a
benzodiazpine. Withdrawal symptoms are caused by the same mechanisms
that are responsible for tolerance. Tolerance is the result of the
body's attempt to compensate for the effects of the drug. Most body
systems, including those controlled by the brain, are regulated so that
they stay at or near an optimal value (see Chapter 12). When the effects
of a drug alter these systems for a prolonged time, compensatory
mechanisms begin to produce the opposite reaction, at least partially
compensating for the disturbance from the optimal value. More and more
of the drug must be taken to achieve a given level of effects. Then,
when the person stops taking the drug, the compensatory mechanisms make
themselves felt as withdrawal symptoms, unopposed by the action of the
drug. When a person has repeatedly used a drug enough to produce
withdrawal symptoms when they stop using it, they have physical
dependence on the drug. Physical dependence is one aspect that
contributes to compulsive drug taking and substance abuse (see Chapter
19). Research suggests that there are several types of compensatory
mechanisms that accompany repeated use of a drug. As we will see, many
drugs that affect the brain do so by binding with receptors and
activating them. The first compensatory mechanism involves a decrease in
the effectiveness of such binding. Either the receptors become less
sensitive to the drug and their affinity for the drug decreases, or the
receptors decrease in number. This decrease in receptor availability is
also called receptor downregulation. The second compensatory mechanism
involves the process that couples the receptors to ion channels in the
membrane or the production of second messengers. After prolonged
stimulation of the receptors, one or more steps in the coupling process
can become less effective. (It is also possible for both effects to
occur.) The details of these compensatory mechanisms are described in
Chapter 19, which discusses substance abuse. Many drugs have several
different sites of action and can produce several different effects.
This means that some of the effects of a drug may show tolerance but
others may not. For example, barbiturates cause sedation and also
depress neurons that control respiration. The sedative effects show
tolerance, but respiratory depression does not. If larger and larger
doses of a barbiturate are taken to achieve

Answer: tolerance

the same level of sedation, the person begins to run the risk of taking
a dangerously large dose of the drug that may cause respiratory failure.
Sensitization is the opposite of tolerance. In sensitization, repeated
doses of a drug produce greater and greater effects. Sensitization may
develop for some of the effects of a drug while tolerance develops for
others. For example, repeated injections of cocaine become more and more
likely to produce movement disorders and seizures, whereas the euphoric
effects of the drug do not show sensitization---and may even show
tolerance. Figure 4.6 provides examples of the effects of repeated drug
administration.

Placebo Effects LO 4.5

Describe a placebo and the placebo effect.

A placebo is an inactive substance. Placebos contain no active drug
molecules, but it is incorrect to say that they have no effect. If a
person expects that a placebo can have a physiological or psychological
effect, then administering a placebo may produce that effect. Placebo
responses can be the result of changes in motivation, expectation, or
forms of learning such as classical conditioning (Price et al., 2008).
Many factors can be related to the experience of a placebo effect.
External factors, such as viewing an injection of a placebo, can result
in postoperative pain relief (Price et al., 2008). Informing individuals
that a placebo is a stimulant results in increased heart rate and blood
pressure. Informing people that the same placebo is a depressant results
in a decreased physiological response (Blackwell et al., 1972; Kirsch,
1997). Taking two placebo capsules results in a greater response than
taking one, and changing the color of capsules can also produce changes
in response to the same placebo capsule (Blackwell et al., 1972).

Your roommate began the semester drinking one cup of coffee in the
morning. Now you see that your roommate needs three cups to achieve the
same level of alertness. Which effect of repeated administration has
occurred?

Research has demonstrated that some placebo pain effects may operate via
the opioid system (an endogenous pain-relieving system in the CNS). For
example, administering a pain-relieving placebo increases activity in
the opioid system, and administering an opioid-blocking drug blocks the
pain-relieving effects of a placebo (Price et al., 2008). When
experimenters want to investigate the behavioral effects of drugs in
humans, they must use control groups whose members receive placebos, or
they cannot be sure that the behavioral effects they observed were
caused by specific effects of the drug. Studies with laboratory animals
must also use placebos, even though researchers don't need to worry
about the animals' "beliefs" about the effects of the drugs we give
them. Consider the steps involved in administering a drug to an animal.
If you have ever needed to give medications to a sick cat, dog, or other
animal, you may be familiar with the unique challenges this involves.
The animal is typically distressed, so even if the substance you
administer to an animal is a placebo, the experience of receiving the
drug could activate the animal's autonomic nervous system, causing the
secretion of stress hormones or other physiological effects. If we want
to know what the behavioral effects of a drug are, we must compare the
behavior of drug-treated individuals (people or animals) with other
individuals who receive a placebo, administered in the same way as the
drug. Only then can a researcher determine whether a drug has
significant behavioral effects, above and beyond the effects of
administering and receiving an inactive substance. Drug researchers
typically report the effects of a drug relative to a similar group that
received a placebo. Placebo control data is so important in determining
drug effects that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration typically
requires multiple studies with placebo control groups before approving
new drugs for sale in the United States.

Module Review: Principles of Psychopharmacology An Overview of
Psychopharmacology LO 4.1 Differentiate between the terms drug, drug
effect, and site of action. A drug is an exogenous chemical not
necessary for normal cellular functioning that significantly alters the
functions of certain cells of the body when taken in relatively low
doses. Drug effects are the changes we can observe in an individual's
physiological processes and behavior. The sites of action of drugs are
the points at which molecules of drugs interact with molecules located
on or in cells of the body, to affect some biochemical processes of
these cells.

Pharmacokinetics

can be measured on a dose-response curve by plotting effects of the drug
on the vertical axis and dose of the drug on the horizontal axis.

Effects of Repeated Administration LO 4.4 Differentiate between
tolerance, sensitization, and withdrawal effects following repeated use
of a drug. With repeated use, drugs can produce tolerance (diminishing
effects of a given dose), sensitization (increasing effects of a given
dose), and withdrawal effects (the opposite effects of the drug itself;
indicative of physical dependence).

LO 4.2 Describe the steps of pharmacokinetics.

Placebo Effects

First, a drug molecule is absorbed. Varying the route of administration
changes how quickly a drug is absorbed. Faster absorption produces a
larger drug effect, with a faster onset. Then, a drug molecule is
distributed. Distribution in the body is affected by several factors,
such as lipid solubility. Next, the drug is metabolized. Metabolism is
affected by the availability of enzymes. Finally, the drug is excreted.
Excretion can be affected by kidney function.

LO 4.5 Describe a placebo and the placebo effect.

Drug Effectiveness

Recently, the head of Amsterdam's health services declared that sugar
was a drug and urged people to stop using it excessively. Based on a
widely accepted definition of "drug" and your emerging understanding of
the principles of pharmacology, draft an email to a friend ­explaining
whether sugar should be considered a drug.

LO 4.3 Identify why drugs vary in effectiveness and how these
differences can be measured. Two reasons that drugs vary in their
effectiveness are that different drugs have different sites of action
and vary in their affinity for their binding sites. Drug effectiveness

Sites of Drug Action Throughout the history of our species, people have
discovered that plants---and some animals and fungi---produce chemicals
that act on the nervous system. Some of these chemicals have been used
for their pleasurable effects; others have been used to treat illness,
reduce pain, or poison other animals (or enemies). More recently,
scientists have learned to produce completely artificial drugs, known as
synthetic drugs, some with potencies far greater than those of naturally
occurring drugs. In addition to their traditional uses, drugs today are
used in research to investigate the operations of the nervous system.
Most drugs that affect behavior do so by affecting synaptic
transmission. Drugs that affect synaptic

transmission are classified into two general categories. Those that
block or inhibit the postsynaptic effects are called antagonists. Those
that facilitate them are called agonists. This module describes the
basic effects of drugs on synaptic activity. As you read in Chapter 2,
the order of events in synaptic activity goes like this:
Neurotransmitters are synthesized and stored in synaptic vesicles. The
synaptic vesicles travel to the presynaptic membrane, where they become
docked. When an axon fires, voltage-dependent calcium channels in the
presynaptic membrane open, permitting the entry of calcium ions. The
calcium ions interact with the docking proteins and initiate the release
of the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Molecules of the
neurotransmitter bind with postsynaptic receptors, causing

changes in intracellular processes or causing particular ion channels to
open, which produces excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.
The effects of the neurotransmitter are kept relatively brief due to
reuptake by transporter molecules in the presynaptic membrane or by
deactivation by enzymes. Also, stimulating presynaptic autoreceptors on
the terminal buttons regulates the synthesis and release of the
neurotransmitter. The discussion of the effects of drugs in this module
follows the same basic sequence. The effects we will describe are
summarized in Figure 4.7 with additional details shown in subsequent
figures.

AChE

Effects on Production of Neurotransmitters LO 4.6

Summarize how drugs can affect neurotransmitter synthesis.

Before they are released into the synapse, neurotransmitters are
produced (or synthesized) by presynaptic neurons. Some psychoactive
drugs produce their effects by altering the production of
neurotransmitters. For example, most neurotransmitters are produced from

24/11/21 12:59 PM

Psychopharmacology and Neurotransmitters 101

molecules called precursors. Some drugs produce their effects by acting
as precursors to increase the amount of neurotransmitter a cell can
synthesize and release into the synapse (see step 1 in Figure 4.7).
Precursor drugs are considered agonists because administering them
increases the activity of the neurotransmitter system. For example,
symptoms of Parkinson's disease are due to the death of
dopamine-releasing cells in the substantia nigra. One treatment for this
disease involves administering l-DOPA. l-DOPA is a precursor for
dopamine. The remaining cells use the l-DOPA to synthesize additional
dopamine, helping replace some of the lost neurotransmission and
reducing symptoms of the disease. Look for more information on this
treatment strategy in Chapter 16. It's also important to remember that
neurotransmitter synthesis is controlled by enzymes. This means that if
a drug deactivates one of these enzymes, it will prevent the
neurotransmitter from being produced. Such a drug serves as an
antagonist (see step 2 in Figure 4.7). For example,
p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) inhibits an enzyme necessary for the
synthesis of serotonin (Dringenberg et al., 1995). PCPA is typically
used as a research drug in studies to better understand the functions of
the serotonin system.

Effects on Storage and Release of Neurotransmitters LO 4.7

Explain the effects of drugs on neurotransmitter storage and release.

After production or recycling, neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic
vesicles until they are transported to the presynaptic membrane and
released following an action potential. Vesicles are filled with
neurotransmitters by vesicle transporter molecules located in the
membrane of synaptic vesicles. Vesicle transporters pump molecules of
the neurotransmitter across the vesicle membrane, filling the vesicles.
It's important to notice that the vesicle transporters are different
from the transporters found on the terminal membrane. Although they both
move neurotransmitter molecules, the terminal membrane transporters move
the molecules from the synapse into the cytoplasm of the presynaptic
cell. The vesicle transporters then move the molecules into the
vesicles. Some drugs can block vesicle transporters by binding with a
particular site on the transporter and inactivating it. These drugs act
as antagonists (see step 3 in Figure 4.7). Because the synaptic vesicles
remain empty, nothing is released when the vesicles eventually release
their contents into the synapse. Reserpine is an example of a drug that
blocks vesicle transporters for monoamine neurotransmitter systems. Due
to adverse side effects, this drug is

M04_CARL0287_13_GE_C04.indd 101

typically only used in research; however, it is sometimes used to reduce
blood pressure. You will read more about reserpine later in this
chapter. Some drugs act as antagonists by preventing the release of
neurotransmitters from the terminal button. They do so by deactivating
the proteins that cause docked synaptic vesicles to fuse with the
presynaptic membrane and expel their contents into the synaptic cleft
(see step 5 in Figure 4.7). An example of a drug with this action is
botulinum toxin (Botox). Botox prevents the release of acetylcholine,
the neurotransmitter responsible for signaling muscle contractions in
the PNS. Other drugs have the opposite effect: They act as agonists by
binding with these proteins and directly triggering the release of the
neurotransmitter (see step 4 in Figure 4.7).

Effects on Receptors LO 4.8

Summarize the effects of drugs at the receptor.

The effects of drug molecules binding with receptors can be very
complex. The effects depend on where the receptor is located, what its
normal effects are, and whether the drug activates the receptor or
blocks its actions. The most important---and most complex---sites of
action of drugs in the nervous system are at presynaptic and
postsynaptic receptors. Let's consider postsynaptic receptors first.
(Here is where the careful reading should begin.) Once a
neurotransmitter is released, it must stimulate the postsynaptic
receptors. Some drugs bind with these receptors, just as the
neurotransmitter does. Once a drug has bound with the receptor, it can
serve as either an agonist or an antagonist (see steps 6 and 7 in Figure
4.7). A drug that mimics the effects of a neurotransmitter acts as a
direct agonist. Molecules of the drug attach to the binding site where
the neurotransmitter normally attaches. This binding causes the receptor
to respond in the same way as when the neurotransmitter is present. For
example, nicotine binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,
mimicking the effects of the acetylcholine and contributing to the
stimulant effects of the drug. Drugs that bind with postsynaptic
receptors can also serve as antagonists. Some drugs bind with the
receptors but block them from being activated. Because they occupy the
receptor's binding site, they prevent the neurotransmitter from
activating the receptor. These drugs are called receptor blockers or
direct antagonists. These types of drugs can have therapeutic effects,
such as the dopamine antagonist chlorpromazine, which reduces some of
the symptoms of schizophrenia. Some postsynaptic receptors have multiple
binding sites, where different molecules can attach. Molecules of the
neurotransmitter bind with one site, and other substances

(such as neuromodulators and various drugs) bind with the others. When a
molecule binds with one of these alternative sites, it is noncompetitive
binding, because the molecule does not compete with molecules of
neurotransmitter for the same binding site. If a drug attaches to one of
these alternative sites and prevents the ion channel from opening, the
drug is said to be an indirect antagonist. (See Figure 4.8.) Two
examples of drugs that work in this way are PCP and ketamine. These
drugs bind to noncompetitive sites as antagonists of the NMDA glutamate
receptor. The ultimate effect of an indirect antagonist is similar to
that of a direct antagonist, but its site of action is different. If a
drug attaches to one of the alternative sites and facilitates the
opening of the ion channel, it is said to be an indirect agonist.
Diazepam (Valium) is used to treat the symptoms of anxiety. Diazepam is
an indirect agonist and requires concurrent binding of GABA to produce
antianxiety effects. As we saw in Chapter 2, the presynaptic membranes
of some neurons contain autoreceptors that function to modify the
activity of the presynaptic cell. Agonist molecules at these receptors
generally result in reduced synaptic communication, and drugs that
selectively activate presynaptic receptors act as antagonists. Drugs
that block presynaptic autoreceptors have the opposite effect: They
increase synaptic communication, acting as agonists (see steps 8 and 9
in Figure 4.7).

Indirect antagonist (b)

Effects on Reuptake and Deactivation of Neurotransmitters LO 4.9

Describe the effects of drugs on neurotransmitter reuptake and
deactivation.

Shortly after being released from a presynaptic cell, the
neurotransmitter is removed from the synapse, clearing the way for a new
chemical message to follow. As you read in Chapter 2, two processes
accomplish the task of removing the neurotransmitter from the synapse:
Molecules of the neurotransmitter are taken back into the terminal
button of the presynaptic cell through the process of reuptake via
terminal transporters, or they are deactivated by an enzyme. Remember,
terminal membrane transporters are different from the vesicle
transporters. Drugs can alter the action at either of these
transporters. Some drug molecules, such as cocaine, attach to the
terminal membrane transporter molecules and inactivate them to block
reuptake. Other drug molecules can bind with enzymes that typically
deactivate the neurotransmitter and prevent the enzymes from working.
Both types of drugs prolong the presence of molecules of the
neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft where they are available to
stimulate postsynaptic receptors. Drugs that block reuptake or enzymatic
deactivation of neurotransmitters are agonists (see steps 10 and 11 in
Figure 4.7).

Module Review: Sites of Drug Action Effects on Production of
Neurotransmitters LO 4.6 Summarize how drugs can affect neurotransmitter
synthesis. Some agonist drugs produce their effects by acting as
precursors to increase the amount of neurotransmitter a cell can
synthesize and release into the synapse. Other drugs are antagonists
that inactivate neurotransmittersynthesizing enzymes to prevent
neurotransmitters from being produced.

M04_CARL0287_13_GE_C04.indd 102

Effects on Storage and Release of Neurotransmitters LO 4.7 Explain the
effects of drugs on neurotransmitter storage and release. Agonists can
directly stimulate the release of neurotransmitters from a vesicle.
Antagonists can block vesicle transporters or deactivate the cellular
machinery responsible for vesicle docking and release. This drug effect
serves to reduce the amount of neurotransmitters available in the
synapse.

Psychopharmacology and Neurotransmitters 103

Effects on Receptors LO 4.8 Summarize the effects of drugs at the
receptor. Agonists activate the receptor by binding directly to the
neurotransmitter site (direct agonist) or another site on the receptor
(indirect agonist). Antagonists block the receptor by binding either
directly or indirectly to sites on a receptor. Drugs can have effects at
postsynaptic and/or presynaptic receptors.

Thought Question Some grocery and health food stores sell the supplement
5-HTP, which is a precursor for the neurotransmitter serotonin. Draft an
email to a curious store manager and explain how a precursor supplement
such as 5-HTP can function as a drug. While it is unclear how much of
the supplement crosses the blood--brain barrier, explain to the manager
how the precursor is intended to work to change neurotransmitter
activity.

Effects on Reuptake and Deactivation of Neurotransmitters LO 4.9
Describe the effects of drugs on neurotransmitter reuptake and
deactivation. Agonists block neurotransmitter reuptake or deactivation
to retain more of the neurotransmitter in the synapse available to bind
to receptors. Drugs can serve as antagonists for the enzymes that
deactivate neurotransmitters, increasing synaptic transmission.

Neurotransmitters and Neuromodulators There are many different kinds of
neurotransmitters---several dozen at least (see Table 4.1 for a
selection of neurotransmitters and their nervous system functions). In
the brain, most synaptic communication is accomplished by two amino acid
neurotransmitters: one with excitatory effects (glutamate) and one with
inhibitory effects (­gamma-aminobutyric acid, or GABA). A secondary
inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter, glycine, is found in the spinal
cord and lower brain stem. Most of the activity of local circuits of
neurons involves balances between the excitatory and inhibitory effects
of these chemicals, which are responsible for most of the information
transmitted from place to place within the brain. All (or nearly all)
neurons in the brain receive excitatory input from glutamate-­secreting
terminal buttons and inhibitory input from neurons that secrete either
GABA or glycine. Except for neurons that detect painful stimuli, which
secrete a different peptide, all sensory organs transmit information to
the brain through axons whose terminals release glutamate. While GABA
and glutamate are released by cells located throughout the brain, most
other neurotransmitter systems include cells organized into specific
pathways with cell bodies originating in one (or more) brain regions
projecting to one (or more) other brain regions. Look for this pattern
of pathways among the neurotransmitters presented throughout this
chapter.

M04_CARL0287_13_GE_C04.indd 103

What do all the other neurotransmitters do? In general, they have
modulating effects rather than informationtransmitting effects. That is,
the release of neurotransmitters other than glutamate, GABA, and glycine
tends to activate or inhibit entire circuits of neurons that are
involved in particular brain functions related to behavior and mental
processes. Because particular drugs can selectively affect neurons that
secrete particular neurotransmitters, they can have specific effects on
behavior. This module introduces some of the most important
neurotransmitters and discusses some of their behavioral functions.
Within each neurotransmitter system, look for information about
neurotransmitter production, storage, release, receptor binding,
reuptake, and enzymatic deactivation aligning with the key steps in
Figure 4.7.

Amino Acids LO 4.10 Compare the features of the amino acid
neurotransmitter systems. Some neurons secrete simple amino acids as
neurotransmitters. Because amino acids are used for protein synthesis by
all cells of the brain, it is a challenge to prove that particular amino
acids are neurotransmitters. However, investigators suspect that at
least eight amino acids may serve as neurotransmitters in the mammalian
CNS. Two specific amino acids are especially important because they are
the most common neurotransmitters in the CNS: glutamate and GABA.

GLUTAMATE Production, Storage, and Release

As you just read, glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in
the brain and spinal cord. Glutamate is synthesized from a precursor
(glutamine) by an enzyme (glutaminase) in one step. After being
synthesized, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Vesicle glutamate
transporters package glutamate into vesicles. Glutamate is released from
the presynaptic neuron following an action potential. Receptors There
are four major types of glutamate receptors. Three of these receptors
are ionotropic: the NMDA receptor, the AMPA receptor, and the kainate
receptor. The other glutamate receptor---the metabotropic glutamate
receptor---is metabotropic. Among other functions, some metabotropic
glutamate receptors serve as presynaptic autoreceptors. AMPA and NMDA
receptors play important roles in the cellular basis of learning and
memory (more on this in Chapter 12). Most drugs that affect glutamate
transmission interact with the glutamate receptors. Chemicals called
NMDA, AMPA, and kainate are the direct agonists at the receptors named
after them. A commonly used drug---­alcohol---is an antagonist of NMDA
receptors. As we will see in Chapter 19, this effect is responsible for
the seizures that can be p ­ rovoked by sudden alcohol withdrawal. The
AMPA receptor is the most common glutamate receptor. It controls a
sodium channel, so when glutamate attaches to the binding site, it
produces EPSPs. The kainate receptor has similar effects. The NMDA
receptor has some special---and very important---characteristics. It
contains at least six different binding sites: four located on the
exterior of the receptor and two located deep within the ion channel.
When it is open, the ion channel controlled by the NMDA receptor permits
both sodium and calcium ions to enter the cell. The influx of both of
these ions causes

M04_CARL0287_13_GE_C04.indd 104

a depolarization, but the entry of calcium (Ca2+) is especially
important. Calcium serves as a second messenger, binding with---and
activating---various enzymes within the cell. These enzymes have
profound effects on the biochemical and structural properties of the
cell. One important result of this second messenger system is an
alteration in the characteristics of the synapse that provide one of the
building blocks of a newly formed memory. These effects of NMDA
receptors will be discussed in much more detail in Chapter 13, where you
will read about their role in memory formation. Figure 4.9 presents an
NMDA receptor and its binding sites. Glutamate binds with one of these
sites; however, glutamate by itself cannot open the calcium channel. For
that to happen, a molecule of glycine must attach to the glycine binding
site, located on the outside of the receptor. (We do not yet understand
why glycine---which also

serves as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in some parts of the CNS---is
required for this ion channel to open.) The drug AP5
(2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate) blocks the glutamate binding site on the
NMDA receptor and impairs synaptic plasticity and certain forms of
learning. An additional requirement for opening the calcium channel is
that a magnesium ion not be attached to the magnesium binding site,
located deep within the channel. When the postsynaptic membrane is at
the resting potential, a magnesium ion (Mg2+) is attracted to the
magnesium binding site and blocks the calcium channel. If a molecule of
glutamate attaches to its binding site, the channel widens, but the
magnesium ion still blocks it, so no calcium can enter the postsynaptic
neuron. However, if the postsynaptic membrane is partially depolarized,
the magnesium ion is repelled from its binding site. This means that the
NMDA receptor opens only if glutamate is present and the postsynaptic
membrane is depolarized. The NMDA receptor, then, is a voltage- and
neurotransmitter-dependent ion channel. The PCP site, located deep
within the ion channel near the magnesium binding site, binds with a
hallucinogenic drug, PCP (phencyclidine). PCP serves as an indirect
antagonist; when it attaches to its binding site, calcium ions cannot
pass through the ion channel. Another drug has similar effects and is
thought to bind to this site too: ketamine. Ketamine and PCP were
originally developed as anesthetics; however, their hallucinatory
effects made them largely unacceptable for human use. In addition to its
recreational use, ketamine is still used as an anesthetic for veterinary
practice, and recent clinical trials have suggested a new use as a
therapeutic drug in treatmentresistant­ depression. Reuptake and
Deactivation Glutamate is removed from the synapse by excitatory amino
acid transporters and broken down into its building block precursor
(glutamine) by the enzyme glutamine synthase. A failure to remove
glutamate from the synapse can have negative consequences. Too much
glutamate stimulation in the synapse can produce glutamate
excitotoxicity and damage neurons by prolonged overexcitation. As you
will read in Chapter 16, glutamate excitotoxicity is believed to be
involved in damage to the brain in stroke and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig's disease). Although drugs that enhance
reuptake or deactivation of excess glutamate remain to be developed,
riluzole (Rilutek) is used in ALS treatment and likely reduces glutamate
signaling by reducing glutamate vesicle docking with the presynaptic
terminal membrane. If you were a researcher trying to develop a drug to
prevent or reduce glutamate excitotoxicity, what would you look for in a
new drug? How could you target reuptake and deactivation of the
neurotransmitter to reduce neuronal damage due to glutamate
overexcitation? What side effects could this drug produce by reducing
glutamate signaling?

brain and spinal cord. GABA is produced from a precursor (glutamic acid)
by the action of an enzyme (glutamic acid decarboxylase, or GAD). GABA
is packaged into vesicles by the vesicle GABA transporter, where it is
stored until being released following an action potential. Neurons in
the brain are highly interconnected. Without the activity of inhibitory
synapses, these interconnections would become unstable. Through
excitatory synapses, neurons would excite neighboring neurons, which
would then excite their neighboring neurons, and so on, until most of
the neurons in the brain would be firing uncontrollably. This event does
sometimes occur, and the result is a seizure, like the one Christopher
experienced in the vignette at the beginning of this chapter. Usually,
an inhibitory influence is supplied for these interconnections by
GABA-secreting neurons, which are present in large numbers in the brain.
Some investigators believe that one of the causes of seizure disorders
is an abnormality in the biochemistry of GABA-secreting neurons or GABA
receptors. Receptors Several GABA receptors have been identified;
however, we will focus on the GABAA receptor because of its importance
in behavior. GABAA receptors are ionotropic and control chloride
channels. (See Figure 4.10.) Like NMDA receptors, GABAA receptors are
complex, and they contain at least five different binding sites. The
primary binding site is for GABA. The drug muscimol serves as a direct
agonist for this site. Another drug, bicuculline, blocks this GABA
binding site, serving as a direct antagonist. A second site on the GABAA
receptor binds with a

106 Chapter 4 class of drugs called the benzodiazepines. These drugs
include diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax), which you read about
in the introduction to this chapter. The benzodiazepines are
anxiolytics, or "anxiety-dissolving" drugs, and are used to reduce
symptoms of anxiety, reduce seizure activity, and produce muscle
relaxation. Drugs that are chemically similar to the benzodiazepines
include zolpidem (Ambien) and eszopiclone (Lunesta), which are sleep
medications that also bind to this site. Another drug that binds to this
site, picrotoxin, produces effects opposite of benzodiazepines: It
inhibits the activity of the GABAA receptor and is an indirect
antagonist. In high enough doses, picrotoxin causes seizures. The third
GABAA site binds with barbiturates, an older class of sedative and
antianxiety drugs. Barbiturates were also presented earlier in this
chapter, where they were used as an example of a drug with a narrow
therapeutic index. Finally, various steroid hormones are normally
produced in the body, and some hormones related to progesterone (the
principal pregnancy hormone) act on the steroid-binding site of the
GABAA receptor, producing a relaxing, anxiolytic sedative effect. Also,
alcohol binds with an as-yet-unknown site on the GABAA receptor. Another
site binds with various steroids, including some steroids used to
produce general anesthesia. The GABAA receptor includes several other
binding sites; however, they are beyond the scope of discussion here.
Much remains to be learned about the GABA system. It is important to
keep in mind that the brain does not produce Valium, barbiturates, or
picrotoxin. The natural, or endogenous, ligands for these binding sites
have not yet been discovered. Reuptake and Deactivation GABA is removed
from the synapse by GABA transporters. Tiagabine (Gabitril) is a GABA
transporter antagonist used to increase availabil-

ity of GABA and reduce the likelihood of seizures. GABA is deactivated
by the enzyme GABA aminotransferase. Vigabatrin (Sabril) blocks the
activity of GABA aminotransferase to increase the amount of GABA
available in the synapse. Vigabatrin is also used as a treatment for
seizures and epilepsy. For a summary of some important drugs that act on
the glutamate and GABA systems, see Table 4.2.

Acetylcholine (ACh) LO 4.11 Summarize the features of the acetylcholine
system. The next several examples of neurotransmitter systems are
organized slightly differently from the amino acid neurotransmitter
systems of the brain. For example, while neurons that release amino acid
neurotransmitters are found throughout the brain, neurons in these
neurotransmitter systems are only found in distinct pathways. While
amino acid neurotransmitters are relatively simple molecules, the
upcoming systems feature more complex neurotransmitter production
processes. PATHWAYS ACh is a unique neurotransmitter because of its
functions in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. It is the
primary neurotransmitter secreted by axons of the PNS that terminate at
muscle cells to control muscle contraction. Because ACh is found outside
the CNS in locations that are easy to study, this neurotransmitter was
the first to be discovered. Unlike the neurons that release the amino
acid neurotransmitters and are located throughout the brain, most
acetylcholine-releasing neurons are found in specific locations and
pathways in the CNS. Three pathways have received the most attention
from neuroscientists: those originating in the dorsolateral pons, the
basal forebrain (or nucleus basalis), and the medial septum. (See Figure
4.11.)

The acetylcholinergic neurons located in the dorsolateral pons play a
role in REM sleep (the phase of sleep during which dreaming occurs).
Those located in the basal forebrain are involved in activating the
cerebral cortex and facilitating learning, especially perceptual
learning. Those located in the medial septum control the electrical
rhythms of the hippocampus and modulate its functions, which include the
formation of particular kinds of memories. PRODUCTION, STORAGE, AND
RELEASE Acetylcholine is composed of two precursors: choline and acetyl
coenzyme A. The enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) is required to
produce ACh from the precursors. (See Figure 4.12.) To date, there has
not been significant

development of drugs that can interact with ChAT to increase or decrease
ACh production. Why do you think a researcher might want to develop a
ChAT antagonist (or agonist)? ACh is loaded into vesicles by the vesicle
ACh transporter, where it is stored until being released from the
presynaptic cell. Two drugs, botulinum toxin and the venom of the black
widow spider, affect the release of ACh. Botulinum toxin (Botox) is
produced by Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that can grow in
improperly canned food. This drug prevents the release of ACh. Botulinum
toxin is an extremely potent poison because the paralysis it can cause
leads to suffocation. When used locally as an injection into a muscle
(rather than being ingested and distributed to the entire body),
botulinum toxin can have highly desired effects. Botox treatments
involve injections of a very dilute solution of botulinum toxin into
facial muscles to stop muscular contractions that are causing wrinkles
in the skin. Although much of the interest in Botox is for cosmetic
reasons, Botox has also been used therapeutically to treat migraine
headaches and severe muscle contractions. Due to compensatory actions by
the presynaptic neuron, these injections are temporary, and the effects
eventually subside. In contrast, black widow spider venom has the
opposite effect: It stimulates the release of ACh. Although the effects
of black widow spider venom can also be fatal,

24/11/21 1:00 PM

108 Chapter 4 the venom is much less toxic than botulinum toxin. It
would take multiple bites to produce severe toxic effects in most
healthy adults, but infants or those with health complications would be
more susceptible. There are two types of ACh receptors. The ionotropic
ACh receptor is stimulated by nicotine, a drug found in tobacco leaves,
and is referred to as the nicotinic receptor. The metabotropic ACh
receptor is stimulated by muscarine, a drug found in the poison mushroom
Amanita muscaria, and referred to as the muscarinic receptor.
Consequently, these two ACh receptors are referred to as nicotinic
receptors and muscarinic receptors, respectively. Because muscle fibers
in the PNS must be able to contract quickly, they contain the
rapid-acting, ionotropic nicotinic receptors. Because muscarinic
receptors are metabotropic in nature and thus control ion channels
through the production of second messengers, their actions are slower
and more prolonged than those of nicotinic receptors. The CNS contains
both kinds of ACh receptors, but muscarinic receptors predominate. Some
nicotinic receptors are found at axoaxonic synapses in the brain, where
they produce presynaptic facilitation. Activation of these receptors is
partially responsible for the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Just as
two different drugs stimulate the two classes of ACh receptors, two
different drugs block them. The first drug, atropine, blocks muscarinic
receptors. One of the effects of atropine administration is to reduce
saliva production. This drug is sometimes used in surgery to reduce
saliva that could obstruct a patient's airway while they are
unconscious. Another drug, curare, blocks nicotinic receptors. Because
these receptors are the ones found on muscles, curare, like botulinum
toxin, causes paralysis. However, the effects of curare are much faster.

RECEPTORS

After being released by the terminal button, ACh is deactivated by the
enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is present in the postsynaptic
membrane. (See Figure 4.13.) AChE breaks down one molecule of ACh into
its two precursors. Drugs that deactivate AChE are used for several
purposes.

AChE inhibitors are used to treat symptoms of a hereditary disorder
called myasthenia gravis, described in the case of Katherine at the
beginning of Chapter 2. Myasthenia gravis is caused by a person's immune
system attacking ACh receptors located on skeletal muscles. The person
becomes weaker and weaker as the muscles become less responsive to the
neurotransmitter. If the person is given an AChE inhibitor such as
neostigmine, the person will regain some strength because the ACh that
is released has a more prolonged effect on the remaining receptors.
After being broken down into its constituent parts, only choline is
recycled by cholinergic cells. Presynaptic neurons in cholinergic
synapses possess choline transporters for the reuptake of this ACh
precursor. Hemicholinium-3 is a research drug that blocks the choline
transporter. The effect of this drug is to reduce the rate of ACh
production. For a summary of some important drugs that act on the ACh
system, see Table 4.3.

The Monoamines LO 4.12 Summarize the key features of the monoamine
systems. The monoamine neurotransmitters are produced by several systems
of neurons in the brain. Most of these systems consist of a relatively
small number of cell bodies located in the brain stem, whose axons
branch repeatedly and give rise to an enormous number of terminal
buttons distributed throughout many regions of the brain. Monoaminergic
neurons modulate the function of widespread regions of the brain,
increasing or decreasing the activities of particular brain functions.
Monoamines are considered "classical" neurotransmitters. Classical
neurotransmitters are a family of relatively small molecules that
includes the monoamines and ACh. Compared to the classical
neurotransmitters, peptide

neurotransmitters are larger molecules that undergo a different type of
synthesis. You will read more about the peptide neurotransmitters in the
next module. Dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, and
histamine are five chemicals that belong to the family of monoamines.
Because the molecular structures of these neurotransmitters are similar,
some drugs affect the activity of all of the systems to some degree. The
first three neurotransmitters---dopamine, norepinephrine, and­
epinephrine---belong to a subclass of monoamines called catecholamines.
The terms in Table 4.4 will be used throughout the rest of this book.
The first catecholamine in Table 4.4, dopamine (DA), produces both
excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, depending on the
postsynaptic receptor. Dopamine has been implicated in several important
functions, including movement, attention, learning, and the reinforcing
effects of drugs that people tend to abuse. It is discussed in Chapters
8, 9, 13, 16, and 19. DOPAMINE

Pathways The brain contains several systems of dopaminergic neurons
arranged in pathways, similar to the

organization you read about for ACh neurons. The three most important
dopamine pathways originate in midbrain structures: the substantia nigra
and ventral tegmental area. In the first pathway, the cell bodies of
neurons of the nigrostriatal system are located in the substantia nigra
and project their axons to the neostriatum: the caudate nucleus and the
putamen. The neostriatum is an important part of the basal ganglia,
which is involved in the control of movement. In the second pathway, the
cell bodies of neurons of the mesolimbic system are located in the
ventral tegmental area and project their axons to several parts of the
limbic system, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and
hippocampus. The nucleus accumbens plays an important role in the
reinforcing (rewarding) effects of certain categories of stimuli,
including those of drugs that people abuse. In the third pathway, the
cell bodies of neurons of the mesocortical system are also located in
the ventral tegmental area. Their axons project to the prefrontal
cortex. These neurons have an excitatory effect on the frontal cortex
and affect functions such forming short-term memories, planning, and
problem-solving. (See Figure 4.14 and Table 4.5.) Degeneration of
dopaminergic neurons that connect the substantia nigra with the caudate
nucleus causes Parkinson's disease, a movement disorder characterized by
tremors, rigidity of the limbs, poor balance, and difficulty in
initiating movements. The cell bodies of these neurons are located in a
region of the brain called the substantia nigra ("black substance").
This region is normally stained black with melanin, the substance that
gives color to the skin. This compound is produced by the breakdown of
dopamine. The brain damage that causes Parkinson's disease

was initially discovered by pathologists who observed that the
substantia nigra of a deceased person who had had this disorder was pale
rather than black. Production, Storage, and Release Catecholamine
synthesis is somewhat complicated, but each step is a simple one. The
precursor molecule is modified slightly, step by step, until it achieves
its final shape. Each step is controlled by a different enzyme, which
causes a small part of the molecule to be added or taken off. The
precursor for the two major catecholamine neurotransmitters (dopamine
and norepinephrine) is tyrosine, an essential amino acid that we must
obtain from our diet. Tyrosine is modified by the enzyme tyrosine
hydroxylase and becomes L-DOPA (L-3,4-­dihydroxyphenylalanine). L-DOPA is
then modified through the activity of the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase and
becomes dopamine. Finally, the enzyme dopamine β-­hydroxylase converts
dopamine to norepinephrine. Only neurons that release norepinephrine
contain dopamine β-hydroxylase; however, both dopamine- and
­norepinephrine-releasing neurons contain tyrosine hydroxylase. These
reactions are shown in Figure 4.15. The drug AMPT (or
α-methyl-p-tyrosine), inactivates tyrosine hydroxylase, the enzyme that
converts tyrosine to L-DOPA. Because this drug interferes with the
synthesis of dopamine (and of norepinephrine as well), it serves as a
catecholamine antagonist. The drug is not normally used medically, but
it has been used as a research tool in laboratory studies. People with
Parkinson's disease are often given the drug L-DOPA. Although dopamine
cannot cross the

blood--brain barrier, L-DOPA can. Once L-DOPA reaches the brain, it is
taken up by dopaminergic neurons and is converted to dopamine. The
increased synthesis of dopamine allows more dopamine to be released by
the surviving dopaminergic neurons in patients with Parkinson's disease.
As a consequence, the patients' symptoms are alleviated. The drug
reserpine prevents the storage of monoamines in synaptic vesicles by
blocking the vesicle ­ onoamine transporters. Because the synaptic
vesicles m remain empty, no neurotransmitter is released when an action
potential reaches the terminal button. Reserpine, then, is a monoamine
antagonist. Reserpine was previously used to treat high blood pressure
but produced depressive and sedative side effects. It has now been
replaced by drugs with fewer side effects. Receptors Several drugs
stimulate or block specific types of dopamine receptors. Five
metabotropic types of dopamine receptors have been identified and named
the D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5. receptors. D1 and D2 receptors are the most
common. Stimulating D1 and D5 receptors increases the production of the
second messenger cyclic AMP, whereas stimulating D2, D3, and D4
receptors decreases the production of cyclic AMP. Dopamine has been
implicated as one neurotransmitter involved in symptoms of
schizophrenia, a serious ­mental disorder whose symptoms include
hallucinations, delusions, and disruption of thought processes. Drugs
such as chlorpromazine, which block D2 receptors, alleviate some
symptoms, such as hallucinations. For this reason, investigators have
speculated that these symptoms of schizophrenia (the so-called positive
symptoms) are produced by the overactivity of dopaminergic neurons. More
recently discovered drugs---the atypical antipsychotics---have more
complicated actions, which are discussed in Chapter 17. Autoreceptors
are found in the dendrites, soma, and terminal buttons of dopaminergic
neurons. Activation of the autoreceptors in the dendritic and somatic
membrane decreases neural firing by producing hyperpolarizations. The
presynaptic autoreceptors located in the terminal buttons suppress the
activity of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase and thus decrease the
production of dopamine---and ultimately its release. Dopamine
autoreceptors resemble D2 receptors, but there seem to be some
differences.

Presynaptic autoreceptors have high affinity for apomorphine; even at
low doses many are activated. This produces an antagonist effect.

Inhibition of dopamine production

At high doses, apomorphine binds with postsynaptic receptors. This

Inhibition of dopamine production High dose of apomorphine

Low dose of apomorphine

Apomorphine

Postsynaptic membrane

For example, the drug apomorphine is a D2 agonist, but it seems to have
a greater affinity for presynaptic D2 receptors than for postsynaptic D2
receptors. A low dose of apomorphine acts as an antagonist because it
stimulates the presynaptic receptors and inhibits the production and
release of dopamine. Higher doses begin to stimulate postsynaptic D2
receptors, and the drug begins to act as a direct agonist. (See Figure
4.16.) Reuptake and Deactivation Dopamine transporters are responsible
for removing dopamine from the synapse. Several drugs inhibit the
reuptake of dopamine and serve as potent dopamine agonists. The best
known of these drugs are amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, and
methylphenidate (Ritalin). Amphetamine and methamphetamine have an
interesting effect: They cause the release of dopamine and
norepinephrine by making the transporters for these neurotransmitters to
run in reverse, propelling dopamine and norepinephrine into the synaptic
cleft. This action also blocks the reuptake of these neurotransmitters.
Cocaine and methylphenidate simply block dopamine ­reuptake. Because
cocaine also blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels, it is sometimes
used as a topical a­ nesthetic in the form of eye drops for eye surgery.
Methylphenidate is used to enhance attention and impulse control
associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Catecholamine deactivation is regulated by an enzyme called monoamine
oxidase (MAO). This enzyme is found within monoaminergic terminal
buttons, where it deactivates excess neurotransmitters. A drug called
deprenyl inhibits the particular form of monoamine oxidase (MAO-B)

M04_CARL0287_13_GE_C04.indd 111

Increased DA activation of postsynaptic cell

that is found in dopaminergic terminal buttons. Because deprenyl
prevents the deactivation of dopamine, more dopamine is available in the
terminal buttons. Deprenyl serves as a dopamine agonist and can be used
to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. (See Figure 4.17.)
NOREPINEPHRINE Pathways Like ACh, norepinephrine (NE) is found in

both the CNS and PNS. As you begin to read, please note that the terms
adrenaline and epinephrine are synonymous, as are noradrenaline and
norepinephrine. Almost every region of the brain receives input from
noradrenergic neurons. The cell bodies of most of these neurons are
located in seven regions of the pons and medulla and one region of the
thalamus. The cell bodies of the most important noradrenergic system
begin in the locus coeruleus, a nucleus located in the dorsal pons. The
axons of these neurons project to the regions shown in Figure 4.18. As
we will see later, the primary effect of activation of these neurons is
an increase in vigilance---­attentiveness to events in the environment.
Neurotransmitter Production, Storage, and Release As you already saw in
the synthesis pathway for catecholamines in Figure 4.14, norepinephrine
is synthesized from dopamine by the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase.
Blocking any portion of the synthesis pathway of dopamine or
norepinephrine reduces the amount of norepinephrine that is produced by
a neuron. The drug AMPT, which prevents the conversion of tyrosine to
L-DOPA, blocks the production of norepinephrine as well as dopamine.

Dopamine Dopamine is stored in synaptic vesicles

Most classical neurotransmitters are synthesized in the cytoplasm of the
terminal button and then stored in newly formed synaptic vesicles.
However, for norepinephrine, the final step of synthesis occurs inside
the vesicles themselves. The vesicles are first filled with dopamine.
Then the dopamine is converted to norepinephrine through the action of
the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase located within the vesicles. The drug
fusaric acid inhibits the activity of dopamine β-hydroxylase and blocks
norepinephrine production without affecting the dopamine production.
Fusaric acid is sometimes used by researchers who want to investigate
the norepinephrine system while leaving the dopamine system unaffected.

Receptors There are four types of adrenergic receptors, a1- and a2
adrenergic receptors and b1- and b2-adrenergic receptors, that are
sensitive to both norepinephrine and epinephrine. All adrenergic
receptors are metabotropic, coupled to G proteins that control the
production of second messengers. Neurons in the CNS contain all four
kinds of receptors. All four kinds of receptors are also found in
various organs of the body and are responsible for the effects of
epinephrine and norepinephrine when they act as hormones in the PNS. The
research drug idazoxan blocks a2 autoreceptors and acts as an agonist.
This drug is used to study the actions of the norepinephrine system.

Several drugs act on adrenergic receptors. For example, yohimbine blocks
the adrenergic autoreceptor, producing symptoms of anxiety and increased
heart rate and blood pressure. In contrast, clonidine (Catapres) is an
agonist at the norepinephrine autoreceptor, decreasing the activity of
this system and reducing heart rate and blood pressure. In the brain,
all adrenergic autoreceptors appear to be of the a2 type. Reuptake and
Deactivation The norepinephrine transporter is responsible for removing
excess norepinephrine from the synapse. Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A)
deactivates norepinephrine. The drug moclobemide specifically blocks
MAO-A and serves as a noradrenergic agonist. Moclobemide and other MAO
inhibitors are sometimes used to treat symptoms of depression; however,
they can contribute to problematic side effects. Newer
monoamineenhancing drugs, such as selective serotonin, norepinephrine,
and dopamine reuptake inhibitors, block transporters and have largely
replaced MAO inhibitors in the treatment of depression.

word raphe means "seam" or "crease" and refers to the fact that most of
the raphe nuclei are found at or near the midline "seam" of the brain
stem. Both the dorsal and median raphe nuclei project axons to the
cerebral cortex. Also, neurons in the dorsal raphe innervate the basal
ganglia, and those in the median raphe innervate the dentate gyrus, a
part of the hippocampal formation. (See Figure 4.19.) Neurotransmitter
Production, Storage, and Release The precursor for serotonin is the
amino acid tryptophan. The enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase acts on
tryptophan, producing 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan). The enzyme 5-HTP
decarboxylase converts 5-HTP to 5-HT (serotonin). (See Figure 4.20.) The
drug PCPA (p-chlorophenylalanine) blocks the activity of tryptophan
hydroxylase and serves as a serotonergic antagonist. Similar to the
other monoamines described in this chapter, 5-HT is loaded into vesicles
using the vesicle monoamine transporter and released following an action
potential. Receptors Investigators have identified at least nine

third monoamine neurotransmitter, serotonin (also called 5-HT, or
5-hydroxytryptamine), is involved in mood and pain regulation, and the
control of eating, sleep, arousal, and dreaming. The cell bodies of
serotonergic neurons are found in nine clusters, most of which are
located in the raphe nuclei of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Like
norepinephrine, 5-HT is released from varicosities rather than terminal
buttons. The two most important clusters of serotonergic cell bodies are
found in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, and we will restrict our
discussion to these clusters. The

114 Chapter 4 5-HT2A-2C, and 5-HT3. Of these, the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D
receptors serve as presynaptic autoreceptors. In the dorsal and median
raphe nuclei, 5-HT1A receptors serve as autoreceptors in the membrane of
dendrites and soma. All 5-HT receptors are metabotropic except for the
5-HT3 receptor, which is ionotropic. The 5-HT3 receptor controls a
chloride channel, which means that it produces inhibitory postsynaptic
potentials. These receptors appear to play a role in nausea and
vomiting, because 5-HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron, are useful in
reducing nausea side effects of chemotherapy and radiation for the
treatment of cancer. Some drugs selectively bind to other 5-HT
receptors. For example, the 5-HT1A partial agonist buspirone (BuSpar)
treats symptoms of anxiety and depression. Several hallucinogenic drugs
produce their effects by interacting with serotonergic transmission. LSD
(lysergic acid diethylamide) produces distortions of visual perceptions.
This drug, which is effective in extremely small doses, is a direct
agonist for postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptors in the forebrain. Reuptake and
Deactivation The serotonin transporter removes 5-HT from the synapse.
Drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake have found a very important place
in the treatment of mental illness. These drugs increase the amount of
serotonin available at the synapse to bind to 5-HT receptors.
Interestingly, serotonin reuptake inhibitors must be administered for
several consecutive weeks to achieve a therapeutic effect. Researchers
believe that important neural adaptations occur during this period to
affect the activity of the 5-HT system. The best known of these drugs,
fluoxetine (Prozac), is used to treat depression, some forms of anxiety
disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. These disorders and their
treatment are discussed in Chapters 17 and 18. Another drug,
fenfluramine, which

causes the release of serotonin as well as inhibits its reuptake, was
formerly used as an appetite suppressant in the treatment of obesity.
Chapter 12 discusses the topic of obesity and pharmacological
interventions. MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine or ecstasy) binds
with norepinephrine and 5-HT transporters and causes them to run
backward, releasing these neurotransmitters and inhibiting their
reuptake, resulting in excitatory and hallucinogenic effects. It appears
that MDMA can selectively damage serotonergic neurons and cause some
cognitive deficits. Similar to the other monoamines, 5-HT is subject to
deactivation by monoamine oxidase. As you have already read, monoamine
oxidase inhibitors have antidepressant effects. HISTAMINE Pathways The
cell bodies of histaminergic neurons are

found in only one place in the brain: the tuberomammillary nucleus,
located in the posterior hypothalamus. (See Figure 4.21.) Histaminergic
neurons send their axons to widespread regions of the cerebral cortex
and brain stem. Histamine plays an important role in wakefulness. The
activity of histaminergic neurons is strongly correlated with the states
of sleep and wakefulness, and drugs that block histamine receptors (also
called antihistamines) can cause drowsiness. Neurotransmitter
Production, Storage, and Release Histamine is produced from the amino
acid precursor histidine by the action of the enzyme histidine
decarboxylase. Like the other monoamines, it is stored in vesicles and
released following an action potential. Receptors The CNS contains H1,
H2, H3, and H4 receptors. Newer antihistamines that are used to treat

symptoms of allergies do not cross the blood--brain barrier, so they
have no direct effects on the brain. In contrast, many over-the-counter
sleep aids and allergy medicines contain diphenhydramine, which crosses
the blood--brain barrier and produces drowsiness. You will read more
about the histamine system and its role in sleep in Chapter 9. For a
summary of some important drugs that act on monoamine systems, see Table
4.6.

Peptides LO 4.13 Contrast the features of peptide neurotransmitters with
classical neurotransmitters. In addition to amino acids and classical
neurotransmitters, neurons of the CNS release a large variety of
peptides. In contrast to the classical neurotransmitters, peptides
consist of two or more amino acids linked together by peptide bonds.
PRODUCTION, STORAGE, AND RELEASE All the peptide neurotransmitters that
have been studied so far are produced from precursor molecules. These
precursors are large polypeptides that are made into smaller
neurotransmitter molecules by special enzymes. Neurons manufacture both
the polypeptides and the enzymes needed to break them apart in the right
places. The appropriate sections of the polypeptides are retained, and
the rest are

M04_CARL0287_13_GE_C04.indd 115

destroyed. Because the synthesis of peptides takes place in the soma,
vesicles containing these chemicals must be delivered to the terminal
buttons by axoplasmic transport. As we saw in Chapter 2, many terminal
buttons contain different types of synaptic vesicles, each filled with a
different substance. These terminal buttons release peptides in
conjunction with a classical neurotransmitter. One reason for the
co-release of peptides is their ability to regulate the sensitivity of
presynaptic or postsynaptic receptors to the neurotransmitter. Many
peptides produced in the brain have interesting behavioral effects, as
you'll see in subsequent chapters. Peptides are released from all parts
of the terminal button, not just from the active zone. This means that
only a portion of the molecules is released into the synaptic cleft. The
rest of the molecules presumably act on receptors belonging to other
cells in the vicinity. Once released, peptides are deactivated by
enzymes. Unlike the other neurotransmitters in this chapter, there is no
mechanism for reuptake and recycling of peptides. Several different
peptides are released by neurons. Although most peptides appear to serve
as neuromodulators, some act as neurotransmitters. One of the best-known
families of peptides are the endogenous opioids. Research has revealed
that opiates (drugs such as opium, morphine, heroin, and oxycodone)
reduce pain because they have direct effects on the brain through their
actions in the endogenous opioid system.

24/11/21 1:00 PM

116 Chapter 4 RECEPTORS Although opiate drugs like opium have been used
for centuries, receptors for opioids were not discovered until the
1970s. At that time, no one knew about the endogenous opioids. Soon
after the discovery of opioid receptors, other neuroscientists
discovered the natural ligands for these receptors, which were called
enkephalins. We now know that the enkephalins are only two members of a
family of endogenous opioids, all of which are synthesized from one of
three large peptides that serve as precursors. Also, we know that there
are at least three different types of opioid receptors: μ (mu), δ
(delta), and Κ (kappa). Several different neural systems are activated
when opioid receptors are stimulated. One type produces analgesia,
another inhibits species-typical defensive responses such as fleeing and
hiding, and another stimulates a system of neurons involved in
reinforcement ("reward"). The last effect explains why opioids are often
abused. (See the case of Christopher at the beginning of the chapter.)
Endogenous opioids are discussed in Chapter 7, and brain mechanisms
involved in opioid abuse are discussed in Chapter 16. So far,
pharmacologists have developed only two types of drugs that affect
neural communication utilizing opioids: direct agonists and antagonists.
Many synthetic opioids, including heroin, methadone, and oxycodone, have
been developed, and some are used clinically as analgesics. Several
opioid receptor antagonists have also been developed. One of them,
naloxone, is used clinically to reverse an opioid overdose. This drug
has saved the lives of many people who would otherwise have died from an
opioid overdose.

Lipids LO 4.14 Summarize the features of the lipid neurotransmitter
systems. Various substances derived from lipids can serve to transmit
messages within or between cells. The best known, and probably the most
important, are the endocannabinoids--- natural ligands for the receptors
that are responsible for the physiological effects of THC
(tetrahydrocannabinol) the active ingredient of marijuana (Matsuda et
al., 1990). THC produces analgesia and sedation, stimulates appetite,
reduces nausea caused by drugs used to treat cancer, relieves asthma
attacks, decreases the pressure within the eyes in patients with
glaucoma, and reduces the symptoms of certain motor disorders. On the
other hand, THC interferes with concentration and memory, alters visual
and auditory perception, and distorts perceptions of the passage of
time. THC can occur naturally (produced by the marijuana plant) or it
can be manufactured synthetically (in manufactured compounds such as
"Spice" or "K2" used as recreational drugs, or dronabinol used as a
prescription drug). Devane and colleagues (1992) discovered the first
natural ligand for the THC receptor: a lipid-like substance that they
named anandamide, from the Sanskrit word ananda,

M04_CARL0287_13_GE_C04.indd 116

or "bliss." A few years after the discovery of anandamide, Mechoulam and
colleagues (1995) discovered another endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonyl
glycerol (2-AG). NEUROTRANSMITTER PRODUCTION, STORAGE, AND RELEASE Lipid
neurotransmitters, such as anandamide,

appear to be synthesized on demand; that is, they are produced and
released as needed and are not stored in synaptic vesicles. Can you
think of any reason why it might be difficult to contain lipid
neurotransmitters within the lipid-based membranes of a vesicle?
RECEPTORS Two types of cannabinoid receptors, CB 1 and CB 2, are both
metabotropic. Besides THC, several drugs affect the actions of the
endocannabinoids. For example, CB1 receptors are blocked by the drug
rimonabant. CB1 receptors are found on terminal buttons of
glutamatergic, GABAergic, acetylcholinergic, noradrenergic,
dopaminergic, and serotonergic neurons, where they serve as presynaptic
heteroreceptors, regulating neurotransmitter release (Iversen, 2003).
When activated, the receptors open potassium channels in the terminal
buttons, shortening the duration of action potentials there and
decreasing the amount of neurotransmitter that is released. When neurons
release cannabinoids, the chemicals diffuse a distance of approximately
20 µm in all directions, and their effects persist for several tens of
seconds. The short-term memory impairment that accompanies marijuana use
appears to be caused by the action of THC on CB1 receptors in the
hippocampus. Endocannabinoids also appear to play an essential role in
the reinforcing effects of opiates: A targeted mutation that prevents
the production of CB1 receptors abolishes the reinforcing effects of
morphine but not of cocaine, amphetamine, or nicotine (Cossu et al.,
2001). These effects of cannabinoids are discussed further in Chapter
19. Agarwal and colleagues (2007) found that THC exerts its analgesic
effects by stimulating CB1 receptors in the PNS. In addition, a commonly
used over-the-counter analgesic, acetaminophen (known as paracetamol in
many countries), also acts on these receptors. Once it enters the blood,
acetaminophen is converted into another compound that then joins with
arachidonic acid, the precursor of anandamide. This compound binds with
peripheral CB1 receptors and activates them, reducing pain sensation.
Because the compound does not cross the blood--brain barrier, it does
not produce effects like those of THC. Administration of a CB1
antagonist completely blocks the analgesic effect of acetaminophen
(Bertolini et al., 2006). REUPTAKE AND DEACTIVATION Anandamide is deac-

tivated by the enzyme FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase), which is
present in anandamide-secreting neurons. Because the enzyme is found
there, molecules of anandamide must be transported back into these
neurons, which is accomplished by anandamide transporters. Another drug,

important drugs that act on the peptide and lipid neurotransmitter
systems, see Table 4.7. In conclusion, we have reviewed only some of
many neurotransmitter systems that have so far been discovered. These
systems are the most relevant to many of the behavioral examples you
will encounter in the remainder of this

book. In addition to the systems reviewed here, there are also
nucleosides, such as adenosine, that serve as neuromodulators. You will
read more about adenosine in Chapter 9. Recently, investigators have
discovered that neurons use at least two simple, soluble gases---nitric
oxide and carbon monoxide---to communicate with one another. As you will
see in Chapter 13, nitric oxide may play a role in establishing neural
changes that are produced by learning.

Glutamate is packaged into vesicles by the vesicle glutamate
transporter; binds to AMPA, NMDA, kainite, and metabotropic glutamate
receptors; is metabolized by the enzyme glutamine synthase, and is

systems. The monoamines are classical neurotransmitters and include
dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin, and histamine. The
neurons of each system are organized into pathways in the CNS. The
monoamines are synthesized from amino acid precursors, loaded into
vesicles by vesicle monoamine transporters, and released following an
action potential. The monoamines bind to a variety of ionotropic and
metabotropic receptors. Monoamines are deactivated by enzymes such as
monoamine oxidase. Reuptake transporters, such as the dopamine
transporter, norepinephrine transporter, and serotonin transporter,
remove monoamines from the synapse.

emergency medical services in many countries are equipped with naloxone
in their kits to reduce overdose-related fatalities. What effects of
naloxone would you expect if you administer this drug to an individual
suffering from opioid overdose who also has a history of opioid abuse?
Why do medics often have methadone, an opioid agonist used as an opioid
replacement in the addiction treatment, in their kit alongside naloxone?

In the summer of 1982, several young people began showing up at
neurology clinics in northern California displaying dramatic symptoms
(Langston et al., 1983). The most severely affected patients were almost
completely paralyzed. They were unable to speak clearly, they salivated
constantly, and their eyes were open with a fixed stare. Others, less
severely affected, walked with a slow, shuffling gait and moved with
great difficulty. The symptoms looked like those of Parkinson's disease,
but that disorder has a very gradual onset, usually in older adulthood.
These patients were all in their twenties or early thirties. The common
factor linking these patients was intravenous drug use. All of the
patients had used a synthetic opiate. The illicit drug was contaminated
with MPTP, a toxic chemical that damaged dopaminergic neurons and caused
the patients' neurological symptoms. Because the symptoms looked like
those of Parkinson's disease, the patients were given l-DOPA, the
dopamine precursor drug used to treat this disease, and they all showed
significant improvement in their symptoms. Unfortunately, the
improvement was temporary, and the drug lost its effectiveness. Two
individuals affected by the MPTP traveled to Sweden to receive fetal
tissue transplants containing dopamine-secreting neurons. This tissue
was transplanted into the caudate and putamen with the hope that the new
neurons from the tissue

would survive and begin to produce dopamine, diminishing the Parkinson's
disease-like symptoms that the patients were experiencing. Before the
transplant took place, one of the patients was given an injection of
radioactive l-DOPA. Then, one hour later, he was given a PET scan. His
head was positioned in the scanner, and for the next several minutes the
machine gathered data from subatomic particles that were emitted as the
radioactive l-DOPA in his brain broke down. This data revealed the
extent and location of damage to the dopamine system. A few weeks later,
the patient was admitted to the hospital for his surgery. Technicians
removed dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra of several fetal
brains and prepared them for implantation into the patient's brain. The
patient was anesthetized, and the surgeon made cuts in his scalp to
expose parts of his skull. The surgeon attached the frame of a
stereotaxic apparatus to the patient's skull, made some measurements
based on a map of the patient's brain, and then drilled several holes.
He used the stereotaxic apparatus to guide the injections of the fetal
neurons into the patient's caudate nucleus and putamen. Once the
injections were completed, the surgeon removed the stereotaxic frame and
sutured the incisions he had made in the scalp.

08/11/2021 17:24

Methods and Strategies of Research The operation was quite successful,
and the patient recovered much of his motor control. A little more than
a year later, he was given another injection of radioactive l-DOPA, and
again underwent a PET scan. The results of the second scan showed what
his recovery implied: The transplanted cells had survived and were
secreting dopamine. You can view the results of his PET scans in Figure
5.32 in this chapter.

This case highlights several important methodological concepts explored
in this chapter. Chemical lesioning, PET scan imaging, and stereotaxic
surgery are all methodological tools used by researchers as they try to
better understand the structure and function of the nervous system and
develop effective treatments for disease. Behavioral neuroscience
research involves the efforts of scientists in many disciplines,
including physiology, neuroanatomy, biochemistry, psychology,
endocrinology, and histology. Pursuing research in behavioral
neuroscience requires skill and knowledge in many experimental
techniques. Because different procedures can produce contradictory
results, investigators must be familiar with the advantages and
limitations of the methods that are used. Researchers might receive a
puzzling answer, only to realize later that they were not asking the
question they thought they were. As we will see, the best conclusions
about behavioral neuroscience don't come from a single experiment but
from a program of research that enables us to compare the results of
studies using different methods. An enormous---and potentially
confusing---array of research methods is available to researchers in
behavioral neuroscience. A reader could get lost---or lose interest---if
these methods were presented in a long list. Instead, we will present
some of the most important and commonly used procedures, arranged by
similarities. Our goal is to make it easier to understand the
advantages, disadvantages, and types of information produced by
different types of methods. It will also help explain the strategies
that researchers employ as they follow up the results of one experiment
by designing and conducting another one. The first module begins with
various methods of experimental ablation. The second looks at how
researchers stimulate and record neural activity. Then the third and
fourth modules examine neurochemical and genetic methods using in
behavioral neuroscience research.

Experimental Ablation An important research method used to investigate
brain functions involves removing or inactivating part of the brain and
evaluating an animal's subsequent behavior. This method is called
experimental ablation. Experimental

Despite the devastating effects of accidental administration in this
group of patients, MPTP is now considered an important tool in
Parkinson's disease research. Its neurotoxic effects make MPTP useful
for creating selective chemical lesions of the dopamine system and
producing a model of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Researchers
now rely on the MPTP model in laboratory animals to test the
effectiveness of new treatments for the disease.

ablation can involve removing brain tissue, or damaging the tissue to
disrupt its functioning. Experimental ablation is one of the oldest
methods used in neuroscience.

Evaluating the Behavioral Effects of Brain Damage LO 5.1

Explain what researchers can learn from lesion studies.

A lesion is a wound or injury, and a researcher who destroys part of the
brain usually refers to the damage as a brain lesion. Experiments in
which part of the brain is damaged and the individual's behavior is
subsequently observed are called lesion studies. Intentional brain
lesioning is performed in animals. In addition, the behavioral results
of naturally occurring lesions, such as those that result from
accidental injuries or strokes, can be studied in human research
participants. Just what can we learn from lesion studies? The goal is to
discover what functions are performed by different regions of the brain
and then to understand how these functions are combined to accomplish
particular behaviors. The distinction between brain function and
behavior is an important one. Circuits within the brain perform
functions, not behaviors. No one brain region or neural circuit is
solely responsible for behavior. Each brain region performs a function
(or set of functions) that contributes to the performance of the
behavior. For example, the act of reading involves functions required
for controlling eye movements, focusing the lens of the eye, perceiving
and recognizing words and letters, comprehending the meaning of the
words, and so on. Some of these functions also participate in other
behaviors. For example, controlling eye movement and focusing are
required for any task that involves looking, and brain mechanisms used
for comprehending the meanings of words also participate in
comprehending speech. The researcher's task is to understand the
functions that are required for performing a particular behavior and to
determine what circuits of neurons in the brain are responsible for each
of these functions. Another example that highlights the role of neural
circuits in behavior can be seen in drug-taking behavior. As you'll read
in Chapter 19, dopamine-secreting cells

08/11/2021 17:24

122 Chapter 5 located in the ventral tegmental area have their terminal
buttons located in the nucleus accumbens. This pathway is involved in
the reinforcing effects of many behaviors, including drug use. Lesioning
cells in this pathway does reduce drug-taking, but only for certain
drugs. Even lesioning the entire mesolimbic pathway may not completely
eliminate the behavior (Pierce & Kumaresan, 2006). Drug-taking is a
complex behavior that involves multiple circuits in the brain.
Interpreting lesion studies is complicated by the fact that all regions
of the brain are interconnected. Suppose that we have a good
understanding of the functions required for the performance of a
particular behavior. We find that damage to one specific brain structure
impairs a particular behavior. Can we necessarily conclude that a
function essential to this behavior is performed by circuits of neurons
located in this one specific structure? Unfortunately, we cannot. The
functions we are interested in may actually be performed by neural
circuits located elsewhere in the brain. Damage to one structure may
simply interfere with the activity of the neural circuits in a different
structure.

Producing Brain Lesions LO 5.2

Compare methods of producing brain lesions.

How are brain lesions produced experimentally? Usually, a researcher
wants to inactivate regions that are hidden away in the depths of the
brain. Brain lesions of subcortical regions (regions located beneath the
cortex) are

usually produced by passing an electrical current through a stainless
steel wire that is covered with an insulating coating except for the
very tip. The wire is then guided to its destination using exact
coordinates to a precise location within the brain. The researcher then
activates a lesion-making device, which produces a radio frequency (RF)
current---an alternating current of a very high frequency. Passing the
RF current through the brain tissue produces heat that kills cells in
the region surrounding the tip of the electrode. Lesions produced using
this technique destroy everything in the vicinity of the electrode tip,
including neural cell bodies and the axons of neurons that pass through
the region. A more selective method of producing brain lesions employs
an excitatory amino acid, such as kainic acid, which kills neurons by
stimulating them to death. Lesions produced in this way are referred to
as excitotoxic lesions. When an excitatory amino acid is injected
through a cannula (a small metal tube) into a region of the brain, the
chemical destroys neural cell bodies in the vicinity but spares axons
that belong to different neurons that happen to pass nearby. (See Figure
5.1.) This selectivity permits the investigator to determine whether the
behavioral effects of destroying a particular brain structure are caused
by the death of neurons located there or by the destruction of axons
that pass nearby. For example, some researchers discovered that RF
lesions of a particular region in the brain stem abolished REM sleep and
concluded that this region was involved in the production of this stage

dreaming occurs. You will learn more about this topic in Chapter 9.) But
later studies showed that when kainic acid was used to destroy the
neurons located there, the animals' sleep was not affected. Therefore,
the RF lesions must have altered sleep by destroying the axons that pass
through the area. Even more specific methods of targeting and killing
particular types of neurons are available. For example, molecular
biologists have devised ways to conjugate (attach together) saporin, a
toxic protein, and antibodies that will bind with particular proteins
found only on certain types of neurons in the brain. The antibodies
target these proteins, and the saporin kills the only cells to which the
proteins are attached. Note that when subcortical lesions are produced
by passing RF current through an electrode or infusing a chemical
through a cannula, there is always additional damage caused to the
brain. When an electrode or a cannula is passed through the brain to get
to a target, it inevitably causes a small amount of damage even before
turning on the lesion maker or starting the infusion. As a result, we
cannot simply compare the behavior of brainlesioned animals with that of
unoperated control animals. The incidental damage to the brain regions
above the lesion may actually be responsible for some of the behavioral
deficits we see. To control for this, researchers typically include an
additional group of animals in a lesion study and produce sham lesions.
To produce sham lesions, researchers anesthetize each animal, insert the
electrode or cannula, and lower it to the proper depth. In other words,
they do everything they would do to produce the lesion except turn on
the lesion maker or start the infusion. This group of animals serves as
a control group. If the behavior of the animals with brain lesions is
different from that of the sham-operated control animals, we can
conclude that the lesions caused the behavioral deficits. (A sham lesion
serves the same purpose as a placebo does in a pharmacology study.) Most
of the time, investigators produce permanent brain lesions, but
sometimes it is advantageous to disrupt the activity of a particular
region of the brain temporarily. The easiest way to do so is to inject a
local anesthetic or a drug called muscimol into the appropriate part of
the brain. The anesthetic blocks action potentials in axons entering or
leaving that region, and effectively produces a temporary lesion
(usually called a reversible brain lesion). Muscimol, a drug that
stimulates GABA receptors, inactivates a region of the brain by
inhibiting the neurons located there. (Recall that GABA is an important
inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.) Another technique,
optogenetics, can also be used to temporarily inhibit, or in some cases
stimulate brain regions. You will read more about this technique later
in the chapter.

Stereotaxic Surgery LO 5.3

Describe the process of stereotaxic surgery.

How do researchers get an electrode or cannula to a precise location in
the depths of an animal's brain? The answer is stereotaxic surgery.
Stereotaxis refers to the ability to locate objects in space. A
stereotaxic apparatus contains a holder that keeps the animal's head in
a standard position and an arm that moves an electrode or a cannula
through measured distances in all three axes of space. However, to
perform stereotaxic surgery, a researcher first consults a stereotaxic
atlas. THE STEREOTAXIC ATLAS A stereotaxic atlas is a book,

website, or software that contains images that correspond to frontal
sections of the brain taken at various distances rostral and caudal to
bregma. The skull is composed of several bones that grow together and
form sutures (seams). The heads of babies contain a soft spot at the
junction of the coronal and sagittal sutures called the fontanelle. Once
this gap closes, the junction is called bregma, from the Greek word
meaning "front of head." No two brains of animals of a given species are
completely identical, but there is enough similarity among individuals
to predict the location of particular brain structures relative to
external features of the head. We can find bregma on a rat's skull, too,
and it serves as a convenient reference point. Figure 5.2 is a drawing
of a slice of the brain that contains a brain structure (shown in red)
that we are interested in. If we wanted to place the tip of a wire in
this structure (a bundle of axons called the fornix), we would have to
drill a hole through the skull immediately above it. Each image of the
stereotaxic atlas is labeled according to the distance of the section
anterior or posterior to bregma. The grid on each image indicates
distances of brain structures ventral to the top of the skull and
lateral to the midline. To place the tip of a wire in the fornix, a
researcher would drill a hole above the target and then lower the
electrode through the hole until the tip was at the correct depth,
relative to the skull height at bregma. By finding a brain structure
(which cannot be seen from the outside of the skull) on one of the
images of a stereotaxic atlas, the researcher can determine the
structure's location relative to bregma (which can be seen from the
outside of the skull). Because of variations in different strains and
ages of animals, the atlas gives only an approximate location.
Researchers always have to try out a new set of coordinates, slice and
stain the animal's brain, see the actual location of the lesion, correct
the numbers, and try again. (Slicing and staining of brains are
described later.) A stereotaxic apparatus is a device that includes a
head holder, which maintains the animal's skull in the proper
orientation; THE STEREOTAXIC APPARATUS

a holder for an electrode or cannula, and a calibrated mechanism that
moves the electrode/cannula holder in measured distances along the three
axes: anterior--posterior, dorsal--ventral, and lateral--medial. Figure
5.3 illustrates a stereotaxic apparatus designed for small animals. The
size of the stereotaxic apparatus can be scaled up or down to be used
for different species. Once a researcher obtains the coordinates from a
stereotaxic atlas, they anesthetize the animal, place it in the
apparatus, and cut the scalp open. The researcher will locate bregma,
dial in the appropriate numbers on the stereotaxic

apparatus, drill a hole through the skull, and lower the device into the
brain by the correct amount. Now the tip of the cannula or electrode is
where the researcher wants it to be, and the researcher is ready to
produce the lesion. Stereotaxic surgery may be used for purposes other
than lesion production. Wires placed in the brain can be used to
stimulate neurons as well as to destroy them, and drugs can be injected
that stimulate neurons or block specific receptors. A researcher can
attach cannulas or wires permanently by following a procedure that will
be described next. In all cases, once the surgery is complete, the scalp
incision is sewn together, and the animal is taken out of the
stereotaxic apparatus and allowed to recover from the anesthetic.
Stereotaxic apparatuses are also made for humans. Sometimes a
neurosurgeon produces subcortical lesions--- for example, to reduce the
symptoms of Parkinson's disease, a treatment you'll encounter in Chapter
16. Usually, the surgeon uses multiple landmarks and verifies the
location of the wire (or another device) inserted into the brain by
taking brain scans or recording the activity of the neurons in that
region before producing a brain lesion. Deep brain stimulation is
another procedure that requires using a stereotaxic apparatus. Deep
brain stimulation is used to treat conditions that include chronic pain,
movement disorders (including Parkinson's disease), epilepsy,
depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Deep brain stimulation
utilizes a stereotaxic apparatus to implant a permanent electrode into
the brain of patients. (See Figure 5.4.) Rather than produce a lesion,
electrical current passed through the electrode is used to stimulate
brain regions and reduce symptoms (Holtzheimer & Mayberg, 2011a;
Sarem-Aslani & Mullett, 2011). The applications of

Hariz, 2014).

Histological Methods LO 4.4

Summarize the steps of histological methods.

After producing a brain lesion and observing its effects on an animal's
behavior, researchers must thinly slice and stain the brain so that they
can observe it under the microscope and see the location of the lesion.
Brain lesioning can miss the mark, so researchers have to verify the
precise location of the brain damage after testing the animal
behaviorally. To do so, histologists (specialists in these techniques)
must fix, slice, stain, and examine the brain. Together, these
procedures are referred to as histological methods. (The prefix histo-
refers to body tissue.)

125

FIXATION AND SECTIONING To study brain tissue, it must be protected from
autolytic enzymes (autolytic means "self-dissolving"), which will
otherwise break down the tissue, making it impossible to study. The
tissue must also be preserved to prevent its decomposition by bacteria
or molds. To achieve both of these objectives, neural tissue is placed
in a fixative. Commonly used fixatives are formalin or paraformaldehyde,
aqueous solutions of formaldehyde, a gas. Fixatives cross-link proteins
to strengthen the very soft and fragile brain tissue and kill any
microorganisms that might destroy it. Before the brain is fixed (that
is, put into a fixative solution), it is usually perfused. Perfusion of
tissue entails the removal of the blood and its replacement with another
fluid. The animal's brain is perfused because better histological
results are obtained when no blood is present in the tissue. The animal
whose brain is to be studied is humanely euthanized with an overdose of
a general anesthetic. Blood is removed from the vessels and replaced
with a dilute salt solution. Finally, a dilute fixative solution is
pumped through the tissue, and the brain is removed from the skull and
placed in a container filled with the fixative. Once the brain has been
fixed, it must be sliced into thin sections and stained for various
cellular structures in order to see anatomical details. Slicing is done
with a microtome or a cryostat. A microtome contains three parts: a
knife, a platform on which to mount the tissue, and a mechanism that
advances the knife (or the platform) the correct distance after each
slice so that another section can be cut. In most cases, the platform
includes an attachment that freezes the brain to make it hard enough to
be cut into thin sections. Figure 5.5 shows a microtome and

126 Chapter 5 a cryostat. A cryostat is similar to a microtome; however,
the entire cutting process occurs within a freezer, allowing sections to
be cut at very cold temperatures. In some cases, a researcher may need
to work quickly with unfixed tissue and a cryostat may be the tool of
choice. After the tissue is cut, the slices are attached to glass
microscope slides. A researcher can then stain the tissue by putting the
entire slide into various chemical solutions. STAINING If you looked at
an unstained section of brain tissue under a light microscope, you would
be able to see the outlines of some large cellular masses and the more
prominent fiber bundles. However, no fine details would be visible. For
this reason, the study of microscopic neuro-anatomy requires special
histological stains. Researchers have developed many different stains to
identify specific substances within and outside of cells. For verifying
the location of a brain lesion, many researchers use one of the simplest
stains: a cellbody stain. Methylene blue and cresyl violet are two
examples of dyes that stain the cell bodies of brain tissue. The
material that takes up the dye within the cell, known as the Nissl
substance, consists of RNA, DNA, and associated proteins located in the
nucleus and scattered, in the form of granules, in the cytoplasm. Figure
5.6 shows a frontal section of a brain stained with cresyl violet. Note
that you can observe fiber bundles by their lighter appearance; they do
not take up the stain. The stain is not selective for neural cell
bodies; all cells are stained, neurons and glia alike. It is up to the
investigator to determine which cell type is which--- by size, shape,
and location.

Other staining techniques frequently used in neuroscience research
include Golgi staining for whole cells, reduced silver staining for
nuclei and cytoskeletal proteins, and hematoxylin and eosin to
distinguish between nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, the
stained sections are covered with a small amount of a transparent liquid
known as a mounting medium, and a very thin glass coverslip is placed
over the sections. The mounting medium keeps the coverslip in position.
LIGHT MICROSCOPY Once the tissue has been fixed, sectioned, stained, and
coverslipped, researchers may use a light microscope to examine tissue
mounted on microscope slides. Light microscopes are less expensive than
other types of microscopes and can be used for a wide variety of
research that requires viewing cells under magnification. (See Figure
5.7.) Light microscopes typically provide between 40 and 100 times
magnification. This level of magnification allows a researcher to view
whole cells, but other types of microscopy are required to see
subcellular structures at higher magnification.

While many researchers use light microscopes to examine stained tissue,
the light microscope is limited in its ability to reveal extremely small
details. To see very small anatomical structures as synaptic vesicles
and details of cell organelles, investigators ELECTRON MICROSCOPY

must use a transmission electron microscope. A beam of electrons is
passed through a thin slice of the tissue to be examined (\< 100 nm
thick). The beam of electrons casts a shadow of the tissue on a
fluorescent screen, which can be photographed or scanned into a
computer. Electron photomicrographs produced in this way can provide
information about structural details on the order of a few tens of
nanometers. (See Figure 5.8.) A scanning electron microscope provides
less magnification than a standard transmission electron microscope,
which transmits the electron beam through the tissue. However, it shows
objects in three dimensions. The microscope scans the tissue with a
moving beam of electrons. The information from the reflection of the
beam is received

by a detector, and a computer produces a remarkably detailed
three-dimensional view. (See Figure 5.8.) CONFOCAL LASER SCANNING
MICROSCOPY Conventional microscopy or transmission electron microscopy
require that the tissue be sliced into thin sections. The confocal laser
scanning microscope makes it possible to see details inside thick
sections of tissue (up to hundreds of micrometers thick) or even in
slabs of tissue maintained in tissue cultures or in the upper layers of
tissue in the exposed living brain. The confocal microscope requires
that the cells or parts of cells of interest be stained with a
fluorescent dye. For example, neurons that produce a particular peptide
can be labeled with a fluorescent dye. A beam of light of a particular
wavelength is produced by a laser and reflected off of a dichroic
mirror---a special mirror that transmits light of certain wavelengths
and reflects light of other wavelengths. Lenses in the microscope focus
the laser light at a particular depth in the tissue. This light triggers
fluorescence in the tissue, which passes through the lenses and is
transmitted through the dichroic mirror to a pinhole aperture. This
aperture blocks extraneous light. The light that passes through the
aperture is measured by a detector. Two moving mirrors cause the laser
light to scan the tissue, which provides the computer with the
information it needs to form an image of a slice of tissue located at a
particular depth within the sample. If multiple scans are made while the
location of the aperture is moved, a stack of images of slices through
the tissue---remember, this can be living tissue---can be obtained.

populations of cells in the hypothalamus of a rat.

Let's suppose that we were interested in discovering the neural
mechanisms responsible for reproductive behavior. To start out, we
wanted to study the physiology of the sexual behavior of female rats. On
the basis of some clues we received by reading reports of experiments by
other researchers published in scientific journals, we performed
stereotaxic surgery on two groups of female rats. We made a lesion in
the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) of the rats in the
experimental group and performed sham surgery on the rats in the control
group. After a few days' recovery, and on a receptive day of the estrus
cycle, we placed the individual animals with male rats. The females in
the control group engaged in courting

behavior with the males followed by copulation. However, the females
with the VMH lesions rejected the males' attention and refused to
copulate with them. We confirmed with histology that the VMH was indeed
destroyed in the brains of the experimental animals. The results of our
experiment indicate that neurons in the VMH appear to play a role in
functions required for copulatory behavior in females. (By the way, it
turns out that these lesions do not affect copulatory behavior in
males.) So where do we go from here? What is the next step? In fact,
there are many questions that we could pursue. One question concerns the
system of brain structures that participate in female copulatory
behavior. Certainly, the VMH does not function alone. The VMH receives
inputs from other structures and sends outputs to still others.
Copulation requires the integration of visual, tactile, and olfactory
perceptions and organization of patterns of movements in response to
those of the partner. In addition, the entire network requires
activation by the appropriate sex hormones. What is the precise role of
the VMH in this complicated system? Before we can hope to answer this
question, we must know more about the connections of the VMH with the
rest

M05_CARL0287_13_GE_C05.indd 128

of the brain. What structures send their axons to the VMH, and to what
structures does the VMH, in turn, send its axons? Once we know what the
connections are, we can investigate the role of these structures and the
nature of their interactions. (See Figure 5.10.)

Figure 5.10 Tracing Neural Circuits Once we know that a particular brain
region is involved in a particular function, we may ask what structures
provide inputs to the region and what structures receive outputs from
it. VMH = ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus

Methods and Strategies of Research

How do we investigate the connections of the VMH? The question cannot be
answered by means of histological procedures that stain all neurons,
such as cell-body stains. If we look closely at a brain that has been
prepared by these means, we will see a large set of all neurons in the
region. But in recent years, researchers have developed very precise
methods that make specific neurons stand out from all of the others.
Eventually, the VMH must affect behavior by sending axons to parts of
the brain that contain neurons that are responsible for muscular
movements. The pathway is probably not direct. It is likely that neurons
in the VMH affect neurons in other structures, which influence those in
yet other structures until, eventually, the appropriate motor neurons
are stimulated. To discover this system, we want to be able to identify
the paths followed by axons leaving the VMH. In other words, we want to
trace the efferent axons of this structure. (Look at Figure 5.10
again.)We can use an anterograde labeling method to trace these axons.
(Anterograde means "moving forward.") Anterograde labeling methods
employ chemicals that are taken up by dendrites or cell bodies and are
then transported through the axons toward the terminal buttons. There
are several different methods for tracing the paths of efferent axons.
For example, to discover the destination of the efferent axons of
neurons located within the VMH, a minute quantity of PHA-L (a protein
found in kidney beans) can be injected into the VMH using a stereotaxic
apparatus. The molecules of PHA-L are taken up by dendrites and are
transported through the soma to the axon, where they travel by means of
fast axoplasmic transport to the terminal buttons. Eventually, cells are
filled with PHA-L. Figure 5.11 illustrates this process. After
euthanizing the animal, slicing the brain, and mounting the sections on
microscope slides, a special TRACING EFFERENT AXONS

129

immunocytochemical method is used to make the molecules of PHA-L
visible, and the slides are examined under a microscope. Figure 5.12
shows how PHA-L injected into the VMH can be used to identify efferent
axons that project to the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). The PAG
contains some labeled axons and terminal buttons (gold color), which
proves that some of the efferent axons of the VMH terminate in the PAG.
Immunocytochemical methods take advantage of an immune reaction. The
body's immune system has the ability to produce antibodies in response
to antigens. Antigens are proteins (or peptides), such as those found on
the surface of bacteria or viruses. Antibodies, which are also proteins,
are produced by white blood cells to destroy invading microorganisms.
Antibodies are either secreted by white blood cells or are located on
their surface, in the way neurotransmitter receptors are located on the
surface of neurons. When the antigens present on the surface of an
invading microorganism come into contact with the antibodies that
recognize them, the antibodies trigger an attack on the invader by the
white blood cells. Molecular biologists have developed methods for
producing antibodies to any peptide or protein. The antibody molecules
are attached to various types of dye molecules. Some of these dyes react
with other chemicals and stain the tissue a brown color. Others are
fluorescent and glow when they are exposed to light of a particular
wavelength. To determine where the peptide or protein (the antigen) is
located in the brain, the investigator places fresh slices of brain
tissue in a solution that contains the antibody/dye molecules. The
antibodies attach themselves to their antigen. (See Figure 5.13.) When
the investigator examines the slices with a microscope (under light of a
particular wavelength in the case of fluorescent dyes), they can see
which parts of the brain---even which individual neurons---contain the
antigen. For example, a

researcher might use antibodies for a protein enzyme involved in the
production of GABA to identify GABAergic cells, or a protein component
of the GABA receptor to identify cells that receive GABAergic messages.
Immunocytochemical methods are an important technique used to help
answer our questions about neural

circuits in the VMH example. To continue our study of the role of the
VMH in female sexual behavior, we would find the structures that receive
information from neurons in the VMH (such as the PAG) and see what
happens when each of them is lesioned. Let's suppose that damage to some
of these structures also impairs female sexual behavior. We could then
inject these structures with PHA-L and see where their axons go.
Eventually, we will discover the relevant pathways from the VMH to the
motor neurons whose activity is necessary for copulatory behavior (In
fact, researchers have done so, and some of their results are presented
in Chapter 10.) TRACING AFFERENT AXONS Tracing efferent axons from the
VMH will tell us only part of the story about the neural circuitry
involved in female sexual behavior: the part between the VMH and the
motor neurons. What about the circuits before the VMH? Is the VMH
somehow involved in the analysis of sensory information (such as the
sight, odor, or touch of the male)? Or perhaps the VMH processes the
activating effect of a female's sex hormones on her behavior through
neurons whose axons form synapses there? To discover the parts of the
brain that are involved in the "upstream" components of the neural
circuitry, we need to find the inputs of the VMH---its afferent
connections. To do so, we will use a retrograde labeling method.
Retrograde means "moving backward." Retrograde labeling methods employ
chemicals that are taken up by

terminal buttons and carried backward through the axons toward the cell
bodies. The method for identifying the afferent inputs to a particular
region of the brain is similar to the method used for identifying its
efferent outputs. First, we inject a small quantity of a retrograde
labeling chemical called fluorogold into the VMH. The chemical is taken
up by terminal buttons and is transported backward toward the cell
bodies by means of retrograde axoplasmic transport to fill the afferent
neurons. Similar to the process for investigating efferent axons, after
euthanizing the animal, slicing the brain, mounting the sections on
microscope slides, and using immunocytochemical methods, the brain
tissue is examined under light of the appropriate wavelength. The
molecules of fluorogold fluoresce under this light. Through this
process, we discover that the medial amygdala is one of the regions that
provide input to the VMH. (See Figure 5.14.) Together, anterograde and
retrograde labeling methods enable us to discover circuits of
interconnected neurons and help to provide us with a "wiring diagram" of
the brain. (See Figure 5.15.) The anterograde and retrograde labeling
methods identify a single link in a chain of neurons---neurons whose
axons enter or leave a particular brain region. Transneuronal tracing
methods identify a series of two, three, or more neurons that form
serial synaptic connections with each other. The most effective
transneuronal tracing method uses a pseudorabies virus---a weakened form
of a pig herpes virus that was originally developed as a vaccine. For
anterograde transneuronal tracing, a variety of the herpes simplex

virus, similar to the one that causes cold sores, is used. The virus is
injected directly into a brain region, is taken up by neurons there, and
infects them. The virus spreads throughout the infected neurons and is
eventually released by the terminal buttons, passing the infection to
other neurons that form synaptic connections with them. After the animal
is euthanized and the brain is sliced, immunocytochemical methods are
used to localize a protein produced by the virus. For example, Daniels
and colleagues (1999) injected pseudorabies virus in the muscles
responsible for female rats' mating posture. After a few days, the rats
were euthanized, and their brains were examined for evidence of viral
infection. The study indicated that the virus found its way up the motor
nerves to the motor neurons in the spinal cord, then to the reticular
formation of the medulla, then to the periaqueductal gray matter, and
finally to the VMH. These results confirm the results of the anterograde
and retrograde labeling methods that were just described.

brain. If we know where the damage occurs, we can study the person's
behavior and try to make the same sorts of inferences we make with
deliberately produced brain lesions in laboratory animals. The problem
is, where is the lesion? In the past, a researcher might have studied
the behavior of a person with brain damage and never determined exactly
where the lesion was located. The only way to be sure was to obtain the
patient's brain when they died and examine slices of it under a
microscope. But it was often impossible to do this. Sometimes the
patient outlived the researcher. Sometimes the patient moved out of
town. Sometimes (often, perhaps) the family refused permission for an
autopsy. Because of these practical problems, the study of the
behavioral effects of damage to specific parts of the human brain made
rather slow progress. Advances in X-ray techniques and computers have
led to the development of several noninvasive methods for studying the
anatomy of the living brain. These advances permit researchers to study
the location and extent of brain damage while the patient is still
living. The first method developed is called computerized tomography
(CT). This procedure, usually referred to as a CT scan, works as
follows: The patient's head is placed in a large doughnut-shaped ring.
The ring contains an

X-ray tube and, directly opposite it (on the other side of the patient's
head), an X-ray detector. The X-ray beam passes through the patient's
head, and the detector measures the amount of radioactivity that gets
through it. The beam scans the head from all angles, and a computer
translates the information it receives from the detector into pictures
of the skull and its contents. (See Figure 5.16.) Figure 5.17 shows a
series of CT scans taken through the head of a patient who sustained a
stroke when bleeding occured in the brain. The scans allow a researcher
or physician to view the location and extent of an injury. In this case,
internal bleeding is indicated by the color blue added to the scan. An
even more detailed, high-resolution picture of what is inside a person's
head is provided by a process called magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The MRI scanner resembles a CT scanner, but it does not use X-rays.
Instead, it passes an extremely strong magnetic field through the
patient's head. When a person's head is placed in this strong magnetic
field, the nuclei of spinning hydrogen atoms align themselves with the
magnetic field. When a pulse of a radio frequency wave is then passed
through the brain, these nuclei flip at an angle to the magnetic field
and then flip back to their original position at the end of the radio
pulse. Different

molecules emit energy at different frequencies. The MRI scanner is tuned
to detect the radiation from hydrogen atoms. Because these atoms are
present in different concentrations in different tissues, the scanner
can use the information to prepare pictures of slices of the brain. (See
Figure 5.18.) As you can see in Figure 5.18, MRI scans can distinguish
between regions of gray matter and white matter, so major fiber bundles
(such as the corpus callosum) can be seen. However, small fiber bundles
are not visible on these scans. A special modification of the MRI
scanner permits the visualization of even small bundles of fibers and
the tracing of fiber tracts. Above absolute zero, all molecules move in
random directions because of thermal agitation: the higher the
temperature, the faster the random movement. Diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) takes advantage of the fact that the movement of water molecules
in bundles of white matter will not be random but will tend to be in a
direction parallel to the axons that make up the bundles. The MRI
scanner uses information about the movement of the water molecules to
determine the location and orientation of bundles of axons in white
matter. Figure 5.19 shows a sagittal view of some of the axons that
project from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex in the human brain, as

Methods and Strategies of Research

Module Review: Experimental Ablation Evaluating the Behavioral Effects
of Brain Damage LO 5.1 Explain what researchers can learn from lesion
studies. By lesioning a part of the nervous system, a researcher can
observe the resulting changes in behavior to determine the function of
that portion of the nervous system. The goal is to discover what
functions are performed by different regions of the brain and then to
understand how these functions are combined to accomplish particular
behaviors. No one brain region or neural circuit is solely responsible
for a behavior; each region performs a function (or set of functions)
that contributes to the performance of the behavior.

Producing Brain Lesions LO 5.2 Compare methods of producing brain
lesions. Brain lesions can be produced by passing an electrical current
through a wire, or by injecting an excitatory amino acid, selective
antibody, or local anesthetic into a specific brain region. Using an
electrical current, an excitatory amino acid or a selective antibody
produces a permanent lesion. Using a local anesthetic produces a
temporary lesion. Using an electrical current produces a nonselective
lesion. The other methods produce lesions based on the type of neuron
the lesioning agent selectively binds to.

Stereotaxic Surgery LO 5.3 Describe the process of stereotaxic surgery.
Stereotaxic surgery involves using a stereotaxic atlas to identify a
specific location in the brain. Once the location has been identified,
the researcher places the head in a stereotaxic apparatus and positions
a cannula over the correct location on the head. The researcher makes an
incision in the scalp of the anesthetized animal (or human), drills a
hole in the skull, and lowers the cannula into place. The researcher
makes the lesion (or in some cases implants an electrode or transplants
tissue), removes the cannula, and the animal (or human) recovers from
the anesthetic.

Histological Methods LO 5.4 Summarize the steps of histological methods.
Brain tissue is perfused and removed from the skull. Then, the tissue to
be examined is placed in a fixative. Once the brain is fixed, it is
sliced into thin sections on a cryostat or microtome. The slices are
placed on a microscope slide. Brain tissue must be stained to reveal
cellular and intracellular structures. Cells can be stained for cell

M05_CARL0287_13_GE_C05.indd 135

bodies, nuclei, or specific proteins using dyes or specially labeled
antibodies. Depending on the characteristics of the cell or
intracellular structures of interest, light microscopes, transmission
electron microscopes, scanning electron microscopes, or confocal laser
scanning microscopes may be used to study the tissue samples.

Tracing Neural Connections LO 5.5 Compare techniques for tracing
efferent and afferent axons. Tracing efferent axons allows researchers
to learn about the target locations of sets of neurons. Using an
anterograde labeling method, a chemical is injected into the region
containing cell bodies, taken up with the cells, and transported to the
terminals. Immunocytochemical methods use antibodies to identify the
structures that receive input from the cell bodies. Tracing afferent
axons allows researchers to learn about neurons that provide input to a
region of interest. Using a retrograde labeling method, a chemical is
injected into the target region and taken up by the terminal buttons.
The chemical then travels to the cell body of the neuron. Transneuronal
tracing methods can identify a series of two or more neurons with
retrograde (pseudorabies) or anterograde (herpes simplex) viruses.

Studying the Structure of the Living Human Brain LO 5.6 Contrast methods
to study the structure of the living human brain. Computerized
tomography (CT) uses X-rays to image the structure of the living human
brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a magnetic field to image
the living brain and differentiates among different tissue types.
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) uses information about the movement of
water molecules to visualize small fiber bundles not visible in MRI
scans.

Thought Question Henry Molaison (H. M.) became a well-known figure in
psychology and neuroscience after undergoing ablation of tissue in his
temporal lobes to reduce seizures. The surgery was performed in 1957. H.
M.'s brain and behavior were documented by physicians and researchers
until his death in 2008. After his death, researchers at the University
of California San Diego carefully preserved, sectioned, and stained his
brain to learn more about it. Describe the techniques these researchers
would need to use to examine H. M.'s brain after his death.

136 Chapter 5

Recording and Stimulating Neural Activity The first module of this
chapter dealt with the anatomy of the brain and the effects of damage to
particular regions. This module considers a different approach: studying
the brain by recording or stimulating the activity of particular
regions. Brain functions involve the activity of circuits of neurons.
Different perceptions and behavioral responses involve different
patterns of activity in the brain. Researchers have devised methods to
record these patterns of activity or to artificially produce them.

Recording Neural Activity LO 5.7

Compare methods of recording neural activity.

Axons produce action potentials, and terminal buttons elicit
postsynaptic potentials in the membrane of the cells with which they
form synapses. These electrical events can be recorded (as we saw in
Chapter 2), and changes in the electrical activity of a particular
region can be used to determine whether that region plays a role in
various behaviors. For example, recordings can be made during stimulus
presentations, decision making, or motor activities. Recordings can be
made over an extended period of time after the animal recovers from
surgery, for a relatively short period of time during which the animal
is kept anesthetized. Short-term recordings, made while the animal is
anesthetized, are usually restricted to studies of sensory pathways.
Short-term recordings seldom involve behavioral observations, since the
behavioral capacity of an anesthetized animal is limited. Drugs that
affect serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons also affect REM sleep.
Suppose that, knowing this fact, we wondered whether the activity of
serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons would vary during different
stages of sleep. To find out, we would record the activity of these
neurons with microelectrodes. Microelectrodes, usually made of thin
wires, have a very fine tip, small enough to record the electrical
activity of individual neurons. This technique is usually called
single-unit recording (a unit refers to an individual neuron). Because
we want to record the activity of single neurons over a long period of
time in unanesthetized animals, we want more durable electrodes. Arrays
of very fine wires gathered together in a bundle can simultaneously
record the activity of many different neurons. The wires are insulated
so that only their tips are bare. Microelectrodes can be implanted in
the brains of animals through stereotaxic surgery and bonded to the
animals' skull. We can then observe both the animal's behavior during
REM sleep and the corresponding activity

RECORDINGS WITH MICROELECTRODES

M05_CARL0287_13_GE_C05.indd 136

of the serotonergic and noradrenergic neurons recorded by the implanted
microelectrodes. (See Figure 5.20.) The electrical signals detected by
microelectrodes are quite small and must be amplified. Amplifiers used
for this purpose work just like the amplifiers in a stereo system,
converting the weak signals recorded in the brain into stronger ones.
These signals can be displayed and saved on a computer. As you will
learn in Chapter 9, if we record the activity of these neurons during
various stages of sleep, we find their firing rates fall almost to zero
during REM sleep, suggesting that these neurons have an inhibitory
effect on REM sleep. That is, REM sleep does not occur until these
neurons stop firing. RECORDINGS WITH MACROELECTRODES Sometimes,

we want to record the activity of a region of the brain as a whole, not
the activity of individual neurons. To do this, we would use
macroelectrodes. Macroelectrodes do not detect the activity of
individual neurons; rather, the records that are obtained with these
devices represent the postsynaptic potentials of many thousands---or
millions---of cells in the area of the electrode. These electrodes are
sometimes implanted into the brain or onto the surface of the brain, but
many are temporarily attached to the human scalp with a special paste
that conducts electricity. Recordings taken from the scalp, especially,
represent the activity of an enormous number of neurons, whose
electrical signals pass through the meninges, skull, and scalp before
reaching the electrodes. The electrical activity of a human brain
recorded through macroelectrodes is displayed on a polygraph. A
polygraph plots the changes in voltage detected by the electrodes along
a timeline during recording. The polygraph is displayed on a computer
screen. Figure 5.21 illustrates electrical activity recorded from
macroelectrodes attached to various locations on a person's scalp. Such
records are called

In this example, an electroencephalogram is created to visually

Left hemisphere

Right hemisphere An electroencephalogram (EEG) electroencephalograms
(EEGs), or "writings of electricity from the head." They can be used to
diagnose epilepsy or to study the stages of sleep and wakefulness, which
are associated with characteristic patterns of electrical activity. In
addition to their use in research, clinicians use ­macroelectrodes to
help treat patients. Occasionally, neurosurgeons implant macroelectrodes
directly into the human brain. The reason for doing so is to detect the
source of abnormal electrical activity that is giving rise to frequent
seizures. Once the source has been determined, the surgeon can remove
the source of the seizures---usually scar tissue caused by brain damage
that occurred earlier in life. Similarly, another clinical use of EEG is
to monitor the condition of the brain during procedures that could
potentially damage it. One of the authors of this book (N. C.) observed
such a procedure: Mrs. F. had sustained one mild heart attack, and
subsequent tests indicated a considerable amount of atherosclerosis,
commonly referred to as "hardening of the arteries." Many of her
arteries were narrowed by cholesterol-rich atherosclerotic plaque. A
clot formed in a particularly narrow portion of one of her coronary
arteries, which caused her heart attack. As the months passed after her
heart attack, Mrs. F. had several transient ischemic attacks, brief
episodes of neurological symptoms that appear to be caused by blood
clots forming and then dissolving in cerebral blood vessels. In her
case, they caused numbness in her right arm and difficulty in talking.
Her physician referred her to a neurologist, who ordered an angiogram (a
recording of heart activity). This procedure revealed that her left
carotid artery was almost totally blocked. The neurologist referred
Mrs. F. to a neurosurgeon, who urged her to have an operation that would
remove the plaque from part of her left carotid artery and increase the
blood flow to the left side of her brain. The procedure is called a
carotid endarterectomy. I was chatting with Mrs. F.'s neurosurgeon after
a conference, and he happened to mention that he would be performing the
operation later that morning. I asked whether I could watch, and

M05_CARL0287_13_GE_C05.indd 137

he agreed. When I entered the operating room, scrubbed and gowned, I
found that Mrs. F. was already anesthetized, and the surgical nurse had
prepared the left side of her neck for the incision. In addition,
several EEG electrodes had been attached to her scalp, and I saw that
Dr. L., a neurologist who specializes in clinical neurophysiology, was
seated at his EEG machine. The surgeon made an incision in Mrs. F.'s
neck and exposed the carotid artery, at the point where the common
carotid, coming from the heart, branched into the external and internal
carotid arteries. He placed a plastic band around the common carotid
artery and clamped it shut, stopping the flow of blood. "How does it
look?" he asked Dr. L. "No good---I see some slowing. You'd better
shunt." The surgeon quickly removed the constricting band and asked the
nurse for a shunt, a short length of plastic tubing a little thinner
than the artery. He made two small incisions in the artery well above
and well below the region that contained the plaque and inserted the
shunt. Now he could work on the artery without stopping the flow of
blood to the brain. He made a longitudinal cut in the artery, exposing a
yellowish mass that he dissected away and removed. He sewed up the
incision, removed the shunt, and sutured the small cuts he had made to
accommodate it. "Everything still okay?" he asked Dr. L. "Yes, her EEG
is fine." Most neurosurgeons prefer to do an endarterectomy by
temporarily clamping the artery shut while they work on it. The work
goes faster, and complications are less likely. Because the blood supply
to the two hemispheres of the brain is interconnected (with special
communicating arteries), it is often possible to shut down one of the
carotid arteries for a few minutes without causing any damage. However,
sometimes the blood flow from one side of the brain to the other is
insufficient to keep the other side nourished with blood and oxygen. The
only way the surgeon can know is to have the patient's EEG monitored. If
the brain is not receiving a sufficient blood supply, the EEG will show
the presence of characteristic "slow waves." That is what happened when
Mrs. F.'s artery was clamped shut, and that is why the surgeon had to
use a shunt tube. Without it, the procedure might have caused a stroke
instead of preventing one. By the way, Mrs. F. made a good recovery.

138 Chapter 5 When electrical current flows through a conductor, it
induces a magnetic field. This means that as action potentials pass down
axons or as postsynaptic potentials pass through dendrites or sweep
across the somatic membrane of a neuron, magnetic fields are also
produced. These fields are very small, but engineers have developed
superconducting detectors (called superconducting quantum interference
devices, or SQUIDs) that can detect minute magnetic fields.
Magnetoencephalography is performed with neuromagnetometers, devices
that contain an array of several SQUIDs, oriented so that a computer can
examine their output and calculate the source of particular signals in
the brain. These devices can be used clinically---for example, to find
the sources of seizures so that they can be removed surgically. They can
also be used in experiments to measure regional brain activity that
accompanies the perception of various stimuli or the performance of
various behaviors or cognitive tasks. (See Figure 5.22.) An important
advantage of magnetoencephalography is its temporal resolution (ability
to quickly show changes in information). Another technique that you'll
read about in this chapter, functional MRI (fMRI) provides excellent
spatial resolution of regional activity in the brain, but the process is
slow and provides relatively poor temporal resolution. The image
produced by magnetoencephalography is not as detailed as an fMRI image,
but it can be acquired much more rapidly and can consequently reveal
fast-moving events.

Recording the Brain's Metabolic and Synaptic Activity LO 5.8

Compare methods for assessing metabolic and synaptic activity.

Electrical and magnetic signals are not the only signs of neural
activity. If the neural activity of a particular ­region of the brain
increases, the metabolic rate of this region increases, too, largely due
to increased operation of ion transporters in the membrane of the cells,
which requires an increased use of cellular energy. This increased
metabolic rate can be measured. The experimenter injects radioactive
2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) into the animal's bloodstream. Because this
chemical closely resembles glucose (the principal food for the brain),
it is taken into cells. This means that the most active cells, which use
glucose at the highest rate, will take up the highest concentrations of
radioactive 2-DG. But unlike normal glucose, 2-DG cannot be metabolized,
so it stays in the cell. After administering 2-DG, the experimenter
euthanizes the animal, removes the brain, slices it, and prepares it for
autoradiography. Autoradiography can be translated roughly as "writing
with one's own radiation." Sections of the brain containing the
radioactive 2-DG are mounted on microscope slides. The slides are then
developed, just like photographic film. The molecules of radioactive
2-DG show themselves as spots of silver grains in the developed images.
The most active regions of the brain contain the most radioactivity,
showing this radioactivity in the form of dark spots in the developed
images of the tissue. Figure 5.23 shows the distribution of μ opioid
receptors (described in Chapter 4) in the rat brain. The researchers
modified the autoradiography method described here, by exposing the
tissue to a radioactive ligand (the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone)
before developing the autoradiographic image. This image shows high
concentrations of opioid receptors in the white areas, including the
olfactory bulb and hippocampus. Another method of identifying active
regions of the brain capitalizes on the fact that when neurons are
activated (for example, by the terminal buttons that form synapses with
them), particular genes in the nucleus called immediate early genes are
turned on, and particular proteins are produced. These proteins then
bind with the chromosomes in the nucleus. The presence of these nuclear
proteins indicates that the neuron has just been activated. One of the
nuclear proteins produced during neural activation is called Fos. You
will remember that earlier in this chapter we began an imaginary
research project on the

rat, taken through the medial amygdala. The dark spots indicate the
presence of Fos protein, localized by means of immunocytochemistry. The

neural circuitry involved in the sexual behavior of female rats. Suppose
we want to use the Fos method in this project to see what neurons are
activated during a female rat's sexual activity. We place female rats
with males and permit the animals to copulate. After euthanizing the
animals, we remove the rats' brains, slice them, and follow a procedure
that stains Fos protein. Figure 5.24 shows the results: Neurons in the
medial amygdala of a female rat that has just mated show the presence of
dark spots, indicating the presence of Fos protein. Thus, these neurons
appear to be activated by copulatory activity---perhaps by the physical
stimulation of the genitals that occurs then. As you will recall, when
we injected a retrograde tracer (fluorogold) into the VMH, we found that
this region receives input from the medial amygdala. The metabolic
activity of specific brain regions can be measured noninvasively in a
living animal, by means of functional imaging---a computerized method of
detecting metabolic or chemical changes within the brain. The first
functional imaging method to be developed was positron emission
tomography (PET). First, a person (or another animal) receives an
injection of radioactive 2-DG. (The chemical dose is harmless to humans
and soon breaks down and leaves the cells.) The person's head is placed
in a machine similar to a CT scanner. When the radioactive molecules of
2-DG decay, they emit subatomic particles called positrons, which meet
nearby electrons. The particles annihilate each other and emit two
photons, which travel in opposite paths. Sensors arrayed around the
person's head detect these photons, and the scanner plots the locations
from

M05_CARL0287_13_GE_C05.indd 139

which these photons are being emitted. From this information, a picture
is produced of a slice of the brain, showing the activity level of
various regions in that slice. (See Figure 5.25). One of the
disadvantages of PET scanners is their operating cost. For reasons of
safety, the radioactive chemicals that are administered have very short
half-lives; that is, they decay and lose their radioactivity very
quickly. For example, the half-life of radioactive 2-DG is 110 minutes,
and the half-life of radioactive water (also used for PET scans) is only
2 minutes. Because these chemicals decay so quickly, they must be
produced on-site, in an atomic particle accelerator called a cyclotron.
The cost of PET scanning also includes the cost of the cyclotron and the
salaries of the personnel who operate it. Another disadvantage of PET
scans is the relatively poor spatial resolution (the blurriness) of the
images. The temporal resolution is also relatively poor. The positrons
being emitted from the brain must be sampled for a fairly long time,
which means that rapid, short-lived events within the brain are likely
to be missed. These disadvantages are not seen in functional MRI,
described in the next paragraph. However, PET scanners can do something
that functional MRI scanners cannot do: measure the concentration of
particular chemicals in various parts of the brain. We will describe
this procedure later in this chapter. Currently, the brain-imaging
method with the best spatial and temporal resolution is functional MRI
(fMRI). Engineers have devised modifications to existing MRI

These areas are in the speech cortex of the brain's frontal lobe. The
scan shows increased uptake of radioactive 2-DG in regions of the brain
that are active in the speech task, which indicates an increased
metabolic rate in these areas. Different computer-generated colors
indicate different rates of uptake of 2-DG, with "warmer" color
indicating increased activity.

scanners and their software that permit the devices to acquire images
that indicate regional metabolism. Brain activity is measured
indirectly, by detecting levels of oxygen in the brain's blood vessels.
Increased activity of a brain region stimulates blood flow to that
region, which increases the local blood oxygen level. The formal name of
this type of imaging is BOLD: blood oxygen level-dependent signal.
Functional MRI scans have a higher resolution than PET scans do and
reveal more detailed information about the activity of particular brain
regions. (See Figure 5.26.) You will read about many functional imaging
studies that employ fMRI in subsequent chapters of this book.

Stimulating Neural Activity LO 5.9

Compare methods of neural stimulation.

So far, this module has focused on research methods that measure the
activity of specific regions of the brain. But sometimes we may want to
artificially change the activity of these regions to see what effects
these changes have on behavior. For example, female rats will copulate
with males only if certain female sex hormones are present. If

M05_CARL0287_13_GE_C05.indd 140

we remove the rats' ovaries, the loss of these hormones will abolish the
rats' sexual behavior. We found in our earlier studies that VMH lesions
disrupt this behavior. Perhaps if we activate the VMH, we will make up
for the lack of female sex hormones, and the rats will copulate again.
How do we activate neurons? We can do so by electrical or chemical
stimulation. Electrical stimulation involves passing an electrical
current through a wire inserted into the brain using stereotaxic
surgery. Chemical stimulation is usually accomplished by injecting a
small amount of excitatory amino acid, such as kainic acid (which in
small doses stimulates neurons) or glutamic acid, into the brain. As you
learned in Chapter 4, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the
brain is glutamic acid (glutamate), and both of these substances
stimulate glutamate receptors, activating the neurons on which these
receptors are located. Injections of chemicals into the brain can be
done through an apparatus that is permanently attached to the skull so
that the animal's behavior can be observed several

times. A researcher can place a cannula (a guide cannula) in an animal's
brain using stereotaxic surgery and cement its top to the skull. A
smaller cannula of measured length can be placed inside the guide
cannula and used to inject a chemical into the brain. Because the animal
is free to move about, it is possible to observe the effects of the
injection on its behavior. (See Figure 5.27.) The principal disadvantage
of chemical stimulation is that it is slightly more complicated than
electrical stimulation because chemical stimulation requires cannulas,
tubes, special pumps or syringes, and sterile solutions of excitatory
amino acids. However, it has a distinct advantage over electrical
stimulation: It activates cell bodies but not axons. Because only cell
bodies (and their dendrites) contain glutamate receptors, we can be
assured that an injection of an excitatory amino acid into a particular
region of the brain excites the cells there but not the axons of other
neurons that happen to pass through the region. This means that the
effects of chemical stimulation are more localized than are the effects
of electrical stimulation. You might have noticed that we just said that
kainic acid, which we described earlier as a neurotoxin, can be used to
stimulate neurons. These two uses are not really contradictory. Kainic
acid produces excitotoxic lesions by stimulating neurons to death.
Whereas large doses of a concentrated solution kill neurons, small doses
of a dilute solution simply stimulate them.

141

When chemicals are injected into the brain through cannulas, molecules
of the chemicals diffuse over a region that includes many different
types of neurons: excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, interneurons
that participate in local circuits, projection neurons that communicate
with different regions of the brain, and neurons that release or respond
to a wide variety of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Stimulating
a particular brain region with electricity or an excitatory chemical
affects all of these neurons, and the result is unlikely to resemble
normal brain activity, which involves coordinated activation and
inhibition of many different neurons. Ideally, we would like to be able
to stimulate or inhibit selected populations of neurons in a given brain
region. What about the results of our hypothetical experiment? In fact
(as you will see in Chapter 10), VMH stimulation does substitute for
female sex hormones. Perhaps, then, the female sex hormones exert their
effects in this nucleus. We will see how to test this hypothesis later
in this chapter.

TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION As we saw earlier in this chapter,
neural activity induces magnetic fields that can be detected by means of
magnetoencephalography. Similarly, magnetic fields can be used to
stimulate neurons by inducing electrical currents in brain tissue.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses a coil of wires, usually
arranged in the shape of the numeral 8, to noninvasively stimulate
neurons in the cerebral cortex. The stimulating coil is placed Figure

activate neurons in the cortex. Figure 5.28 shows an electromagnetic
coil used in transcranial magnetic stimulation and its Chemical
placement on a person's head. The effects of TMS are very similar to
those of Plastic direct stimulation of the exposed brain. For example,
tubing as you will see in Chapter 6, stimulation of a particular region
of the visual association cortex will disrupt a person's ability to
detect movements in visual Guide stimuli. In addition, as we will see in
Chapters 16 cannula Dental and 17, TMS has been used to treat the
symptoms plastic of neurological and mental disorders. Depending on
Skull Brain the strength and pattern of stimulation, TMS can either
excite the region of the brain over which the coil is positioned or
interfere with its functions.

(Baker, 2011; Boyden et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2007). Photosensitive
proteins have evolved in many organisms--- even single-celled organisms
such as algae and bacteria. Researchers have discovered that one of
these proteins, Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), found in green algae,
controls ion channels that, when open, permit the flow of sodium,
potassium, and calcium ions. When blue light strikes a ChR2-ion channel,
the channel opens, and the rush of positively charged sodium and calcium
ions depolarizes the membrane, causing excitation. A second
photosensitive protein, Natronomonas pharaonis halorhodopsin (NpHR), is
found in a bacterium. This protein controls a transporter that moves
chloride into the cell when activated by yellow light. This influx of
negatively charged ions hyperpolarizes the membrane, causing inhibition.
The action of both of these photosensitive proteins

M05_CARL0287_13_GE_C05.indd 142

begins and ends very rapidly when light of the appropriate wavelength
(blue or yellow) is turned on and off. (See Figure 5.29). ChR2 and NpHR
can be introduced into neurons by attaching the genes that code for them
into the genetic material of harmless viruses. The viruses are then
injected into the brain, where they infect neurons and begin expressing
the proteins, which are inserted into the cell membrane. The genes can
be modified so that the proteins will be expressed only in particular
types of neurons. In this way, researchers can observe the effects of
turning on or off particular types of neurons in a specific region of
the brain. Because ChR2 and NpHR are activated by light, researchers
must be able to introduce light into the brain. If the neurons that
express these photosensitive proteins are located in the cerebral
cortex, a small hole can be drilled in the skull, and light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) can be attached directly above the hole. To activate
photosensitive proteins in the membranes of neurons deep within the
brain, optical fibers can be implanted by means of stereotaxic surgery,
just like electrodes or cannulas, and light can be transmitted through
these fibers. For example, Tsai and colleagues (2009) used optogenetic
methods to insert ChR2-ion channels into the membranes of dopaminergic
neurons in the ventral tegmental area of rats. The investigators found
that if these neurons were stimulated when the rats were in one of two
chambers in

a testing apparatus, the animals preferred to spend time in that
chamber. The development of optogenetic procedures has caused much
excitement among neuroscientists because they suggest ways to study the
functions of particular neural circuits in the brain. Some investigators
are also exploring possible clinical uses of photosensitive proteins.
For example, retinitis pigmentosa is a genetic disease that causes
blindness in humans. People with this disease are born with normal
vision, but they gradually become blind as the photoreceptor cells in
their retinas degenerate. The retina contains two major categories of
photoreceptors: rods, which are responsible for night vision, and cones,
which are responsible for daytime vision. The rods of people with
retinitis pigmentosa die, but although the cones lose their sensitivity
to light, their cell

bodies survive. Busskamp and colleagues (2010) used an optogenetic
method to try to reestablish vision in mice with a genetic modification
that causes them to develop retinitis pigmentosa. The investigators
targeted the animals' cones with NpHR. (Because the membranes of
photoreceptors are normally hyperpolarized by light, they chose to use
this protein.) Electrical recording and behavioral studies found that
the treatment at least partially reestablished the animals' vision.
Furthermore, the same treatment reestablished light sensitivity in
retinal tissue removed from deceased people who had been diagnosed with
retinitis pigmentosa. These findings provide hope that further research
may develop a treatment for this form of blindness. Table 5.2 summarizes
information about the research methods presented in this module.

methods for assessing metabolic and synaptic activity. Autoradiography
is a postmortem technique that involves measuring the radioactivity from
cells that have taken up radioactive 2-DG while they are metabolically
active prior to tissue collection. Staining for immediate early genes
reveals the neurons that were recently activated prior to tissue
collection. Positron emission tomography (PET) visualizes activity of
brain regions that are metabolically active in a living brain (it also
uses radioactive 2-DG). Functional MRI (fMRI) visualizes brain regions
that have increased blood flow and local blood oxygen levels in a living
brain.

Neurochemical Methods Sometimes we are most interested in the location
of neurons that possess particular types of receptors or produce
particular types of neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. We might also
want to measure the amount of these chemicals secreted by neurons in
particular brain regions during particular circumstances. The following
modules describe neurochemical methods to study the chemicals of the
nervous system.

Finding Neurons That Produce Particular Neurochemicals LO 5.10 Describe
methods to identify neurons that produce a particular neurochemical.
Suppose we learn that a particular drug affects behavior. How would we
go about discovering the neural circuits that are responsible for the
drug's effects? To answer this question, let's take a specific example.
Physicians discovered several years ago that farmworkers who had been
exposed to certain types of insecticides (the organophosphates) had
particularly intense and bizarre dreams and even reported having
hallucinations while awake. A plausible explanation for these symptoms
is that the pesticides acted as a drug that stimulates the neural
circuits involved in the control of REM sleep---the phase of sleep
during which dreaming occurs. (After all, dreams are hallucinations that
we have while sleeping.) The first question to ask relates to how the
organophosphate insecticides work. Pharmacologists have the

M05_CARL0287_13_GE_C05.indd 144

chemical into a specific brain region through a cannula. Optogenetic
methods are used to stimulate or inhibit particular types of neurons in
specific brain regions. In optogenetic methods, turning wavelengths of
light on and off allows the researcher to control the activity of the
genetically altered neurons that are light sensitive. Transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) uses a magnetic signal to stimulate or
inhibit neurons beneath the TMS device. Unlike other methods of
stimulating neural activity, TMS is noninvasive.

Thought Question Have you heard about brain-training programs or apps
that claim to activate your brain? Have you wondered if these claims are
accurate or how they could be tested? Write an email to a friend who is
curious about the research behind measuring brain activation using
braintraining programs. In your message, describe what technique you
predict the researchers used to measure brain activation in the
participants of the study. Explain why this technique would be
appropriate.

answer: These insecticides are acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors.
As you learned in Chapter 4, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are potent
acetylcholine agonists. By inhibiting AChE, the drugs prevent the rapid
destruction of ACh after it is released by terminal buttons and prolong
the postsynaptic potentials at acetylcholinergic synapses. Now that we
understand the action of the insecticides, we know that these drugs act
at acetylcholinergic synapses. What neurochemical methods should we use
to discover the sites of action of the drugs in the brain? First, let's
consider methods by which we can localize particular neurochemicals,
such as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. (In our case we are
interested in acetylcholine.) There are at least two basic ways of
localizing neurochemicals in the brain: localizing the chemicals
themselves or localizing the enzymes that produce them. Chemicals that
are peptides (or proteins) can be localized directly by means of
immunocytochemical methods, which were described earlier in this
chapter. Slices of brain tissue are exposed to an antibody for the
peptide and linked to a dye (often, a fluorescent dye). The slices are
then examined under a microscope using light of a particular wavelength.
(See Figure 5.30.) How can a researcher localize chemicals that are not
peptides? In our example, we are interested in studying acetylcholine,
which is not a peptide. Therefore, we cannot use immunocytochemical
methods to find this neurotransmitter directly. However, we can use
these methods to localize the enzyme that produces it. Enzymes are
peptides, and we can use immunocytochemical methods to localize them.
Acetylcholine is synthesized by the enzyme

was exposed to an antibody to ChAT attached to a fluorescent dye. In
fact, research using many of the methods described in this chapter
indicates that these neurons play a role in controlling REM sleep.
Returning to our example of hallucinations following pesticide exposure,
if we were to conduct an experiment to confirm the effects of continuous
organophosphate exposure on the ACh system, we might consider comparing
the brain changes in a group of rats exposed to organophosphates with a
control group that was not exposed. We could then examine the brains of
animals in these two conditions to evaluate the effects of
organophosphate exposure on the ACh system. Using immunocytochemical
techniques to investigate ChAT might reveal that organophosphate
exposure resulted in reduced ChAT in the neurons, supporting our
hypothesis that the pesticides had an effect on the ACh system. To
confirm a behavioral effect, we could have also observed the animals in
the REM sleep stage using another technique in this chapter: EEG.

almost certainly secrete ACh. Figure 5.30b shows acetylcholinergic

M05_CARL0287_13_GE_C05.indd 145

As we saw in Chapter 2, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and hormones
convey their messages to their target cells by binding with receptors on
or in these cells. The location of these receptors can be determined by
two different procedures. The first procedure to determine the location
of receptors uses autoradiography. The basic steps involved in
autoradiography to determine the location of cells that were
metabolically active (by consuming radioactive 2-DG) were presented
earlier in the chapter. In a similar procedure, autoradiography to
determine the locations of receptors requires us to expose slices of
brain tissue to a solution containing a radioactive ligand for a
particular receptor, instead of radioactive 2-DG that can be used to
identify any metabolically active cell. Next, we rinse the slices so
that the only radioactivity remaining in them is derived from molecules
of the radioactive ligand bound to their receptors. Finally, the slides
are taken into a darkroom and coated with a photographic emulsion and
developed to localize the radioactive ligand and the receptors it is
bound to. (See Figure 5.23.) Let's apply this method for localizing
receptors to the first line of investigation we considered in this
chapter: the role of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) in the sexual
behavior of female rats. So far, we have discovered that lesions of the
VMH abolish this behavior. We also saw that the behavior does not occur
if the rat's ovaries are removed but that the behavior can be activated
by stimulation of the VMH with electricity or an excitatory amino acid.
These results suggest that the sex hormones produced by the ovaries

08/11/2021 17:25

146 Chapter 5 act on neurons in the VMH. We could next use
autoradiography to look for the receptors for the sex hormone. We would
expose slices of rat brain to the radioactive hormone, rinse them, and
perform autoradiography. If we did so, we would indeed find
radioactivity in the VMH. (And if we compared slices from the brains of
female and male rats, we would find evidence of more hormone receptors
in the females' brains.) The second procedure for localizing receptors
in the brain uses another technique you have already encountered in this
chapter: immunocytochemistry. Receptors are proteins, which means that
we can produce antibodies against them. We expose slices of brain tissue
to the appropriate antibody (often labeled with a fluorescent dye) and
look at the slices with a microscope under light of a particular
wavelength. We could use this technique to learn more about the role of
sex hormones in the VMH and their involvement in female sexual behavior.
Instead of using autoradiography to identify the locations of the sex
hormone receptors, we could instead use antibodies for the receptors.
This would allow us to use immunocytochemistry, attach a dye molecule to
the antibodies, and view the labeled receptors under a microscope.
Although this approach will yield the same results as using
autoradiography to localize particular receptors, the advantages include
not needing to obtain a radioactive ligand and being able to view
individually labeled cells under a microscope.

Measuring Chemicals Secreted in the Brain LO 5.12 Compare methods used
to examine chemicals secreted in the brain. While we can use
autoradiography and immunocytochemistry to measure particular receptors
involved in female sexual behavior in the rat, this information only
tells us about structures located on the postsynaptic cells. Suppose we
are also interested in learning about what chemicals are secreted by
presynaptic cells in the VMH. To measure the amount of neurotransmitter
released in particular regions of the brain, we use a procedure called
microdialysis. Dialysis is a process in which substances are separated
by means of an artificial membrane that is permeable to some molecules
but not others. A microdialysis probe consists of a small metal tube
that introduces a solution into a section of dialysis tubing---a piece
of artificial membrane shaped in the form of a cylinder, sealed at the
bottom. Another small metal tube leads the solution away after it has
circulated through the pouch. A drawing of such a probe is shown in
Figure 5.31. We can use stereotaxic surgery to place a microdialysis
probe in a rat's brain so that the tip of the probe is located in the
region we are interested in (the VMH). We pump a

small amount of a solution similar to the extracellular fluid through
one of the small metal tubes into the dialysis tubing. The fluid
circulates through the dialysis tubing and passes through the second
metal tube, from which it is taken for analysis. As the fluid passes
through the dialysis tubing, it collects molecules from the
extracellular fluid of the brain. The molecules are then pushed across
the membrane by the force of diffusion. We analyze the contents of the
fluid that has passed through the dialysis tubing by an extremely
sensitive analytical method. This method is so sensitive that it can
detect neurotransmitters (and their breakdown products) that have been
released by the terminal buttons and have escaped from the synaptic
cleft into the rest of the extracellular fluid. We find that the cells
of the VMH release a number of different neurotransmitters, including
norepinephrine. Microdialysis reveals that norepinephrine release is
increased when females administered sex hormones subsequently displayed
sexual behavior, but was not increased when the behavior was absent
(Vathy & Etgen, 1989). In a few special cases (for example, in
monitoring brain chemicals of people with intracranial hemorrhages or
head trauma) the microdialysis procedure has been applied to study the
human brain, but ethical reasons prevent doing so for research purposes.
Fortunately, there is a noninvasive way to measure neurochemicals in the
human brain. Although PET scanners are expensive machines, they are also
versatile. They can be used to localize any radioactive substance that
emits positrons. Figure 5.32 shows PET scans of the brain of one of the
patients who developed Parkinson's disease-like symptoms after using a
synthetic

opiate in the case that opened this chapter. A stereotaxic apparatus was
used to transplant fetal dopamine-secreting neurons into his basal
ganglia. As you read, PET scans were taken of his brain before his
surgery and a little more than a year afterward. He was given an
injection of radioactive l-DOPA one hour before each scan was made. As
you learned in Chapter 4, l-DOPA is taken up by the terminals of
dopaminergic neurons, where it is converted to dopamine; thus, the
radioactivity shown in the scans indicates the presence of
dopamine-secreting terminals in the basal ganglia. The scans show the
amount of radioactivity before (part a) and after (part b) he received
the transplant. As you can see, the basal ganglia contained
substantially more dopamine after the surgery. Table 5.3 summarizes the

that are selective for a protein on the receptor of interest. The tissue
can then be examined under a microscope.

Measuring Chemicals Secreted in the Brain LO 5.12 Compare methods used
to examine chemicals secreted in the brain. First, a microdialysis probe
is placed into the brain region of interest using stereotaxic surgery. A
small amount of a solution similar to extracellular fluid is pumped into
the brain through one of the small metal tubes into the dialysis tubing.
The fluid circulates through the dialysis tubing and passes through the
second metal tube, from which it is taken for analysis. As the fluid
passes through the dialysis tubing, it collects molecules from the
extracellular fluid of the brain, which are pushed across the membrane
by the force of diffusion. A researcher can then analyze the brain
chemical contents of the fluid that has passed through the dialysis
tubing by an extremely sensitive analytical method. PET scanning is a
noninvasive method, and when a radioactive ligand is administered, can
be used to identify and quantify chemicals secreted in the living brain.

Genetic Methods All behavior is determined by interactions between an
individual's brain and his or her environment. Many behavioral
characteristics---such as talents, personality variables, and mental
disorders---seem to run in families. This suggests that genetic factors
may play a role in the development of physiological differences that are
ultimately responsible for these characteristics. In some cases, the
genetic link is very clear: A defective gene interferes with brain
development, and a neurological abnormality causes behavioral deficits.
In other cases, the links between heredity and behavior are much more
subtle, and special genetic methods must be used to reveal them.

Twin Studies LO 5.13 Describe how twin concordance rates can be used to
assess genetic contributions to a behavior. A powerful method for
estimating the influence of heredity on a particular trait is to compare
the concordance rate for this trait in pairs of monozygotic and
dizygotic twins. Monozygotic twins (identical twins) have identical
genotypes---that is, their chromosomes, and the genes they contain, are
identical. In contrast, the genetic similarity between dizygotic twins
(fraternal twins) is, on average, 50 percent. Investigators study
records to identify pairs of

Thought Question Throughout this chapter, you have read about a series
of studies intended to understand the neural mechanisms involved in
female rat sexual behavior. Many different methods, including several
neurochemical methods, were used to gather information and improve
understanding of the neural circuits underlying this behavior. Imagine
that you have been asked to submit a grant proposal for research on the
neurochemical basis of an important behavior. Write a summary of your
proposal identifying: A. an important behavior (you can select any
behavior, relevant to humans or other animals); B. a potential
neurochemical (for example, this could be a neurotransmitter or
hormone); C. a method you could use to identify neurons that produce the
chemical; and D. a method you could use to identify where the receptors
for the chemical are located.

twins in which at least one member has the trait---for example, a
diagnosis of a particular mental disorder. If both twins have been
diagnosed with this disorder, they are said to be concordant. If only
one has received this diagnosis, the twins are said to be discordant. If
a disorder has a strong genetic basis, the percentage of monozygotic
twins who are concordant for the diagnosis will be higher than that for
dizygotic twins. For example, as we will see in Chapter 17, the
concordance rate for schizophrenia in twins is at least four times
higher for monozygotic twins than for dizygotic twins, a finding that
provides strong evidence for a genetic component in the development of
schizophrenia. Twin studies have found that many individual
characteristics, including personality traits, prevalence of obesity,
incidence of alcohol abuse, and a wide variety of mental disorders, are
influenced by genetic factors.

Adoption Studies LO 5.14 Evaluate the role of adoption studies in
assessing genetic contributions to a behavior. Another method for
estimating the heritability of a particular behavioral trait is to
compare people who were adopted early in life with their biological and
adoptive family members. All behavioral traits are affected to some
degree by hereditary factors, environmental factors, and an interaction
between these factors. Environmental factors are physical, social, and
biological in nature.

08/11/2021 17:25

Methods and Strategies of Research

For example, the mother's health, nutrition, and drugtaking behavior
during pregnancy are prenatal environmental factors, and the child's
diet, medical care, and social environment (both inside and outside the
home) are postnatal environmental factors. If a child is adopted soon
after birth, the genetic factors will be associated with the biological
parents, the prenatal environmental factors will be associated with the
biological mother, and most of the postnatal environmental factors will
be associated with the adoptive family. Adoption studies require that
the investigator knows the identity of the parents of the people being
studied and is able to measure the behavioral trait in the biological
and adoptive parents. If the people being studied strongly resemble
their biological parents, we conclude that the trait is probably
influenced by genetic factors. If, instead, the people resemble their
adoptive families, we conclude that the trait is influenced by
environmental factors. Remember that both hereditary and environmental
factors are involved in the expression of a given behavior, and the
people being studied will resemble both their biological and adoptive
families to some degree. In the laboratory, researchers can model
adoption studies in rodents using cross-fostering methods. In
cross-fostering, newborn pups or litters are exchanged between mothers,
and the behavior and physiology of the fostered pups can be studied.
This approach has been used to assess the genetic, prenatal, and
postnatal environmental contributions to a wide variety of behaviors.
When the genetic background of the mice is known (as in many established
mouse strains), researchers are able to obtain more specific information
about genetic and environmental factors involved in complex behaviors.
Cross-fostering can also be used to better understand epigenetic changes
related to behavior (for extensive review, see McCarty, 2017).

Genomic Studies LO 5.15 Identify genomic techniques used to study
physical and behavioral traits. The human genome consists of the DNA
that encodes our genetic information. Because of the accumulation of
mutations over past generations of our species, no two people, with the
exception of monozygotic twins, have identical genetic information. The
particular form of an individual gene is called an allele. For example,
different alleles of the gene responsible for the production of iris
pigment in the eye produce pigments with different colors. Genomic
studies attempt to determine the location in the genome of genes
responsible for various physical and behavioral traits. Linkage studies
identify families whose members vary with respect to a particular
trait---for example, the

M05_CARL0287_13_GE_C05.indd 149

149

presence or absence of a particular hereditary disease. A variety of
markers, sequences of DNA whose locations are already known, are
compared with the nature of an individual person's trait. For example,
the gene responsible for Huntington's disease, a neurological disorder
discussed, was found to be located near a known marker on chromosome 4.
Researchers studied people in an extended family in Venezuela that
contained many members with Huntington's disease and found that the
presence or absence of the disease correlated with the presence or
absence of the marker. Similarly, genomewide association studies have
been made possible by the development of methods to obtain the DNA
sequence of the entire human genome. These studies permit researchers to
compare all or portions of the genomes of different individuals to
determine whether differences in the people's genomes correlate with the
presence or absence of diseases (or other traits). As we will see in
Chapter 17, these studies are beginning to reveal the location of genes
that control characteristics that contribute to the development of
various mental disorders.

Targeted Mutations LO 5.16 Summarize how targeted mutations can be used
to study genetic contributions to a behavior. Targeted mutations are
mutated genes produced in the laboratory and inserted into the
chromosomes of animals, typically mice. In some cases, the genes (also
called knockout genes) are defective: These genes fail to produce a
functional protein. In many cases, the target of the mutation is an
enzyme that controls a particular chemical reaction. In other cases, the
genes (also called knockin genes) produce a new functional protein to
replace a missing protein, or make increased amounts of a protein. For
example, lack of a particular enzyme interferes with learning. (See
Chapter 13.) This result suggests that the enzyme is partly responsible
for changes in the structure of synapses required for learning to occur.
In other cases, the target of the mutation is a protein that itself
serves useful functions in the cell. For example, a particular type of
cannabinoid receptor is involved in the reinforcing and analgesic
effects of opiates. (See Chapter 19.) Researchers can even produce
conditional knockouts that cause the animal to stop expressing a
particular gene when the animal is given a particular drug. This permits
the targeted gene to express itself normally during the animal's
development and then be knocked out (inactivated) at a later time.
Investigators can also use methods of genetic engineering to insert new
genes into the DNA of mice. These genes can increase production of
proteins normally found in the host species, or they can produce
entirely new proteins.

Antisense Oligonucleotides

CRISPR-Cas Methods

LO 5.17 Describe how antisense oligonucleotides function to change
behavior.

LO 5.18 Summarize the uses of CRISPR-Cas methods in neuroscience
research.

Another genetic method involves molecules that block the production of
proteins encoded by particular genes by injecting antisense
oligonucleotides. The most common types of antisense oligonucleotides
are modified strands of RNA or DNA that will bind with specific
molecules of messenger RNA and prevent them from producing their
protein. Once the molecules of mRNA are trapped in this way, they are
destroyed by enzymes present in the cell. (See Figure 5.33.) The term
antisense refers to the fact that the synthetic oligonucleotides contain
a sequence of bases complementary to those contained by a particular
gene or molecule of mRNA. What role does this method have in helping us
to understand behavior? Destroying proteins in this way can produce
changes in behavior, highlighting the importance of intracellular
proteins in behavior. For example, injecting antisense oligonucleotides
that destroy receptors for sex hormones in the VMH of female rats
inhibited female sexual behavior (Mani et al., 1994; Pollio et al.,
1993). This method can be used to confirm the importance of sex hormones
in the VMH in contributing to female sexual behavior in rats. The
results obtained using this technique complement the results of using
other methods highlighted throughout this chapter.

All of the proteins used in the nervous system have their origins in
DNA. Proteins contribute to all functions of the nervous system. To make
proteins, cells rely on genetic information contained in DNA, which is
used as a recipe for synthesizing specific proteins. A set of techniques
can be used to help neuroscientists both understand and modify sections
of DNA that code for specific proteins. Similar to using antisense
oligonucleotides, CRISPRCas (or clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeat) methods alter the production of proteins; however,
this technique involves changes to the DNA instead of the mRNA. To
create changes in the DNA of a cell, CRISPR uses a Cas protein to
identify target sites in the double strand of DNA and break both strands
at that site. Once the strands are broken, cells use one of two
different pathways to repair the DNA damage: non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) or homology-directed recombination (HDR). If the cell uses NHEJ
pathways, the result is to mutate or delete the targeted genetic
sequence. This inactivates the gene, creating a gene knockout. If the
cell uses HDR, a new genetic sequence can be inserted into the cut
strands of DNA. Researchers can develop these replacement sequences and
introduce them into the cell, precisely controlling the change in the
genetic sequence. (See Figure 5.34.)

CRISPR-Cas methods have been used to study the role of genes in behavior
in a number of different species used in neuroscience research, ranging
from invertebrates to primates. The technique has been used to model
neurodegenerative diseases that are caused (at least in part) by genetic
mutations, including Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's
diseases. Some research has begun to explore the possibility of using
this technique to generate

personalized interventions for brain diseases with genetic bases
(Heidenreich & Zhang, 2016). Future applications of this technique could
include reprogramming undifferentiated cells to be used to treat
neurodegenerative disease or model the kinds of environment-dependent
gene expression seen in epigenetics (Savell & Day, 2017). Table 5.4

phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). The majority (about 75 percent) of people
perceive this harmless chemical as bitter-tasting and respond to it with
avoidance and negative facial reactions. A minority of people perceive
PTC as tasteless and show no behavioral response. The gene for the PTC

Mrs. W, an 86-year-old lady, had been blind for the past two years. Her
trouble with vision started many years ago when colours did not appear
to her as bright as they used to be. Then she could not see objects in
the centre properly, while everything else appeared blurred and
distorted. Mrs. W's eyesight further deteriorated and eventually, she
was unable to see anything. Doctors diagnosed her with macular
degeneration, one of the most common age-related eye conditions.
However, despite her blindness and senior age, Mrs. W was actively
engaged in her day-to-day family life. Everything was going well for
Mrs. W until recently when she started "seeing" things. At first, her
family thought she was not being serious---how can a blind person
possibly see anything? But then she described what she had been
seeing---­distorted human faces, birds transforming into hats, pigeons
with human faces, and a persistent fluctuating pilaster. She further
said that all these visual transformations were completely silent and
felt "more like watching a silent movie." Mrs. W ­admitted that when she
had first experienced these hallucinations, she had not told anyone
fearing her family might interpret it as a sign of madness. Mrs W's
family immediately rushed her to the doctor, who found that her memory
and other cognitive skills were excellent for her age and she did not
show any signs of a psychiatric

condition. The doctor seemed puzzled at first but then concluded that
Mrs. W had a condition called the Charles ­Bonnet syndrome. One in ten
visually impaired people experience such visual hallucinations at some
point. Hallucinations in such ­p atients are usually complex, contain
elaborate details, and can last from a few seconds to a few hours.
Unlike individuals with psychiatric conditions, Charles Bonnet syndrome
patients understand that the visions they experience are not real. But
what is the explanation for this? As you know, we see not only with our
eyes but also with our brain, which translates electric signals into
images we see. It appears that sometimes the brain is able to dissociate
this process and mimic perception. In this chapter, you will read about
the main areas of the brain that are involved in visual processing,
including specific cortical regions dedicated to distinct visual
representations. In case of Charles Bonnet syndrome, these cortical
regions show increased activity due to reduced visual input as
demonstrated by ­n umerous fMRI studies. One such region, fusiform gyrus,
is involved in face recognition and its high activity produces
hallucinations that involve human faces. Other neurological conditions
caused by a lesion in this cortical area also lead to hallucinations.
Such patients are unable to recognize

Vision 155

This case study illustrates several important ideas from this chapter,
including the roles the eyes and various brain regions play in vision
and types of blindness, such as object agnosia and prosopagnosia. As we
saw in Chapter 3, the brain performs two major functions: It controls
the movements of the muscles, producing useful behaviors, and it
regulates the body's internal environment. To perform both these tasks,
the brain must be informed about what is happening both in the external
environment and within the body. Such information is received by the
sensory systems. The next chapter considers the sensory modalities of
audition, the vestibular senses, the somatosenses, gustation (taste),
and olfaction (smell). This chapter, however, is exclusively dedicated
to vision, the sensory modality that receives a great deal of attention
from neuroscientists, psychologists, anatomists, and physiologists. One
reason for this attention derives from the fascinating complexity of the
sensory organs of vision and the relatively large proportion of the
human brain that is devoted to the analysis of visual information. A
large portion of the human cerebral cortex plays a direct role in the
analysis of visual information (Wandell et al., 2007). The first section
of this chapter is dedicated to the structure and functions of the eye
itself. The second section examines the brain regions involved in
vision. The remaining sections focus on the perception of color, form,
spatial location, and movement.

The Eye In this module, we will explore the role of the eye in vision.
The module begins with an introduction to sensation and perception,
which is relevant to both this chapter and the following chapter. Next,
it includes a discussion of the stimulus detected by the eye: light.
Then, we will explore the anatomy of the eye and the role of the
photoreceptors in the process of transduction, as well as central and
peripheral vision. Finally, the module concludes with a description of
the role of the optic nerves and provides a general overview of the
visual pathway that will be examined in greater depth through the rest
of the chapter.

Introduction to Sensation and Perception LO 6.1

Differentiate sensation and perception.

Look carefully at Figure 6.1. What do you see? Do you see an image in
color? Does it look the same in dim and bright light? Do you see shapes
in the image? Do you see parts of the image in three dimensions? Can you
identify what is in the image and where it is in space? Is the image
still or moving? What parts of your nervous system allow you to
understand the picture in terms of these elements of color, shape, and
dimension? The experience of vision requires both sensation and
perception. Sensation involves the cells of the nervous system that are
specialized to detect stimuli from the environment. These stimuli occur
in specific forms of energy (such as light, sound, or heat), and the
neurons that detect this energy transform it into action potentials that
get sent through the nervous system. Perception is the conscious
experience and interpretation of information from the senses and
involves neurons in the central nervous system. Chapters 6 and 7 include
specific examples of sensation and perception. To make it easier to see
similarities among the different senses (and their perception), these
chapters will follow similar organizational structures. For each sense,
we will begin with a discussion of the appropriate stimulus (in

processing provide an insight into the complexity of the neurophysiology

156 Chapter 6 this chapter, light) and the physical organ that detects
it (in this chapter, the eye). This is followed by information about the
brain regions that are involved in processing sensory information.
Finally, each chapter concludes with a discussion of how the nervous
system perceives sensory information (for example, light and dark,
color, form, spatial location, orientation, and movement of visual
stimuli).

The Stimulus: Light LO 6.2

Describe three perceptual dimensions of light.

Photoreceptors in the eye detect the presence of light stimuli. For
humans, visible light is a narrow band of the spectrum of
electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength
of between 380 and 760 nm (a nanometer, nm, is one-billionth of a meter)
is visible to us. (See Figure 6.2.) Other animals can detect different
ranges of electromagnetic radiation. For example, honeybees can detect
differences in ultraviolet radiation reflected by flowers that appear
white to us. The range of wavelengths we call light is simply the part
of the continuum that we humans can detect. Three dimensions determine
the perceived color of light: hue, saturation, and brightness. Light
travels at a constant speed of approximately 300,000 kilometers (186,000
miles) per second. This means that if the frequency of oscillation of
the wave varies, the distance between the peaks of the waves will vary
similarly but in inverse fashion. Slower oscillations lead to longer
wavelengths, and faster ones lead to shorter wavelengths. Wavelength
determines the first of the three perceptual dimensions of light: hue.
The visible spectrum contains the range of hues that our eyes can
detect. Light can also vary in intensity, which corresponds to the
second perceptual dimension of light: brightness. If the intensity of
the electromagnetic radiation is increased, the apparent brightness
increases, too. The third dimension, saturation, refers to the relative
purity of the light that is being perceived. If all the radiation is of
one wavelength, the perceived color is pure, or fully saturated.
Conversely, if the radiation contains all visible wavelengths, it
produces no sensation of hue---it appears white. Colors with
intermediate amounts of saturation consist of different mixtures of
wavelengths.

Finally, the appearance of the colors of objects remains much the same
whether we observe them under artificial light, under an overcast sky,
or at noon on a cloudless day. This phenomenon is known as color
constancy. Our visual system does not simply respond according to the
wavelength of the light reflected by objects. Instead, it compensates
for the source of the light. If the scene contains a particularly high
level of long-wavelength light (as it would if an object were
illuminated by the light of a setting sun), then some long-wavelength
light is "subtracted out" of the perception of each point in the scene.
This compensation helps us to see what is actually out there.

Anatomy of the Eye LO 6.3

Organize the structures and functions of the eye involved in visual
processing.

We receive information about the environment from sensory
receptors---specialized neurons that detect a variety of physical
events. (See Figure 6.3.) Be careful not to confuse sensory receptors
with receptors for neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and hormones.
Sensory receptors are specialized neurons, and the other types of
receptors are made of specialized proteins that bind with certain
molecules. Stimuli that are detected by sensory receptors alter the
membrane potentials of the cells. This process is known as sensory
transduction because sensory events are transduced ("transferred") into
changes in the cells' membrane potential. These electrical changes are
called receptor potentials. Unlike many other types of neurons, most
sensory receptors lack axons. Instead, a portion of their somatic
membrane forms synapses with the dendrites of other neurons. Receptor
potentials affect the release of neurotransmitters and can modify the
pattern of firing in neurons with which these cells form synapses. For
an individual to see, an image must be focused on the retina, the inner
lining of the eye. (See Figure 6.4.) This image causes changes in the
electrical activity of millions of sensory receptors in the retina,
which results in messages being sent through the optic nerves to the
rest of the brain. The retina is part of the brain. This means that the
retina and the optic nerve are in the central---not peripheral---nervous
system.

The bones and muscles surrounding the eye aid in focusing an image on
the retina. Knowledge of the bones, muscles, and physical structure of
the eye is important to understanding how stimuli are received and
transduced into neural signals. The eyes are suspended in the orbits,
bony pockets in the front of the skull. The eyes are held in place and
moved by six extraocular muscles attached to the tough, white outer coat
of the eye called the sclera. Normally, we cannot look behind our
eyeballs and see these muscles because the conjunctiva hides their
attachments to the eyes. These mucous membranes line the eyelid and fold
back to attach to the eye (preventing a contact lens that has slipped
off the

cornea from "falling behind the eye"). Figure 6.4 illustrates the
anatomy of the eye. The white outer layer of most of the eye, the
sclera, is opaque and does not permit entry of light into the eye.
However, the cornea, the outer layer at the front of the eye, is
transparent. The amount of light that enters is regulated by the size of
the pupil, which is an opening in the iris, the pigmented ring of
muscles behind the cornea. The lens, situated immediately behind the
iris, consists of a series of transparent, onionlike layers. The shape
of the lens can be altered by the contraction of the ciliary muscles.
These changes in shape permit the eye to focus images of near or distant
objects on the retina---a process called accommodation.

After passing through the lens, light traverses the main part of the
eye, which is filled with vitreous humor, a clear, gelatinous substance.
After passing through the vitreous humor, light falls on the retina.
Receptor cells called rods and cones (named for their shapes),
collectively known as photoreceptors, are located in the retina. The
human retina contains three main cellular layers: the photoreceptive
layer, the bipolar cell layer, and the ganglion cell layer. Note that
the photoreceptors are at the back of the retina and light must pass
through the overlying layers to get to them. Fortunately, these layers
are transparent. The roles of cells in the bipolar and ganglion cell
layers will be described later in this section. (See Figure 6.5.)

information about our environment. In particular, they are responsible
for our daytime vision. They provide us with information about small
features in the environment and are the source of vision of the highest
sharpness, or acuity. The fovea, or central region of the retina, which
mediates our most acute vision, contains only cones. Cones are also
responsible for color vision---our ability to discriminate light of
different wavelengths. Although rods do not detect different colors and
provide vision of poor acuity, they are more sensitive to light. In a
very dimly lighted environment, we use our rod vision. In very dim light
we are colorblind and lack foveal vision. (See Table 6.1.) The optic
disk is located at the back of the eye, where the axons conveying visual
information gather together and leave the eye through the optic nerve.
The optic disk produces a blind spot because no receptors are located
there. We do not normally perceive our blind spots, but their presence
can be demonstrated. If you have not found yours, you may want to try
the exercise described in Figure 6.6. The photoreceptors form synapses
with bipolar cells, neurons whose two arms connect the shallowest and
deepest layers of the retina. In turn, bipolar cells form synapses with
the ganglion cells, neurons whose axons travel through the optic nerves
(the second cranial nerves) and carry visual information into the rest
of the brain. In addition, the retina contains horizontal cells and

Transduction LO 6.5

Summarize the process of transduction.

Sensory transduction occurs in the photoreceptors and allows light to be
converted into a change in membrane potential. Remember that changes in
membrane potential can be excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory
(hyperpolarizing). The first step in this chain of events that
eventually leads to visual perception involves a special chemical called
a photopigment. Photopigments are embedded in the lamellae---thin plates
of a membrane that make up the outer segment of photoreceptors. Each
photoreceptor consists of an outer segment connected by a cilium to the
inner segment, which contains the cell nucleus. A single human rod
contains approximately 10 million photopigment molecules. The molecules
consist of two parts: an opsin (a protein) and retinal (a lipid). There
are several forms of opsin; for example, the photopigment of human rods,
rhodopsin, consists of rod opsin plus retinal. Retinal is synthesized
from vitamin A, which explains why carrots, which are rich in this
vitamin, are said to be good for your eyesight. In some cases of vitamin
A deficiency, supplementing with this vitamin can improve some aspects
of rod-based vision (Whatham et al., 2008). ROLE OF HYPERPOLARIZATION IN
TRANSDUCTION

Photopigments transduce light energy into changes in membrane potential.
When a molecule of rhodopsin is

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 159

exposed to light, it breaks into its two constituents: rod opsin and
retinal. In vertebrates, splitting the ­photopigment triggers a cascade
of intracellular events that hyperpolarize the photoreceptor membrane.
Most other types of sensory receptors (such as hair cells in the ear for
audition) become depolarized by stimuli. One way to understand
transduction in the visual system is to think about the photoreceptors
as "darkness detectors." When the receptors experience darkness, they
respond by depolarizing. When they experience light, they respond by
hyperpolarizing. For a review of hyperpolarization and depolarization,
see Chapter 2. In the vertebrate retina, photoreceptors provide input to
both bipolar cells and horizontal cells in a circuit. Photoreceptors and
bipolar cells do not produce action potentials. Instead, their release
of neurotransmitter (glutamate) is regulated by their membrane
potential. Depolarizations increase the release of neurotransmitter, and
hyperpolarizations decrease it. In the dark, photoreceptors are
depolarized and constantly release glutamate into synapses with bipolar
cells. In the light, photoreceptors are hyperpolarized, and less
glutamate is released into synapses with bipolar cells. (See Figure
6.8.) Bipolar cells have two different responses to the presence of
glutamate. ON center bipolar cells are hyperpolarized by glutamate,
while OFF center bipolar cells are depolarized. The ON and OFF center
bipolar cells then synapse with ganglion cells and influence their rate
of firing. Light shining on the photoreceptor can produce a variety of
responses from bipolar and ganglion cells as the transduced message
begins to make its way out of the retina and to the brain for additional
visual processing.

Light striking a photoreceptor produces a hyperpolarization, so the
photoreceptor releases less neurotransmitter. Because the
neurotransmitter normally hyperpolarizes the membrane of the bipolar
cell, the reduction causes a depolarization. This depolarization causes
the bipolar cell to release more neurotransmitter, which excites the
ganglion cell.

Ganglion cells in the fovea receive input from a smaller number of
photoreceptors than those in the periphery and provide more acute visual
information. Photoreceptor Layer

Central and Peripheral Vision LO 6.6

Compare features of the eye involved in central and peripheral vision.

The receptive field of a neuron in the visual system is the part of the
visual field that an individual neuron "sees"--- that is, the place in
which a visual stimulus must be located to produce a response in that
neuron. The location of the receptive field of a particular neuron
depends on the location of the photoreceptors that provide it with
visual information. If a neuron receives information from photoreceptors
located in the fovea, its receptive field will be at the fixation
point---the point at which the eye is looking. If the neuron receives
information from photoreceptors located in the periphery of the retina,
its receptive field will be located off to one side. At the periphery of
the retina many individual receptors converge on a single ganglion cell,
bringing information from a relatively large area of the retina---and
hence a relatively large area of the visual field. However, the fovea
contains approximately equal numbers of ganglion cells and cones. These
receptor-to-axon

relationships explain the fact that our foveal (central) vision is very
acute but our peripheral vision is much less precise. (See Figure 6.9.)
TYPES OF EYE MOVEMENTS To keep stimuli from the environment projecting
to the retina, particularly the fovea, the eyes make three types of
movements: vergence movements, saccadic movements, and pursuit
movements. Vergence movements are cooperative movements that keep both
eyes fixed on the same target---or, more precisely, that keep the image
of the target object on corresponding parts of the two retinas. If you
hold up a finger in front of your face, look at it, and then bring your
finger closer to your face, your eyes will make vergence movements
toward your nose. If you then look at an object on the other side of the
room, your eyes will rotate outward, and you will see two separate
blurry images of your finger. When you scan the scene in front of you,
your gaze does not roam slowly and steadily across its features.
Instead, your eyes make jerky saccadic movements---you shift your gaze
abruptly from one point to another. When you read a line in this book,
your eyes stop several times, moving very quickly between each stop. You
cannot consciously control the speed of movement between stops; during
each saccade the eyes move as fast as they can. Only by performing a
pursuit movement---say, by looking at your finger while you move it
around---can you make your eyes move more slowly.

Figure 6.10 The Visual Pathway The visual pathway begins with
photoreceptors in the retina, which send information to the LGN through

visual cortex.

Overview of the Visual Pathway LO 6.7

Describe the components of the visual pathway.

From the eye, visual information is sent to the brain for additional
processing. The journey of information from light detection in the
retina to the experience of complex visual scenes occurs along the
visual pathway. At the back of each eye, axons of the retinal ganglion
cells bundle together to form the optic nerve. The optic nerves join
together at the base of the brain to form the X-shaped optic chiasm.
There, axons from ganglion cells serving the inner halves of the retina
(the nasal sides) cross through the chiasm and ascend to a portion of
the thalamus called the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) on the
opposite side of the brain. The axons from the outer halves of the
retina (the temporal sides) remain on the same side of the brain. The
lens inverts the image of the world projected on the retina (and
similarly reverses left and right). Therefore, because the axons from
the nasal halves of the retinas cross to the other side of the brain,
each hemisphere receives information from the contralateral half
(opposite side) of the visual scene. That is, if a person looks straight
ahead, the right hemisphere receives information from the left half of
the visual field, and the left hemisphere receives information from the
right. It is not correct to say that each hemisphere receives visual
information solely from the contralateral eye. The neurons in the LGN
send their axons through optic radiations to the primary visual cortex,
or V1 (the first cortical area devoted to vision), in the occipital
lobe. The primary visual cortex is also called the striate cortex
because it contains a dark-staining layer (striation) of cells. From the
primary visual cortex, visual information is sent to a number of areas
in the visual association cortex, or V2. V2 (the second cortical area
for vision processing) is also known

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 161

Striate cortex

as the extrastriate cortex because this region surrounds the striate
cortex. Information about more complex aspects of visual processing may
also travel on to additional cortical areas, such as V4 or V5. This
visual pathway, from eyes to thalamus to cortex, provides organization
for the rest of the information in the chapter. (See Figure 6.10.)

Other Retinal Pathways LO 6.8

List functions of other retinal pathways.

Fibers from the retina also make up several other pathways related to
vision. Many of these pathways are involved in unconscious functions you
might not have considered part of vision. For example, one pathway to
the hypothalamus synchronizes an animal's activity cycles to the 24-hour
rhythms of day and night. (We will study this system in Chapter 9.)
Other pathways coordinate eye movements, control the muscles of the iris
(to control the size of the pupil) and the ciliary muscles (which
control the lens) and help to direct our attention to sudden movements
in the periphery of our visual field. Blindsight is a phenomenon in
which cortical regions involved in conscious visual perception are
damaged, but other visual pathways that are not involved in conscious
perception are intact. The case of Mr. J. illustrates the symptoms of
blindsight.

Natalie J. had brought her grandfather to see Dr. M., a
neuropsychologist. Mr. J.'s stroke had left him almost completely blind;
all he could see was a tiny spot in the middle of his visual field.
Dr. M. had learned about Mr. J.'s condition from his neurologist and had
asked Mr. J. to come to his laboratory so that he could do some tests
for his research project.

24/11/21 1:20 PM

162 Chapter 6 Dr. M. helped Mr. J. find a chair and sit down. Mr. J.,
who walked with the aid of a cane, gave it to his granddaughter to hold
for him. "May I borrow that?" asked Dr. M. Natalie nodded and handed the
cane to Dr. M. "The phenomenon I'm studying is called blindsight," he
said. "Let me see if I can show you what it is. Mr. J., please look
straight ahead. Keep looking that way, and don't move your eyes or turn
your head. I know that you can see a little bit straight ahead of you,
and I don't want you to use that piece of vision for what I'm going to
ask you to do. Now, I'd like you to reach out with your right hand and
point to what I'm holding." "But I don't see anything---I'm blind!" said
Mr. J., obviously exasperated. "I know, but please try, anyway." Mr. J.
shrugged his shoulders and pointed. He looked startled when his finger
encountered the end of the cane, which Dr. M. was holding toward him.
"Gramps, how did you do that?" asked Natalie, amazed. "I thought you
were blind." "I am!" he said, emphatically. "It was just luck."

"Let's try it just a couple more times, Mr. J.," said Dr. M. "Keep
looking straight ahead." He reversed the cane, so that the handle was
pointing toward Mr. J. "Now I'd like you to grab hold of the cane."
Mr. J. reached out with an open hand and grabbed hold of the cane.
"Good. Now put your hand down, please." Dr. M. then rotated the cane 90
degrees, so that the handle was oriented vertically. "Now reach for it
again." Mr. J. did so. As his arm came up, he turned his wrist so that
his hand matched the orientation of the handle, which he grabbed hold of
again. "Good. Thank you, you can put your hand down." Dr. M. turned to
Natalie. "I'd like to test your grandfather now, but I'll be glad to
talk with you later." As Dr. M. explained to Natalie afterward, the
human brain contains not one but several mechanisms involved in vision.
Mr. J.'s stroke had damaged the cortical visual system. Cases like his
show that after this system is damaged, people can still use unconscious
visual pathways to guide hand movements toward an object even though
they cannot see what they are reaching for.

Module Review: The Eye Introduction to Sensation and Perception LO 6.1
Differentiate sensation and perception. Sensation involves the cells of
the nervous system that are specialized to detect stimuli from the
environment. Perception is the conscious experience and interpretation
of information from the senses and involves neurons in the central
nervous system.

The Stimulus: Light LO 6.2 Describe three perceptual dimensions of
light. Visible light includes the portion of the spectrum that is
detected by the photoreceptors of an organism. Hue is determined by the
wavelength of light. Brightness is determined by the intensity of light.
Saturation is determined by the relative purity of light being perceived
(containing one or more different wavelengths). In addition, color
constancy describes the relatively constant appearance of objects viewed
under varying light conditions.

Anatomy of the Eye LO 6.3 Organize the structures and functions of the
eye involved in visual processing. The bones and muscles surrounding the
eye aid in focusing an image on the retina. The pupil regulates the
amount of light entering the eye. The lens is responsible

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 162

for accommodation. The retina of the eye contains the photoreceptors
(rods and cones), which detect light and transduce it into receptor
potentials.

Photoreceptors LO 6.4 Contrast the location and function of rods and
cones. Rods are located throughout the retina, except in the fovea. They
are sensitive to low-intensity light but do not contribute to color or
high-acuity vision. Cones are prevalent in the central retina, including
the fovea, and are responsible for color vision and acuity.

Transduction LO 6.5 Summarize the process of transduction. Transduction
converts light into a change in membrane potential of photoreceptors.
When a molecule of p ­ hotopigment is exposed to light, it breaks into
its two constituents. In vertebrates, splitting the photopigment
triggers a cascade of intracellular events that hyperpolarize the
photoreceptor membrane. In the dark, ­photoreceptors are depolarized and
constantly release glutamate into synapses with bipolar cells. In the
light, photoreceptors are hyperpolarized, and less glutamate is released
into synapses with bipolar cells. ON and OFF center bipolar cells then
relay this information to retinal ganglion cells, and the information
proceeds to the brain.

Central and Peripheral Vision LO 6.6 Compare features of the eye
involved in central and peripheral vision. In central vision, the fovea
contains approximately equal numbers of ganglion cells and cones. These
receptor-toaxon relationships explain why central vision is very acute
but peripheral vision is much less precise. In peripheral vision, many
individual receptors from the periphery of the retina converge on a
single ganglion cell. This arrangement provides information from a
relatively large area of the retina and visual field and generates a
receptive field located off to one side. The receptive field of neurons
involved in central vision is at a fixation point. To keep stimuli from
the environment projecting to the retina, particularly the fovea, the
eyes make three types of movements: vergence movements, saccadic
movements, and pursuit movements.

visual pathway.

through the optic nerves to the LGN in the thalamus. Axons from ganglion
cells serving the inner halves of the retina (the nasal sides) cross
through the chiasm and ascend to the LGN on the opposite side of the
brain. The axons from the outer halves of the retina (the temporal
sides) remain on the same side of the brain. The neurons in the LGN send
their axons through optic radiations to the striate cortex. From the
striate cortex, visual information is sent to the extrastriate cortex.

Other Retinal Pathways LO 6.8 List functions of other retinal pathways.
Additional pathways arising from the retina are involved in unconscious
processes related to vision, such as synchronizing behavior to cycles of
day and night, coordinating eye movements and directing attention. Cases
of blindsight also reveal that unconscious visual processing can guide
more complex behaviors such as reaching or grasping.

Thought Question

The visual pathway begins in the photoreceptors of the retina, which
synapse with bipolar and retinal ganglion cells. The axons of the
retinal ganglion cells then send visual information to the rest of the
brain by ascending

People who try to see faint, distant lights, or stars at night are often
advised to look just to the side of the location where they expect to
see the lights. Is this good advice? Explain the rationale for why this
advice is helpful (or not helpful).

Brain Regions Involved in Visual Processing

of the magnocellular and parvocellular layers. As we will see later in
this chapter, these three sets of layers belong to different systems,
which are responsible for the analysis of different types of visual
information. (See Figure 6.11.)

After leaving the eye, visual information is sequentially processed by
several brain regions, beginning in the LGN of the thalamus, followed by
the striate cortex, and finally by the extrastriate cortex. The
following section will describe the structures and functions of the LGN,
striate cortex, and extrastriate cortex in more detail.

Lateral Geniculate Nucleus LO 6.9

Describe the structure of the lateral geniculate nucleus.

The LGN contains six layers of neurons. Each layer receives information
from the retinal ganglion cells in the optic nerve of only one eye in a
semialternating fashion. Layers 1, 4, and 6 receive input from the
contralateral (or opposite) eye, and layers 2, 3, and 5 receive input
from the ipsilateral eye. The neurons in the two inner layers of the LGN
contain cell bodies that are larger than those in the outer four layers.
The inner two layers are called the magnocellular layers, and the outer
four layers containing smaller cell bodies are called the parvocellular
layers. The third set of neurons in the koniocellular sublayers are
found below each

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 163

Striate Cortex LO 6.10 Identify the functions and organization of the
striate cortex. The striate cortex (V1), receives input directly from
the LGN and is the first cortical region involved in combining visual
information from several sources. The studies of Nobel Prize winners
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel at Harvard University during the 1960s
began a revolution in the study of the physiology of visual perception
(see Hubel & Wiesel, 1977, 1979). Hubel and Wiesel discovered that
neurons in the visual cortex did not simply respond to spots of light.
Instead, they selectively responded to specific features (or contours)
of the visual world. This means that the neural circuitry within the
visual cortex combines information from several sources (for example,
from axons carrying information received from several different ganglion
cells via the LGN) to detect features that are larger than the receptive
field of a single ganglion cell or a single cell in the LGN. FUNCTIONS

The retinal ganglion cells encode information about the relative amounts
of light falling on the center and surround regions of their receptive
fields and, in many cases, about the wavelength of that light. The
striate cortex performs additional processing of this information, which
it then transmits to the extrastriate cortex. ORGANIZATION The striate
cortex is a highly organized

structure. It contains neurons arranged in layers, modules, and groups
called cytochrome oxidase blobs. These organizational divisions will be
described in the following paragraphs. Layers Similar to the LGN, the
striate cortex consists of six layers arranged in bands parallel to the
surface. The fourth layer is further subdivided into sublayers 4A, 4B,
4Ca, and 4Cb. These layers contain the nuclei of cell bodies and
dendritic trees that show up as bands of light or dark in sections of
tissue that have been dyed with a cell-body stain. (See Figure 6.12.)
Input from the parvocellular, koniocellular, and magnocellular layers of
the LGN is received by different sublayers of the striate cortex: The
koniocellular input is received by sublayers 2 and 3 in the striate
cortex, magnocellular input is received by sublayer 4Ca, and
parvocellular input is received by sublayer 4Cb (Nassi & Callaway,
2009). Modules Most investigators believe that the cortex is organized
in modules, which probably range in size from 100,000 to a few million
neurons. Each module receives information from other modules, performs
some calculations, and then passes the results to other modules. In
recent

years, investigators have been learning the characteristics of the
modules that are found in the visual cortex. The striate cortex is
divided into approximately 2,500 modules containing approximately
150,000 neurons. The neurons in each module are devoted to the analysis
of various features contained in one very small portion of the visual
field. Collectively, these modules receive information from the entire
visual field, with the individual modules serving like the tiles in a
mosaic mural. The modules actually consist of two segments, each
surrounding a CO blob. Neurons located within the blobs have a special
function: Most of them are sensitive to color.

In addition, their receptive fields are monocular---they receive visual
information from only one eye (Kaas & Collins, 2001; Landisman & Ts'o,
2002). Outside the CO blob, in the interblob regions, neurons show
sensitivity to orientation, movement, and binocular disparity, but most
do not respond to color (Born & Tootell, 1991; Edwards et al., 1995;
Livingstone & Hubel, 1984). Each half of the module receives input from
only one eye, but the circuitry within the module combines the
information from both eyes, which means that most of the neurons are
binocular. Cytochrome Oxidase (CO) Blobs In the striate cortex,
information from color-sensitive ganglion cells is transmitted, through
the parvocellular and koniocellular layers of the LGN, to special cells
grouped together in cytochrome oxidase (CO) blobs (also called spots or
dots). CO blobs are found in layers 2 and 3 and (more faintly) layers 5
and 6 of

striate cortex in humans and other primates (Horton & Hubel, 1980;
Humphrey & Hendrickson, 1980; Marcondes et al., 2019). Figure 6.13 shows
a photomicrograph of a slice through the striate cortex and an adjacent
area of the extrastriate cortex of a macaque monkey. You can see the CO
blobs within the striate cortex (V1). CO blobs are also found in the
extrastriate cortex. The distribution of CO-rich neurons in the
extrastriate cortex consists of three kinds of stripes: thick stripes,
thin stripes, and pale stripes. Neurons in CO blobs of the striate
cortex project to thin stripes, and neurons outside the blobs (in
interblob areas) project to thick stripes and pale stripes of the
extrastriate cortex (Sincich et al., 2010). Neurons in the thin stripes
receive information concerning color, and those in the thick stripes and
pale stripes receive information about orientation, spatial frequency,
movement, and retinal disparity.

Extrastriate Cortex LO 6.11 Describe the structures and functions of the
pathways of the extrastriate cortex. The striate cortex is necessary for
visual perception, but the perception of objects and of entire visual
scenes does not take place there. Each of the thousands of modules of
the striate cortex sees only what is happening in one tiny part of the
visual field. For us to perceive objects and entire visual scenes, the
information from these individual modules must be combined. That
combination takes place in the extrastriate cortex. In primates,
extrastriate contains multiple regions (for example, V2--V4) arranged in
a hierarchy from closest (V2) to farthest (V4) from the striate cortex
(Grill-Spector & Malach, 2004; Wandell et al., 2007). So far,
investigators have identified over two dozen distinct regions and
subregions STRUCTURES OF THE EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX

of the visual cortex of the rhesus monkey. Each region of the
extrastriate cortex contains maps of the visual field and is specialized
to respond to features of visual information, such as orientation,
movement, spatial frequency, retinal disparity, or color. Most of this
specialized information passes up the hierarchy. Lower regions in the
hierarchy (such as V2) analyze the information and pass the results on
to "higher" regions (such as V3) for further analysis. Some information
is also transmitted in the opposite direction, but fewer axons descend
the hierarchy than ascend it. PATHWAYS OF THE EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX Visual
processing in the extrastriate cortex divides into two pathways: the
dorsal stream and the ventral stream. The pathways begin to diverge
after area V2. The dorsal stream begins with the neurons in the thick
stripes of area V2 and ascends into regions of the posterior parietal
cortex. The ventral stream begins with the neurons in the pale and thin

Figure 6.14 Pathways of the Extrastriate Cortex: The Dorsal and Ventral
Streams Processing visual information involves connections across a
hierarchy of cortical areas (represented by the blue arrows) beginning
in the primary visual cortex (V1), which receives input from the lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN). The connections extend through a ventral
stream into the temporal lobe and a dorsal stream into the parietal lobe
and prefrontal cortex. This figure depicts some of the many cortical
regions that are involved in extrastriate visual processing. Regions
within the intraparietal sulcus (anterior/AIP, lateral/LIP, ventral/VIP,
and medial/MIP) are described in detail in the section on the role of
the extrastriate cortex in perceiving spatial location. Source: Gilbert,

stripes of area V2, continues forward to area V4, and then projects to a
variety of subareas of the inferior temporal cortex. Some axons
conveying information received from the magnocellular system bypass area
V2: They project from area V1 directly to area V5 (also called area MT
for medial temporal), a region of the dorsal stream devoted to the
analysis of movement. (See Figure 6.14.) The dorsal and ventral streams
play different roles in visual processing. The dorsal stream provides
visual information that guides navigation and skilled movements directed
toward objects. The ventral stream provides visual information about the
size, shape, color, and texture of objects (including, as we shall see,
other people). In other words, the dorsal stream recognizes where an
object is, and the ventral stream recognizes what an object is. Usually,
the dorsal and ventral streams communicate with each other through the
vertical occipital fasciculus, a tract of white matter found in many
species (Takemura et al., 2018). Communication between these streams
helps to seamlessly convey where and what in visual perception.

A fascinating study with young children demonstrates the importance of
communication between the dorsal and ventral streams of the visual
system in perception of form (DeLoache et al., 2004). The experimenters
let children play with large toys: an indoor slide that they could climb
and slide down, a chair that they could sit on, and a toy car that they
could enter. After the children played in and on the large toys, the
children were taken out of the room, the large toys were replaced with
identical miniature versions, and the children were then brought back
into the room. When the children played with the miniature toys, they
acted as if they were the large versions: They tried to climb onto the
slide, climb into the car, and sit on the chair. One child said "In!"
several times and turning to his mother, apparently asked her to help
him. The authors suggest that this child's behavior reflects incomplete
maturation of connections between the dorsal and ventral streams. The
ventral stream recognizes the identity of the objects, and the dorsal
stream recognizes their size, but in the developing brain, the
information is not adequately shared between these two streams.

striate cortex. The striate cortex is the first cortical region involved
in combining visual information from several sources. It receives visual
input from the LGN and performs additional processing of this
information, which it then transmits to the extrastriate cortex. The
striate cortex contains six layers. Layer 4 contains four sublayers (4A,
4B, 4Cα, and 4Cβ). CO blobs are groups of cells that receive information
about color from the parvocellular and koniocellular layers of the LGN.
The striate cortex is divided into many modules, each containing
thousands of neurons devoted to the analysis of specific features of a
portion of the visual field. Neurons in CO blobs of the striate cortex
project to thin stripes, and neurons outside the blobs (in interblob
areas) project to thick stripes and pale

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 167

stripes of the extrastriate cortex. Neurons in the thin stripes receive
information concerning color, and those in the thick stripes and pale
stripes receive information about orientation, spatial frequency,
movement, and retinal disparity.

Extrastriate Cortex LO 6.11 Describe the structures and functions of the
pathways of the extrastriate cortex. The extrastriate cortex is
responsible for hierarchically combining information from individual
modules of the striate cortex to allow an individual to perceive objects
and entire visual scenes. Each region of the extrastriate cortex is
specialized, containing neurons that respond to particular features of
visual information, such as orientation, movement, spatial frequency,
retinal disparity, or color. The dorsal stream terminates in the
posterior parietal cortex and is responsible for processing where the
object is located. The ventral stream terminates in the inferior
temporal cortex and is responsible for processing what an object is.

Thought Question Take a moment to look at the scene in front of you
right now and imagine how its features are encoded by neurons in your
striate and extrastriate cortex. Describe one object or aspect of your
current visual scene and summarize where this information is processed
in your visual cortex.

Perceiving Color

1.  ON cells are excited by light falling in the central field (center)
    and inhibited by light falling in the surrounding field (surround).
2.  OFF cells are excited by light falling in the surround and inhibited
    by light falling in the center.
3.  ON/OFF ganglion cells are briefly excited when light is turned on or
    off.

With a basic understanding of the visual system, we will now turn our
attention to understanding the roles these structures play in more
specific visual functions. Not all components of the visual system have
the same amount of involvement in different visual functions. For
example, the retina is highly involved in basic functions such as
perceiving light and dark, while both retinal and cortical processing
are required for perceiving faces (see the case at the beginning of the
chapter). The following sections will investigate the role of the visual
system in perceiving color, form, spatial location, orientation, and
movement. The sections on perceiving color and form focus on the "what"
of ventral stream processing. The sections on perceiving spatial
location, orientation, and movement focus on the "where" of dorsal
stream processing.

In primates most of these ON/OFF cells project mainly to the superior
colliculus, which is primarily involved in visual reflexes in response
to moving or suddenly appearing stimuli (Schiller & Malpeli, 1977). (See
Figure 6.15.) Figure 6.15 also illustrates a rebound effect that occurs
when the light is turned off again. Neurons whose firing is inhibited
while the light is on will show a brief burst of excitation when it is
turned off. In contrast, neurons whose firing is increased will show a
brief period of inhibition when the light is turned off. Ganglion cells
normally produce action potentials at a relatively low rate. Then, when
the level of illumination in the center of their receptive field
increases or decreases (for example, when an object moves or the eye
makes a saccade), the ganglion cells signal the change in illumination.
ON cells signal increases in illumination and OFF cells signal
decreases, but both convey changes in illumination through an increased
rate of firing action potentials.

Role of the Retinal Ganglion Cells LO 6.12 Compare the activity of
retinal ganglion cells in perceiving light and dark. Perceiving light is
required for perceiving color. As you read in the section on
Transduction, ON and OFF bipolar cells initiate signals to retinal
ganglion cells that are important in perceiving light and dark.
Mammalian ganglion cells have a receptive field that consists of a
roughly circular center, surrounded by a ring. There are three types of
ganglion cells:

and OFF ganglion cells to stimuli presented in the center or the

LO 6.13 Differentiate between the trichromatic and opponent-color system
theories. Various theories of color vision have been proposed for many
years---long before it was possible to disprove or validate them by
physiological means. The trichromatic (three-color) theory was proposed
in 1802 and suggested that the eye detected different colors because it
contained three types of cones, each sensitive to a single hue. An
alternative explanation, the opponent-color system theory, suggested
that color might be represented in the visual system as opponent colors:
red versus green and yellow versus blue. Many people consider yellow,
blue, red, and green as primary colors---colors that seem unique and do
not appear to be blends of other colors. (Black and white are primary,
too, but we perceive them as colorless.) All other colors can be
described as mixtures of these primary colors. The trichromatic system
cannot explain why yellow is included in this group---why it is
perceived as a pure color. In addition, some colors appear to blend,
whereas others do not. For example, one can speak of a bluish green or a
yellowish green, and orange appears to have both red and yellow
qualities. Purple resembles both red and blue. But try to imagine a
reddish green or a bluish yellow. It is impossible; these colors seem to
be opposite to each other. Again, these facts are not explained by the
trichromatic theory. As we shall see in the following sections, the
visual system uses both trichromatic and opponent-color systems to
encode information related to color. PHOTORECEPTORS: TRICHROMATIC CODING
Physiological investigations of retinal photoreceptors in higher
primates support the trichromatic theory: Three different types of
photoreceptors (three different types of cones) are responsible for
color vision. Figure 6.16 demonstrates light absorbance by blue, green,
and red light-sensitive cones. Investigators have studied the absorption
characteristics of individual photoreceptors, determining the amount of
light of different wavelengths that is absorbed by the photopigments.
These characteristics are controlled by the particular opsin a
photoreceptor contains; different opsins absorb particular wavelengths
more readily. Changes in color vision can result from anomalies in one
or more of the three types of cone (Wissinger & Sharpe, 1998; Nathans,
1999). The first two kinds of color blindness described here involve
genes on the X chromosome. Because most men have only one X chromosome,
they are more likely to have this disorder. (Women are likely to have an
unaffected gene on one of their X chromosomes, which compensates for the
defective one.) People with protanopia ("first-color defect") confuse
red and green.

They see the world in shades of yellow and blue; both red and green look
yellowish to them. Their visual acuity is normal, which suggests that
their retinas do not lack "red" or "green" cones. This fact and their
sensitivity to lights of different wavelengths suggest that their "red"
cones are filled with "green" cone opsin. People with d ­ euteranopia
("second-color defect") also confuse red and green and have normal
visual acuity. Their "green" cones appear to be filled with "red" cone
opsin. (In other words, their vision is dichromatic, or "two color,"
like that of our ­ancestors and most present-day mammals.) Mancuso and
colleagues (2009) attempted to perform gene therapy on adult squirrel
monkeys whose retinas lacked the gene for "red" cone pigment. Although
most female squirrel monkeys have trichromatic color vision, males have
only dichromatic vision and cannot distinguish red from green. Mancuso
and her colleagues used a genetically modified virus to insert a human
gene for the pigment of that "red" cone into the retinas of male
monkeys. Color vision tests before and after surgery confirmed that the
gene insertion converted the monkeys from dichromats into trichromats:
They could now distinguish between red and green. Tritanopia
("third-color defect") is rare, affecting fewer than 1 in 10,000 people.
This disorder involves a faulty gene that is not located on an X
chromosome and is equally prevalent in men and women. People with
tritanopia have difficulty with hues of short wavelengths and see the
world in greens and reds. To them a clear blue sky is a bright green,
and yellow looks pink. Their retinas lack "blue" cones. Because the
retina contains so few of these cones, their absence does not noticeably
affect visual acuity.

24/11/21 1:20 PM

170 Chapter 6 Finally, some people possess a very rare genetic condition
in which the retina completely lacks cones. These individuals have
monochromatic vision and see the visual world in black and white and
shades of grey. For an example of the stimuli used to assess color
blindness, see Figure 6.17.

Figure 6.18 Receptive Fields of Color-Sensitive

Ganglion Cells

When a portion of the receptive field is illuminated with the color
shown, the cell's rate of firing increases. When a portion is
illuminated with the complementary color, the cell's rate of firing
decreases.

RETINAL GANGLION CELLS: OPPONENT-PROCESS CODING Unlike cones, retinal
ganglion cells use an

opponent-color system. These neurons respond specifically to pairs of
primary colors, with red opposing green and blue opposing yellow (Daw,
1968; Gouras, 1968). This means the retina contains two kinds of
color-sensitive ganglion cells: red-green and yellow-blue. Some
colorsensitive ganglion cells respond in a center-surround fashion. For
example, a cell might be excited by red and inhibited by green in the
center of their receptive field while showing the opposite response in
the surrounding ring.

Figure 6.17 Testing for Color Vision Special images are used to assess
protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia. The tester shows the
individual the images and asks them to identify the number in the
circle. In protanopia, people have difficulty seeing the color red
because their "red" cones are filled with "green" cone opsin. In
deuteranopia, people have difficulty seeing green because their "green"
cones appear to be filled with "red" cone opsin. In tritanopia, people
have difficulty seeing blue because their retinas lack "blue" cones.

(See Figure 6.18.) Other ganglion cells that receive input from cones do
not respond differently to different wavelengths but simply encode
relative brightness in the center and surround. These cells serve as
"black-andwhite detectors." The response characteristics of retinal
ganglion cells to light of different wavelengths are determined by the
particular circuits that connect the three types of cones with the two
types of ganglion cells. Figure 6.19 helps to explain how hues are
detected by "red," "green," and "blue" cones and translated into
excitation or inhibition of the red-green and yellow-blue ganglion
cells. The diagram does not show the actual neural circuitry, which
includes the retinal neurons that connect the cones with the ganglion
cells. The arrows in Figure 6.19 refer to the effects of the light
falling on the retina. Detection and coding of pure red, green, or blue
light is the easiest to understand. For example, red light excites "red"
cones, which causes the excitation of red-green ganglion cells. (See
Figure 6.19a.) Green light excites "green" cones, which causes the
inhibition of red-green cells. (See Figure 6.19b.) But consider the
effect of yellow light. Because the wavelength that produces the
sensation of yellow is intermediate between the wavelengths that produce
red and green, it will stimulate both "red" and "green" cones about
equally. Yellow-blue ganglion cells are excited by both "red" and
"green" cones, so their rate of firing increases. However, red-green
ganglion cells are excited by red and inhibited by green, so their
firing rate does not change. The brain detects an increased firing rate
from the axons of yellow-blue ganglion cells, which it interprets as
yellow. (See Figure 6.19c.) Blue light inhibits the activity of
yellow-blue ganglion cells. (See Figure 6.19d.) The ­opponent-color
system used by the ganglion cells explains why we cannot perceive a
reddish green or a bluish yellow: An axon that signals red or green (or
yellow or blue) can either increase or decrease its rate of firing; it
cannot do both at the same time. A reddish green would have to be
signaled by a ganglion cell firing slowly and rapidly at the same time,
which is impossible.

Figure 6.20 demonstrates an interesting property of the visual system:
the formation of a negative afterimage. Stare at the cross in the center
of the image on the left for approximately 30 seconds. Then quickly look
at the cross in the center of the white rectangle to the right. You will
have a fleeting experience of seeing the red and green colors of an
apple--- colors that are complementary, or the opposite, to the ones on
the left. Complementary items go together to make up a whole. In this
context complementary colors are those that make white (or shades of
gray) when added together. The most important cause of negative
afterimages is adaptation in the rate of firing of retinal ganglion
cells. When ganglion cells are excited or inhibited for a prolonged
period of time, they later show a rebound effect, firing faster or
slower than normal. For example, the green of the apple in Figure 6.20
inhibits some red-green ganglion cells. When this region of the retina
is then stimulated with the neutral-colored light reflected off the
white rectangle, the red-green ganglion cells---no longer inhibited by
the green light---fire faster than normal and we see a red afterimage of
the apple.

Role of the Striate and Extrastriate Cortex LO 6.14 Describe the role of
the striate and extrastriate cortex in color perception. The retinal
ganglion cells encode information about the relative amounts of light
falling on the center and surround regions of their receptive field and,
in many cases, about the wavelength of that light. This information is
then relayed to the LGN, then on to the striate cortex, and finally to
the extrastriate cortex. The parvocellular, koniocellular, and
magnocellular systems provide different kinds of information to the
striate cortex. (See Figure 6.11.) Only the cells in the parvocellular
and koniocellular systems receive information about wavelength from
cones. These systems provide information concerning color. The
parvocellular system receives information only from "red" and "green"
cones; additional information from "blue" cones is transmitted through
the koniocellular system (Chatterjee & Callaway, 2003; Hendry

& Yoshioka, 1994). Cells in the parvocellular system also show high
spatial resolution and low temporal resolution; that is, they are able
to detect very fine details, but their response is slow and prolonged.
In the koniocellular system, the "blue" cones are much less numerous
than "red" and "green" cones and do not provide information about fine
details. In contrast, neurons in the magnocellular system are
color-blind. They are not able to detect fine details, but they can
detect smaller contrasts between light and dark. They are also
especially sensitive to movement. (See Table 6.2.) In the extrastriate
cortex, the dorsal ("where") stream receives mostly magnocellular input
to process light/dark contrast and movement. The ventral stream ("what")
receives approximately equal input from the magnocellular and the
parvocellular/koniocellular systems, helping to process color and
details relevant to object recognition. STUDIES WITH LABORATORY ANIMALS
In the monkey

brain, color-sensitive neurons in the CO blobs of the striate cortex
send color-related information to the thin stripes in area V2. Neurons
in V2 send information to an adjacent region of the extrastriate cortex,
called V4. (See Figure 6.21.) Zeki (1980) found that neurons in this
region respond selectively to colors, but their response characteristics
are much more complex than those of neurons in V1 or V2. Unlike the
neurons we have encountered so far, these extrastriate

1

neurons respond to a variety of wavelengths, not just the wavelengths
that correspond to red, green, yellow, and blue. Schein and Desimone
(1990) performed a careful study of the response characteristics of
neurons in area V4 of the monkey extrastriate cortex, which receives
input from the pale and thin stripes of area V2. They found that these
neurons responded to specific colors. Some also responded to colored
bars of specific orientation. This indicates that area V4 seems to be
involved in the analysis of form as well as color. The color-sensitive
neurons had a rather unusual secondary receptive field: a large region
surrounding the primary field. When stimuli were presented in the
secondary receptive field, the neuron did not respond. However, stimuli
presented there could suppress the neuron's response to a stimulus
presented in the primary field. For example, if a cell would fire when a
red spot was presented in the primary field, it would fire at a slower
rate (or not at all) when an additional red stimulus was presented in
the surrounding secondary field. In other words, these cells responded
to particular wavelengths of light but subtracted out the amount of that
wavelength that was present in the background. As Schein and Desimone
point out, this subtraction could serve as the basis for color constancy
(see section The Stimulus: Light).

Figure 6.21 Color Processing via Parvocellular and Koniocellular Systems

The dorsal stream receives mostly magnocellular input (light/dark
contrast and movement).

LGN

Color processing: The ventral stream receives approximately equal input
from the magnocellular, parvocellular ("red" and "green" cones) and
koniocellular ("blue" cones) systems.

Walsh and colleagues (1993) confirmed this prediction; damage to area V4
does disrupt color constancy. The investigators found that, although
monkeys could still discriminate between different colors after area V4
had been damaged, their performance was impaired when the color of the
overall illumination was changed. But the fact that the monkeys could
still perform a color discrimination task under constant illumination
means that some region besides area V4 must be involved in color vision.
A study by Heywood and colleagues (1995) suggested that a portion of the
inferior temporal cortex just anterior to area V4---a region of the
monkey brain that is usually referred to as area TEO---plays a critical
role in visual discrimination. (See Figures 6.14 and 6.21.) The
investigators destroyed area TEO, leaving area V4 intact, and observed
severe impairment in color discrimination. The monkeys had no difficulty
in discriminating shades of gray, so the deficit was restricted to
impaired color perception. Conway and colleagues (2007) performed a
detailed analysis of the responsiveness of neurons in a large region of
the visual association cortex in monkeys, including areas V4 and TEO.
Using fMRI, the investigators identified color "hot spots"---small
scattered regions that were strongly activated by changes in the color
of visual stimuli. Next, they recorded the response characteristics of
neurons inside and outside these spots, which they called globs. (It's
likely the similarity between the terms "blobs" and "globs" was
intentional.) They found that glob neurons were indeed responsive to
colors but also had some weak sensitivity to shapes. In contrast,
interglob neurons (those located outside globs) did not respond to
colors but were strongly selective to shape. This means that within a
large region of the visual association cortex, patches of neurons were

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 173

strongly sensitive to colors or to shape but not to both. The fact that
color-sensitive globs are spread across a wide area of visual
association cortex probably explains why only rather large brain lesions
cause severe disruptions in perceiving color. STUDIES WITH HUMANS
Lesions of a restricted region of the human extrastriate cortex can
cause loss of color vision without disruption of visual acuity. Some
patients describe their vision as resembling a black-and-white film. In
addition, they may not be able to imagine colors or remember the colors
of objects they saw before their brain damage occurred (Damasio et al.,
1980; Heywood & Kentridge, 2003). The condition is known as cerebral
achromatopsia. If the brain damage is unilateral, people will lose color
vision in only half of the visual field. The case of Mrs. D. illustrates
a unique example of cerebral achromatopsia. Mrs. D. was a 74-year-old
woman who loved oil painting as a hobby. She suffered two strokes that
affected her occipital cortex, one in each hemisphere. After the
strokes, testing revealed that she had a full visual field; however,
Mrs. D. reported seeing the world in shades of grey. Several months
later, she described seeing the world in reddish-brownish shades, and
occasionally perceived bright, saturated colors (Bartolomeo et al.,
1997).

Researchers located a region of the inferior temporal cortex of the
monkey brain whose damage disrupted the ability to make color
discriminations. The analogous region in humans appears to play a
critical role in color perception as well. An fMRI study by Hadjikhani
and colleagues (1998) found a color-sensitive region that included the
lingual and fusiform gyri, in a location corresponding to area TEO in
the monkey's cortex, which they called area V8. An analysis of 92 cases
of achromatopsia

24/11/21 1:21 PM

174 Chapter 6 by Bouvier and Engel (2006) confirmed that damage to this
region (which is adjacent to and partly overlaps the fusiform face area,
discussed later in this chapter) disrupts color vision. The function of
our ability to perceive different colors is to help us perceive
different objects in our environment. To perceive and understand what is
in front of us, we must have information about color combined with other
forms of information. Some people with brain damage lose the ability to
perceive shapes but can still perceive colors. For example, Zeki and
colleagues (1999) described a patient who could identify colors but was
otherwise blind. Patient P. B. received an electrical shock that caused
both cardiac and respiratory arrest. He was revived, but the period of
anoxia caused extensive damage to his extrastriate cortex. As a result,
he lost all form perception. However, even though he could not recognize
objects presented on a video monitor, he could still identify their
colors. (See Figure 6.22.)

Loss of Form, but Not Color, Perception Patient P. B. experienced damage
to the extrastriate cortex. Structural and functional MRI data from the
patient P. B. show activation in area V1 (white area on the MRI scan)
when correctly identifying colors, though he could not perceive the form

Module Review: Perceiving Color Role of the Retinal Ganglion Cells LO
6.12 Compare the activity of retinal ganglion cells in perceiving light
and dark. ON, OFF, and ON/OFF retinal ganglion cells contain center and
surround portions of their receptive fields. In ON cells, light
stimulating the center (but not the surround) portion of the receptive
field results in a burst of action potentials. In OFF cells, light
stimulating the surround (but not the center) portion of the receptive
field results in a burst of action potentials. ON/OFF cells respond when
the light goes on and again when it goes off. These cells project mainly
to the superior colliculus, which is involved in visual reflexes in
response to moving or suddenly appearing stimuli.

Role of the Retina LO 6.13 Differentiate between the trichromatic and
opponent-color system theories. The trichromatic theory explains that
the eye detects different colors because it contains three types of
receptors, each sensitive to a single hue (blue, green, or red). The
opponent-color system theory explains that color is represented in the
visual system as opponent colors: red versus green and yellow versus
blue. Research has revealed that cones are sensitive to blue, green, and
red light, in support of the trichromatic theory and that retinal
ganglion cells respond specifically to pairs of colors, with red

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 174

opposing green and blue opposing yellow, in support of the
opponent-color system theory.

Role of the Striate and Extrastriate Cortex LO 6.14 Describe the role of
the striate and extrastriate cortex in color perception. In the striate
cortex, the parvocellular system receives information from "red" and
"green" cones. Additional information from "blue" cones is transmitted
through the koniocellular system and relayed to the extrastriate cortex.
Extrastriate cortex region V4 adds complexity to the color processing
begun in the striate cortex and is likely involved in the analysis of
form as well as color. Area TEO in the primate extrastriate cortex is
responsible for additional color and shape perception. Research with
human volunteers revealed a region for color perception, V8, that is
analogous to TEO. Damage to this region results in achromatopsia. Damage
to other regions of the extrastriate cortex can selectively impair form
recognition, leaving the ability to discriminate between colors intact.

Perceiving Form The analysis of visual information that leads to the
perception of form begins with neurons in the striate cortex that are
sensitive to spatial frequency. These neurons send information to area
V2 and then on to the ventral stream of the extrastriate cortex. (See
Figure 6.14.) Let's look at this process in closer detail.

Role of the Striate Cortex LO 6.15 Outline the benefit of neural
circuits that analyze spatial frequency in the striate cortex. Early
studies by Hubel and Wiesel suggested that neurons in the primary visual
cortex detected lines and edges, and subsequent research found that
cells in the striate cortex actually responded strongest to sine-wave
gratings (De Valois et al., 1978). Figure 6.23 compares a sine-wave
grating with a square-wave grating. A square-wave grating consists of a
simple set of rectangular bars that vary in brightness; the brightness
along the length of a line perpendicular to them would vary in a
stepwise (square-wave) fashion. (See Figure 6.23a.) A sine-wave grating
looks like a series of fuzzy, unfocused parallel bars. Along any line
perpendicular to the long axis of the grating, the brightness varies
according to a sine-wave function. (See Figure 6.23b.) A sine-wave
grating is designated by its spatial frequency. Frequencies (for
example, of sound waves or radio

waves) are often expressed in terms of time or distance (such as cycles
per second or wavelength in cycles per meter). But because the image of
a stimulus on the retina varies in size according to how close it is to
the eye, the visual angle is generally used instead of the physical
distance between adjacent cycles. This means that the spatial frequency
of a sine-wave grating is its variation in brightness measured in cycles
per degree of visual angle. Most neurons in the striate cortex respond
best when a sinewave grating of a particular spatial frequency is placed
in the appropriate part of the visual field. Different neurons detect
different spatial frequencies. What is the point of having neural
circuits that analyze spatial frequency? Consider the types of
information provided by high and low spatial frequencies. Small objects,
details within a large object, and large objects with sharp edges
provide a signal rich in high frequencies, whereas large areas of light
and dark are represented by low frequencies. An image that is deficient
in high-frequency information looks fuzzy and out of focus, like the
image seen by a nearsighted person who is not wearing corrective lenses.
This image still provides much information about forms and objects in
the environment. The most important visual information is contained in
low spatial frequencies. When low-frequency information is removed, the
shapes of images are very difficult to perceive. (The evolutionarily
older magnocellular system provides low-frequency information.)

gratings: (a) square-wave grating, and (b) sine-wave grating. (c) Angles

176 Chapter 6 Many experiments have confirmed that the concept of
spatial frequency analysis plays a central role in visual perception,
and mathematical models have shown that the information present in a
scene can be represented very efficiently if it is first encoded in
terms of spatial frequency. This means that the brain probably
represents the information in a similar way. Here we will describe an
example to help show the validity of the concept. Look at the two
pictures in Figure 6.24. You can see that the picture on the right looks
much more like the face of Abraham Lincoln than the one on the left
does. Yet the two pictures contain the same information. The creators of
the pictures, Harmon and Julesz (1973), constructed the figure on the
left, which consists of a series of squares, each representing the
average brightness of a portion of a picture of Lincoln. The one on the
right is simply a transformation of the first one in which high
frequencies have been removed. Sharp edges contain high spatial
frequencies, so the transformation eliminates them. In the case of the
picture on the left, these frequencies have nothing to do with the
information contained in the original picture, and they can be seen as
visual "noise." The filtration process removes this noise---and makes
the image much clearer to the human visual system. Presumably, the high
frequencies produced by the edges of the squares in the left figure
stimulate neurons in the striate cortex that are tuned to high spatial
frequencies. When the visual association cortex receives this noisy
information, it has difficulty perceiving the underlying form. If you
want to watch the effect of filtering the extraneous high-frequency
noise, try the following demonstration. Look at the pictures in Figure
6.24 from across the room. The distance "erases" the high frequencies,
because they exceed the resolving power of the eye, and the two pictures
look identical. Now walk toward the pictures, focusing on the left

Figure 6.24 Spatial Filtering The two pictures contain the same amount
of low-frequency information, but extraneous high-frequency information
has been filtered from the picture on the right. If you look at the
pictures from across the room, they look identical. Source: From Harmon,

figure. As you get closer, the higher frequencies reappear, and this
picture looks less and less like the face of Lincoln.

Role of the Extrastriate Cortex LO 6.16 Describe the roles of the
ventral stream and fusiform face area in perceiving form. Much of our
understanding about the role of the extrastriate cortex in form
perception has come from research in humans and other animals. The
following sections describe research supporting the role of the
extrastriate cortex in recognizing objects, patterns, and categories.
STUDIES WITH LABORATORY ANIMALS In primates, recognizing visual patterns
and identifying objects take place in the inferior temporal cortex,
located in the ventral part of the temporal lobe. This region of
extrastriate cortex is located at the end of the ventral stream. It is
here that analyses of form and color are put together, and perceptions
of three-dimensional objects and backgrounds are achieved. The inferior
temporal cortex consists of two major regions: a posterior area (TEO)
and an anterior area (TE). Damage to these regions causes severe
deficits in visual discrimination (Dean, 1976; Gross, 1973; Mishkin,
1966). (See Figure 6.14.) As we saw earlier, the analysis of visual
information is hierarchical: Area V1 is concerned with the analysis of
elementary aspects of information in very small regions of the visual
field, and successive regions (V2, etc.) analyze more complex
characteristics. The size of the receptive fields also grows as the
hierarchy is ascended. The receptive fields of neurons in area TEO are
larger than those in area V4, and the receptive fields of neurons in
area TE are the largest of all, often encompassing the entire
contralateral half of the visual field (Boussaoud et al., 1991). In
general, these neurons respond best to three-dimensional objects (or
photographs of them). They respond poorly to simple stimuli such as
spots, lines, or sine-wave gratings. Most of them continue to respond
even when complex stimuli are moved to different locations, are changed
in size, are placed against a different background, or are partially
occluded by other objects (Kovács et al., 1995; Rolls & Baylis, 1986).
These cells appear to participate in the recognition of objects rather
than the analysis of specific features. The fact that neurons in the
primate inferior temporal cortex respond to very specific complex shapes
suggests that the development of the circuits responsible for detecting
them must involve learning. Indeed, that seems to be the case. For
example, several studies have found neurons in the inferior temporal
cortex that respond specifically to objects that the monkeys have
already seen many times but not to unfamiliar objects (Baker et al.,
2002; Kobatake et al., 1992; Logothetis et al., 1995).

cortex has told

us much about the organization of the human visual system. In recent
years our knowledge has been greatly expanded by functional imaging
studies. Visual Agnosia Damage to the human extrastriate cortex can
cause a category of deficits known as visual agnosia. Mrs. R., whose
case was described in the opening of this chapter, had visual agnosia
caused by damage to the ventral stream of her extrastriate cortex. She
could not identify common objects by sight, even though she had
relatively normal visual acuity. However, she could still read, even
small print, which indicates that reading involves different brain
regions than object perception does. (Chapter 14 discusses research that
has identified brain regions involved in visual recognition of letters
and words.) When she held an object that she could not recognize
visually, she could immediately recognize it by touch and say what it
is, which demonstrates that she had not lost her memory for the ­object
or simply forgotten how to say its name. Recognizing Categories Visual
agnosia is caused by damage to the parts of the extrastriate cortex that
contribute to the ventral stream. This is vividly illustrated by a case
report of patient J. S. by Karnath and colleagues (2009). Patient J. S.
sustained a stroke in which the ventral stream was seriously damaged,
but the dorsal stream was intact. He was unable to recognize objects or
faces and could no longer read. He could not recognize shapes or
orientations of visual stimuli (ventral stream functions). However, his
ability to reach for and pick up objects was preserved, and if he knew
in advance what they were, he could pick them up and use them
appropriately (dorsal stream functions). For example, if he knew where
his clothes were, he could pick them up and get dressed. He could shake
hands when someone else extended his hand to him. He could walk around
his neighborhood, enter a store, and give a written list to an employee.

stimuli. The investigators presented images of objects from 19 different
categories to a control group and found only three regions that showed
the greatest activation to the sight of specific categories: faces,
bodies, and scenes. Bell and colleagues (2009) found that in both the
human and the monkey brain, regions that responded to faces and body
parts were adjacent to each other, as were those that responded to
objects and scenes of places. (See Figure 6.25.) Recognizing Faces A
common symptom of visual agnosia is prosopagnosia, inability to
recognize particular faces (prosopon is Greek for "face"). That is,
patients with this disorder can recognize that they are looking at a
face, but they cannot say whose face it is---even if it belongs to a
relative or close friend. They see eyes, ears, a nose, and a mouth, but
they cannot recognize the particular configuration of these features
that identify an individual face. They still remember who these people
are and will usually recognize them when they hear the person's voice,
like the case of Mrs. R.

temporal cortex of monkeys and humans as revealed by functional magnetic
resonance imaging. Journal of Neurophysiology, 101, 688--700.

With the advent of functional imaging, investigators have studied the
responses of the typical human brain and have discovered several regions
of the ventral stream that are activated by the sight of particular
categories of visual stimuli. For example, researchers have identified
regions of the inferior temporal and lateral occipital cortex that are
specifically activated by categories such as animals, tools, cars,
flowers, letters and letter strings, faces, bodies, and scenes. (See
Grill-Spector & Malach, 2004, and Tootell et al., 2003 for a review.)
However, not all of these findings have been replicated, and
general-purpose regions contain circuits that can learn to recognize
shapes that do not fall into these categories. A relatively large region
of the ventral stream of the visual association cortex, the lateral
occipital complex (LOC), appears to respond to a wide variety of objects
and shapes. A functional imaging study by Downing and colleagues (2006)
suggests that there are few regions of the extrastriate cortex devoted
to the analysis of specific categories of

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 177

178 Chapter 6 As one patient said, "I have trouble recognizing people
from just faces alone. I look at their hair color, listen to their
voices . . . I use clothing, voice, and hair. I try to associate
something with a person one way or another . . . what they wear, how
their hair is worn" (Buxbaum et al., 1999, p. 43). Studies with people
who have experienced brain damage and functional-imaging studies suggest
that these special face-recognizing circuits are found in the fusiform
face area (FFA), located in the fusiform gyrus on the base of the
temporal lobe. For example, Grill-Spector and colleagues (2004) obtained
fMRI scans of the brains of people who looked at pictures of faces and
several other categories of objects and found that regions of the
fusiform cortex were selectively activated by viewing faces. (See
Grill-Spector et al., 2017 for a review of the FFA and its associated
circuits.) Perhaps the most unusual piece of evidence for a special
face-recognition region comes from a report by Moscovitch and colleagues
(1997), who studied a man with a visual agnosia for objects but not for
faces. For example, he recognized the face shown in Figure 6.26 but not
the flowers, fruits, and vegetables that compose it. Presumably, some
regions of his visual association cortex were damaged, but the fusiform
face region was not. Some people have congenital prosopagnosia---the
inability to recognize faces without having obvious damage to the FFA.
Behrman and colleagues ( 2007) found that the

anterior fusiform gyrus is smaller in people with congenital
prosopagnosia, and a diffusion tensor imaging study by Thomas and
colleagues (2009) found evidence that people with congenital
prosopagnosia show decreased connectivity within the occipito-temporal
cortex. Another interesting region of the ventral stream is the
extrastriate body area (EBA), which is just posterior to the FFA and
partly overlaps it. Downing and colleagues (2001) found that this region
was specifically activated by photographs, silhouettes, or stick
drawings of human bodies or body parts and not by control stimuli such
as photographs or drawings of tools, scrambled silhouettes, or scrambled
stick drawings of human bodies. Figure 6.27 shows the magnitude of the
fMRI response in the nonoverlapping regions of the FFA and EBA to
several categories of stimuli (Schwarzlose et al., 2005). As you can
see, the FFA responded to faces more than any of the other categories,
and the EBA showed the greatest response to headless bodies and body
parts. Urgesi and colleagues (2004) used transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) to temporarily disrupt the normal neural activity of
the EBA. (As we saw in Chapter 5, the TMS procedure applies a strong
localized magnetic field to the brain by passing an electrical current
through a coil of wire placed on the scalp.) The investigators found
that the disruption temporarily impaired people's ability to recognize
photographs of body parts, but not parts of faces or motorcycles.

As we will see in Chapter 13, the hippocampus and nearby regions of the
medial temporal cortex are involved in spatial perception and memory.
Several studies have identified a parahippocampal place area (PPA),
located in a region of limbic cortex bordering the ventromedial temporal
lobe, that is activated by the sight of scenes and backgrounds. For
example, Steeves and colleagues (2004) studied Patient D. F., a
47-year-old woman who had sustained brain damage caused by accidental
carbon monoxide poisoning 14 years earlier. Bilateral damage to her
lateral occipital cortex (an important part of the ventral stream)
caused profound visual agnosia for objects. However, she was able to
recognize both natural and human-made scenes (beaches, forests, deserts,
cities, markets, and rooms). Functional imaging showed activation of her
intact PPA. These results suggest that scene recognition does not depend
on recognition of particular objects found within the scene, because D.
F. was incapable of recognizing these objects. Figure 6.28 shows the
activation in her brain and that of a control participant. Expert
Recognition As we just saw, the ability to recognize faces by sight
depends on a specific region of the fusiform gyrus. But must we conclude
that the development of this region is a result of natural selection and
that the FFA comes prewired with circuits devoted to the analysis of
faces? Several kinds of evidence suggest that the answer is no---that
the face-recognition circuits develop as a result of the experience we
have of seeing people's faces. Because of the extensive experience we
have of looking at faces, we can become expert at recognizing them. It
appears that recognizing specific complex stimuli by experts, too, is
disrupted by lesions that cause prosopagnosia: inability of a farmer to
recognize his cows, inability

of a bird expert to recognize different species of birds, and inability
of a driver to recognize his own car except by reading its license plate
(Bornstein et al., 1969; Damasio et al., 1982). Two functional imaging
studies (Gauthier et al., 2000; Xu, 2005) found that when bird or car
experts (but not nonexperts) viewed pictures of birds or cars, the
fusiform face area was activated. Another study (Gauthier et al., 1999)
found that when people had spent a long time becoming familiar with
computer-generated objects they called "greebles," viewing the greebles
activated the fusiform face area. Tarr and Gauthier (2000) suggested we
should relabel the FFA as the flexible fusiform area. A functional
imaging study (Golby et al., 2001) found higher activation of the
fusiform face area when people viewed pictures of faces of members of
their own race (African Americans or European Americans). Participants
in this study recognized faces of people of their own race more
accurately than faces of people of another race. Presumably, this
difference reflected the fact that the people in the study had more
experience seeing members of their own race, which indicates that
expertise does appear to play a role in face recognition. There is no
doubt that a region of the fusiform gyrus plays an essential role in the
analysis of particular faces. In fact, a face-responsive area exists in
a similar location in the monkey brain, and this area contains neurons
that respond to the faces of both monkeys and humans (Tsao et al.,
2006). Two issues are still disputed by investigators interested in the
FFA. First, is an analysis of faces the sole function of this region, or
is it really a "flexible fusiform area" involved in visual analysis of
categories of very similar stimuli that can be discriminated only by
experts? The activation of the FFA by greebles in the brains of greeble
experts suggests that the FFA is an expertise area rather than an
exclusively face area. However, perhaps a more important issue is the
relative roles of genetic programming and experience in the development
of a brain region critically involved in face perception. Developmental
Aspects of Recognition A functional imaging study indicates that
although the relative size of the LOC, which responds to objects other
than faces and bodies, is the same in children and adults, the left FFA
does not reach its eventual size until adulthood, and the ability to
recognize faces is directly related to the expansion of the FFA (Golarai
et al., 2007). These findings are consistent with the suggestion that
the ability to recognize faces is a learned skill that grows with
experience. Figure 6.29 shows the regions on the left and right fusiform
cortex of an 8-year-old child and an adult. You can see the age-related
size difference and also the difference between the size of this region
in the left and right hemispheres. Newborn babies prefer to look at
stimuli that resemble faces, which suggests the presence of prewired
circuits in the human brain that dispose babies to look at faces and
learn to recognize them. Farroni and colleagues (2005) presented

newborn babies (between 13 and 168 hours old) with pairs of stimuli and
found that they preferred to look at the ones that bore the closest
resemblance to faces viewed in their normal, upright orientation, with
the lighting coming from above, as it normally does. Figure 6.30
illustrates the stimuli that Farroni and her colleagues used. An
asterisk above a stimulus indicates that the babies spent more time
looking at it than at the other member of the pair. If neither stimulus
is marked with an asterisk, that means that the baby indicated no
preference---and as you can see, these pairs of stimuli bore the least
resemblance to a face illuminated from above. An imaging study by Deen
and colleagues (2017) confirmed that brain areas sensitive to faces and
scenes show adult-like spatial organization in the ventral streams by
four to six months of age. However, this organization is further refined
throughout development. Similar to other lines of research,
face-sensitive regions in the infants included the fusiform gyrus,
lateral occipital cortex, superior temporal sulcus (STS) and medial
prefrontal cortex, while the

parahippocampal gyrus and lateral occipital cortex selectively responded
to scenes (Deen et al., 2017). (See Figure 6.31.) A review of the
literature by Johnson (2005) suggests that a baby's preference for faces
is controlled by a fast, lowspatial-frequency, subcortical pathway that
is present in newborn infants. This circuit survives in many adults with
prosopagnosia caused by cortical damage, who are aware that they are
looking at a face even though they cannot recognize it and can even
recognize facial expressions such as happiness, fear, or anger. (This
phenomenon is discussed in more detail in Chapter 11, which deals with
emotion.) In babies, the subcortical pathway helps facilitate looking at
faces, which increases social bonding with other humans and facilitates
developing face-sensitive circuits in the cerebral cortex. A study by Le
Grand and colleagues (2001) discovered that the experience of seeing
faces very early in life plays a critical role in the development of the
skills necessary for recognizing them later in life. The investigators
tested the ability of people (aged 9--21 years) who had been born with
congenital cataracts to recognize subtle differences between pairs of
faces. The participants in the study had been

unable to see more than light and dark until they received eye surgery
at 62--187 days of age that made detailed vision possible. The early
visual deprivation resulted in a severe deficit, compared with the
performance of control participants, in recognizing the facial
differences. A follow-up study by Le Grand and colleagues (2003) tested
people who were born with cataracts in only one eye. Because of the
immaturity of the newborn brain, visual information received by one eye
is transmitted only to the contralateral visual cortex. (You may recall
that we said earlier in this chapter that it is not correct to say that
each hemisphere receives visual information solely from the
contralateral eye. However, our admonition does not apply to newborn
babies.) This means that the right hemisphere of a person born with a
cataract in the left eye does not receive patterned visual information
until the cataract is removed. Le Grand and his colleagues predicted
that because the right fusiform gyrus is critical for facial
recognition, people born with cataracts in their left eye would have
difficulty recognizing faces but that people born with cataracts in the
right eye would show expected facial discrimination---and that is
exactly what they found. As we will see in Chapter 18, people diagnosed
with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may find it more challenging to
develop close social relationships. Grelotti and colleagues (2002) found
that a sample of people with this disorder had difficulty recognizing
faces and that looking at faces did not activate the fusiform gyrus.
(See Figure 6.32.) The authors speculate that features associated with
this change in fusiform

activation could be related differences in recognizing faces as a child
grows up. Additional research revealed reduced connectivity between the
FFA and other areas of the visual cortex, which may also be related to
the social processing differences associated with ASD (Lynn et al.,
2018). Another frequent feature of ASD can be intense interest and
expertise in a specific topic or hobby, such as cars or characters.
Functional imaging has revealed that viewing stimuli related to an area
of expertise produced a response in the FFA of people without an ASD
diagnosis, with an enhanced response associated with ASD (Foss-Feig et
al., 2016). (See Figure 6.33 for examples of

spectrum disorder in more detail. Williams syndrome is a genetic
condition caused by a mutation on chromosome 7. People with this
disorder tend to be very sociable, charming, and kind. People with
Williams syndrome often show a lot of interest in other people, spend a
great deal of time looking closely

at their faces, and are generally better at recognizing faces than
people without the syndrome. A functionalimaging study by Golarai and
colleagues (2010) found that the fusiform face area was enlarged in
people with Williams syndrome and that the size of the FFA was
positively correlated with a person's ability to recognize faces.

Module Review: Perceiving Form Role of the Striate Cortex LO 6.15
Outline the benefit of neural circuits that analyze spatial frequency in
the striate cortex. Small objects, details within a large object, and
large objects with sharp edges provide a signal rich in high
frequencies, whereas large areas of light and dark are represented by
low frequencies. Possessing neural circuits that can differentiate
between these types of stimuli is beneficial in filtering noise from a
visual stimulus, making the image more clear in the human visual system,
and allowing an individual to perceive the underlying form.

three-dimensional objects and backgrounds are achieved. Damage to the
human extrastriate cortex can cause a category of deficits known as
visual agnosia, a failure to recognize familiar objects or categories of
objects, including faces. The fusiform face area is specifically devoted
to facial recognition. Development of this region may be a result of
extensive experience looking at faces; expertise with other complex
stimuli such as artificial creatures (greebles) causes the development
of circuits devoted to the perception of these stimuli as well.
Development of the fusiform face area may be involved in symptoms of
autism spectrum disorder, possibly related to developing experience in
recognizing faces.

guide fine movements of the hands and fingers.

Perceiving spatial location involves the retina, striate, and
extrastriate cortex. Together, these structures contribute to depth
perception, perceiving and remembering the locations of objects, and
controlling movements of the eyes and the limbs.

Role of the Striate and Extrastriate Cortex

Role of the Retina LO 6.17 Identify the retina's contributions to
perceiving spatial location. We perceive depth by many means, most of
which involve cues that can be detected monocularly---that is, by one
eye alone. For example, perspective, relative retinal size, loss of
detail through the effects of atmospheric haze, and relative apparent
movement of retinal images as we move our heads all contribute to depth
perception and do not require binocular vision. However, binocular
vision provides a vivid perception of depth through the process of
stereoscopic vision, or stereopsis. If you have seen a three-dimensional

patterns that appear to contribute to the perception of depth (Poggio &
Poggio, 1984). In most cases the cells respond most vigorously (by
firing action potentials) when each eye sees a stimulus in a slightly
different location. That is, the neurons respond to retinal disparity, a
stimulus that produces images on slightly different parts of the retina
of each eye. This is exactly the information that is needed for
stereopsis: Each eye sees a three-dimensional scene slightly

differently, and the presence of retinal disparity indicates differences
in the distance of objects from the observer. Many neurons throughout
almost all regions of the visual cortex are responsive to binocular
disparity, which serves as the basis for stereoscopic depth perception
(Parker, 2007; Roe et al., 2007). The disparity-sensitive neurons found
in the dorsal stream, which is involved in spatial perception, respond
to large, extended visual surfaces, whereas those found in the ventral
stream, which is involved in object perception, respond to the contours
of three-dimensional objects. A phenomenon called "flat vision"
illustrates the role of the dorsal stream in perceiving spatial
location.

Patient E. H. experienced a stroke that impacted the area between the
parietal and occipital lobes on the right side of the brain, areas
involved in processing retinal disparity information. Although he had
normal stereopsis, E. H. lost his ability to ­perceive depth and
described his experience of "flat vision" as seeing all objects
appearing as equidistant to him. This made behaviors that required depth
perception, such as walking on stairs or uneven ground, difficult. With
visual training, E. H. recovered depth perception (Schaadt et al.,
2015). (See Figure 6.34.)

The parietal lobe is involved in spatial and somatosensory perception,
and it receives visual, auditory, somatosensory, and vestibular
information to perform these tasks. Damage to the parietal lobes
disrupts performance on a variety of tasks that require perceiving and
remembering the locations of objects and controlling movements of the
eyes and the limbs. The dorsal stream of the visual association cortex
terminates in the posterior parietal cortex. The anatomy of the
posterior parietal cortex is shown in Figures 6.14 and 6.35. Five
regions within the

intraparietal sulcus (IPS) are of particular interest: AIP, LIP, VIP,
CIP, and MIP (anterior, lateral, ventral, caudal, and medial IPS).

184 Chapter 6 Single-unit studies with monkeys and functionalimaging
studies with humans indicate that neurons in the IPS are involved in
visual attention and control of saccadic eye movements (LIP and VIP),
visual control of reaching and pointing (VIP and MIP), visual control of
grasping and manipulating hand movements (AIP), and perception of depth
from stereopsis (CIP) (Astafiev et al., 2003; Culham & Kanwisher, 2001;
Frey et al., 2005; Snyder et al., 2000; Tsao et al., 2003). Goodale and
his colleagues (Goodale & Milner, 1992; Goodale & Westwood, 2004;
Goodale et al., 1994) suggest that the primary function of the dorsal
stream of the visual cortex is to guide actions rather than simply to
perceive spatial locations. Ungerleider and Mishkin (1982) originally
said the ventral and dorsal streams tell us "what" and "where." Goodale
and his colleagues suggested that better terms are "what" and "how."
First, they noted that the visual cortex of the posterior parietal lobe
is extensively connected to regions of the frontal lobe involved in
controlling eye movements, reaching movements of the limbs, and grasping
movements of the hands and fingers. Second, they noted that damage to
the dorsal stream can produce deficits in visually guided movements.
(Chapter 8 discusses in more detail the role of the posterior parietal
cortex in control of movements.) They cited the case of a woman with
damage to the dorsal stream who had no difficulty recognizing line
drawings (that is, her ventral stream was intact) but who had trouble
picking up objects (Jakobson et al., 1991). The patient could easily
perceive the difference in the size of wooden blocks that were set out
before her, but she failed to adjust the distance between her thumb and
forefinger to the size of the block she was about to pick up. In
contrast, a patient with profound visual agnosia caused by damage to the
ventral stream could not distinguish between wooden blocks of different
sizes but could adjust the distance between her thumb and forefinger
when she picked them up. She made this adjustment by means of vision
before she actually touched them (Goodale et al., 1994; Milner et al.,
1991). A functional-imaging study of

this patient (James et al., 2003) showed the expected activity in the
dorsal stream while she was picking up objects---especially in the
anterior intraparietal sulcus (AIP), which is involved in manipulating
and grasping. The suggestion by Goodale and his colleagues seems a
reasonable one. Certainly, the dorsal stream is involved in perception
of the location of object's space---but then, if its primary role is to
direct movements, it must be involved in location of these objects, or
else how could it direct movements toward them? In addition, it must
contain information about the size and shape of objects, or else how
could it control the distance between thumb and forefinger? Two
functional-imaging studies provide further evidence that the dorsal
stream is involved in visual control of movement. Valyear and colleagues
(2006) presented photographs of pairs of elongated stimuli, one after
the other, and noted which regions of the brain responded to the
difference between the two stimuli. They found that a region of the
ventral stream responded differentially to pairs of stimuli that
differed in their form (for example, a fork versus a clarinet) but did
not distinguish between the same object shown in different orientations
(for example, one tipped 45 degrees to the right of vertical and the
other tipped 45 degrees to the left). In contrast, a region of the
dorsal stream distinguished between different orientations but ignored
changes in the identity of the two objects. A follow-up study published
the next year (Rice et al., 2007) showed volunteers photographs of two
different types of objects: graspable ones, such as forks and hammers,
and ungraspable ones, such as tractors and pieces of furniture. The
investigators found that, as before, the region of the dorsal stream
ignored changes in the identity of the objects but distinguished between
orientations. However, the region distinguished between the orientations
only of stimuli that a person could grasp. This region did not
distinguish between the orientations of photos of stimuli that could not
be picked up, such as tractors and pieces of furniture.

extrastriate cortex in perceiving spatial location. Most neurons in the
striate cortex are binocular and contribute to depth perception via
retinal disparity. The disparitysensitive neurons found in the dorsal

extended visual surfaces, whereas those found in the ventral pathway,
which is involved in object perception, respond to the contours of
three-dimensional objects. Damage to regions

of the dorsal stream can impair three-dimensional spatial perception,
producing "flat vision." The dorsal stream of the extrastriate cortex
terminates in the parietal cortex, which is involved in spatial and
somatosensory perception. The parietal cortex receives visual, auditory,
somatosensory, and vestibular information to perform these tasks.
Single-unit studies with monkeys and functional-imaging studies with
humans indicate that neurons in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) are
involved in visual attention and control of saccadic eye movements (LIP
and VIP), visual control of reaching and pointing (VIP and MIP), visual
control of grasping and manipulating hand movements (AIP), and
perceiving depth from stereopsis (CIP).

Perceiving Orientation and Movement We need to know not only what things
are and where they are located, but also where they are going. Without
the ability to perceive the direction and velocity of the movement of
objects, we would have no way to predict where they will be. We would be
unable to catch the objects (or avoid letting them catch us). This
module examines the perception of movement.

Thought Question You attended a heavyweight boxing championship match,
as one of your close friends was competing for the championship. After
an intense fight, your friend won the title, but it was not easy---he
missed a few punches and felt dizzy and nauseous. A few days later, you
meet him at a party, and he is unable to recognize you. He also notes
that all objects as well as people around him ­appear "flat." What do you
think happened to your friend? Which brain areas could be involved and
how would you investigate it?

Role of the Striate Cortex LO 6.19 Explain the role of the striate
cortex in perceiving orientation. Most neurons in the striate cortex are
sensitive to orientation. That is, if a line or an edge (the border of a
light and a dark region) is positioned in the cell's receptive field and
rotated around its center, the cell will respond only when the line is
in a particular position---a particular orientation. Some neurons
respond best to a vertical line, some to a horizontal line, and some to
a line oriented somewhere in between. Figure 6.36 shows the responses of
a neuron in the striate cortex when lines were presented at various
orientations. As you can see, this neuron responded best when a vertical
line was presented in its receptive field. Information about orientation
is conveyed to the extrastriate cortex, where it is used to aid in
perceiving movement.

Role of the Extrastriate Cortex LO 6.20 Describe the role of the
extrastriate cortex in perceiving movement. Research with humans and
other animals has helped to reveal the role of the extrastriate cortex
in visual perception of movement.

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 185

Area V5 of the extrastriate cortex---also known as area MT, for medial
temporal---contains neurons that respond to movement. (See Figure 6.14.)
Damage to this region severely disrupts a monkey's ability to perceive
moving stimuli (Siegel & Andersen, 1986). Area V5 receives input
directly from the striate cortex and from several other regions of the
extrastriate cortex. It also receives input from the superior
colliculus, which is involved in visual reflexes, including reflexive
control of eye movements. Accurately determining the velocity and
direction of movement of an object is an important ability. That moving

STUDIES WITH LABORATORY ANIMALS

24/11/21 1:23 PM

186 Chapter 6 object could be a prey animal trying to run away, a
predator trying to catch you, or a projectile you are trying to catch
(or keep from hitting you). If we are to accurately track moving
objects, the information received by V5 must be up to date. In fact, the
axons that transmit information from the magnocellular system are thick
and heavily myelinated, which increases the rate at which they conduct
action potentials. Petersen and colleagues (1988) recorded the responses
of neurons in areas V4 and V5 and found that visual information reached
the V5 neurons sooner than it reached those in area V4, whose neurons
are involved in the analysis of form and color. The input from the
superior colliculus contributes in some way to the movement sensitivity
of neurons in area V5. Rodman and colleagues (1989, 1990) found that
destruction of the striate cortex or the superior colliculus alone does
not eliminate the movement sensitivity of V5 neurons, but destruction of
both areas does. The roles played by these two sources of input are not
yet known. Clearly, both inputs provide useful information; Seagraves
and colleagues (1987) found that monkeys still could detect movement
after lesions of the striate cortex but had difficulty estimating its
rate. A region adjacent to area V5, area MST, or medial superior
temporal, receives information about movement from V5 and performs a
further analysis. (See Figure 6.14.) MST neurons respond to complex
patterns of movement, including radial, circular, and spiral motion (see
Vaina, 1998 for a review). One important function of this region---in
particular, the dorsolateral MST, or MSTd--- appears to be analysis of
optic flow. As we move around in our environment or as objects in our
environment move in relation to us, the sizes, shapes, and locations of
environmental features on our retinas change. Imagine the image seen by
a video camera as you walk along a street, pointing the lens of the
camera straight in front of you. Suppose you will pass a mailbox to the
left. The image of the mailbox will slowly get larger. Finally, as you
pass the mailbox, its image will veer to the left and disappear. Points
on the sidewalk will move downward, and branches of trees that you pass
under will move upward. Analysis of the relative movement of the visual
elements of your environment---the optic flow---will tell you where you
are going, how fast you are approaching different items in front of you,
and whether you will pass to the left or right of (or under or over)
these items. The point toward which we are moving does not move, but all
other points in the visual scene move away from it. This point is called
the center of expansion. If we keep moving in the same direction, we
will eventually bump into an object that lies at the center of
expansion. We can also use optic flow to determine whether an object
approaching us will hit us or pass us by.

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 186

Bradley et al. (1996) recorded from single units in MSTd of monkeys and
found that particular neurons responded selectively to the center of
expansion located in particular regions of the visual field. These
neurons compensated for eye movements, which means that their activity
identified the location in the environment toward which an animal was
moving. Britten and van Wezel (1998) found that electrical stimulation
of MSTd disrupted monkeys' ability to perceive the apparent direction in
which they were heading. In this way, these neurons do indeed seem to
play an essential role in heading estimation derived from optic flow.
Research with human participants has been essential in improving
understanding of the functions of extrastriate cortex in the perception
of motion, optic flow, form from motion, biological motion, and the
compensation of eye movements in motion. STUDIES WITH HUMANS

Perception of Motion Functional-imaging studies suggest that
motion-sensitive area V5 is found within the inferior temporal sulcus of
the human brain (Dukelow et al., 2001). However, a more recent study
suggests that this region is located in the lateral occipital cortex,
between the lateral and inferior occipital sulci (Annese et al., 2005).
Annese and his colleagues examined sections of the brains of deceased
individuals that had been stained for the presence of myelin. As we just
saw, area V5 receives a dense projection of thick, heavily myelinated
axons, and the location of this region was revealed by the myelin stain.
Bilateral damage to the human brain that includes area V5 produces an
inability to perceive movement--- akinetopsia. Instead of a smooth
progression of movement in their environment, individuals with
akinetopsia experience a series of still images that appear to refresh
periodically. For example, Zihl and colleagues (1991) reported the case
of a woman (L. M.) with bilateral lesions of the lateral occipital
cortex and area V5. Patient L. M. had an almost total loss of movement
perception. She was unable to cross a street without traffic lights
because she could not judge the speed at which cars were moving.
Although she could perceive movements, she found moving objects very
unpleasant to look at. For example, while talking with another person,
she avoided looking at the person's mouth because she found its
movements very disturbing. When the investigators asked her to try to
detect movements of a visual target in the laboratory, she said, "First
the target is completely at rest. Then it suddenly jumps upwards and
downwards" (Zihl et al., 1991, pp. 22--44). She was able to see that the
target was constantly changing its position, but she was unaware of any
sensation of movement.

Walsh and colleagues (1998) used TMS to temporarily inactivate area V5
in a control group of volunteers. The investigators found that during
the TMS procedure people

24/11/21 1:23 PM

Vision 187

were unable to detect which of several objects displayed on a computer
screen was moving. When the current was off, the volunteers had no
trouble detecting the motion. The current had no effect on the
volunteers' ability to detect stimuli that varied in their form.

Figure 6.37 Perceiving Form from Motion An example of the stimuli used
in research used to study form from motion.

Optic Flow As we saw, neurons in area MSTd of the monkey brain respond
to optic flow, an important source of information about the direction in
which the animal is heading. A functional-imaging study by Peuskens and
colleagues (2001) found that area V5 became active when people judged
their heading while viewing a display showing optic flow. Vaina and her
colleagues (Jornales et al., 1997; Vaina, 1998) found that people with
lesions that included this region were able to perceive motion but could
not perceive heading from optic flow. Building on these findings,
imaging studies of healthy volunteers extended the regions involved in
optic flow to include additional areas of the extrastriate cortex, such
as V6, an area involved in distinguishing motion of an object from
motion of an observer (Pitzalis et al., 2013). Form from Motion
Perception of movement can even help us to perceive three-dimensional
forms---a phenomenon known as form from motion. Johansson (1973)
demonstrated just how much information we derive from movement. He
dressed actors in black and attached small lights to several points on
their bodies, such as their wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, and
feet. He made movies of the actors in a darkened room while they were
performing various behaviors, such as walking, running, jumping,
limping, doing push-ups, and dancing with a partner who was also
equipped with lights. Even though observers who watched the films could
see only a pattern of moving lights against a dark background, they
could readily perceive the pattern as belonging to a moving human and
could identify the behavior the actor was performing. Subsequent studies
(Barclay et al., 1978; Kozlowski & Cutting, 1977) showed that people
could even tell, with reasonable accuracy, the sex of the actor wearing
the lights. The cues appeared to be supplied by the relative amounts of
movement of the shoulders and hips as the person walked. Figure 6.37
shows an example of the points used to convey form from motion in this
type of research. McCleod and colleagues (1996) suggest that the ability
to perceive form from motion does not involve area V5. They reported
that patient L. M. (studied by Zihl et al., 1991) could recognize people
depicted solely by moving points of light even though she could not
perceive the movements themselves. Vaina and her colleagues (reported by
Vaina, 1998) described a patient with a lesion in the medial right
occipital lobe who showed just the opposite deficits: Patient R. A.
could perceive movement---even complex radial and circular optic
flow---but could not perceive form

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 187

from motion. This must mean that perception of motion and perception of
form from motion involve different regions of the visual association
cortex. A functional-imaging study by Grossman and colleagues (2000)
found that when people viewed a video that showed form from motion, a
small region on the ventral bank of the posterior end of the superior
temporal sulcus became active. More activity was seen in the right
hemisphere, whether the images were presented to the left or right
visual field. Grossman and Blake (2001) found that this region became
active even when people imagined that they were watching points of light
representing form from motion. (See Figure 6.38.) Grossman and
colleagues (2005) found that inactivation of this area with TMS
disrupted perception of form from motion. Perceiving form from motion
might not seem like a phenomenon that has any importance outside the
laboratory. However, this phenomenon does occur under natural
circumstances, and it appears to involve brain mechanisms different from
those involved in normal object perception. For example, as we saw in
the prologue to this chapter, people with visual agnosia can often still
perceive actions (such as someone pretending to stir something in a
bowl) even though they cannot recognize objects by sight. They

may be able to recognize friends by the way they walk, even though they
cannot recognize the friends' faces. Lê and colleagues (2002) reported
the case of patient S. B., a 30-year-old man whose ventral stream was
damaged bilaterally by an infection when he was 3 years old. As a
result, he was unable to recognize objects, faces, textures, or colors.
However, he could perceive movement and could even catch a ball that was
thrown to him. Furthermore, he could recognize other people's arm and
hand movements that mimed common activities such as cutting something
with a knife or brushing one's teeth, and he could recognize people he
knew by their gait. Biological Motion As we saw earlier in this chapter,
neurons in the extrastriate body area (EBA) are activated by the sight
of human body parts. A functional-imaging study by Pelphrey and
colleagues (2005) showed participants a computer-generated image of a
person who made hand, eye, and mouth movements. (Note that the
participants were perceiving motion made by a human being, not form from
the motion of individual points of light as described in the previous
subsection.) The investigators found that movements of different body
parts activated different locations just anterior to the EBA.
Compensation for Eye Movements So far, this discussion has been confined
to movement of objects in the visual field. But if a person moves his or
her eyes, head, or whole body, the image on the retina will move even if
everything within the person's visual field remains stable. Often, of
course, both kinds of movements will occur at the same time. The problem
for the visual system is to determine

M06_CARL0287_13_GE_C06.indd 188

which of these images are produced by movements of objects in the
environment and which are produced by the person's own eye, head, and
body movements. To illustrate this problem, think about how a paragraph
of text looks as you read it. If we could make a recording of one of
your retinas, we would see that the image of the text projected there is
in constant movement as your eyes make several saccades along a line and
then snap back to the beginning of the next line. Yet the text seems
perfectly still to you. On the other hand, if you look at a single point
(say, a period at the end of a sentence) and then move the image around
while following the period with your eyes, you perceive the text as
moving, even though the image on your retina remains relatively stable.
(Try it.) Then think about the images on your retina while you are
driving in busy traffic, constantly moving your eyes around to keep
track of your own location and that of other cars moving in different
directions at different speeds. You are perceiving not only the simple
movement of objects but optic flow as well, which helps you keep track
of the trajectories of the objects relative to each other and to
yourself. Haarmeier and colleagues (1997) reported the case of a patient
with bilateral damage to the extrastriate cortex who could not
compensate for image movement caused by head and eye movements. When the
patient moved his eyes, it looked to him as if the world was moving in
the opposite direction. Without the ability to compensate for head and
eye movements, any movement of a retinal image was perceived as movement
of the environment. On the basis of evidence from EEG and MEG
(magnetoencephalography) studies in human participants and single-unit
recordings in monkeys, Their and colleagues (2001) suggest that this
compensation involves extrastriate cortex located at the junction of the
temporal and parietal lobes near a region involved in the analysis of
signals from the vestibular system. Indeed, the investigators note that
when patients with damage to this region move their eyes, the lack of
compensation for these movements makes them feel very dizzy. This
chapter explored the structures and functions of the visual system
related to perceiving color, form, spatial location, orientation, and
movement. Although these sections included a lot of information, you may
have noticed themes. For example, each type of perception involved areas
of the striate cortex, extrastriate cortex, and the dorsal and ventral
processing streams. Much of this information has been summarized in
Table 6.3 to help you organize and review your new knowledge of vision.

Audition, the Body Senses, and the Chemical Senses

Thirteen-year-old Ashlyn was in the kitchen, stirring ramen noodles when
she dropped the spoon into the pot of boiling water. Without thinking,
she reached her right hand in to retrieve the spoon, then took her hand
out of the water and stood looking at it, emotionless. She walked to the
sink and ran cold water over her hands and the many faded white scars
from previous accidents. She then called to her mother, who rushed to
her daughter's side with ice and pressed it against her daughter's hand,
relieved that the burn wasn't worse. Throughout her childhood, Ashlyn
was asked lots of questions from her schoolmates and friends. Was she
Superman? Could she feel pain from a punch to the face? Could she walk
across burning coals as if she were walking on grass? Would it

Ashlyn and Jo have congenital insensitivity to pain. Due to a gene
mutation, Ashlyn's nervous system developed without functional
nociceptors. Nociceptors are specialized neurons activated by painful
stimuli. You'll read more about nociceptors and pathways in the
somatosenses module of this chapter. A genetic mutation in a gene for
FAAH (the enzyme that deactivates endocannabinoids; see Chapter 4)
produced elevated levels of the endocannabinoids responsible for Jo's
lack of pain and anxiety, and possibly her accelerated healing (Habib et
al., 2019). Ashlyn and Jo's case studies highlight several important
concepts from this chapter, including the role of specialized
somatosensory receptors and the importance of the senses in guiding our
behavior. People often say that we have five senses: sight, hearing,
smell, taste, and touch. Actually, we have more than five, but even
experts disagree about how the lines between the various categories
should be drawn. For example, we could add the vestibular senses that
control movement and balance in space to the list of senses, or consider
a sense arising from cells capable of transducing the earth's
geomagnetic fields (Wang et al., 2019). Reflecting the areas of greatest
sensory research, however, this chapter contains five modules: audition,
the vestibular system, the somatosenses, gustation, and olfaction. All
are vital to how we perceive and navigate the world around us.

hurt if she were stabbed in the arm? The answers are no, no, yes, no.
She can feel pressure and texture. She can feel a hug and a handshake.
She cannot feel pain (Heckert, 2012). Seventy-one-year-old Jo surprised
her doctors when she declined pain medication following invasive hand
surgery and rated her postsurgical pain 0/10. She felt no pain during
dental procedures, when receiving stitches, during the birth of her
children, or when her hip was severely degenerated and needed to be
replaced. She had trouble recognizing when she had been burned or cut.
Jo's case held more surprises for researchers: Her injuries seemed to
heal faster than anyone expected, and she never experienced anxiety
(Habib et al., 2019; Murphy, 2019).

source of a sound is but also where it is located. This module describes
the nature of the stimulus, the sensory receptors, the brain mechanisms
devoted to audition, and some of the details of the physiology of
auditory perception.

The Stimulus: Sound LO 7.1

Describe three perceptual dimensions of sound.

We hear sounds, which are produced by objects that vibrate and set
molecules of air into motion. When an object vibrates, its movements
cause molecules of air surrounding it to alternate between compressing
and expanding, producing waves that travel away from the object at
approximately 1,200 kilometers (km) per hour. If the vibration ranges
between approximately 30 and 20,000 times per second, these waves will
stimulate receptor cells in human ears and will be perceived as sounds.
(See Figure 7.1.) In Chapter 6 we saw that light has three perceptual
dimensions---hue, brightness, and saturation---that correspond to three
physical dimensions. Similarly, sounds vary in their pitch, loudness,
and timbre. The perceived pitch of an auditory stimulus is determined by
the frequency of vibration, which is measured in hertz (Hz), or cycles
per

Figure 7.1 Sound Waves

Audition Hearing, or audition, has three primary functions: to detect
sounds, to determine the location of their sources, and to recognize the
identity of these sources, which helps us understand their meaning and
relevance to us (Heffner & Heffner, 1990; Yost, 1991). The auditory
system does a phenomenal job of analyzing the vibrations that reach our
ears. For example, we can understand speech, recognize a person's
emotion from his or her voice, appreciate music, detect the approach of
a vehicle or another person, or recognize an animal's call. We can
recognize not only what the

second. Loudness is a function of intensity---the degree to which the
compressions and expansions of air differ from each other. More vigorous
vibrations of an object produce more intense sound waves and hence
louder ones. Timbre provides information about the nature of the
particular sound---for example, the sound of an oboe or a train whistle.
Most natural acoustic stimuli are complex, consisting of several
different frequencies of vibration. The particular mixture determines
the sound's timbre. (See Figure 7.2.)

shows the outer anatomy of the ear and auditory canal and illustrates
many of the structures of the middle and inner ear. OUTER EAR Sound is
funneled via the pinna (external ear) through the ear canal to the
tympanic membrane (eardrum), which vibrates with the sound. When the
tympanic membrane is damaged by trauma, infection, or autoimmune attack,
hearing is impaired, particularly for sounds with low frequencies (Mehta
et al., 2006). Demonstrating the role of the pinna in sound
localization, researchers created inserts that altered the shape of the
pinna and asked volunteers to wear the inserts in one ear for up to six
weeks. The volunteers' ability to localize the source of various sounds
was significantly disrupted at first. After several days, however,
auditory adaptation occurred, and the volunteers were able to accurately
determine the location of sounds (Hofman et al., 1998).

Organize the structures and functions of the ear involved in auditory
processing.

The middle ear consists of a small hollow region behind the tympanic
membrane. It contains the bones of the middle ear, called the ossicles,
which are set into vibration by the tympanic membrane. The malleus
(hammer) connects with the tympanic membrane and transmits vibrations
via the incus (anvil) and stapes (stirrup) to the cochlea, the structure
that contains the receptors. The bottom of the stapes presses against
the membrane behind the oval window, the opening in the bone surrounding
the cochlea. (Look again at Figure 7.3.)

The anatomy of the ear helps to direct sound waves to the auditory
receptors. Structures of the ear can be organized by their location in
the outer, middle, and inner ear. Figure 7.3

INNER EAR The cochlea is part of the inner ear. It is filled with fluid,
and sounds transmitted through the air must be transferred into its
liquid medium. This process

normally is very inefficient---99.9 percent of the energy of airborne
sound would be reflected away if the air impinged directly against the
oval window of the cochlea. The chain of ossicles, however, serves as an
efficient means of energy transmission. The bones provide a mechanical
advantage, with the baseplate of the stapes making smaller but more
forceful excursions against the oval window than the tympanic membrane
makes against the malleus. The name cochlea comes from the Greek word
kokhlos, or "land snail." It is indeed snail-shaped, consisting of two
and three-quarters turns of a gradually tapering cylinder, 35 mm long.
The cochlea is divided longitudinally into three sections, the scala
vestibuli ("entrance stairway"), the scala media ("middle stairway"),
and the scala tympani ("tympanic stairway"), as shown in Figure 7.4. The
receptive organ, known as the organ of Corti, consists of the basilar
membrane, the hair cells, and the tectorial membrane. The auditory
receptor cells are called hair cells, and they are anchored, via rodlike
Deiters's cells, to the basilar membrane. The cilia of the hair cells
pass through the reticular membrane, and the ends of some of the hair
cells attach to the fairly rigid

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 195

tectorial membrane, which is located overhead like a shelf. Sound waves
cause the basilar membrane to move relative to the tectorial membrane,
which bends the cilia of the hair cells. This bending produces receptor
potentials. The vibratory energy exerted on the oval window causes the
basilar membrane to bend. The portion of the basilar membrane that bends
the most is determined by the frequency of the sound: High-frequency
sounds cause the base of the membrane---the end nearest the oval
window---to bend. A flexible membrane-covered opening, the round window,
allows the fluid inside the cochlea to move back and forth. The base of
the stapes vibrates against the membrane behind the oval window and
introduces sound waves of high or low frequency into the cochlea. The
vibrations cause part of the basilar membrane to flex back and forth.
Pressure changes in the fluid underneath the basilar membrane are
transmitted to the membrane of the round window. When the base of the
stapes pushes in, the membrane behind the round window bulges out. As we
will see in a later submodule, different frequencies of sound vibrations
cause different portions of the basilar membrane to flex. (See Figure
7.5.)

Auditory Hair Cells Transduce Auditory Information LO 7.3

Contrast the location and function of hair cells in auditory
transduction.

Two types of auditory receptors, inner and outer auditory hair cells,
are located on the basilar membrane. Hair cells contain cilia, fine
hairlike projections, arranged in rows according to height. The human
cochlea contains approximately 3,500 inner hair cells and 12,000 outer
hair cells. The hair cells form synapses with dendrites of bipolar
neurons whose axons bring auditory information to the brain. The inner
hair cells are necessary for normal hearing. In fact, mutant mice whose
cochleas contain only outer hair cells apparently cannot hear at all
(Deol & GluecksohnWaelsch, 1979). The outer hair cells are effector
cells, involved in altering the mechanical characteristics of the
basilar membrane and influencing the effects of sound vibrations on the
inner hair cells. We will discuss the role of outer hair cells in the
section on place coding of pitch. The bases of the cilia are attached to
the basilar membrane, while the tips of the cilia of outer hair cells
are attached to the tectorial membrane above. Sound waves cause both the
basilar membrane and the tectorial membrane to flex up and down. These
movements bend the cilia of the hair cells in one direction or the
other. The cilia of the inner hair cells do not touch the overlying
tectorial membrane, but the relative movement of the two membranes
causes the fluid within the cochlea to flow past them, making them bend
back and forth, too. Cilia contain a core of actin filaments surrounded
by myosin filaments, and these proteins make the cilia rigid (Flock,
1977). Adjacent cilia are linked to each other by

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 196

A particular region of the basilar membrane flexes back and forth in
response to sound of a particular frequency

elastic filaments known as tip links. Each tip link is attached to the
end of one cilium and to the side of an adjacent cilium. The points of
attachment, known as insertional plaques, look dark under an electron
microscope. Receptor potentials are triggered at the insertional
plaques. Normally, tip links are slightly stretched, which means that
they are under a small amount of tension. Moving the bundle toward the
tallest cilium stretches these linking fibers, generating a high rate of
action potentials. Moving the bundle in the opposite direction (toward
the shortest cilium) relaxes the linking fibers, resulting in a low rate
of action potentials. (See Figure 7.6.) Unlike the fluid that surrounds
most neurons, the fluid that surrounds the auditory hair cells is rich
in potassium. Each insertional plaque contains a single cation channel,
identified as TRPA1, a member of the transient receptor potential cation
channel, subfamily A, type 1 (Corey et al., 2004). (We mention the TRP
family of receptors because this family includes receptors involved in
perceiving touch, temperature, and taste, and you will encounter them
again later in the chapter.) When the bundle of cilia is straight, the
probability of an individual ion channel being open is approximately 10
percent. This means that a small amount of the cations K+ and Ca2+
diffuses into the cilium. When the bundle moves toward the tallest
cilium, the increased tension on the tip links opens all the ion
channels, the flow of cations into the cilia increases, and the membrane
depolarizes. As a result, the release of neurotransmitter by the hair
cell increases. When the bundle moves in the opposite direction, toward
the shortest cilium, the relaxation of the tip links allows the opened
ion channels to close. The influx of cations ceases, the membrane
hyperpolarizes, and the release of neurotransmitter decreases.

The Auditory Pathway LO 7.4

Describe the components of the auditory pathway.

The auditory pathway consists of the structures of the ear, as well as
the cochlear nerve, subcortical structures, and the auditory cortex.
AFFERENT CONNECTIONS WITH THE COCHLEAR NERVE The organ of Corti sends
auditory information

to the brain by means of the cochlear nerve. The cochlear

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 197

nerve is a bundle of axons of bipolar neurons that send auditory
information to the brain. The cell bodies of these bipolar neurons
reside in the cochlear nerve ganglion. These unique neurons have axonal
processes that protrude from both ends of the soma and convey an action
potential. One end of the axonal process acts like a dendrite,
responding with excitatory postsynaptic potentials when neurotransmitter
is released by the auditory hair cells. The excitatory postsynaptic
potentials trigger action potentials in the auditory nerve axons, which
form synapses with neurons in the medulla. (Refer back to Figure 7.4.)

24/11/21 1:27 PM

198 Chapter 7

well as afferent ones. The source of the efferent axons is the superior
olivary complex, a group of nuclei in the medulla. The efferent fibers
constitute the olivocochlear bundle. The fibers form synapses directly
on outer hair cells and on the dendrites that serve the inner hair
cells. While the excitatory neurotransmitter at the afferent synapses is
glutamate, the efferent terminal buttons secrete acetylcholine, which
has an inhibitory effect on the hair cells. Why would neurons in the
brain need to send messages to the cochlea? Several functions of this
inhibitory pathway have been proposed, including a protective mechanism
to prevent noise-induced damage to the cochlea (Ciuman, 2010; 2013).

Note that axons enter the cochlear nucleus of the medulla and synapse
there. Most of the neurons in the cochlear nucleus send axons to the
superior olivary complex, also located in the medulla. Axons of neurons
in these nuclei pass through a large fiber bundle called the lateral
lemniscus to the inferior colliculus, located in the dorsal midbrain.
Neurons there send their axons to the medial geniculate nucleus of the
thalamus, which sends its axons to the auditory cortex of the temporal
lobe. Each hemisphere of the brain receives information from both ears
but primarily from the contralateral one. Some auditory information also
makes its way to the cerebellum and reticular formation. Altogether,
subcortical auditory processing requires many neurons and synapses in
complex networks that span multiple regions of the brain.

The anatomy of the subcortical components of the auditory system is more
complicated than that of the visual system. Rather than giving a
detailed verbal description of the pathways here, we will refer you to
Figure 7.7.

AUDITORY CORTEX Let's take a closer look at the final destination of the
auditory pathway: the auditory cortex. The auditory cortex has a unique
relationship with the basilar membrane in the cochlea. The frequency map
of the basilar membrane is preserved through processing in

the subcortical structures and mapped in the primary auditory cortex.
(See Figure 7.8.) The basal end of the basilar membrane (the end toward
the oval window, which responds to the highest frequencies) is
represented most medially in the auditory cortex, and the apical end
(the end farther from the oval window, which responds to the lowest
frequencies) is represented most laterally there. Because, as we will
see, different parts of the basilar membrane respond best to different
frequencies of sound, this relationship between cortex and basilar
membrane is referred to as tonotopic representation (tonos means "tone,"
and topos means "place"). Hierarchical Organization in the Auditory
Cortex As we saw in Chapter 6, the visual cortex is arranged in a
hierarchy. Modules in the striate cortex (primary visual cortex) analyze
features of visual information and pass the results of this analysis to
regions of the extrastriate cortex (visual association areas) that
surround the striate cortex, which perform further analyses and pass
information on to other regions, culminating in the most complex levels
of visual processing in the parietal and inferior temporal lobes. The
auditory cortex seems to be similarly arranged. The primary auditory
cortex lies hidden on the upper bank of the lateral fissure. The core
region, which contains the

Corresponds to apex of cochlea

primary auditory cortex, actually consists of three regions, each of
which receives a separate tonotopic map of auditory information from the
ventral division from the medial geniculate nucleus. The first level of
auditory association cortex, the belt region, surrounds the primary
auditory cortex, much as the extrastriate cortex surrounds the primary
visual (striate) cortex. The belt region, which consists of at least
seven divisions, receives information both from the primary auditory
cortex and from the dorsal and medial divisions of the medial geniculate
nucleus (subcortical auditory processing regions). The highest level of
auditory association cortex, the parabelt region, located ventral to the
lateral parabelt, receives information from the belt region and from the
divisions of the medial geniculate nucleus that also project to the belt
­region. (See Figure 7.9.) Two Streams in the Auditory Cortex As we saw
in C ­ hapter 6, processing in the extrastriate cortex is arranged in two
streams---dorsal and ventral. The dorsal stream, which ends in the
parietal cortex, is involved in perceiving location ("where"), while the
ventral stream, which ends in the inferior temporal cortex, is involved
in perceiving form ("what"). Processing in the auditory association
cortex is similarly arranged in two streams. The anterior stream, which
begins in the anterior parabelt region, is involved

with analyzing complex sounds. The posterior stream, which begins in the
posterior parabelt region, is involved with sound localization
(Rauschecker & Scott, 2009; Rauschecker & Tian, 2000). (Look again at
Figure 7.9.)

Perceiving Pitch LO 7.5

Contrast place and rate coding in pitch perception.

As you saw in the previous section, the perceptual dimension of pitch
corresponds to the physical dimension of frequency. The cochlea detects
frequency by two means: Moderate to high frequencies are detected by
place coding, and low frequencies are detected by rate coding. These two
types of coding are described next. PLACE CODING Due to the mechanical
construction of the cochlea and basilar membrane, acoustic stimuli of
different frequencies cause different parts of the basilar membrane to
flex back and forth. This suggests that at least some frequencies of
sound waves are detected by means of a place code. For example, if
neurons at one end of the basilar membrane are excited by higher
frequencies and those at the other end are excited by lower frequencies,
we can say that the frequency of the sound is coded by the particular
neurons that are active. In turn, the firing of particular axons in the
cochlear nerve tells the brain about the presence of specific
frequencies of sound. Evidence for place coding of pitch comes from
several sources. High doses of antibiotic drugs produce degeneration of
the auditory hair cells. The damage begins at the basal end of the
cochlea and progresses toward the apical end. The progressive death of
hair cells induced by an antibiotic closely parallels a progressive
hearing loss: The

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 200

highest frequencies are the first to be lost, and the lowest are the
last. High-frequency hearing loss can also be caused by exposure to loud
sounds. Cochlear Implants Evidence for place coding of pitch in the
human cochlea comes from the effectiveness of cochlear implants.
Cochlear implants are devices that are used to restore hearing in people
with deafness caused by damage to the hair cells. The external part of a
cochlear implant consists of a microphone and a miniaturized electronic
signal processor. The internal part contains a very thin, flexible array
of electrodes, which the surgeon carefully inserts into the cochlea in
such a way that it follows the snail-like curl and ends up resting along
the entire length of the basilar membrane. Each electrode in the array
stimulates a different part of the basilar membrane. Information from
the signal processor is passed to the electrodes by means of flat coils
of wire, implanted under the skin. (See Figure 7.10.) Cochlear implants
are most useful for two groups of people with hearing loss: individuals
who became deaf in adulthood and very young children (Moore & Shannon,
2009). The primary purpose of a cochlear implant is to restore a
person's ability to understand speech. Because most of the important
acoustical information in speech is contained in frequencies that are
too high to be accurately represented by a rate code, the multichannel
electrode was developed in an attempt to duplicate the place coding of
pitch on the basilar membrane (Copeland & Pillsbury, 2004). When
different regions of the basilar membrane are stimulated, the person
perceives sounds with different pitches. The signal processor in the
external device analyzes the sounds detected by the microphone and sends
separate signals to the appropriate portions of the basilar membrane.
Like other people who closely identify with their cultures, many members
of the Deaf community are proud of their shared experience and language.
Some deaf people say that if they were given the opportunity to hear,
for example through a cochlear implant, they might refuse it. You can
find more information about brain processing of non-spoken language
(such as American Sign Language) in Chapter 14.

The previous section described how the frequency of a sound can be
detected by place coding. However, the lowest frequency sounds do not
appear to be accounted for in this manner. Lower-frequency sounds are
detected by neurons that fire in synchrony with the movements of the
apical end of the basilar membrane. Lowerfrequency sounds are detected
by means of rate coding. The most convincing evidence of rate coding of
pitch also comes from studies of people with cochlear implants. Pijl and
Schwarz (1995a, 1995b) found that stimulating a single electrode with
pulses of electricity produced sensations RATE CODING

of pitch that were proportional to the frequency of the stimulation. In
fact, the participants could even recognize familiar tunes produced by
modulating the pulse frequency. (The participants had become deaf later
in life, after they had already learned to recognize the tunes.) As we
would expect, the participants' perceptions were best when the tip of
the basilar membrane was stimulated, and only low frequencies could be
distinguished by this method.

Perceiving Loudness LO 7.6

Contrast how loudness in high- and low-frequency sounds is represented.

The cochlea is an extremely sensitive organ. In very quiet environments,
a healthy ear is limited in its ability to detect sounds in the air by
the masking noise of blood rushing through the cranial blood vessels
rather than by the sensitivity of the auditory system itself.

The axons of the cochlear nerve appear to inform the brain of the
loudness of a stimulus by altering their rate of firing action
potentials. Louder sounds produce more intense vibrations of the eardrum
and ossicles, which produce a more intense shearing force on the cilia
of the auditory hair cells. As a result, these cells release more
neurotransmitter, producing a higher rate of firing by the cochlear
nerve axons. This explanation seems simple for the axons involved in
place coding of pitch. In this case, pitch is signaled by which neurons
fire, and loudness is signaled by their rate of firing. However, the
neurons in the apex of the basilar membrane that signal the lowest
frequencies do so by their rate of firing. If they fire more frequently,
they signal a higher pitch. Therefore, most investigators believe that
the loudness of low-frequency sounds is signaled by the number of axons
arising from these neurons that are active at a given time. (See Table
7.1.)

Table 7.1 Perception of Pitch and Loudness for High-, Moderate-, and

Perceiving Timbre LO 7.7

Identify the characteristics of timbre.

Although laboratory investigations of the auditory system often use
single-frequency sound stimuli, these sounds are seldom encountered
outside the laboratory. Instead, we hear sounds with a rich mixture of
frequencies---sounds of complex timbre. For example, consider the sound
of a flute playing a particular note. If we hear it, we can identify it
as a flute and not a piano or a violin. The reason we can do so is that
these three instruments produce sounds of different timbre, which our
auditory system can distinguish. The flute note possesses a fundamental
frequency, which corresponds to the perceived pitch of the note. The
note also has many overtones, frequencies of complex tones that occur at
multiples of the fundamental frequency. Different instruments produce
overtones with different intensities. Electronic synthesizers simulate
the sounds of real instruments by producing a series of overtones of the

proper intensities, mixing them, and passing them through a speaker.
Figure 7.11 illustrates the fundamental frequency and overtones of a
clarinet. When the basilar membrane is stimulated by the sound of an
instrument, different portions respond to each of the overtones. This
response produces a unique anatomically coded pattern of activity in the
cochlear nerve, which is subsequently identified by circuits in the
auditory association cortex. Actually, the recognition of complex sounds
is not quite that simple. The earlier explanation only applies to the
analysis of the sustained sound of a flute. Most sounds are dynamic;
that is, their beginning, middle, and end are different from each other.
The beginning of a note played on a flute (the attack) contains
frequencies that appear and disappear in a few milliseconds. At the end
of the note (the decay), some frequencies disappear before others. If we
are to recognize different sounds, the auditory cortex must analyze a
complex sequence of multiple frequencies that appear, change in
amplitude, and disappear. And when you consider the fact that we can
listen to an orchestra and identify several instruments that are playing
simultaneously, you can appreciate the complexity of the analysis
performed by the auditory system.

Perceiving Spatial Location LO 7.8

So far, we have discussed coding of pitch, loudness, and timbre (the
last of which is actually a complex frequency analysis). The auditory
system also responds to other qualities of acoustic stimuli. For
example, our ears are very good at determining whether the source of a
sound is to the right or left of us. Three physiological mechanisms
detect the location of sound sources: We use phase differences for low
frequencies (less than approximately 3,000 Hz) and intensity differences
for high frequencies; in addition, we use an analysis of timbre to
determine the height of the source of a sound and recognize whether it
is in front of us or behind us.

LOCALIZATION BY MEANS OF ARRIVAL TIME AND PHASE DIFFERENCES Even without
visual information,

we can still determine with a rather good accuracy the location of a
stimulus that emits a click. We are most accurate at judging the
azimuth---that is, the horizontal (left or right) angle of the source of
the sound relative to the midline of our body. Neurons in our auditory
system respond selectively to different arrival times of the sound waves
at the left and right ears. If the source of the click is to the right
or left of the midline, the sound pressure wave will reach one ear
sooner and initiate action potentials there first. Only if the stimulus
is straight ahead will the ears be stimulated simultaneously. Many
neurons in the auditory system

respond to sounds presented to either ear. Some of these neurons,
especially those in the superior olivary complex of the medulla, respond
according to the difference in arrival times of sound waves produced by
clicks presented binaurally (that is, to both ears). Their response
rates reflect differences as small as a fraction of a millisecond. Of
course, we can hear continuous sounds as well as clicks, and we can also
perceive the location of their source. We detect the source of
continuous low-pitched sounds by means of phase differences. Phase
differences refer to the simultaneous arrival, at each ear, of different
portions (phases) of the oscillating sound wave. For example, if we
assume that sound travels at approximately 1,200 km per hour through the
air, adjacent cycles of a 1,000 Hz tone are approximately 30 centimeters
(cm) apart. This means that if the source of the sound is located to one
side of the head, one eardrum is pulled out while the other is pushed
in. The movement of the eardrums will reverse, or be 180° out of phase.
If the source were located directly in front of the head, the movements
would be perfectly in phase (0° out of phase). (See Figure 7.12.)
Because some auditory neurons respond only when the eardrums (and the
bending of the basilar membrane) are at least somewhat out of phase,
neurons in the superior olivary complex in the brain are able to use the
information they provide to detect the source of a continuous sound.
Neurons receive information from two sets of axons coming from the two
ears. Each neuron serves as a coincidence detector; it responds only if
it received signals simultaneously from synapses belonging to both sets
of axons. If a signal reaches the two ears simultaneously, neurons in
the middle of the array will fire. However, if the signal reaches one
ear before the other, then neurons

(b) 

farther away from the "early" ear will be stimulated (Jeffress, 1948).
(See Figure 7.13.) Coincidence detectors can be studied in the barn owl,
a nocturnal bird that can detect very accurately the source of a sound
(such as that made by an unfortunate mouse). (See Figure 7.14.) The
branches of two axons, one from each ear, project to the nucleus
laminaris, the barn owl analog of the mammalian medial superior olivary
complex. Axons from the ipsilateral and contralateral ears enter the
nucleus from opposite directions. This means that dorsally located
neurons within the nucleus are stimulated by sounds that first reach the
contralateral ear. Carr and Konishi (1989, 1990) recorded from single
units within the nucleus and found that the response characteristics of
the neurons located there were consistent with the coincidence-detector
model. LOCALIZATION BY MEANS OF INTENSITY DIFFERENCES The auditory
system cannot readily detect bin-

aural phase differences of high-frequency stimuli; the differences in
phases of such rapid sine waves are just too short to be measured by the
neurons. However, highfrequency stimuli that occur to the right or left
of the midline stimulate the ears unequally. The head absorbs high
frequencies, producing a "sonic shadow," so the ear closest to the
source of the sound receives the most intense stimulation. Some neurons
in the auditory system respond differentially to binaural stimuli of
different intensity in each ear, which means that they provide
information that can be used to detect the source of tones of high
frequency. The neurons that detect binaural differences in loudness are
located in the superior olivary complex. But whereas neurons that detect
binaural differences in phase

We just saw that left--right localization of the source of high- and
lowfrequency sounds is accomplished by two different mechanisms:
differences in phase and intensity. But how can we determine the
elevation of the source of a sound and perceive whether it is in front
of us or behind us? One answer is that we can turn and tilt our heads,
to transform the discrimination into a left--right decision. But we have
another means by which we can determine elevation and distinguish front
from back: analysis of timbre. This method involves a part of the
auditory system that we have not said much about: the external ear
(pinna). People's external ears contain several folds and ridges. Most
of the sound waves that we hear bounce off the folds and ridges of the
pinna before they enter the ear canal. Depending on the angle at which
the sound waves strike these folds and ridges, different frequencies
will be enhanced or attenuated. In other words, the pattern of
reflections will change with the location of the source of the sound,
which will alter the timbre of the sound that is perceived. Sounds
coming from behind the head will sound different from those coming from
above the head or in front of it, and sounds coming from above will
sound different from those coming from the level of our ears. The timbre
of sounds that reaches an ear changes along with the elevation of the
source of the sound. Figure 7.15 shows the effects of elevation on the
intensity of sounds of various frequencies received at

the timbre of sounds caused by changes in the height of their sources,
which they could see. In contrast, the ability of individuals who were
blind to perceive the horizontal location of the sources of sounds was
equal to that of sighted people. Blind individuals have much experience
navigating to and around the sources of sounds located at ground level
(and objects that reflect sounds, such as that of a tapping cane). These
perceptions can be calibrated by physical contact with these objects.
Kumpik and colleagues (2010) obtained further evidence for the role of
learning in the ability to recognize the location of the source of
sounds. They found that when one ear was partially plugged, people had
difficulty localizing sounds. However, if they practiced several days
for a period of time with the plug in, they learned to accurately
localize sounds.

the intensity of various frequencies of sound received by the ear to the
intensity of these frequencies received by a microphone in open air. The
important point in Figure 7.15 is that the transfer functions varied
with the elevation of the source of the sound. The timbre of sounds that
reaches the cat's ear changed along with the elevation of the source of
the sound. People's ears differ in shape. This means that the changes in
the timbre of a sound coming from different locations will also differ
from person to person. In addition, as children grow, the size of their
ears changes. Each individual must learn to recognize the subtle changes
in the timbre of sounds that originate in locations in front of the
head, behind it, above it, or below it. The neural circuits that
accomplish this task are not genetically programmed; they must be gained
through experience. An experiment by Zwiers and colleagues (2001) found
evidence for the role of experience in calibrating the sensitivity of
the auditory system to changes in elevation. They found that individuals
who were blind had more difficulty judging the elevation of sounds than
people with sight did, especially if some noise was present. Presumably,
the increased accuracy of sighted people reflected the fact that they
had had the opportunity to calibrate the changes in

Compare the anterior and posterior auditory processing streams.

As we said at the outset of this module, hearing has three primary
functions: to detect sounds, to determine the location of their sources,
and to recognize the identity of these sources. We will now consider the
third function: recognizing the identity of a sound source. Right now
perhaps you can hear the sound of people talking, a television in the
background, the muffled din of music playing in another room, or perhaps
you're in a very quiet, remote place and hear only the sound of the
breeze in the trees. How can you recognize these sound sources? The
axons in your cochlear nerve contain a constantly changing pattern of
activity corresponding to the constantly changing mixtures of
frequencies that strike your eardrums. Somehow, the auditory system of
your brain recognizes particular patterns that belong to particular
sources, and you perceive each of them as an independent entity.
PERCEIVING ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDS AND THEIR LOCATION The auditory system
is constantly involved

in pattern recognition. The auditory system must recognize that
particular patterns of constantly changing activity belong to different
sound sources. And as we saw, few patterns are simple mixtures of fixed
frequencies. For example, notes of different pitches produce different
patterns of activity in our cochlear nerve, yet we recognize each of the
notes as belonging to a flute. In addition, the notes played on a flute
have a characteristic attack and decay. And consider the complexity of
sounds that occur in the environment: cars honking, birds chirping,
people coughing, doors slamming, and so on. (We will discuss speech
recognition--- an even more complicated task---in Chapter 14.) Perhaps
unsurprisingly, we are far from understanding how pattern recognition of
such complex sounds works.

24/11/21 1:28 PM

206 Chapter 7 Perceiving complex sounds appears to be accomplished by
circuits of neurons in the auditory cortex. Recognizing complex sounds
requires that the timing of changes in the components of the sounds be
preserved all the way to the auditory cortex. In fact, the neurons that
convey information to the auditory cortex contain special features that
permit them to conduct this information rapidly and accurately
(Trussell, 1999). Their axons contain special low-threshold voltagegated
potassium channels that produce very short action potentials. Their
terminal buttons are large and release large amounts of glutamate, and
the postsynaptic membrane contains neurotransmitter-dependent ion
channels that act unusually rapidly to produce very strong EPSPs. The
terminal buttons form synapses with the somatic membrane of the
postsynaptic neurons, which minimizes the distance between the synapses
and the axon---and the delay in conducting information to the axon of
the postsynaptic neuron. As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, the
auditory cortex, like the visual cortex, is organized into two streams:
an anterior stream, involved in perceiving complex sounds (the "what"
system); and a posterior stream, involved in perceiving location (the
"where" system). In a single-unit recording study with monkeys,
Rauschecker and Tian (2000) found that neurons in the "what" system
discriminated between different monkey calls, while neurons in the
"where" system discriminated between different locations of loudspeakers
presenting these calls. Figure 7.16 compares the regions of the monkey
brain that are devoted to processing visual and auditory information. As
you can see, the visual and auditory "where" streams overlap in the
parietal lobe. This overlap is undoubtedly related to the fact that
monkeys (and humans, too) can use the convergence of sight and sound to
recognize which of several objects in the environment is making a noise.
In addition, we can learn the association between the sight of an object
and the sounds it makes. Information

from both the visual and auditory systems is also projected to specific
regions of the frontal lobes---again, with a region where both systems
overlap. The role of the frontal lobes in learning and memory is
discussed in Chapter 13. AUDITORY CORTEX DAMAGE IMPAIRS COMPLEX SOUND
PERCEPTION As we saw in Chapter 6, lesions

of the visual association cortex can selectively impair various aspects
of visual perception. Damage to the ventral stream can produce visual
agnosias---the inability to recognize objects even though the visual
acuity may be good ("what" system)---and lesions of the dorsal stream
disrupt performance on a variety of tasks that require perceiving and
remembering the locations of objects ("where" system). Lesions of the
auditory association cortex can produce deficits analogous to
these---impairment of various aspects of auditory perception, even
though the individuals are not deaf. A review of 38 functional-imaging
studies with human participants (Arnott et al., 2004) reported a
consistent result: Perceiving the identity of sounds activated the
"what" stream of the auditory cortex, and perceiving the location of
sounds activated the "where" stream. A functional MRI (fMRI) study by
Alain and colleagues (2008) supports this conclusion. The investigators
presented people with sounds of animals, humans, and musical instruments
(for example, the bark of a dog, a cough, and the sound of a flute) in
one of three locations: 90° to the left, straight ahead, or 90° to the
right. On some blocks of trials the participants were asked to press a
button when they heard two sounds of any kind from the same location. On
other blocks of trials they were asked to indicate when they heard the
same kind of sound twice in a row, regardless of its location. As Figure
7.17 shows, judgments of location activated dorsal

regions ("where" system), and judgments of the nature of a sound
activated ventral regions ("what" system). Inhibiting structures in
these pathways results in specific deficits in perceiving "what" and
"where" for auditory stimuli. Lomber and Malhotra (2008) implanted
coiled tubes that circulated a chilled liquid in the cerebral cortex of
cats. Circulating the liquid temporarily deactivated the cortical area
under the coil. Deactivating a region of the "what" pathway disrupted
the cats' ability to recognize an auditory stimulus, and deactivating a
region of the "where" pathway disrupted their ability to recognize its
location. Although damage can impair the perception of complex sounds,
there is also plasticity in the auditory processing pathways. For
example, the superior auditory abilities of blind individuals have long
been recognized: Loss of vision appears to increase the sensitivity of
the auditory system. A functional-imaging study by Klinge and colleagues
(2010) found that input to the auditory cortex was identical in
individuals who were blind and sighted, but that neural connections
between the auditory cortex and the visual cortex were stronger in
people who were blind. In addition, the visual cortex showed enhanced
responsiveness to auditory stimuli. These findings suggest that the
analysis of auditory stimuli can be extended to the visual cortex in
people who are blind. Clarke and colleagues (2000) reported the cases of
three patients with brain damage that affected different portions of the
auditory cortex. The investigators tested the patients' ability to
recognize environmental sounds, to identify the locations from which the
sounds were coming, and to detect when the source of a sound was moving.
Patient F. D. had difficulty recognizing environmental sounds but could
identify sound location or movement. Patient C. Z. could recognize
environmental sounds but could not identify sound location or movement.
Finally, although patient M. A. was not deaf, she showed deficits in all
three tasks: recognition, localization, and perception of movement.
Although the lesions in these patients were too large to determine the
exact locations of the brain regions responsible for the perception of
environmental sounds and the location of their sources, we can certainly
conclude that different regions of the auditory cortex are involved in
perceiving what and where.

Perceiving Music LO 7.10 Summarize the biological basis for perceiving
music. Perception of music is a special form of auditory perception.
Music consists of sounds of various pitches and timbres played in a
particular sequence with an underlying rhythm. Particular combinations
of musical notes played simultaneously are perceived as consonant or
dissonant, pleasant or unpleasant. The intervals between notes of
musical scales follow specific rules, which may vary in the music of
different cultures. In Western music, melodies played using notes that
follow one set of rules (the major mode) usually sound

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 207

207

happy, while those played using another set of rules (the minor mode)
generally sound sad. In addition, a melody is recognized by the relative
intervals between its notes, not by their absolute value. A melody is
perceived as unchanging even when it is played in different keys---that
is, when the pitches of all the notes are raised or lowered without
changing the relative intervals between them. This means that musical
perception requires recognition of sequences of notes, their adherence
to rules that govern permissible pitches, harmonic combinations of
notes, and rhythmical structure. Because the duration of musical pieces
is several seconds to many minutes, musical perception involves a
substantial memory capacity. The neural mechanisms required for musical
perception are complex. Studies with monkeys and humans have found that
the primary auditory cortex responds to pure tones of different
frequencies but that recognition of the pitch of complex sounds is
accomplished only by the auditory association cortex (Bendor & Wang,
2006). Functional-imaging studies with humans indicate that pitch
discrimination takes place in a region of the superior temporal gyrus
rostral and lateral to the primary auditory cortex, in a region of the
"what" stream. (See Figure 7.18.) Different regions of the brain are
involved in different aspects of musical perception (Peretz & Zatorre,
2005). For example, the inferior frontal cortex appears to be involved
in recognition of harmony, the right auditory cortex appears to be
involved in the perception of the underlying beat in music, and the left
auditory cortex appears to be involved in perception of rhythmic
patterns that are superimposed on the rhythmic beat. (Think of a drummer
indicating the regular, underlying beat by operating the foot pedal of
the bass drum and superimposing a more complex pattern of beats on
smaller drums with the drumsticks.) In addition, the cerebellum and
basal ganglia are involved in the timing of musical rhythms, as they are
in the timing of movements. Everyone learns language, but only some
people become musicians. Musical training obviously makes changes in the
brain---changes in motor systems involved in singing or playing an
instrument, and changes in the auditory system involved in recognizing
subtle complexities of harmony, rhythm, and other characteristics of
musical structure. Here, we will consider aspects of musical expertise
related to audition. Some of the effects of musical training can be seen
in changes in the structure or activity of portions of the auditory
system of the brain. For example, a study by Schneider and colleagues
(2002) found that the volume of the primary auditory cortex of musicians
was 130 percent larger than that of non-musicians, and the neural
response in this area to musical tones was 102 percent greater in
musicians. Moreover, both of these measures were positively related to a
person's musical aptitude.

Evidence suggests that neural circuits used to process music are already
present in newborn infants. A functionalimaging study by Perani and
colleagues (2010) found that one- to three-day-old infants showed
changes in brain activity (primarily in the right hemisphere) when music
they were hearing changed key. (See Figure 7.19.) Brain activity also
altered when babies heard dissonant music, which adults find unpleasant.

Patient I. R., a right-handed woman in her early forties, sustained
bilateral damage during surgical treatment of aneurysms located on her
middle cerebral arteries. Aneurysms (discussed in more detail in Chapter
16) are balloon-like swellings on blood vessels that can sometimes
rupture, having fatal consequences. The surgery successfully clipped off
the aneurysms but resulted in damage to most of the left superior
temporal gyrus, and some of the inferior frontal and parietal lobes
bordering the lateral fissure. Damage to the right hemisphere was less
severe but included the anterior third of the superior temporal gyrus
and the right inferior and middle frontal gyri. Ten years after the
surgery I. R. had normal hearing, could understand speech and converse,
and could recognize environmental sounds, but she showed a nearly
complete amusia---loss of the ability to perceive or produce melodic or
rhythmic aspects of music. She had been raised in a musical environment;
both her grandmother and brother were professional musicians. After her
surgery, she lost the ability to recognize melodies that she had been
familiar with previously, including simple pieces such as "Happy
Birthday." She was no longer able to sing (Peretz et al., 1998).
Remarkably, I. R. insisted that she still enjoyed listening to music,
and she was still able to recognize emotional aspects of music. Although
she could not recognize specific pieces of music, she recognized whether
the music sounded happy or sad. She could also recognize happiness,
sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust in a person's tone of voice.
The ability to recognize emotion in music contrasts with her inability
to recognize dissonance in music---a quality that listeners typically
find intensely unpleasant. Peretz and her colleagues (2001) discovered
that I. R. was totally insensitive to changes in music that irritate
most listeners. Even four-month-old babies prefer consonant music to
dissonant music, which shows that recognition of dissonance develops
very early in life (Zentner & Kagan, 1998).

Approximately 4 percent of the population exhibits congenital amusia
that becomes apparent early in life. People with amusia cannot recognize
or differentiate between tunes, and they even try to avoid social
situations that involve music.

Musical ability in general and congenital amusia, in particular, appear
to have a genetic basis. Drayna and colleagues (2001) had pairs of twins
listen to simple popular melodies and determine which ones contained
some wrong---and discordant---notes. They found that the correlation
between the scores of the twin pairs was .67 for monozygotic twins but
only .44 for dizygotic twins. These

209

results indicate a heritability index in this kind of musical ability of
approximately .75 (on a scale of 0--1.0). Peretz and her colleagues
(2007) found that 39 percent of first-degree relatives (siblings,
parents, or children) of people with amusia also had amusia, compared
with an incidence of only 3 percent in the first-degree relatives of
people in control families.

Module Review: Audition The Stimulus: Sound LO 7.1 Describe three
perceptual dimensions of sound. The perceived pitch of an auditory
stimulus is determined by the frequency of vibration, which is measured
in hertz (Hz). Loudness is a function of intensity---the degree to which
the compressions and expansions of air differ from each other. Timbre
provides information about the nature of the particular sound---for
example, the sound of an oboe or a train whistle.

Anatomy of the Ear

from the cochlear nerve to the superior olivary nucleus, and on to the
inferior colliculus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally to the
auditory cortex. The auditory cortex has a tonotopic representation for
auditory stimuli and is divided into primary and association areas.
Processing in the auditory cortex progresses from the core region
(primary cortex), to the belt region and then the parabelt region
(association cortex). Cortical auditory processing consists of two
streams. The anterior stream, which begins in the anterior parabelt
region, is involved with analysis of complex sounds. The posterior
stream, which begins in the posterior parabelt region, is involved with
sound localization.

LO 7.2 Organize the structures and functions of the ear involved in
auditory processing. The outer ear contains the pinna, ear canal, and
tympanic membrane. The middle ear contains the ossicles (malleus, incus,
and stapes). The inner ear contains the cochlea, organ of Corti
(including the basilar membrane, hair cells, tectorial membrane, and
reticular membrane), and the round window.

Auditory Hair Cells Transduce Auditory Information LO 7.3 Contrast the
location and function of hair cells in auditory transduction. Inner and
outer auditory hair cells are located on the basilar membrane. Hair
cells contain rows of cilia and synapse with dendrites of bipolar
neurons whose axons bring auditory information to the brain. Movement of
the basilar membrane causes the cilia to move, bending back and forth.
Cilia are arranged in bundles, and bending the bundle of cilia causes
receptor potentials. The inner hair cells are necessary for normal
hearing. The outer hair cells are involved in altering the mechanical
characteristics of the basilar membrane and influencing the effects of
sound vibrations on the inner hair cells.

Perceiving Pitch LO 7.5 Contrast place and rate coding in pitch
perception. The cochlea detects frequency by two means: Moderate to high
frequencies are detected by place coding, and low frequencies are
detected by rate coding. Place coding occurs because acoustic stimuli of
different frequencies cause different parts of the basilar membrane to
flex back and forth, triggering the neurons in those locations to fire.
Rate coding occurs because lower frequencies are detected by neurons
that fire in synchrony with the movements of the apical end of the
basilar membrane.

Perceiving Loudness LO 7.6 Contrast how loudness in high- and
low-frequency sounds is represented. Loudness in high-frequency sounds
is represented by an increased rate of action potentials from the
auditory hair cells. Loudness in low-frequency sounds is represented by
the number of axons arising from the low-frequencydetecting neurons at
the apical end of the basilar membrane that are active at a given time.

Perceiving Spatial Location LO 7.8 Compare the processes used to
perceive spatial location. Neurons in our auditory system respond
selectively to different arrival times of the sound waves at the left
and right ears to determine the horizontal location of an intermittent
sound. Phase differences include the simultaneous arrival, at each ear,
of different portions (phases) of the sound wave to detect the
horizontal location of a continuous sound. Coincidence-detecting cells
compare binaural input and help determine location. Some neurons in the
auditory system respond differentially to binaural stimuli of different
intensity in each ear, which means that they provide information that
can be used to detect the source of tones of high frequency. Difference
in timbre is used to determine the vertical location of a sound.

Perceiving Complex Sounds LO 7.9 Compare the anterior and posterior
auditory processing streams. The anterior stream is involved in
perceiving complex sounds ("what"), and the posterior stream is involved
in perceiving location ("where"). Damage to these streams can lead to
impairment of various aspects of auditory perception, even though the
individuals are not deaf. Inhibiting

Vestibular System The functions of the vestibular system include
balance, maintaining the head in an upright position, and adjusting eye
movement to compensate for head movements. Vestibular stimulation does
not produce any readily definable sensation; however, certain
low-frequency stimulation of the vestibular sacs can produce nausea, and
stimulating the semicircular canals can produce dizziness and rhythmic
eye movements (nystagmus). Typically, we are not directly aware of the
information received from these organs. This module describes the
vestibular apparatus and the vestibular pathway in the brain.

Anatomy of the Vestibular Apparatus LO 7.11 Summarize the structures and
functions of the vestibular apparatus. The vestibular system has two
components: the vestibular sacs and the semicircular canals. They
represent the

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 210

structures in these pathways results in specific deficits in perceiving
"what" and "where" for auditory stimuli.

Perceiving Music LO 7.10 Summarize the biological basis for perceiving
music. Different regions of the brain are involved in different aspects
of musical perception. The primary auditory cortex responds to pure
tones of different frequencies, and recognition of the pitch of complex
sounds is accomplished by the auditory association cortex. The inferior
frontal cortex is involved in recognizing harmony, the right auditory
cortex is involved in perceiving the underlying beat in music, and the
left auditory cortex is involved in perceiving rhythmic patterns that
are superimposed on the rhythmic beat. Damage to the auditory cortex can
result in amusia. Musical ability and the occurrence of congenital
amusia appear to have a genetic basis.

Thought Question A 62-year-old woman, who has a mild hearing impairment,
says she can hear music when it is not p ­ laying, especially when she is
falling asleep. After a quick ­research, you find that her condition
refers to a phenomenon called musical hallucinations. Which brain
structures are likely to be involved during such hallucinations?

second and third components of the labyrinths of the inner ear. (We just
studied the first component, the cochlea.) The vestibular sacs respond
to the force of gravity and inform the brain about the head's
orientation. The semicircular canals respond to angular
acceleration---changes in the rotation of the head---but not to steady
rotation. They also respond (but rather weakly) to changes in position
or to linear acceleration. Figure 7.20 shows the labyrinths of the inner
ear, which include the cochlea, the semicircular canals, and the two
vestibular sacs: the utricle ("little pouch") and the saccule ("little
sack"). The semicircular canals approximate the three major planes of
the head: sagittal, transverse, and horizontal. Receptors in each canal
respond maximally to angular acceleration in one plane. The semicircular
canal consists of a membranous canal floating within a bony one; the
membranous canal contains a fluid called endolymph. An enlargement
called the ampulla contains the organ in which the sensory receptors
reside. The sensory receptors are hair cells similar to those found in
the cochlea. Their cilia are embedded in a gelatinous mass called the
cupula, which blocks part of the ampulla.

To explain the effects of angular acceleration on the semicircular
canals, we will first describe an "experiment." If we place a glass of
water on the exact center of a turntable and then start the turntable
spinning, the water in the glass will, at first, remain stationary (the
glass will move with respect to the water it contains). Eventually,
however, the water will begin rotating with the container. If we then
stop the turntable, the water will continue spinning for a while because
of its inertia. The semicircular canals operate on the same principle.
The endolymph within these canals, like the water in the glass, resists
movement when the head begins to rotate. This inertial resistance pushes
the endolymph against the cupula, causing it to bend until the fluid
begins to move at the same speed as the head. If the head rotation is
then stopped, the endolymph, still circulating through the canal, pushes
the cupula the other way. Angular acceleration is translated into
bending of the cupula, which exerts a shearing force on the cilia of the
hair cells. (Of course, unlike the glass of water in the example, we do
not normally spin around in circles; the semicircular canals measure
very

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 211

slight and very brief rotations of the head.) With this explanation in
mind, what might be responsible for the perception of movement after a
person stops spinning? The vestibular sacs (the utricle and saccule)
work very differently. These organs are roughly circular, and each
contains a patch of receptive tissue. The receptive tissue is located on
the "floor" of the utricle and on the "wall" of the saccule when the
head is in an upright position. The receptive tissue, like that of the
semicircular canals and cochlea, contains hair cells. The cilia of these
receptors are embedded in an overlying gelatinous mass, which contains
something rather unusual: otoconia, which are small crystals of calcium
carbonate. (See Figure 7.21.) The weight of the crystals causes the
gelatinous mass to shift in position as the orientation of the head
changes. In this way, movement produces a shearing force on the cilia of
the receptive hair cells. The hair cells of the semicircular canal and
vestibular sacs are similar in appearance. Each hair cell contains
several cilia, graduated in length from short to long. These hair cells
resemble the auditory hair cells found in the cochlea, and their
transduction mechanism is also

similar: A shearing force of the cilia opens ion channels, and the entry
of potassium ions depolarizes the ciliary membrane. All three forms of
hair cells employ the same receptor molecules: TRPA1, which we described
earlier in this chapter. Figure 7.22 shows two views of a hair cell of a

The Vestibular Pathway LO 7.12 Outline the vestibular pathway. As seen
in Figure 7.23, the vestibular and cochlear nerves constitute the two
branches of the eighth cranial nerve (auditory nerve). The bipolar cell
bodies that give rise to the afferent axons of the vestibular nerve (a
branch of the eighth cranial nerve) are located in the vestibular
ganglion, which appears as a nodule on the vestibular nerve. Most of the
axons of the vestibular nerve synapse within the vestibular nuclei in
the medulla, but some axons travel directly to the cerebellum. Neurons
of the vestibular nuclei send their axons to the cerebellum, spinal
cord, medulla, and pons. There also appear to be vestibular projections
to the temporal cortex, but the precise pathways have not been
determined. Most investigators believe that the cortical projections are
responsible for feelings of dizziness; the activity of projections to
the lower brain stem can produce nausea and vomiting that accompany
motion sickness. Projections to brain stem nuclei controlling neck
muscles are clearly involved in maintaining an upright position of the
head. Perhaps the most interesting connections are those to the cranial
nerve nuclei (third, fourth, and sixth) that control the eye muscles. As
we walk or (especially) run, the head is jarred. The vestibular system
exerts direct control on eye movement to compensate for the sudden head
movements. This process, called the vestibulo-ocular

yourself: Look at a distant object and hit yourself (gently) on the side
of the head. Note that your image of the world jumps a bit but not too
much. People who

have suffered vestibular damage and who lack the vestibulo-ocular reflex
have difficulty seeing anything while walking or running. Everything
becomes a blur of movement.

Module Review: Vestibular System Anatomy of the Vestibular Apparatus LO
7.11 Summarize the structures and functions of the vestibular apparatus.
The vestibular apparatus contains the vestibular sacs (the utricle and
saccule) and the semicircular canals of the ear. The vestibular sacs
respond to the force of gravity and inform the brain about the head's
orientation. The semicircular canals respond to angular acceleration and
changes in position or linear acceleration.

The Vestibular Pathway LO 7.12 Outline the vestibular pathway. From the
hair cells, vestibular information is relayed to the brain via the
vestibular and cochlear nerves. The vestibular nerve projects to the
medulla, which sends

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 213

information to the cerebellum, spinal cord, pons, and other regions of
the medulla. The cranial nerve relays information to the eye muscles to
compensate for sudden head movements. There also appear to be vestibular
projections to the temporal cortex, but the precise pathways have not
been determined.

Thought Question Persistent dizziness has a lifetime prevalence of
approximately 25 percent and represents a significant risk factor for
falls among older adults. Select one structure involved in vestibular
perception and explain how damage or dysfunction in this structure could
contribute to the experience of dizziness (even if the exact cortical
pathways are not yet identified).

Somatosenses This chapter began with the cases of Ashlyn and Jo. Their
cases highlight the important role of somatosenses in influencing our
behavior. The somatosenses provide information about what is happening
on the surface of our body and inside it. The cutaneous senses (skin
senses) are the most studied of the somatosenses and include several
submodalities commonly referred to as touch. Proprioception and
kinesthesia provide information about body position and movement. We
will describe the contribution of sensory receptors in the skin to these
perceptual systems in this module. The muscle receptors and their role
in feedback from limb position and movement are also discussed in this
module and in Chapter 8. The organic senses arise from receptors in and
around the internal organs. (See Table 7.2.)

control movement. These receptors will be discussed separately in
Chapter 8. We are aware of some of the information received through the
organic senses, which can provide us with unpleasant sensations such as
stomachaches or gallbladder attacks, or pleasurable ones such as those
provided by a warm drink on a cold winter day. We are unaware of some
information, such as that provided from receptors in the digestive
system, kidneys, liver, heart, and blood vessels that are sensitive to
nutrients and minerals. This information, which plays a role in the
control of metabolism and water and mineral balance, is described in
Chapter 12.

Anatomy of the Skin and Its Receptive Organs LO 7.14 Describe the
anatomy and somatosensory receptors of the skin.

The Stimuli LO 7.13 Provide examples of stimuli that activate receptors
for the somatosenses. The cutaneous senses respond to several different
types of stimuli: pressure, vibration, heating, cooling, and events that
cause tissue damage (and hence pain). Feelings of pressure are caused by
mechanical deformation of the skin. Vibration occurs when we move our
fingers across a rough surface. We use vibration sensitivity to judge an
object's roughness. Sensations of warmth and coolness are produced by
objects that raise or lower skin temperature. Sensations of pain can be
caused by many different types of stimuli, but it appears that most
cause at least some tissue damage. One source of kinesthesia is the
stretch receptors found in skeletal muscles that report changes in
muscle length to the central nervous system. Receptors within joints
between adjacent bones respond to the magnitude and direction of limb
movement. However, the most important source of kinesthetic feedback
appears to come from receptors that respond to changes in the stretching
of the skin during movements of the joints or of the muscles themselves,
such as those in the face (Johansson & Flanagan, 2009). Muscle length
detectors, located within the muscles, do not give rise to conscious
sensations; their information is used to

The skin is a complex and vital organ of the body---one that we often
tend to take for granted. We cannot survive without it; extensive skin
burns are fatal. Our cells, which must be bathed by a warm fluid, are
protected from the hostile environment by the skin's outer layers. The
skin participates in thermoregulation by producing sweat to cool the
body, or by restricting its circulation of blood to conserve heat.
Skin's appearance varies widely across the body, from mucous membranes
to hairy skin to the smooth, hairless skin of the palms and the soles of
the feet, which is known as glabrous skin. The skin consists of
subcutaneous tissue, dermis, and epidermis, and it contains various
receptors scattered throughout these layers. Glabrous skin contains a
dense, complex mixture of receptors, which reflects the fact that we use
the palms of our hands and the inside surfaces of our fingers to
actively explore the environment: We use our hands and fingers to hold
and touch objects. In contrast, the rest of our body most often contacts
the environment passively; that is, other things come into contact with
it. Figure 7.24 shows the appearance of free nerve endings and the four
types of encapsulated somatosensory receptors (Merkel's disks, Ruffini
corpuscles, Meissner's corpuscles, and Pacinian corpuscles). The
locations and functions of these receptors are listed in Table 7.3.

Perceiving Cutaneous Stimulation LO 7.15 Describe the perception of
touch, temperature, pain, and itch. The three most important qualities
of cutaneous stimulation are touch, temperature, and pain. These
qualities, along with itch and some new directions in cutaneous
perception research, are described in the sections that follow. TOUCH

it (tactile stimuli) are detected

by mechanoreceptors---the encapsulated receptors shown in Figure
7.24---and some types of free nerve endings. Most investigators believe
that the encapsulated nerve endings serve only to modify the physical
stimulus transduced by the dendrites that reside within them. But what
is the mechanism of transduction? How does movement of the dendrites of
mechanoreceptors produce changes in membrane potentials? It appears that
the movement causes ion channels to open, and the flow of ions into or
out of the dendrite causes a change in the membrane potential. You will
recall that TRPA1, a member of the TRP (transient receptor potential)
family of receptor proteins, is responsible for the transduction of
mechanical information in auditory and vestibular hair cells. Most
information about tactile stimulation is precisely localized---that is,
we can perceive the location on our skin where we are being touched.
However, a case study by Olausson and colleagues (2002) discovered a new
category of tactile sensation. Read the following case study to learn
more about a unique case of cutaneous stimulation.

215

Patient G. L., a 54-year-old woman, experienced a permanent loss of
afferent neurons involved in somatosensation. G. L. lost the ability to
perceive tickle but retained the ability to perceive temperature, pain,
and itch (Olausson et al., 2002, pp. 902--903). When the hairy skin on
her forearm or the back of her hand was stroked with a soft brush, she
reported a faint, pleasant sensation. However, she could not determine
the direction of the stroking or its precise location. An fMRI analysis
showed that this stimulation activated the insular cortex, a region that
is known to be associated with emotional responses and sensations from
internal organs. The somatosensory cortex was not activated. When
regions of hairy skin of control participants were stimulated this way,
fMRI showed activation of the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex
as well as the insular cortex because the stimulation activated both
large and small axons. The glabrous skin on the palm of the hand is
served only by large-diameter myelinated axons. When this region was
stroked with a brush, G. L. reported no sensation at all, presumably
because of the absence of small, unmyelinated axons. The investigators
concluded that, besides conveying information about noxious and thermal
stimuli, small-diameter unmyelinated axons constitute a "system for
limbic touch that may underlie emotional, hormonal and affiliative
responses to caress-like, skin-to-skin contact between individuals"
(Olausson et al., 2002, p. 900). And, as we saw, G. L. could no longer
perceive tickle. Tickling sensations, which were previously believed to
be transmitted by these small axons, are apparently transmitted by the
large myelinated axons that were destroyed in patient G. L. Olausson and
his colleagues (Löken et al., 2009) note that the sensory endings that
detect pleasurable stroking are found only in hairy skin, and that
stroking of glabrous skin does not provide these sensations. However, we
can think of pleasurable tactile stimuli that can be experienced through
the glabrous skin of the palms and fingers---for example, those provided
by stroking a warm, furry animal or touching a loved one. When our hairy
skin contacts the skin of another person, it is more likely that that
person is touching us. In contrast, when our glabrous skin contacts the
skin of another person, it is more likely that we are touching them.
Based on this information, we might expect receptors in hairy skin to
provide pleasurable sensations when someone caresses us but expect
receptors in glabrous skin to provide pleasurable sensations when we
caress someone else.

216 Chapter 7 Our cutaneous senses are often used to analyze the shapes
and textures of stimulus objects that are moving with respect to the
surface of the skin. Sometimes, the object itself moves, but more often,
we do the moving ourselves. If an object is placed in your palm and you
are asked to keep your hand still, you will have a great deal of
difficulty recognizing the object by touch alone. If you are then
allowed to move your hand, you will manipulate the object, letting its
surface slide across your palm and the pads of your fingers. You will be
able to describe the object's threedimensional shape, hardness, texture,
slipperiness, and so on. In order to describe it, your motor system must
cooperate, and you need kinesthetic sensation from your muscles and
joints, in addition to the cutaneous information. If you squeeze the
object and feel a lot of well-localized pressure in return, it is hard.
If you feel a less intense, more diffuse pressure in return, it is soft.
If it produces vibrations as it moves over the ridges on your fingers,
it is rough. If very little effort is needed to move the object while
pressing it against your skin, it is slippery. If it does not produce
vibrations as it moves across your skin but moves in a jerky fashion,
and if it takes effort to remove your fingers from its surface, it is
sticky. Our somatosenses work dynamically with the motor system to
provide useful information about the nature of objects that come into
contact with our skin. Studies of people who make especially precise use
of their fingertips show changes in the regions of somatosensory cortex
that receive information from this part of the body. For example,
violinists must make very precise movements of the four fingers of the
left hand, which are used to play notes by pressing the strings against
the fingerboard. Tactile feedback and proprioceptive feedback are very
important in accurately moving and positioning these fingers so that
sounds of the proper pitch are produced. In contrast, placement of the
thumb, which slides along the bottom of the neck of the violin, is less
critical. In a study of violin players, Elbert and colleagues (1995)
found that the portions of their right somatosensory cortex that receive
information from the four fingers of their left hand were enlarged
relative to the corresponding parts of the left somatosensory cortex.
The amount of somatosensory cortex that receives information from the
thumb was not enlarged. (The right hand holds the bow, and the violinist
makes precise movements with the arm and wrist, but tactile information
from the fingers of this hand is much less important.) Schwenkrels and
colleagues (2007) stimulated the median and ulnar nerves of
non-musicians and professional violinists and recorded the subsequent
activity of their somatosensory cortex. The median and ulnar nerves
convey sensory information from the hands. The researchers found that
stimulating the nerves of the left hand of the violinists produced
greater activity in the right compared to the left somatosensory cortex
of the musicians. Stimulating the hands of the non-musicians produced
similar activity in the right and left somatosensory cortex. Figure 7.25
shows

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 216

a representation of the results of the study. The violinist (panel A)
had a larger area of the right somatosensory cortex devoted to
processing sensory information from the left hand (the red and blue dots
represent that area corresponding to the stimulation of the median and
ulnar nerves). Feelings of warmth and coolness are relative, not
absolute, except at the extremes. There is a temperature level that, for
a particular region of skin, will produce a sensation of temperature
neutrality---neither TEMPERATURE

warmth nor coolness. This neutral point is not an absolute value but
depends on the prior history of thermal stimulation of that area. If the
temperature of a region of skin is raised by a few degrees, the initial
feeling of warmth is replaced by one of neutrality. If the skin
temperature is lowered to its initial value, it now feels cool.
Increases in temperature lower the sensitivity of warmth receptors and
raise the sensitivity of cold receptors. The converse holds for
decreases in skin temperature. This adaptation to temperature can be
demonstrated easily by placing one hand in a bucket of warm water and
the other in a bucket of cool water until some adaptation has taken
place. If you then simultaneously immerse both hands in water at room
temperature, it will feel warm to one hand and cool to the other. There
are two categories of free nerve-ending thermal receptors: those that
respond to warmth and those that respond to coolness. Cold sensors in
the skin are located just beneath the epidermis, and warmth sensors are
located more deeply in the skin. We can detect thermal stimuli over a
very wide range of temperatures, from less than 8° C (noxious cold) to
over 52° C (noxious heat). Investigators have long believed that no
single receptor could detect such a range of temperatures, and recent
research indicates that this belief was correct. At present we know of
six mammalian thermoreceptors---all members of the TRP family (Bandell
et al., 2007; Romanovsky, 2007). The thermoreceptors are listed in Table
7.4. Some of the thermal receptors respond to particular chemicals as
well as to changes in temperature. For example, the M in TRPM8 stands
for menthol, a compound found in the leaves of many members of the mint
family. Peppermint tastes cool in the mouth, and menthol is added to
some cigarettes to make the smoke feel cooler and perhaps less harsh and
damaging to the lungs. Menthol provides a cooling sensation because it
binds with and stimulates the TRPM8 receptor and produces neural
activity that the brain interprets as coolness. Chemicals can produce
the sensation of heat also. Later in this chapter, you'll learn more
about the perception of "heat" from capsaicin, the chemical responsible
for the burning sensation you experience when eating chile peppers. This
experience of heat is due to the activation of pain receptors.

PAIN The story of pain is quite different from that of temperature and
pressure; pain is a much more complicated sensation. Our awareness of
pain and our emotional reaction to it are controlled by mechanisms
within the brain. Stimuli that produce pain also tend to trigger
species-typical escape and withdrawal responses. Subjectively, these
stimuli hurt, and we try hard to avoid or escape from them. However,
sometimes we are better off ignoring pain and getting on with important
tasks. In fact, our brains possess mechanisms that can reduce pain,
partly through the action of the endogenous opioids. These mechanisms
are described in more detail in a later module of this chapter. Pain
perception, like thermoreception, is accomplished by the networks of
free nerve endings in the skin. There appear to be at least three types
of pain receptors (usually referred to as nociceptors, or "detectors of
noxious stimuli"). High-threshold mechanoreceptors are free nerve
endings that respond to intense pressure, which might be caused by
something striking, stretching, or pinching the skin. The second type of
free nerve ending appears to respond to extremes of heat, to acids, and
to the presence of capsaicin, the active ingredient in chile peppers.
(Note that we say that chile peppers make food taste "hot.") This type
of fiber contains TRPV1 receptors (Kress & Zeilhofer, 1999). The V
stands for vanilloid---a group of chemicals of which capsaicin is a
member. Caterina and colleagues (2000) found that mice with a knockout
of the gene for the TRPV1 receptor showed less sensitivity to painful
hightemperature stimuli and would drink water to which capsaicin had
been added. The mice responded normally to noxious mechanical stimuli.
Presumably, the TRPV1 receptor is responsible for pain produced by
burning of the skin and to changes in the acid/base balance within the
skin. These receptors are responsible for the irritating effect of
chemicals such as ammonia on the mucous membranes of the nose (Dhaka et
al., 2009). TRPV1 receptors also appear to play a role in regulation of
body temperature. In addition, Ghilardi and colleagues (2005) found that
a drug that blocks TRPV1 receptors reduced pain in patients with bone
cancer, which is apparently caused by the production of acid by the
tumors. Another type of nociceptive fiber contains TRPA1 receptors,
which, as we saw earlier in this chapter, are found in the cilia of
auditory and vestibular hair cells. TRPA1 receptors are sensitive to
pungent irritants found in mustard oil, wintergreen oil, horseradish,
and garlic and to a variety of environmental irritants, including those
found in ­vehicle exhaust and tear gas (Bautista et al., 2006; Nilius et
al., 2007). The primary function of this receptor appears to be to
provide information about the presence of chemicals that produce
inflammation. ITCH Another noxious sensation, itch (or, more formally,
pruritus) is caused by skin irritation. Itch was defined by a
seventeenth-century German physician as an "unpleasant

24/11/21 1:28 PM

218 Chapter 7 sensation that elicits the desire or reflex to scratch"
(Ikoma et al., 2006, p. 535). If an adult sees a child scratching at an
insect bite or another form of skin irritation, the adult is likely to
say, "Stop that---it will only make it worse!" The scratching may indeed
make the irritation worse, but the immediate effect of scratching is to
reduce the itching. Davidson and colleagues (2009) found that scratching
inhibited the activity of neurons in the spinothalamic tract of monkeys
that transmit itch sensations to the brain. Presumably, the scratch
response to stimuli that produce itching helps rid skin of irritating
debris or parasites (Davidson & Giesler, 2010). Scratching reduces
itching because pain suppresses itching (and, ironically, itching
reduces pain). Histamine and other chemicals released by skin irritation
and allergic reactions are important sources of itching. Experiments
have shown that painful stimuli such as heat and electrical shock can
reduce sensations of itch produced by an injection of histamine into the
skin, even when the painful stimuli are applied up to 10 cm from the
site of irritation (Nilsson et al., 1997; Ward et al., 1996). On the
other hand, administering an opiate into the epidural space around the
spinal cord diminishes pain but often produces itching as an unwelcome
side effect (Chaney, 1995). Naloxone, a drug that blocks opiate
receptors, has been used to reduce cholestatic pruritus, a condition of
itching that sometimes accompanies pregnancy (Bergasa, 2005). Little is
known about the receptors that are responsible for the sensation of
itch, but at least two different types of neurons transmit itch-related
information to the CNS. Johanek and colleagues (2007) produced itch in
volunteers with intradermal injections of histamine and applications of
cowhage spicules---tiny, needlelike plant fibers that contain an enzyme
that breaks down proteins in the skin. Both treatments produce intense
itch, but only histamine produces an area of vasodilation. Pretreating a
patch of skin with a topical antihistamine prevented histamine from
producing an itch at that spot but had no effect on the itch produced by
cowhage. In contrast, pretreating a patch of skin with capsaicin
prevented cowhage-induced itch but not histamine-induced itch.

The Somatosensory Pathways LO 7.16 Describe the components of the
somatosensory pathways. The somatosensory pathways relay information
about somatosensation from the receptors, through subcortical structures
to the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, enabling
somatosensory perception. Somatosensory axons from the skin, muscles, or
internal organs enter the central nervous system via spinal NERVES AND
SUBCORTICAL PROCESSING

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 218

nerves. Those located in the face and head primarily enter through the
trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve). The cell bodies of the unipolar
neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia and cranial nerve
ganglia. Axons that convey precisely localized information, such as fine
touch, ascend through the dorsal columns in the white matter of the
spinal cord to nuclei in the lower medulla. From there, axons cross the
brain and ascend through the medial lemniscus to the ventral posterior
nuclei of the thalamus, the relay nuclei for somatosensation. Axons from
the thalamus project to the primary somatosensory cortex, which in turn
sends axons to the secondary somatosensory cortex. In contrast, axons
that convey poorly localized information, such as pain or temperature,
form synapses with other neurons as soon as they enter the spinal cord.
The axons of these neurons cross to the other side of the spinal cord
and ascend through the spinothalamic tract to the ventral posterior
nuclei of the thalamus. (See Figure 7.26.) The primary and secondary
regions of the somatosensory cortex are arranged in columns and divided
into multiple maps of the body surface. THE SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX

Column Organization Recall from Chapter 6 that the primary visual cortex
contains columns of cells, each of which responds to particular
features, such as orientation, ocular dominance, or spatial frequency.
Within these columns are blobs that contain cells that respond to
particular colors. The somatosensory cortex also has a columnar
arrangement; in fact, cortical columns were discovered in the
somatosensory cortex before they were found in the visual and auditory
cortex (Mountcastle, 1957). Within a column, neurons respond to a
particular type of stimulus (for example, temperature or pressure)
applied to a particular part of the body. Map Organization Dykes (1983)
has reviewed research indicating that the primary and secondary
somatosen­sory cortical areas are divided into at least five (and perhaps
as many as 10) different maps of the body surface. Within each map,
cells respond to a particular submodality of somatosensory receptors.
Separate areas have been identified that respond to cutaneous receptors,
receptors that detect changes in muscle length, receptors located in the
joints, and Pacinian corpuscles. As we saw in Chapter 6, damage to the
visual association cortex can cause visual agnosia, and as we saw
earlier in this chapter, damage to the auditory association cortex can
cause auditory agnosia. You may not be surprised, then, to learn that
damage to the somatosensory association cortex can cause tactile
agnosia.

Patient E. C., a woman with left parietal lobe damage, was unable to
recognize common objects by touch. For example, she identified a pine
cone as a brush, a ribbon as a rubber band, and a snail shell as a
bottle cap. The deficit was not due to a simple loss of tactile
sensitivity; the patient was still sensitive to light touch and to warm
and cold objects, and she could easily discriminate objects by their
size, weight, and roughness (Reed et al., 1996). Nakamura and colleagues
(1998) described patient M. T., who had a different type of tactile
agnosia. M. T. had bilateral lesions of the angular gyrus, a region of
the parietal

lobe surrounding the caudal end of the lateral fissure. This patient,
like E. C., had normal tactile sensitivity, but he could not identify
objects by touch. However, unlike E. C., he could draw objects that he
touched even though he could not recognize what they were. (See Figure
7.27.) The fact that he could draw the objects means that his ability to
perceive three-dimensional objects by touch must have been intact.
However, the brain damage prevented the information analyzed by the
somatosensory association cortex from being transmitted to parts of the
brain responsible for the control of language---and for consciousness.

Perceiving Pain LO 7.17 Describe why pain is experienced, the components
of pain, and how pain perception can be modified. Pain is a curious
phenomenon. It is more than a mere sensation; it can be defined only by
some sort of withdrawal reaction or, in humans, by verbal report. Pain
can be modified by opiates, by hypnosis, by the administration of
placebos, by emotions, and even by other forms of stimulation, such as
acupuncture. Recent research efforts have made remarkable progress in
discovering the physiological bases of these phenomena. We might
reasonably ask why we experience pain. The answer is that in most cases
pain serves a constructive role. For example, inflammation, which often
accompanies injuries to skin or muscle, greatly increases the
sensitivity of the inflamed region to painful stimuli. This effect
motivates the individual to minimize the movement of the injured part
and avoid contact with other objects. The effect is to reduce the
likelihood of further injury. WHY DO WE EXPERIENCE PAIN?

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 220

Cox and colleagues (2006) studied three families from northern Pakistan
whose members included several people with a complete absence of pain
and discovered the location of the gene responsible for this disorder.
The gene, an autosomal recessive allele located on chromosome 2, encodes
for a voltage-dependent sodium channel. The case that brought the
families to the researchers' attention was a 10-year-old boy who
performed a "street theater" during which he would thrust knives through
his arms and walk on burning coals without feeling any pain. He died
just before his fourteenth birthday after jumping off the roof of a
house. All six of the affected people in the three families had injuries
to their lips or tongues caused by self-inflicted bites. They all
suffered from bruises and cuts, and many sustained bone fractures that
they did not notice until the injuries impaired their mobility. Despite
their total lack of pain from any type of noxious stimulus, they had
normal sensations of touch, warmth, coolness, proprioception, tickle,
and pressure. Some environmental events diminish the perception of pain.
For example, Beecher (1959) noted that many wounded American soldiers
back from the battle at Anzio, Italy, during World War II reported that
they felt no pain from their wounds. They did not even want medication.
It would appear that their perception of pain was diminished by the
relief they felt from surviving such a terrible ordeal. There are other
instances in which people report the perception of pain but are not
bothered by it. Some tranquilizers have this effect, and damage to parts
of the brain does, too.

COMPONENTS OF PAIN Pain appears to have three different perceptual and
behavioral effects (Price, 2000). First is the sensory component---the
pure perception of the intensity of a painful stimulus. The second
component is the immediate emotional consequences of pain---the
unpleasantness or degree to which the individual is bothered by the
painful stimulus. The third component is the longterm emotional
implications of chronic pain---the threat that such pain represents to
one's future comfort and well-being. These three components of pain
appear to involve different brain mechanisms. The purely sensory
component of pain is mediated by a pathway from the spinal cord to the
ventral posterolateral thalamus to the primary and secondary
somatosensory cortex. The immediate emotional component of pain appears
to be mediated by pathways that reach the anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC) and insular cortex. The long-term emotional component appears to
be mediated by pathways that reach the prefrontal cortex. (See Figure
7.28.) Let's look at some evidence for brain mechanisms involved in
short-term and long-term emotional responses to pain. Several studies
have found that painful stimuli activate the insular cortex and the ACC.
In addition, Ostrowsky and colleagues (2002) found that electrical
stimulation of the insular cortex caused reports of painful burning and
stinging sensations. Damage to this region

decreases people's emotional response to pain: They continue to feel the
pain but do not seem to recognize that it is harmful (Berthier et al.,
1988). They do not withdraw from pain or the threat of pain. Rainville
and colleagues (1997) produced pain sensations in participants by having
them put their arms in ice water. Under one condition, the researchers
used hypnosis to diminish the unpleasantness of the pain. The hypnosis
worked; the participants said that the pain was less unpleasant, even
though it was still as intense. Meanwhile, the investigators used a PET
scanner to measure the regional activation of the brain. They found that
the painful stimulus increased the activity of both the primary
somatosensory cortex and the ACC. When the participants were hypnotized
and found the pain less unpleasant, the activity of the ACC decreased,
but the activity of the primary somatosensory cortex remained high.
Presumably, the primary somatosensory cortex is involved in the
perception of pain, and the ACC is involved in its immediate emotional
effects---its unpleasantness. (See Figure 7.29.) In another study from
the same laboratory, Hofbauer and colleagues (2001) produced the
opposite effect. They presented participants with a painful stimulus and
used hypnotic suggestion to reduce the perceived intensity of the pain.
They found that the suggestion reduced participants' ratings of pain and
also decreased the activation of the somatosensory cortex. Changes in
perceived ­intensity of pain are reflected in changes in activation of

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 221

the somatosensory cortex, whereas changes in perceived unpleasantness of
pain are reflected in changes in activation of the ACC. Several
functional-imaging studies have shown that under certain conditions,
stimuli associated with pain can activate the ACC even when no actual
painful stimulus is applied. Osaka and colleagues (2004) found that the
ACC was activated when participants heard Japanese words that vividly
denote various types of pain (for example, a throbbing pain, a splitting
headache, or the pain caused by being stuck with thorns). In a test of
romantically involved couples, Singer and colleagues (2004) found that
when women received a painful electrical shock to the back of their
hand, their ACC, anterior insular cortex, thalamus, and somatosensory
cortex became active. When they saw their partners receive a painful
shock but did not receive

one themselves, the same regions (except for the somatosensory cortex)
became active. The emotional component of pain---in this case, a
vicarious experience of pain, provoked by empathy with the feelings of
someone a person loved---caused responses in the brain similar to the
ones caused by actual pain. Just as we saw in the study by Rainville and
colleagues (1997), the somatosensory cortex is activated only by an
actual noxious stimulus. The final component of pain---the emotional
consequences of chronic pain---appears to involve the prefrontal cortex.
As we will see in Chapter 11, damage to the prefrontal cortex impairs
people's ability to make plans for the future and to recognize the
personal significance of situations in which they are involved. Along
with the general lack of insight, people with prefrontal damage tend not
to be concerned with the implications of chronic conditions---including
chronic pain---for their future. (See Table 7.5.) A unique form of pain
sensation occurs after a limb has been amputated. After the limb is
gone, up to 70 ­percent of amputees report that they feel as though the
missing limb still exists and that it often hurts. This phenomenon is
referred to as the phantom limb (Melzak, 1992; Ramachandran & Hirstein,
1998). People with phantom limbs report that the limb feels very real,
and they often say that if they try to reach out with it, it feels as
though it were responding. Sometimes, they perceive it as sticking out,
and they may feel compelled to avoid knocking it against the side of a
doorframe or sleeping in a position that would make it come between them
and the mattress. People have reported all sorts of sensations in
phantom limbs, including pain, pressure, warmth, cold, wetness, itching,
sweatiness, and prickliness. The classic explanation for phantom limbs
has been activity of the sensory axons belonging to the amputated limb.
Presumably, the nervous system interprets this activity as coming from
the missing limb. When nerves are cut and connections cannot be
reestablished between the proximal and distal portions, the cut ends of
the proximal portions form nodules known as neuromas. The treatment for
phantom pain has been to cut the nerves above these neuromas, to cut the
dorsal roots that bring the afferent information from these nerves into
the spinal cord, or to

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 222

make lesions in somatosensory pathways in the spinal cord, thalamus, or
cerebral cortex. Sometimes these procedures work for a while, but often
the pain returns. Melzak (1992) suggested that the phantom limb
sensation is inherent in the organization of the parietal cortex. The
parietal cortex is involved in our awareness of our own bodies. Indeed,
people with lesions of the parietal lobe (especially in the right
hemisphere) have been known to push their own leg out of bed, believing
that it belongs to someone else. Melzak reports that some people who
were born with missing limbs nevertheless experience phantom limb
sensations, which would suggest that our brains are genetically
programmed to provide sensations for all four limbs. A unique therapy
can be helpful for some types of pain or discomfort experienced from
phantom limbs. It is further thought that phantom limb pain can arise
from a conflict between visual feedback and proprioceptive feedback from
the phantom limb. Mirror box therapy requires the patient to substitute
visual feedback for the missing limb by reflecting a mirror image of the
intact limb. Clinical trials of mirror box therapy support the utility
of this intervention for reducing phantom limb pain when the mirror
image is used to represent an image of moving and stretching the phantom
limb (Chan et al., 2007). (See Figure 7.30.) ENDOGENOUS MODIFICATION OF
PAIN SENSITIVITY

For many years, investigators have known that perception of pain can be
modified by environmental stimuli. Work beginning in the 1970s has
revealed the existence of neural circuits whose activity can produce
analgesia. A variety of environmental stimuli can activate these
analgesia-producing circuits. Most of these stimuli cause the release of
the endogenous opioids, which were described in Chapter 4. Electrical
stimulation of particular locations within the brain can cause
analgesia, which can even be profound enough to serve as an anesthetic
for surgery in

rats (Reynolds, 1969). The most effective locations appear to be within
the periaqueductal gray matter and in the rostroventral medulla. For
example, electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray matter
produced analgesia in rats equivalent to that produced by at least 10
milligrams (mg) of morphine per kilogram (kg) of body weight, which is a
large dose (Mayer & Liebeskind, 1974). The technique has even found an
application in reducing severe chronic pain in humans: Fine wires are
surgically implanted in parts of the central nervous system and attached
to a radio-controlled device that permits the patient to administer
electrical stimulation when necessary (Kumar et al., 1990). Analgesic
brain stimulation apparently triggers the neural mechanisms that reduce
pain, primarily by causing endogenous opioids to be released. Basbaum
and Fields (1978, 1984) proposed a neural circuit that mediates
opiate-induced analgesia. Basically, they proposed the following:
Endogenous opioids (released by environmental stimuli or administered as
a drug) stimulate opiate receptors on neurons in the periaqueductal gray
matter. Because the effect of opiates appears to be inhibitory (Nicoll
et al., 1980), Basbaum and Fields proposed that the neurons that contain
opiate receptors are themselves inhibitory interneurons. Administering
opiates activates the neurons on which these interneurons synapse.
Figure 7.31 depicts this circuit. Neurons in the periaqueductal gray
matter send axons to the nucleus raphe magnus, located in the medulla.
The neurons in this nucleus send axons to the dorsal horn of the spinal
cord gray matter; destroying these axons eliminates analgesia induced by
an injection of morphine. The inhibitory effects of these neurons
apparently involve one or two interneurons in the spinal cord.

223

Pain sensitivity can be regulated by direct neural connections, as well
as by secretion of the endogenous opioids. The periaqueductal gray
matter receives inputs from the frontal cortex, amygdala, and
hypothalamus (Beitz, 1982; Mantyh, 1983). These inputs permit learning
and emotional reactions to affect an animal's responsiveness to pain
even without the secretion of opioids. Pain can be reduced, at least in
some people, by administering a pharmacologically inert placebo. When
some people take a medication that they believe will reduce pain, it
triggers the release of endogenous opioids and actually does so. This
effect is eliminated if the people are given an injection of naloxone, a
drug that blocks opiate receptors (Eippert et al., 2009). For some
people a placebo is not pharmacologically inert---it has a physiological
effect. The placebo effect may be mediated through connections of the
frontal cortex with the periaqueductal gray matter. A functional-imaging
study by ­Zubieta and colleagues (2005) found that placebo-induced
analgesia did indeed cause the release of endogenous opiates. They used
a PET scanner to detect the presence of µ-opioid neurotransmission in
the brains of people who responded to the effects of a placebo. As
Figure 7.32 shows, several regions of the brain, including the anterior
cingulate cortex and insular cortex, showed evidence of increased
endogenous opioid activity. An interesting study by Waber and colleagues
(2008) found that the efficacy of a placebo was directly related to its
perceived value. Volunteers were given a placebo pill that was alleged
to reduce pain. Some people were told that the pills normally cost
\$2.50 each, and others were told that the price had been discounted to
10 cents each. Before and after taking the pill, the participants
received

electric shocks to their wrists and rated the intensity of the pain that
the shocks produced. As Figure 7.33 shows, participants who believed
that they had received an expensive pill showed a stronger reduction in
pain perception than those who believed they had received an inexpensive
one. A functional-imaging study by Wager and colleagues (2004) supports
the suggestion that the prefrontal cortex plays a role in placebo
analgesia. They administered painful stimuli (heat or electrical shocks)
to the skin with or without the application of an "analgesic" skin cream
that was actually an unmedicated placebo. They observed a placebo
effect---reports of less intense pain and decreased

activity in the primary pain-reactive regions of the brain, including
the thalamus, ACC, and insular cortex. They also observed increased
activity in the prefrontal cortex and the periaqueductal gray matter of
the midbrain. Presumably, the expectation of decreased sensitivity to
pain caused the increased activity of the prefrontal cortex, and
connections of this region with the periaqueductal gray matter activated
endogenous mechanisms of analgesia. (See Figure 7.34.) It appears that a
considerable amount of neural circuitry is devoted to reducing the
intensity of pain. What functions do these circuits perform? When an
animal ­encounters a noxious stimulus, the animal usually stops

what it is doing and engages in withdrawal or escape behaviors.
Obviously, these responses are quite appropriate. However, they are
sometimes counterproductive. For example, males fighting for access to
females during mating season will fail to pass on their genes if pain
elicits withdrawal responses that interfere with fighting. In fact,
fighting and sexual activity both stimulate brain mechanisms of
analgesia. Komisaruk and Larsson (1971) found that tactile stimulation
of a rat's vagina produced analgesia. Such stimulation also increases
the activity of neurons in the

225

periaqueductal gray matter and decreases the responsiveness of neurons
in the ventrobasal thalamus to painful stimulation (Komisaruk &
Steinman, 1987). The phenomenon also occurs in humans; Whipple and
Komisaruk (1988) found that self-administered vaginal stimulation
reduces sensitivity to painful stimuli but not to neutral tactile
stimuli. Presumably, copulation triggers analgesic mechanisms. The
adaptive significance of this phenomenon is clear: Painful stimuli
encountered during the course of copulation are less likely to cause the
behavior to be interrupted, and the chances of pregnancy are increased.

The Somatosensory Pathways

LO 7.13 Provide examples of stimuli that activate

LO 7.16 Describe the components of the somatosensory

receptors for the somatosenses. Mechanical deformation of the skin
activates pressure receptors. Changes in temperature activate
temperature receptors. Sensations of pain can be caused by many
different types of stimuli, but most cause tissue damage and activate
nociceptors. Skeletal muscle stretch and limb movement activate
kinesthetic receptors.

Anatomy of the Skin and Its Receptive Organs LO 7.14 Describe the
anatomy and somatosensory receptors of the skin. Skin consists of
subcutaneous tissue, dermis, and epidermis. Skin contains free nerve
endings and encapsulated receptors. The encapsulated receptors are found
in hairy and glabrous skin and are responsible for a variety of
functions.

Perceiving Cutaneous Stimulation LO 7.15 Describe the perception of
touch, temperature, pain, and itch. Mechanoreceptors are activated by
vibration. Vibratory movement causes ion channels to open and change
membrane potential to transduce the signal. Thermal receptors are free
nerve endings that are activated by a relative change in temperature.
Pain receptors are free nerve endings that are stimulated by intense
pressure, heat, and chemical irritants. Little is known about the
receptors that are responsible for the sensation of itch.

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 225

pathways. Somatosensory axons enter the central nervous system via
spinal and cranial nerves. Information from the nerves passes through
the medulla, the medial lemniscus of the midbrain, the ventral posterior
nucleus of the thalamus, the primary somatosensory cortex, and finally
the secondary (association) somatosensory cortex. The sensory cortex
includes column organization by stimulus type and multiple maps of the
body surface, each corresponding to different types of somatosensory
information.

Perceiving Pain LO 7.17 Describe why pain is experienced, the components
of pain, and how pain perception can be modified. Pain serves a
constructive role: to reduce the likelihood of further injury. It
consists of three perceptual and behavioral effects: perceptions of the
intensity of a painful stimulus, immediate emotional consequences, and
long-term emotional implications of chronic pain. Pain perception can be
modified by activating analgesia circuits, through the release of
endogenous opioids, or by administering exogenous opioids.

Thought Question Do all placebos have the same effects on pain
reduction? Design an experiment to test the effects of various

placebo may make it more effective (for example, price was described in

Gustation A 75-year-old woman experienced a sudden stroke while cooking
in her kitchen. Six months following the stroke, the woman had recovered
many of her impaired functions (which included weakness on her right
side); however, she had lost 6.35 kg (approximately 14 lb.) and found
her favorite foods unappealing. She reported that everything she ate
tasted unappetizing to her and although she could distinguish among
different tastes, she perceived foods to have unusual, non-food-like
flavors. This experience resulted in the patient eating less food,
losing weight, and experiencing feelings of isolation because she did
not enjoy sharing meals or eating in restaurants with friends or family.
CT scans of the patient's brain immediately following the stroke
revealed that the lesion was localized to the left insular cortex (Dutta
et al., 2013).

The stimuli that we have encountered so far produce receptor potentials
by imparting physical energy: thermal, photic (involving light), or
kinetic. However, the stimuli received by the last two senses to be
studied---gustation and olfaction---interact with their receptors
chemically. This module discusses the first of them: gustation. As
demonstrated in the case study you just read, gustation is important in
maintaining both adequate nutrition and quality of life. As with the
other senses, regions of the cortex are devoted to perceiving taste, and
damage to these regions can result in loss of sensory perception.

The Stimuli LO 7.18 List the six qualities of taste stimuli. Gustation
is clearly related to eating; this sense modality helps us to determine
the nature of things we put in our mouths. For a substance to be tasted,
molecules of it must dissolve in the saliva and stimulate the taste
receptors on the tongue. Tastes of different substances vary, though
much less than we generally realize. There are only six qualities of
taste: bitterness, sourness, sweetness, saltiness, umami, and fat.
Flavor, as opposed to taste, is a composite of olfaction and gustation.
Much of the flavor of food depends on its odor; people with anosmia (who
lack the sense of smell) or people whose nostrils are blocked have
difficulty distinguishing between different foods by taste alone. Most
vertebrates possess gustatory systems that respond to all six taste
qualities. (An exception is the cat family; lions, tigers, leopards, and
domestic cats do not detect sweetness.) Sweetness receptors are food
detectors. Most sweet-tasting foods, such as fruits and some vegetables,
are safe to eat (Ramirez, 1990). Saltiness receptors detect the presence
of sodium chloride. In some environments, it is difficult to obtain
adequate amounts of this mineral from

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 226

the usual sources of food, so sodium chloride detectors help the animal
to detect its presence. Injuries that cause bleeding deplete an organism
of its supply of sodium rapidly, so the ability to find salt quickly can
be critical. In recent years, researchers have recognized the existence
of a fifth taste quality: umami. Umami, a Japanese word that means "good
taste," refers to the taste of monosodium glutamate (MSG), a substance
that is often used as a flavor enhancer in Asian cuisine (Kurihara,
1987; Scott & Plata-Salaman, 1991). The umami receptor detects the
presence of glutamate, an amino acid found in proteins. Presumably, the
umami ­receptor provides the ability to taste types of protein, an
­important nutrient. Most species of animals will readily ingest
substances that taste sweet or somewhat salty. Similarly, they are
attracted to foods that are rich in amino acids, which explains the use
of MSG as a flavor enhancer. However, they will tend to avoid substances
that taste sour or bitter. Because of bacterial activity, many foods
become acidic when they spoil. In addition, most unripe fruits are
acidic. Acidity tastes sour and causes an avoidance reaction. (However,
we have learned to make highly preferred mixtures of sweet and sour,
such as lemonade.) Bitterness is almost universally avoided and cannot
easily be improved by adding some sweetness. Many plants produce
poisonous alkaloids, which protect them from being eaten by animals.
Alkaloids taste bitter. The bitterness receptor undoubtedly serves to
warn animals away from these chemicals. For many years, researchers have
known that many species of animals (including our own) show a distinct
preference for high-fat foods. Because there is not a distinct taste
that is associated with the presence of fat, most investigators
concluded that we detected fat by its odor and texture ("mouth feel").
However, Fukuwatari and colleagues (2003) found that rats whose
olfactory sense was destroyed continued to show a preference for a
liquid diet containing a long-chain fatty acid, one of the breakdown
products of fat. When fats reach the tongue, some of these molecules are
broken down into fatty acids by an enzyme called lingual lipase, which
is found in the vicinity of taste buds. The activity of lingual lipase
ensures that fatty acid detectors are stimulated when food containing
fat enters the mouth. Cartoni and colleagues (2010) identified two G
protein-coupled receptors that appear to be responsible for detecting
the presence of fatty acids in the mouth. The investigators found that
mice with a targeted mutation against the genes responsible for the
production of these receptors showed a decreased preference for fatty
acids, and that responses of the taste nerves to fatty acids were also
diminished. Recent research has begun to explore the role of fat taste
sensitivity in obesity and changes in this taste sensitivity in response
to high- and low-fat diets (Liu et al., 2016).

Anatomy of the Taste Buds and Gustatory Cells

Perceiving Gustatory Information

LO 7.19 Identify the location and structure of taste receptor cells. The
tongue, palate, pharynx, and larynx contain approximately 10,000 taste
buds. Most of these receptive organs are arranged around papillae, small
protuberances of the tongue. Fungiform papillae, located on the anterior
two-thirds of the tongue, contain up to eight taste buds, along with
receptors for pressure, touch, and temperature. Foliate papillae consist
of up to eight parallel folds along each edge of the back of the tongue.
Approximately 1,300 taste buds are located in these folds. Circumvallate
papillae, arranged in an inverted V on the posterior third of the
tongue, contain approximately 250 taste buds. They are shaped like
little plateaus surrounded by moatlike trenches. Taste buds consist of
groups of 20 to 50 receptor cells, specialized neurons arranged somewhat
like the segments of an orange. Cilia are located at the end of each
cell and project through the opening of the taste bud (the pore) into
the saliva that coats the tongue. Tight junctions between adjacent taste
cells prevent substances in the saliva from diffusing freely into the
taste bud itself. Figure 7.35 shows the appearance of a circumvallate
papilla; a cross section through the surrounding trench contains a taste
bud. Taste receptor cells form synapses with dendrites of bipolar
neurons whose axons convey gustatory information to the brain through
the seventh, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves. The neurotransmitter
released by the receptor cells is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the
molecule produced by mitochondria that stores energy within cells
(Finger et al., 2005). The receptor cells have a life span of only 10
days. They quickly wear out, being directly exposed to a rather hostile
environment. As they degenerate, they are replaced by newly developed
cells; the dendrite of the bipolar neuron is passed on to the new cell
(Beidler, 1970).

LO 7.20 Summarize the process of gustatory transduction. Transduction of
taste is similar to the chemical transmission that takes place at
synapses: The tasted molecule binds with the receptor and produces
changes in membrane permeability that cause receptor potentials.
Different substances bind with different types of receptors, producing
different taste sensations. In this section we will describe what we
know about the nature of the molecules with particular tastes and the
receptors that detect their presence. To taste salty, a substance must
ionize. Although the best stimulus for saltiness receptors is sodium
chloride (NaCl), a variety of salts containing metallic cations (such as
Na+, K+, and Li+) with a small anion (such as Cl--, Br--, SO42--, or
NO3--) taste salty. The receptor for saltiness seems to be a simple
sodium channel. When present in the saliva, sodium enters the taste cell
and depolarizes it, triggering action potentials that cause the cell to
release a neurotransmitter (Avenet & Lindemann, 1989; Kinnamon &
Cummings, 1992). The best evidence that sodium channels are involved is
the fact that amiloride, a drug that is known to block sodium channels,
prevents sodium chloride from activating taste cells and decreases
sensations of saltiness. However, the drug does not completely block
these sensations in humans, so most investigators believe that more than
one type of receptor is involved (Ossebaard et al., 1997; Schiffman et
al., 1983). SALT

SOUR Sourness receptors appear to respond to the ­hydrogen ions present
in acidic solutions. However, because the sourness of a particular acid
is not simply a function of the concentration of hydrogen ions, the
anions must have an effect as well. The reason for this anion ­effect is
not yet known. BITTER, SWEET, AND UMAMI The stimulus for sourness---the
presence of acids---is clear. However, bitter and sweet substances are
more difficult to ­characterize. The typical stimulus for bitterness is a
plant alkaloid such as quinine; for sweetness it is a sugar such as
glucose or fructose. The fact that some molecules elicit both sensations
suggested to early researchers that bitterness and sweetness receptors
may be similar. For example, the Seville orange rind contains a
glycoside (complex sugar) that tastes extremely bitter; the addition of
a hydrogen ion to the molecule makes it taste intensely sweet (Horowitz
& Gentili, 1974). Some amino acids taste sweet. Indeed, the commercial
sweetener aspartame consists of just two amino acids: aspartate and
phenylalanine. Receptors sensitive to bitterness and sweetness are
linked to a G protein known as gustducin, which is very

24/11/21 1:29 PM

228 Chapter 7 similar in structure to transducin, the G protein involved
in transduction of photic information in the retina. Receptors sensitive
to umami are linked to both gustducin and transducin (He et al., 2004;
McLaughlin et al., 1993; Wong et al., 1996). When a bitter molecule
binds with the receptor, the G protein activates an enzyme that begins a
cycle of chemical reactions that causes the release of ATP, the
neurotransmitter of taste receptor cells. Recent evidence has discovered
two families of receptors responsible for detecting sweet, bitter, and
umami tastes (see Scott, 2004, for a review). The first family, T1R, has
three members: T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3, produced by three different genes.
The sweet receptor consists of two components: T1R2 + T1R3. The umami
receptor consists of T1R1 + T1R3. A gustatory receptor cell can be
sensitive to sweet or umami but not both. Bitter compounds are detected
by the second family of receptors, T2R, of which there are 30 members
(Matsunami et al., 2000). A gustatory receptor cell sensitive to
bitterness contains one of the many different varieties of T2R, which
indicates that each cell can detect the presence of many different
bitter-tasting molecules. As we saw, many compounds found in nature that
taste bitter are poisonous. Rather than entrusting detection of these
compounds to a single receptor, the process of evolution has given us
the ability to detect a wide variety of compounds with different
molecular shapes. (See Figure 7.36.) We mentioned earlier that cats are
insensitive to sweet tastes. Li and colleagues (2005) discovered the
reason for the absence of sweet sensitivity: Cat DNA lacks functional
genes that produce T1R2 proteins, one of the components of sweet
receptors. (Look again at Figure 7.36.) The investigators suggested that
this mutation was probably an important event in the evolution of cats'
carnivorous behavior.

The Gustatory Pathway LO 7.21 Describe the components of the gustatory
pathway. Gustatory information is transmitted through cranial nerves 7,
9, and 10. Information from the anterior part of the tongue travels
through the chorda tympani, a branch of the seventh cranial nerve
(facial nerve). Taste receptors in the posterior part of the tongue send
information through the lingual (tongue) branch of the ninth cranial
nerve (glossopharyngeal nerve); the tenth cranial nerve (vagus nerve)
carries information from receptors of the palate and epiglottis. The
chorda tympani gets its name because it passes through the middle ear
just beneath the tympanic membrane. The first relay station for taste is
the nucleus of the solitary tract, located in the medulla. In primates
the taste-sensitive neurons of this nucleus send their axons

to the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus, a nucleus that also
receives somatosensory information from the trigeminal nerve (Beckstead
et al., 1980). Thalamic taste-sensitive neurons send their axons to the
primary gustatory cortex, which is located in the base of the frontal
cortex and in the insular cortex (Pritchard et al., 1986). Neurons in
this region project to the secondary gustatory cortex, located in the
caudolateral orbitofrontal cortex (Rolls et al., 1990). Unlike most
other sense modalities, taste is ipsilaterally represented in the brain;
that is, the right side of the tongue projects to the right side of the
brain, and the left side projects to the left. (See Figure 7.37.)
Besides receiving information from taste receptors, the gustatory cortex
also receives thermal, mechanical,

visceral, and nociceptive (painful) stimuli, which undoubtedly play a
role in determining the palatability of food (Carleton et al., 2010).
Gustatory information also reaches the amygdala and the hypothalamus and
adjacent basal forebrain (Nauta, 1964; Russchen et al., 1986). Many
investigators believe that the hypothalamic pathway plays a role in
mediating the reinforcing effects of sweet, umami, and slightly salty
tastes. In fact, some neurons in the hypothalamus respond to sweet
stimuli only when the animal is hungry (Rolls et al., 1986).

MAP ORGANIZATION IN THE GUSTATORY CORTEX

In a functional-imaging study, Schoenfeld and colleagues (2004) had
people sip water that was flavored with sweet, sour, bitter, and umami
tastes. The investigators found that tasting each flavor activated
different regions in the primary gustatory area of the insular cortex.
Although the locations of the taste-responsive regions differed from
person to person, the same pattern was seen when a given individual was
tested on different occasions. The representation of tastes in the
gustatory cortex is idiosyncratic but stable.

Olfaction Olfaction, another chemical sense, helps us to identify food
and avoid food that has spoiled and is unfit to eat. It helps the
members of many species to track prey or detect predators and to
identify friends, foes, and receptive mates. Although many other
mammals, such as dogs, have more sensitive olfactory systems than humans
do, we should not underrate our own. The olfactory system is second only
to the visual system in the number of sensory receptor cells, with an
estimated 10 million cells. We can smell some substances at lower
concentrations than the most sensitive laboratory instruments can
detect. Recent research is beginning to suggest that part of the greater
olfactory sensitivity of other mammals compared to humans is that other
mammals put their noses where odors are the strongest---just above the
ground. For example, a dog following an odor trail sniffs along the
ground, where the odors of a passing animal may have clung. A
bloodhound's nose would not be as useful if it were located nearly 2
meters above the ground, as an average human's is. When people sniff the
ground as dogs do, their olfactory system works much better. Porter and
colleagues (2007) prepared a scent trail---using a string moistened with
essential oil of chocolate and placed in a grassy field. The
participants were blindfolded and wore earmuffs, kneepads, and gloves,
which prevented them from using anything other than their noses to
follow the scent trail. They did quite well, and they adopted the same
zigzag strategy used by dogs.

enters the nucleus of the solitary tract in the medulla, then to the
thalamus, then the primary gustatory cortex, and finally the secondary
gustatory cortex. Unlike most other sense modalities, taste is
ipsilaterally represented in the brain. The primary gustatory cortex
contains a taste map.

Thought Question The case study presented at the start of this module
highlights the importance of the insular cortex in gustation. This part
of the brain has a diverse range of functions and is closely linked to
the limbic system. What other symptoms would you expect to find in the
patients from the case study? What approach might you take to assist the
patient to regain their sense of taste and improve their quality of
life?

The Stimulus and Anatomy of the Olfactory Apparatus LO 7.22 Organize the
structures and functions of the olfactory apparatus involved in
olfactory processing. The stimulus for odor (known formally as an
odorant) consists of volatile substances having a molecular weight in
the range of approximately 15--300. Almost all odorous compounds are
lipid-soluble and of organic origin. However, many substances that meet
these criteria have no odor at all, so we still have much to learn about
the nature of odorants. Our 6 million olfactory receptor cells reside
within two patches of mucous membrane (the olfactory epithelium), each
having an area of about 1 square inch. The olfactory epithelium is
located at the top of the nasal cavity, as shown in Figure 7.38. Less
than 10 percent of the air that enters the nostrils reaches the
olfactory epithelium; a sniff is needed to sweep air upward into the
nasal cavity so that it reaches the olfactory receptors. OLFACTORY
RECEPTORS Figure 7.38 illustrates a group of olfactory receptor cells,
along with their supporting cells. Olfactory receptor cells are bipolar
neurons whose cell bodies lie within the olfactory mucosa that lines the
cribriform plate, a bone at the base of the rostral part of the brain.
There is a constant production of new olfactory receptor cells, but
their life is considerably longer than those of gustatory receptor
cells. Supporting cells contain enzymes that destroy odorant molecules
and help to prevent them from damaging the olfactory receptor cells.

Olfactory receptor cells send a process toward the surface of the
mucosa, which divides into 10 to 20 cilia that penetrate the layer of
mucus. Odorous molecules must dissolve in the mucus and stimulate
receptor molecules on the olfactory cilia. Approximately 35 bundles of
axons, ensheathed by glial cells, enter the skull through small holes in
the cribriform plate. The olfactory mucosa also contains free nerve
endings of trigeminal nerve axons; these nerve endings presumably
mediate sensations of pain that can be produced by sniffing some
irritating chemicals, such as ammonia. The olfactory bulbs lie at the
base of the brain on the ends of the stalklike olfactory tracts. Each
olfactory receptor cell sends a single axon into an olfactory bulb,
where it forms synapses with dendrites of mitral cells (named for their
resemblance to a bishop's miter, or ceremonial headgear). These synapses
take place in the complex axonal and dendritic arborizations called
olfactory glomeruli. There are approximately 10,000 glomeruli, each of
which receives input from a bundle of approximately 2,000 axons. The
axons of the mitral cells travel to the rest of the brain through the
olfactory tracts. Some of these axons terminate in other regions of the
ipsilateral forebrain; others cross the brain and terminate in the
contralateral olfactory bulb.

OLFACTORY PROCESSING

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 231

Olfactory tract axons project directly to the amygdala and to two
regions of the limbic cortex: the p ­ iriform cortex (the primary
olfactory cortex) and the ­entorhinal cortex. (Look again at Figure
7.38.) The amygdala sends olfactory information to the hypothalamus, the
entorhinal cortex sends it to the hippocampus, and the piriform cortex
sends it to the hypothalamus and to the orbitofrontal cortex via the
dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus (Buck, 1996; Shipley & Ennis, 1996).
As you may recall, the orbitofrontal cortex also receives gustatory
information, and it may be involved in the combining of taste and
olfaction into flavor. The hypothalamus also receives a considerable
amount of olfactory information, which is probably important for the
acceptance or rejection of food and for the olfactory control of
reproductive processes seen in many species of mammals. (See Figure
7.39.) MAPPING SPECIFIC ODORS Zou and colleagues (2001) investigated the
specificity of olfactory information in the pathway from olfactory
receptors to olfactory glomeruli to the olfactory cortex. The
investigators found that just as retinotopic information is maintained
in the visual system and tonotopic information is maintained in the
auditory system, "olfactotopic" information is maintained in the
olfactory

system. That is, the particular glomeruli that receive information from
particular olfactory receptors send this information to specific regions
of the olfactory cortex. These regions appeared to occur in identical
locations in different mice.

Transducing Olfactory Information LO 7.23 Summarize the process of
olfactory transduction. For many years, researchers have recognized that
olfactory cilia contain receptors that are stimulated by molecules of
odorants, but the nature of the receptors was unknown. Jones and Reed
(1989) identified a particular G protein, which they called Golf. This
protein is able to activate an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of
cyclic AMP, which, in turn, can open sodium channels and depolarize the
membrane of the olfactory cell (Firestein et al., 1991; Menco et al.,
1992; Nakamura & Gold, 1987). As we saw in Chapter 2, G proteins serve
as the link between metabotropic receptors and ion channels: When a
ligand binds with a metabotropic receptor, the G protein either opens
ion channels directly or does so indirectly, by triggering the
production of a second messenger. The discovery of Golf suggested that
olfactory cilia contained odorant receptors linked to this G protein.
Indeed, Buck and Axel (1991) used molecular genetics techniques and
discovered a family of genes that code for a family of olfactory
receptor proteins (and in 2004 won a Nobel Prize for doing so). So far,
olfactory receptor genes have been isolated in more than 12 species of
vertebrates, including mammals, birds, and amphibians (Mombaerts, 1999).
Humans have 339 different olfactory receptor genes, and mice have 913
(Godfrey et al., 2004; Malnic et al., 2004). Molecules of an odorant
bind with olfactory receptors and the G proteins coupled to these
receptors open sodium channels and produce depolarizing receptor
potentials.

M07_CARL0287_13_GE_C07.indd 232

For many years, recognition of specific odors has been an enigma. Humans
can recognize up to 10,000 different odorants, and other animals can
probably recognize even more (Shepherd, 1994). Even with 339 different
olfactory receptors, that leaves many odors unaccounted for. And every
year, chemists synthesize new chemicals, many with odors unlike those
that anyone has previously detected. How can we use a relatively small
number of receptors to detect so many different odorants? Before we
answer this question, we should look more closely at the relationship
between receptors, olfactory neurons, and the glomeruli to which the
axons of these neurons project. First, the cilia of each olfactory
neuron contain only one type of receptor (Nef et al., 1992; Vassar et
al., 1993). As we saw, each glomerulus receives information from
approximately 2,000 olfactory receptor cells. Ressler and colleagues
(1994) discovered that each of these 2,000 cells contains the same type
of receptor molecule. This means that there are as many types of
glomeruli as there are types of receptor molecules. Furthermore, the
location of particular types of glomeruli (defined by the type of
receptor that sends information to them) appears to be the same in each
of the olfactory bulbs in a given animal and may even be the same from
one animal to another. (See Figure 7.40.) Now let's go back to the
question that was just posed: How can we use a relatively small number
of receptors to

detect so many different odorants? The answer is that a particular
odorant binds to more than one receptor. Because a given glomerulus
receives information from only one type of receptor, different odorants
produce different patterns of activity in different glomeruli.
Recognizing a particular odor, then, is a matter of recognizing a
particular pattern of activity in the glomeruli. The task of chemical
recognition is transformed into a task of spatial recognition. Figure
7.41 illustrates this process. The left side of the figure shows the
shapes of eight hypothetical odorants. The right side shows four
hypothetical odorant receptor molecules. If a portion of the odorant
molecule fits the binding site of the receptor molecule, it will
activate it and stimulate the olfactory neuron. As you can see, each
odorant molecule fits the binding site of at least one of the receptors
and in most cases fits more than one of them. Notice also that the
pattern of receptors activated by each of the eight odorants is
different, which means that if we know which pattern of receptors is
activated, we know which odorant is present. Even though a particular
odorant might bind with several different types of receptor molecules,
it might not bind equally well with each of them. For example, it might
bind very well with one receptor molecule, moderately well with another,
weakly with another, and so on. The spatial pattern of "olfactotopic"
information is maintained in the olfactory cortex. Johnson and Leon
(2007) presented a variety of odorants to rats and recorded the regions
of activation on the

of the coding suggests that different odorant molecules attach to
different combinations of receptor molecules. (Activated receptor

surface of an exposed olfactory bulb. They found that different
categories of molecules activated different regions of the olfactory
bulb. Figure 7.42 shows the patterns of activity. Characteristics of
odorant molecules are represented by particular patterns of activity in
the olfactory bulbs. QUALITIES OF ODORANTS Although odorants are cat-

egorized according to their molecular characteristics within the
olfactory bulb, the coding scheme changes at the level of the piriform
cortex (the primary olfactory cortex). A functional-imaging study with
humans by Gottfried and colleagues (2006) found that groups of neurons
in the anterior region represent the chemical structures of odorants,
just as neurons in the olfactory bulb do, but groups of neurons in the
posterior region represent the qualities of odorants. Another
functional-imaging study (Howard et al., 2009) found that odorants
normally associated with particular objects (in this case, odorants that
people perceive as minty, woody, or citrusy) produced particular
patterns of activity in the posterior piriform cortex, regardless of the
chemical structure of the odorants. The investigators presented the
participants with three different minty odorants, three different woody
odorants, and three different citrusy odorants. Each of the three
odorants in each of these categories had very different chemical
structures. Nevertheless, the patterns of activity on the posterior
piriform cortex were correlated with the odor category, not the
molecular structure. We do not yet know how maps of chemical

of perceptual quality in the posterior piriform cortex. Presumably,
learning plays some role in this process. Several studies have found
that interactions can take place between glomeruli within the olfactory
bulb. For example, some odors have the ability to mask others. (The
existence of the deodorant and airfreshener industries depends on this
fact.) Cooks in various cultures have long known that as long as it is
not too strong, the unpleasant, rancid off-flavor of spoiled food can be
masked by the spices fennel and clove. Takahashi and his colleagues
(2004) found that evidence for this masking

ODORANT MASKING

can be seen in the responses of olfactory glomeruli. Examination of the
rat olfactory bulbs with a microscope showed local areas of increased
blood flow when different odorants were presented, which indicated
regions of increased neural activity. Takahashi and his colleagues
mapped the regions of the olfactory bulb that responded to badsmelling
odorants and to the odors of fennel and clove. They found that responses
to the bad odors were suppressed by the presence of the spice odors,
indicating that the masking took place in the olfactory bulbs.
Presumably, the glomeruli that responded to the spice odors inhibited
those that responded to the rancid ones.

Module Review: Olfaction The Stimulus and Anatomy of the Olfactory
Apparatus LO 7.22 Organize the structures and functions of the olfactory
apparatus involved in olfactory processing. The stimuli for olfaction
are chemical molecules that are typically lipid-soluble and organic.
Olfactory receptor cells are bipolar neurons whose cell bodies lie
within the olfactory mucosa that lines the cribriform plate. These
neurons send information to the olfactory bulb and through the brain via
olfactory tracts. Some information proceeds to the limbic system and
integrates with gustatory information. Olfactory information is
processed in the olfactory cortex. Regions of the olfactory cortex
contain olfactotopic maps.

Transducing Olfactory Information LO 7.23 Summarize the process of
olfactory transduction. Molecules of an odorant bind with olfactory
receptors, and the G proteins coupled to these receptors open

sodium channels and produce depolarizing receptor potentials.

Perceiving Specific Odors LO 7.24 Explain how receptors can detect
specific odors. A particular odorant binds to more than one receptor,
and different odorants produce different patterns of activity in
different glomeruli. Recognizing a particular odor involves recognizing
a particular pattern of activity in the glomeruli. The primary olfactory
cortex contains an olfactory map that appears to be based on the
chemical structure of odorant molecules.

Thought Question Have you ever encountered an odor that you knew was
somehow familiar, but you couldn't say exactly why? Can you think of any
explanations? Might this phenomenon have something to do with the fact
that the sense of olfaction developed very early in our evolutionary
history?

Mrs. G, a 76-year-old former ballerina, is a charming lady and a keen
fashionista. She loves ballet so much that she now dedicates her time in
teaching children. Recently, she has been facing an ­unusual difficulty.
For instance, yesterday she was unable to do the buttons on her shirt
and had to choose clothes that were easier to put on and manage.
Sometimes she "just does not know how to put her clothes on anymore" and
has to seek help from Mr. V, her husband. Although Mrs. G found this
odd, she was not worried too much as she was perfectly able to
demonstrate complex dance compositions to her students. Mr. V, being
concerned about his wife's health, took her to a neurologist for help.
The neurologist greeted Mrs. G and waved at her, to which she responded
by waving back with a warm smile. Upon initial examination, the doctor
could not find any motor or other types of abnormalities in her, apart
from the fact that she was unable to manipulate her clothes correctly.
She could perform all other simple gestures as well as pantomiming acts.
The doctor suspected that Mrs. G had a particular type of movement
abnormality called dressing apraxia, which could occur in case of
different brain disorders such as a stroke or a brain tumour. The doctor
investigated these symptoms further using brain imaging techniques, such
as MRI. The scan showed intense bilateral signal irregularities in the
parietal cortex---areas of the brain involved in control of movement,
which are described later in this chapter.

Meanwhile Mrs. G's condition seemed to progress and seven weeks later,
her husband struggled to understand what she said as "she could not
control her tongue anymore." Her speech, especially her vowels, sounded
distorted and she would often group sounds before saying a word
correctly. She also made many errors in the tone and rhythm of speech,
would often omit syllables or use them inappropriately. Mrs. G was
admitted to a hospital, where neurologists examined her incorrect
gestures, and how she was unable to pantomime actions or draw objects
correctly. Her speech sounded highly distorted, but doctors could not
find any signs of muscle weakness in the tongue, larynx, or surrounding
muscles involved in speaking. Doctors conducted further tests and found
that Mrs. G was suffering from CreutzfeldtJakob disease---a
neurocognitive disorder due to prion disease. Doctors described that
this condition typically affects people over 60 and, in most cases, like
in Mrs. G's, the cause ­remains unknown. The neurodegenerative processes
caused by the prions can lead to a wide array of neurological symptoms
depending on which area of the brain becomes primarily affected. In
Mrs. G's case, as the MRI demonstrated, the disease targeted parietal
cortex from both sides of the brain and she suffered from different
types of apraxia, including speech apraxia, as the disease progressed.

Control of Movement 237

This case study illustrates the complexity of motor control by the
nervous system. So far, we have explored the nature of neural
communication, the basic structure of the ­nervous system, and the
physiology of sensation and perception. Now it is time to consider the
ultimate function of the nervous system: controlling behavior. In this
chapter you will learn more about the role of the brain and spinal cord
in reflexive and voluntary motor behavior. This chapter describes the
principles of muscular contraction, some reflex circuitry within the
spinal cord, and how the brain initiates behaviors. The first module
starts us off with a discussion of skeletal muscle. The second and third
modules then focus on how the spinal cord and brain control our
movements. The fourth module focuses on complex motor behavior, and the
final module describes deficits in motor movements.

Figure 8.1 Flexion and Extension

Skeletal Muscle

The central region (capsule) of the intrafusal muscle fiber contains
sensory endings that are sensitive to stretch applied to the muscle
fiber. Actually, there are two types of intrafusal muscle fibers, but
for simplicity's sake, only one kind is shown here. The efferent axon of
the gamma motor neuron causes the intrafusal muscle fiber to contract;
however, this contraction contributes an insubstantial amount of force.
As we will see, the function of this contraction is to modify the
sensitivity of the fiber's afferent ending to stretch. A single
myelinated axon of an alpha motor neuron serves several extrafusal
muscle fibers. In primates the number of muscle fibers served by a
single axon varies considerably, depending on the precision with which
the muscle can be controlled. In muscles that move the fingers or eyes,
the ratio can be less than one to ten. In muscles that move the leg, it
can be one to several hundred. An alpha motor neuron, its axon, and
associated extrafusal muscle fibers make up a motor unit. A single
muscle fiber consists of a bundle of ­myofibrils, each of which consists
of overlapping strands of actin and myosin. Can you see the small
protrusions on the myosin filaments in Figure 8.3? These structures
(myosin cross bridges) are the motile elements that interact with the
actin filaments and produce muscular contractions. The regions in which
the actin and myosin filaments overlap produce dark stripes, or
striations. Because of this pattern, skeletal muscle is also called
striated muscle. (See Figure 8.3.)

Skeletal muscles are the ones that move us around and are responsible
for our actions. Most of them are attached to bones at each end and move
the bones when they c­ ontract. (Exceptions include eye muscles and some
abdominal muscles, which are attached to bone at one end only.) Muscles
are fastened to bones by tendons, strong bands of connective tissue.
Several different kinds of movement can be accomplished by the skeletal
muscles, but we will focus on two of them: flexion and extension.
Contraction of a flexor muscle produces flexion, moving a limb toward
the body. Extension, which is the opposite movement or moving a limb
away from the body, is produced by contraction of extensor muscles.
These are the so-called antigravity muscles---the ones we use to stand
up. Sometimes, people say that they "flex" their muscles. This is an
incorrect use of the term. Muscles contract; limbs flex. Bodybuilders
show off their arm muscles by simultaneously contracting the flexor and
extensor muscles of that limb. (See Figure 8.1.)

Anatomy LO 8.1

Describe the structures of a skeletal muscle.

The detailed structure of a skeletal muscle is shown in Figure 8.2. As
you can see, it consists of two types of muscle fibers. The extrafusal
muscle fibers are served by axons of the alpha motor neurons.
Contracting these fibers provides the muscle's motive force. The
intrafusal muscle fibers are specialized sensory organs that are served
by two axons, one sensory and one motor. These organs are also called
muscle spindles because of their shape. In fact, the Latin word fusus
means "spindle." Intrafusal muscle fibers are found within the spindles,
and extrafusal muscle fibers are found outside them.

The terminal buttons of the neurons synapse on motor endplates, located
in grooves along the surface of the muscle fibers. When an axon fires an
action potential, acetylcholine is released from the terminal buttons
and depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane. This depolar­ ization is an
endplate potential. The endplate p ­ otential is much larger than an
excitatory postsynaptic p ­ otential in synapses between neurons. An
endplate potential always causes the muscle fiber to fire, propagating
the potential along its length. This action potential induces a
contraction, or twitch, of the muscle fiber. Depolarizing a muscle fiber
opens the gates of voltage-dependent calcium channels, permitting
calcium ions to enter the cytoplasm. This event triggers the
contraction. Calcium acts as a cofactor that permits the myofibrils to
extract energy from the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that is present in
the cytoplasm. The myosin cross bridges alternately attach to the actin
strands, bend in one direction, detach themselves, bend back, reattach
to the actin at a point farther down the strand, and so on. This makes
the cross bridges "row" along the actin filaments. Figure 8.5
illustrates this rowing sequence and shows how this sequence results in
shortening the muscle fiber.

A single impulse of a motor neuron produces a single twitch of a muscle
fiber. The physical effects of the twitch last longer than the action
potential, because of the elasticity of the muscle and the time required
to rid the cell of calcium. (Like sodium, calcium is actively removed
from a cell by a pump in the membrane.) As you know from your own
experience, muscular contraction is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon.
The strength of a muscular contraction is determined by the average rate
of firing of the various motor units. If at a given moment, many units
are firing, the contraction will be forceful. If few are firing, the
contraction will be weak.

Sensory Feedback from Muscles LO 8.3

Movement of actin filament

Myofibril

Contrast the roles of receptors for sensory feedback from muscles.

The intrafusal muscle fibers contain sensory endings that are sensitive
to stretch. The intrafusal muscle fibers are arranged in parallel with
the extrafusal muscle fibers so that they are stretched when the muscle
lengthens and are relaxed when it shortens. Even though these afferent
neurons are stretch receptors, they serve as muscle length detectors.
This distinction is important. Stretch receptors are also located within
the tendons, in the Golgi tendon organ. These receptors detect the total
amount of stretch exerted by the muscle, through its tendons, on the
bones to which the muscle is attached. The stretch receptors of the
Golgi tendon organ encode the degree of stretch by the rate of firing.
They respond not to a muscle's length

but to how hard it is pulling. In contrast, the receptors on intrafusal
muscle fibers detect muscle length, not tension. Figure 8.6 shows the
response of afferent axons of the muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organ
to various types of movements. Figure 8.6a shows the effects of passive
lengthening of muscles, the kind of movement that would be seen if your
forearm, held in a completely relaxed fashion, was slowly lowered by
someone who was supporting it. The rate of firing of one type of muscle
spindle afferent neuron (MS1) increases, while the activity of the
afferent neuron of the Golgi tendon organ remains unchanged. Figure 8.6b
shows the results when the arm

Weight is dropped into hand

is dropped quickly; note that this time the second type of muscle
spindle afferent neuron (MS2) fires a rapid burst of impulses. This
fiber, then, signals rapid changes in muscle length. Figure 8.6c shows
what would happen if a weight were suddenly dropped into your hand while
your forearm was held parallel to the ground. Neurons MS1 and MS2
(especially MS2, which responds to rapid changes in muscle length)
briefly fire, because your arm lowers briefly and then comes back to the
original position. The Golgi tendon organ, monitoring the strength of
contraction, fires in proportion to the stress on the muscle, so it
increases its rate of firing as soon as the weight is added.

Module Review: Skeletal Muscle Anatomy LO 8.1 Describe the structures of
a skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscles contain extrafusal muscle fibers,
which provide the force of contraction. The alpha motor neurons form
synapses with the extrafusal muscle fibers and control their
contraction. Skeletal muscles also

M08_CARL0287_13_GE_C08.indd 240

contain intrafusal muscle fibers, which detect changes in muscle length.
The length of the intrafusal muscle fiber, and its sensitivity to
increases in muscle length, is controlled by the gamma motor neuron.
Besides the intrafusal muscle fibers, the muscles contain stretch
receptors in the Golgi tendon organs, located at the ends of the
muscles.

LO 8.3 Contrast the roles of receptors for sensory

neuromuscular junction. When a neuron synapses on a muscle fiber at the
neuromuscular junction, the neuron releases acetylcholine (ACh) into the
synapse. ACh binds to receptors on the muscle fiber to produce an
endplate potential. The depolarization of a muscle fiber opens the gates
of voltagedependent ­calcium channels, permitting calcium ions to enter
the c­ ytoplasm. This event triggers the contraction. Calcium allows the
muscle cell to use ATP to "row" or slide myosin cross bridges along
actin to produce the contraction.

Control of Movement by the Spinal Cord Although behaviors are controlled
by the brain, the spinal cord possesses a certain degree of autonomy.
Some kinds of somatosensory stimuli can elicit rapid responses through
neural connections located within the spinal cord. These reflexes
constitute the simplest level of motor integration.

The Monosynaptic Stretch Reflex LO 8.4

Explain the function of monosynaptic stretch reflexes.

The activity of the simplest functional neural pathway in the body is
easy to demonstrate. Sit on a surface high enough to allow your legs to
dangle freely and have someone lightly tap your patellar tendon, just
below the kneecap. This stimulus briefly stretches your quadriceps
muscle, on the top of your thigh. The stretch causes the muscle to
contract, which makes your leg kick forward. This is an example of a
monosynaptic stretch reflex. The time interval between the tendon tap
and the start of the leg extension is about 50 msec. That interval is
too short to involve the brain. It would take longer for sensory
information to be relayed to the brain and for motor information to be
relayed back. If you ask someone to move their leg as quickly as
possible after being touched on the knee, it would take several times
longer than the patellar reflex and would involve sensory and motor
mechanisms of the brain.

M08_CARL0287_13_GE_C08.indd 241

feedback from muscles. Receptors provide sensory feedback about muscle
length that helps regulate muscle contractions. Intrafusal muscle fibers
contain sensory endings that are sensitive to stretch. Receptors on
intrafusal muscle fibers detect muscle length. Golgi tendon organs
contain stretch receptors for tendons. Monitoring stretch and length of
muscles, as well as stretch in tendons, helps coordinate efficient motor
behavior.

Thought Question Weight lifters can lift heavier weights if their Golgi
tendon organs are deactivated with an injection of a local anesthetic.
Considering the function of these organs, why might these injections be
unwise?

The patellar reflex is not there only so you will kick when your tendon
is tapped. Instead, monosynaptic stretch reflexes help maintain posture
and body positions. Figure 8.7a includes a piece of the spinal cord,
with its roots, to show the neural circuit that composes the
monosynaptic stretch reflex in a limb. First, follow the circuit:
Starting at the muscle spindle, afferent impulses are conducted to
terminal buttons in the gray matter of the spinal cord. These terminal
buttons synapse on an alpha motor neuron that innervates the extrafusal
muscle fibers of the same muscle. Only one synapse is encountered along
the route from receptor to effector---hence the term monosynaptic.
Figure 8.7b shows the effect of placing a weight in a person's hand on a
monosynaptic reflex in the arm. Figure 8.7c shows the effect of leaning
forward and maintaining postural control via a monosynaptic reflex in
the leg. Now consider a useful function this reflex performs. If the
weight the person is holding is increased, the forearm begins to move
downward. This movement lengthens the muscle and increases the firing
rate of the muscle spindle afferent neurons, whose terminal buttons then
stimulate the alpha motor neurons, increasing their rate of firing.
Consequently, the strength of the muscular contraction increases and the
arm pulls the weight up. (See Figure 8.7b.) Another important function
of the monosynaptic stretch reflex is controlling our posture. To stand,
we must keep our center of gravity above our feet, or we will fall. As
we stand, we tend to oscillate forward and back and from side to side.
Our vestibular sacs and our visual system play important roles in the
maintenance of posture. However, these systems are aided by the activity
of the monosynaptic stretch reflex. For example, consider

the gamma motor system, the brain controls the length of the muscle
spindles and, indirectly, the length of the entire muscle.

The Gamma Motor System

LO 8.6

LO 8.5

Explain the function of the gamma motor system.

Muscle spindles are very sensitive to changes in muscle length; they
will increase their rate of firing when the muscle is lengthened by a
very small amount. The ­interesting thing is that this detection
mechanism is adjustable. Remember that the ends of the intrafusal muscle
fibers can be contracted by the activity of the associated efferent
axons of the gamma motor neurons; their rate of firing determines the
degree of contraction. When the muscle spindles are relaxed, they are
relatively insensitive to stretch. However, when the gamma motor ­neurons
are active, they become shorter and more s­ensitive to changes in muscle
length. This property of adjustable sensitivity simplifies the role of
the brain in controlling movement. The more control that can occur in
the spinal cord, the fewer messages must be sent to and from the brain.
We have already seen that the afferent axons of the muscle spindle help
to maintain limb position even when the load carried by the limb is
altered. Efferent control of the muscle spindles permits these muscle
length detectors to assist in changes in limb position as well. Consider
a single muscle spindle. When its efferent axon is completely silent,
the spindle is completely relaxed and extended. As the firing rate of
the efferent axon increases, the spindle gets shorter and shorter. If
simultaneously, the rest of the entire muscle also gets shorter, there
will be no stretch on the central region that contains the sensory
endings, and the afferent axon will not respond. However, if the muscle
spindle contracts faster than does the muscle as a whole, there will be
a considerable amount of afferent activity. The motor system makes use
of this phenomenon in the following way: When commands from the brain
are issued to move a limb, both the alpha motor neurons and the gamma
motor neurons are activated. The alpha motor neurons start the muscle
contracting. If there is little resistance, both the extrafusal and
intrafusal muscle fibers will contract at approximately the same rate,
and little activity will be seen from the afferent axons of the muscle
spindle. However, if the limb meets with resistance, the intrafusal
muscle fibers will shorten more than the extrafusal muscle fibers, and
sensory axons will begin to fire and cause the monosynaptic stretch
reflex to strengthen the contraction. This is how the brain makes use of
the gamma motor system in moving the limbs. By establishing a rate of
firing in

M08_CARL0287_13_GE_C08.indd 243

Polysynaptic Reflexes Contrast polysynaptic and monosynaptic reflexes.

The monosynaptic stretch reflex is the only spinal reflex we know of
that involves only one synapse. All others are ­polysynaptic. Examples
include relatively simple ones, such as limb withdrawal in response to a
painful stimulation, and relatively complex ones, such as the startle
reflex. Spinal reflexes do not exist in isolation; they are normally
controlled by the brain. For example, Chapter 2 described how inhibition
from the brain can prevent a person from dropping a hot cup, even though
the painful stimuli received by the fingers cause reflexive extension of
the fingers. We will now explore some of the general principles of
polysynaptic reflexes, but we should mention that the simple circuit
diagrams used here (including the one you just looked at in Figure 8.7)
are oversimplified. Reflex circuits are typically shown as a single
chain of neurons, but in reality most reflexes involve thousands of
neurons. Each axon usually synapses on many neurons, and each neuron
receives synapses from many different axons. As you read earlier, the
afferent axons from the Golgi tendon organ detect muscle stretch. There
are two populations of afferent axons from the Golgi tendon organ, with
different sensitivities to stretch. The more sensitive afferent axons
tell the brain how hard the muscle is pulling. The less sensitive ones
have an additional function. Their terminal buttons synapse on spinal
cord interneurons--- neurons that reside entirely within the gray matter
of the spinal cord and interconnect other spinal neurons. These
interneurons synapse on the alpha motor neurons serving the same muscle.
The terminal buttons release glycine and produce inhibitory postsynaptic
potentials on the motor neurons. (See Figure 8.8.) The function of this
reflex pathway is to decrease the strength of muscular contraction when
there is a danger of damage to the tendons or bones to which the muscles
are attached. The discovery of the inhibitory Golgi tendon organ reflex
provided the first real evidence of neural inhibition, long before the
synaptic mechanisms were understood. A decerebrate cat, whose brain stem
has been cut through (transected), exhibits a phenomenon known as
decerebrate rigidity. The animal's back is arched, and its legs are
extended stiffly from its body. This rigidity results from excitation
originating in the caudal reticular formation, a region of the brain
stem, which greatly facilitates all stretch reflexes, especially of
extensor muscles,

by increasing the activity of the gamma motor system. Rostral to the
brain stem transection is an inhibitory region of the reticular
formation that normally counterbalances the excitatory one. The
transection removes the inhibitory influence, leaving only the
excitatory one. If you attempt to flex the outstretched leg of a
decerebrate

cat, you will meet with increasing resistance, which will suddenly melt
away, allowing the limb to flex. It almost feels as though you were
closing the blade of a pocketknife, which is why this has been named the
clasp-knife reflex. The sudden release is mediated by the activation of
the Golgi tendon organ reflex.

multiple synapses involved in more c­ omplex reflexive behavior, such as
inhibiting a withdrawal reflex. Polysynaptic reflexes contain at least

Control of Movement 245

Control of Movement by the Brain The brain and spinal cord include
several different motor systems, each of which can simultaneously
control particular kinds of movements. For example, a person can walk
and talk with a friend simultaneously. At the same time, the person can
gesture with their hands to emphasize a point, scratch an itch, brush
away a fly, wipe sweat off their forehead, and so on. Walking, postural
adjustments, talking, and moving the arms and fingers all involve
different specialized motor systems, which we will look at in more
detail in this module. Movements can be initiated several ways. For
example, rapidly stretching a muscle triggers the ­monosynaptic stretch
reflex, stumbling triggers righting reflexes, and an object rapidly
approaching your face causes a startle response, a complex reflex
consisting of movements of ­ several muscle groups. Other stimuli
initiate sequences of movements described in other chapters. For
example, the presence of food causes eating, and the sight of a loved
one evokes a hug and a kiss. Because there are many causes of behavior,
there are many starting points for the neural mechanisms that control
movement.

In this module, we will explore the role of the brain in controlling
movements, and we will do so by highlighting the roles of some specific
motor regions of cortical and subcortical structures.

Cortical Structures LO 8.7

Describe how motor control information is processed in the cortex.

Cortical structures involved in controlling movement include the primary
motor cortex, supplementary motor area, and premotor cortex. These
regions and their contributions to motor control will be described in
the following sections. The primary motor cortex lies on the precentral
gyrus, just rostral to the central sulcus. Stimulation studies
(including those in awake humans) have shown that activating neurons
located in particular parts of the primary motor cortex causes movements
of particular parts of the body. In other words, the primary motor
cortex shows somatotopic organization (from soma, "body," and topos,
"place"). Figure 8.9 shows a motor homunculus based on the observations
of Penfield and Rasmussen (1950). Note that a disproportionate amount of
cortical area is devoted to

246 Chapter 8 movements of the fingers and the muscles used for speech,
as represented by the disproportionately large mouth on the human figure
in Figure 8.9. The primary motor cortex is organized in terms of
particular movements of particular parts of the body. Each movement may
be accomplished by the contraction of several muscles. For example, when
the arm is extended in a particular direction, many muscles in the
shoulder, upper arm, and forearm must contract. This fact means that
complex neural circuitry is located between individual ­neurons in the
primary motor cortex and the motor neurons in the spinal cord that cause
motor units to contract. The ­commands for movement initiated in the
motor cortex are assisted and modified---most notably, by the basal
ganglia and the cerebellum. A study by Graziano and Aflalo (2007) found
that although briefly stimulating particular regions of the primary
motor cortex of monkeys caused brief movements of various parts of the
body, prolonged stimulation produced much more complex movements. For
example, stimulating one region caused the hand to close and then
approach the mouth, and the mouth then to open. Stimulation of another
region caused the face to squint, the head to turn quickly to one side,
and the arms to fling up as if to protect the face from something that
was going to hit it. Stimulating different zones of the motor cortex
caused different categories of actions. The map of these categories was
consistent from animal to animal. (See Figure 8.10.)

MOTOR ASSOCIATION CORTEX: SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA AND PREMOTOR CORTEX
The ­motor

association cortex includes the supplementary motor area and premotor
cortex. These regions are immediately ­adjacent to the primary motor
cortex and are especially important in controlling movement. Both
regions receive sensory information from the parietal and temporal
lobes, and both send efferent axons to the primary motor cortex. The
supplementary motor area (SMA) is located on the medial surface of the
brain, just rostral to the primary motor cortex. The premotor cortex is
located primarily on the lateral surface, also just rostral to the
primary motor cortex. The locations of primary motor cortex,
supplementary motor cortex, and premotor cortex are shown in Figures 8.9
and 8.11. The roles that these regions play in the control of movement
are discussed next.

Planning and Initiating Movements: Role of the Motor Association Cortex
LO 8.8

Describe the functions of the motor association cortex in planning and
initiating movement.

Within the motor association cortex, the supplementary motor area and
the premotor cortex are involved in planning movements, and they execute
these plans through their connections with the primary motor cortex.
(See Figure 8.11.) Functionalimaging studies show that when people
execute sequences of

movements---or even imagine them---these regions become activated (Roth
et al., 1996). More recent evidence indicates that the motor association
cortex is also involved in imitating the actions of other people (an
ability that makes it possible to learn new behaviors from them) and
even in understanding the functions of other people's behavior. The
supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex receive information
from association areas of the parietal and temporal cortex. As we saw in
Chapter 6, the visual association cortex is organized in two streams:
dorsal and ventral. The ventral stream, which terminates in the inferior
temporal cortex, is involved in perceiving and recognizing particular
objects---the "what" of visual perception. The dorsal stream, which
terminates in the posterior parietal lobe, is involved in perceiving
location---the "where" of visual perception. In addition, the parietal
lobes are involved in organizing visually guided movements that interact
with objects in the environment---the "how" of visual perception.
Besides receiving information about space from the visual system, the
parietal lobes receive information about spatial location from the
somatosensory, vestibular, and ­auditory systems and integrate this
information with visual information. In this way, the regions of the
frontal cortex that are involved in planning movements receive the
information they need about what is happening and where it is happening
from the temporal and parietal lobes. Because the parietal lobes contain
spatial information, the pathway from them to the frontal lobes is
especially important in controlling both locomotion and arm and hand
movements. After all, meaningful locomotion requires us to know where we
are, and meaningful movements of our arms and hands require us to know
where objects are located in space. (See Figure 8.11.) Let's look at the
functions of the supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex in
more detail. In general, the supplementary motor cortex is involved in
learning and performing behaviors that consist of sequences of
movements. The premotor cortex is involved in learning and ­executing
responses that are signaled by the presence of arbitrary stimuli. As a
component of the mirror neuron system, the premotor cortex is also
involved in imitating responses of other people and in understanding and
predicting these actions. You will read more about the mirror neuron
system later in this chapter. SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA The supplementary
motor area (SMA) plays a critical role in behavioral sequences. Damaging
this region disrupts the ability to execute well-learned sequences of
responses in which the performance of one response serves as the signal
that the next response must be made.

a peanut after each response. Figure 8.12 shows the apparatus for this
experiment. Shima and Tanji (1998) temporarily inactivated the SMA in
monkeys with injections of muscimol, a drug that stimulates GABA
receptors and inhibits neural activity. They found that after
inactivating this region, monkeys could still reach for objects or make
particular movements in response to visual cues but could no longer make
a sequence of three movements they had previously learned. A single-unit
recording study came to similar conclusions. Mushiake and colleagues
(1991) trained monkeys to perform a memorized series of responses,
pressing each of three buttons in a specific sequence. While the monkeys
were performing this task, more than half of the neurons in the SMA
became activated. However, when the sequence was cued by visual
stimuli---the monkeys simply had to press the button that was
illuminated---these neurons showed little activity. In another study,
Shima and Tanji (2000) taught monkeys sequences of three motor
responses, such as push, then pull, then turn. They recorded from
neurons in the SMA and found neurons whose activity appeared to encode
elements of these sequences. For example, some neurons responded just
before a particular sequence of three movements occurred; some neurons
responded between two particular responses; some neurons responded as
the monkey was preparing to make the last response of the sequence.
Presumably, these neurons were members of circuits that encoded the
information ­necessary to perform the six sequences.

248 Chapter 8 Research with Humans Studies with human participants have
obtained results similar to those obtained with monkeys. For example, a
functional-imaging study by Hikosaka and colleagues (1996) observed
increased activity in the posterior SMA while performing a learned
sequence of button presses. Gerloff and colleagues (1997) taught people
to make a sequence of 16 finger presses on an electronic piano. When the
experimenters disrupted the activity of the SMA with transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS), performing the sequence was disrupted.
However, the disruption was not immediate: The participants continued
the sequence for approximately one second and then stopped, saying that
they "did not know anymore which series of keys to press next."
Apparently, the SMA is involved in planning the elements yet to come in
sequences of movements. The actual execution of the movements appears to
be controlled elsewhere---likely by the primary motor cortex. Once we
have learned a sequence of movements using one hand, we can easily
perform the sequence with the other hand. Presumably, the learning has
taken place in the hemisphere that controls the hand that first
performed the sequence. Perez and colleagues (2008) trained people to
perform a 12-item sequence of finger movements using four fingers of the
right hand. While they were learning the task, the experimenters
supplied TMS to the participants' left SMA with a sequence of pulses
that temporarily ­disrupted the activity of this region. If the
disrupting stimulation occurred just before each response was to be
made, the participants learned the task with their right hand but
performed poorly when they were later tested with their left hand. If
the stimulation occurred during each finger movement, transfer to the
left hand was as expected. Perez and her colleagues noted that the left
and right SMA have strong interconnections and suggest that during the
learning of the sequence, information about the previous response was
transmitted from the left SMA to the right SMA. The disrupting TMS
interfered with this transfer. A region just anterior to the
supplementary motor area, the pre-SMA, appears to be involved in the
control of spontaneous movements---or at least in the perception of
control. It has long been known that although electrical stimulation of
the motor cortex causes movements, it does not produce the desire to
move. The movement is perceived as automatic and involuntary. In
contrast, electrical stimulation of the medial surface of the frontal
lobes (including the SMA and pre-SMA) often provokes the urge to make a
movement or at least the anticipation that a movement is about to occur
(Fried et al., 1991). A functional-imaging study by Lau and colleagues
(2004) found that the pre-SMA appears to play a role in voluntary
behavior. They found that this region became active just before people
performed spontaneous movements. The experimenters asked the
participants to make a finger movement from time to time, whenever they
felt like doing so.

M08_CARL0287_13_GE_C08.indd 248

The participants watched a red light that moved around a clock face at
about 2.5 sec per revolution. They were asked to pay attention to the
instant when they decided to make the movement and report the position
of the red dot at that time. The decision appeared to occur
approximately 0.2 sec before the movement began. However, fMRI showed
that the activity of the pre-SMA actually began to increase
approximately 2--3 sec earlier than that, which suggests that the neural
activity responsible for the decision to move begins before a person is
even aware of making that decision. The results suggest that although we
feel that we consciously decide when to make a response, the decision is
actually made by brain processes of which we are unaware. We do not
become aware of the decision until later. Evidence suggests that the
decision to move is not made by neurons in the SMA. Sirigu and
colleagues (2004) used a task similar to the one in the study by Lau and
colleagues (2004) to investigate decision making in people with lesions
of the posterior parietal cortex. They found that people with these
lesions could accurately report when they started the movement, but they
were not aware of an intention to move prior to making the movement. The
investigators suggest that neural activity in the posterior parietal
cortex "generates a predictive internal model of the upcoming movement"
(Sirigu et al., 2004, p. 80). What neural circuits are actually
responsible for making a decision to move? Sirigu and colleagues (2004)
note that lesions of the prefrontal cortex (even more anterior than the
pre-SMA) disrupt people's plans for voluntary action. People with
prefrontal lesions will react to events but show deficits in initiating
behavior, so perhaps the prefrontal cortex is an important source of
these decisions. The posterior parietal cortex may be involved in
monitoring one's own plans and intentions rather than directly forming
these intentions. A functional-imaging study by Soon and colleagues
(2008) found evidence that a region of the prefrontal cortex--- the
frontopolar cortex, located at the rostral tip of the cerebral
hemispheres---may play a critical role in deciding to make a motor
response. The investigators had participants perform a task similar to
the one used by Lau and colleagues (2004). The participants were told to
watch a screen that displayed a stream of letters and to press one of
two buttons whenever they felt like it. The choice of button and the
timing of the response was up to them. After each response, the
participants reported the letter they had seen on the screen at the time
they decided to press one of the buttons, which indicated the time
between the awareness of this decision and their m ­ ovement---which
averaged about one second. Examination of the pattern of brain
activation on each trial enabled the investigators to predict the
decision to press the right or left button. Approximately 10 sec before
the response, the decision about which button should be pressed could
accurately be predicted by particular patterns of activity in the
frontopolar cortex. The decision could be predicted

shortly thereafter by the pattern of activity in the posterior parietal
cortex, and then by the activity in the SMA. Finally, the primary motor
cortex became activated, causing the finger to move. These results
suggest that the prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in decision
making. The posterior parietal cortex appears to be involved in storing
the information about the decision and transmitting it to the SMA, where
the process of executing the response begins. Table 8.1 summarizes many
of the research results described in this section. PREMOTOR CORTEX The
premotor cortex is involved in learning and executing complex movements
that are guided by sensory information. The results of several studies
suggest that the premotor cortex is involved in using arbitrary stimuli
to indicate what movement should be made. For example, reaching for an
object that we see in a particular location involves nonarbitrary
spatial information; that is, the visual information provided by the
location of the object specifies just where we should target our
reaching movement. But we also have the ability to learn to make
movements based on arbitrary information---information that is not
directly related to the movement that it signals. The case at the
beginning of this chapter describes deficits in making movements based
on arbitrary information (being asked to wave versus waving in response
to seeing new people). For example, a person can point to a particular
object when someone says its name, or a dancer can make a particular
movement when asked to do so by a choreographer. Different languages use
different sounds to indicate the names of objects, and different
choreographers could invent different names for movements used in their
dances. Or a person could be told to "wave your left hand when you hear
the buzz and touch your nose when you hear the bell." The associations
between these stimuli and the movements they designate are arbitrary and
must be learned.

Research with Nonhuman Primates Kurata and Hoffman (1994) trained
monkeys to move their hand toward the right or left in response to
either a spatial or a nonspatial signal. The spatial signal required the
animals to move in the direction indicated by signal lights located to
the right

M08_CARL0287_13_GE_C08.indd 249

and left of its hand. The nonspatial signal consisted of a pair of
lights, one red and one green, located in the middle of the display. The
red light signaled a movement to the left, and the green light signaled
a movement to the right. The investigators temporarily inactivated the
premotor cortex with injections of muscimol. When this region was
inactivated, the monkeys could still move their hand toward a signal
light located to the left or right (a n ­ onarbitrary ­signal), but they
could no longer make the appropriate movements when the red or green
signal lights were illuminated (an arbitrary signal). Research with
Humans Similar results are seen in people with damage to the premotor
cortex. Halsband and Freund (1990) found that patients with these
lesions could learn to make six different movements in response to
spatial cues but not in response to arbitrary visual cues. That is, they
could learn to point to one of six locations in which they had just seen
a visual stimulus, but they could not learn to use a set of visual,
auditory, and tactile cues to make particular movements. Nowak and
colleagues (2009) found further evidence that the premotor cortex plays
a role in learning to ­control movements in response to arbitrary
stimuli. The investigators trained participants to grasp and lift an
object positioned between the thumb and forefinger of their right
(dominant) hand. The participants watched a computer screen; when a blue
dot appeared, they immediately gripped the object and lifted it.
Sometimes the dot was pale blue, and sometimes it was dark blue. The
light blue dot indicated that the object would weigh 350 g, and the dark
blue dot indicated that it would weigh 550 g. This protocol meant that
the force needed to grip and lift the object was indicated by an
arbitrary signal. The participants learned to grip the object more
forcefully when the dark blue dot (heavy signal) appeared, indicating
that the object would be heavy. Next, 20 sec of repetitive TMS was
applied to the participants' left dorsal premotor cortex, which inhibits
this brain region for approximately 30 minutes. When the participants
were again tested on the task, they did not adjust the force of their
grip; instead, they used a more forceful grip regardless of the
brightness of the blue dot.

Subcortical Structures LO 8.9

Describe the functions of subcortical regions involved in control of
motor behavior.

In addition to the cortical regions and the spinal cord, control of
motor behavior also involves several subcortical structures, including
the reticular formation, cerebellum, and the basal ganglia. These
structures contain sets of ­nuclei in the mid- and hindbrain that are
involved in the control of voluntary and involuntary motor behavior,
­posture, locomotion, and limb movements. They receive information from
regions of the motor cortex and help ­convey it to the spinal cord and
nerves. (See Figure 8.13.) THE RETICULAR FORMATION The reticular
formation consists of a large number of nuclei located in the core of
the medulla, pons, and midbrain. The reticular formation controls the
activity of the gamma motor system and regulates muscle tonus. In
addition, the pons and medulla contain several nuclei with specific
motor functions. For example, different locations in the medulla control
automatic or semiautomatic responses such as respiration, sneezing,
coughing, and vomiting. As we saw, pathways in the ventromedial group
originate in the superior colliculi, vestibular nuclei, and reticular
formation. In this way, the reticular formation plays a role in the
control of posture. The reticular formation also plays a role in
locomotion. Stimulating the mesencephalic locomotor region, located
ventral to the inferior colliculus, causes a cat to make pacing
movements (Shik & Orlovsky, 1976). The mesencephalic locomotor region
does not send fibers directly to the

Figure 8.13 Subcortical Structures Involved in Control

of Movement

Basal ganglia Cerebellum Reticular formation

M08_CARL0287_13_GE_C08.indd 250

spinal cord but apparently controls the activity of reticulospinal tract
neurons. The reticular formation also appears to exert control over some
very specific behaviors. For example, Siegel and McGinty (1977) recorded
from 35 single neurons in the reticular formation of unanesthetized,
freely moving cats. Thirtytwo of these neurons responded during specific
movements of the head, tongue, facial muscles, ears, forepaw, or
shoulder. The specific nature of the relationships suggests that the
neurons play some role in controlling the movements. For example, one
neuron responded when the tongue moved out and to the left. The
functions of these neurons and the range of movements they control are
not yet known. A second subcortical structure, the cerebellum, is an
important part of the motor system. It contains about 80 percent of all
brain neurons (Azevedo et al., 2009; Lent et al., 2012). Its outputs
project to every major motor structure of the brain. When it is damaged,
people's movements become jerky, erratic, and uncoordinated. The
cerebellum consists of two hemispheres that contain several deep nuclei
situated beneath the wrinkled and folded cerebellar cortex. The
cerebellum resembles the cerebrum in miniature. The medial part of the
cerebellum is evolutionarily older than the lateral part, and it
participates in controlling the ventromedial system. The flocculonodular
lobe, located at the caudal end of the cerebellum, receives input from
the vestibular system and projects axons to the vestibular nucleus. (See
Figure 8.14.) You may not be surprised to learn that this system is
involved in postural reflexes. (See the green lines in Figure 8.14.) The
vermis, located on the midline, receives auditory and visual information
from the tectum and cutaneous and kinesthetic i­ nformation from the
spinal cord. It sends its outputs to the fastigial nucleus (one of the
set of deep cerebellar nuclei). Neurons in the fastigial nucleus send
axons to the vestibular nucleus and to motor nuclei in the reticular
formation. These neurons influence behavior through the vestibulospinal
and reticulospinal tracts, two of the three ventromedial pathways. (See
the blue lines in Figure 8.14.) The rest of the cerebellar cortex
receives most of its input from the cerebral cortex, including the
primary motor cortex and association cortex. This input is relayed to
the cerebellar cortex through the pontine tegmental reticular nucleus.
The intermediate zone of the cerebellar cortex projects to the
interposed nuclei, which in turn project to the red nucleus. In this
way, the intermediate zone influences the control of the rubrospinal
system over movements of the arms and legs. The interposed nuclei also
send outputs to the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus, which projects to
the motor cortex. (See the red lines in Figure 8.14.) The lateral zone
of the cerebellum is involved in the control of independent limb
movements, especially rapid, THE CEREBELLUM

skilled movements. Such movements are initiated by neurons in the
frontal association cortex, which control neurons in the primary motor
cortex. But although the frontal cortex can plan and initiate movements,
it does not contain the neural circuitry needed to calculate the
complex, closely timed sequences of muscular contractions that are

M08_CARL0287_13_GE_C08.indd 251

needed for rapid, skilled movements. That task falls to the lateral zone
of the cerebellum. Both the frontal association cortex and the primary
motor cortex send information about intended movements to the lateral
zone of the cerebellum via the pontine nucleus. The lateral zone also
receives information from

08/11/2021 19:58

252 Chapter 8 the somatosensory system, which informs it about the
current position and rate of movement of the limbs--- information that
is necessary for computing the details of a movement. When the
cerebellum receives information that the motor cortex has begun to
initiate a movement, it computes the contribution that various muscles
will have to make to perform that movement. The results of this
computation are sent to the dentate nucleus, another of the deep
cerebellar nuclei. Neurons in the dentate nucleus pass the information
on to the ventrolateral thalamus, which projects to the primary motor
cortex. The projection from the ventrolateral thalamus to the primary
motor cortex enables the ­cerebellum to modify the ongoing movement that
was initiated by the frontal cortex. The lateral zone of the cerebellum
also sends efferents to the red nucleus (again, via the dentate nucleus)
to help control independent limb ­movements through this system as well.
(See Figure 8.15.)

Cerebellum

In humans, lesions of different regions of the cerebellum produce
different symptoms. Damage to the flocculonod-ular lobe or the vermis
causes disturbances in posture and balance. Damage to the intermediate
zone produces deficits in movements controlled by the rubrospinal
system; the principal symptom of this damage is limb rigidity. Damage to
the lateral zone causes weakness and decomposition of movement. For
example, a person with this kind of damage who is attempting to bring
the hand to the mouth will make separate movements of the joints of the
shoulder, elbow, and wrist instead of performing simultaneous smooth
movements. Lesions of the lateral zone of the cerebellar cortex also
appear to impair the timing of rapid ballistic movements. Ballistic
(literally, "throwing") movements occur too fast to be modified by
feedback. The sequence of muscular movements must then be programmed in
advance, and the individual muscles must be activated at the proper
times. You might like to try this common neurological test: Have a
friend place his or her finger in front of your face, about
three-quarters of an arm's length away. While your friend slowly moves
his or her finger around to serve as a moving target, alternately touch
your nose and your friend's finger as rapidly as you can. If your
cerebellum is functioning as expected, you can successfully hit your
nose and your friend's finger without too much trouble. People with
lateral cerebellar damage or injury have difficulty with this task; they
tend to miss the examiner's hand and their nose. When making rapid,
aimed movements, such as throwing, we cannot rely on feedback to stop
the movement when we reach the target. By the time we perceive that our
finger has reached the proper place, it is too late to stop the
movement, and we will overshoot the target if we try to stop it then.
Instead of relying on feedback, the movement appears to be timed. We
estimate the distance between our hand and the target, and our
cerebellum calculates the amount of time that the muscles will have to
be turned on. After the proper amount of time, the cerebellum briefly
turns on antagonistic muscles to stop the movement. In fact, Kornhuber
(1974) suggested that one of the primary functions of the cerebellum is
timing the duration of rapid movements. Learning must play a role in
controlling such movements. Timmann and colleagues (1999) reported an
interesting example of the role the cerebellum plays in timing sequences
of muscular contractions. When tossing a ball at a target using an
overarm throw, a person raises his or her hand above the shoulder,
rotates the arm forward, and then releases the ball by extending the
fingers---moving them apart. The timing of the release is critical: too
soon and the ball goes too high, too late and it goes too low. The
researchers found that healthy participants released the ball within an
11 msec window 95 percent of the time.

Control of Movement 253

Patients with cerebellar lesions did five times worse: Their window was
55 msec wide. The cerebellum also appears to integrate successive
sequences of movements that must be performed one after the other. For
example, a patient with a lesion in the cerebellum described their
movement by saying: "The movements of my left arm are done
subconsciously, but I have to think out each movement of the right
\[affected\] arm. I come to a dead stop in turning and have to think
before I start again" (Holmes, 1939). Many neurons in the dentate nuclei
(which receive inputs from the lateral zone of the cerebellar cortex)
showed response patterns that predict the next movement in a sequence
rather than the one that is currently taking place (Thach, 1978).
Presumably, deliberately planning the movements was necessary due to the
cerebellum damage that affected the patient's right arm. The case of
Mr. P. illustrates the unique role of the cerebellum in regulating
movements. As you will read, other brain regions (and sensory feedback)
can help to compensate for missing cerebellar control of movement but
are not nearly as efficient. Dr. S., a professor of neurology at the
medical school, stood on the stage of the auditorium as he presented a
case to a group of physicians and students. He discussed the symptoms
and possible causes of cerebellar--brain stem degeneration. "Now I'd
like you to meet Mr. P.," he said, as a set of MRI scans appeared on the
screen. "As you can see, Mr. P.'s cerebellum shows substantial
degeneration, but we can't see evidence of any damage to the brain
stem." Dr. S. left the stage and returned, pushing Mr. P. onstage in a
wheelchair. Dr. S. chatted with Mr. P. for a few minutes, demonstrating
his awareness and that he had no readily apparent speech or memory
changes. "Okay, Mr. P., I'd like you to make some movements." He faced
Mr. P. and said, "Please stretch your hands out and hold them like
this." Dr. S. suddenly raised his arms from his sides and held them out
straight in front of him, palms down, fingers pointing forward. Mr. P.
did not respond immediately. He looked as if he were considering what to
do. Suddenly, his arms straightened out and lifted from the armrests of
the wheelchair. Instead of stopping when they pointed straight ahead of
him, they continued upward. Mr. P.'s arms began moving around---up,
down, left, and right---until he finally held them outstretched in front
of him. It was clear that it required effort to hold them there. "Thank
you, Mr. P. Now try this." Dr. S. very slowly raised his arms from his
side until they were straight out in front of them. Mr. P. did the same,
and this time there was no overshoot. After a few more demonstrations,
Dr. S. thanked Mr. P. and reviewed what we had seen. "When Mr. P. tried
to quickly raise his arms in front of him, his primary motor cortex sent
messages to the appropriate muscles, and his arms straightened out and
began to rise. Usually, the cerebellum is informed about the movement
and, through

M08_CARL0287_13_GE_C08.indd 253

its connections back to the motor cortex, begins to contract the
antagonistic muscles at the appropriate time, bringing the arms to rest
in the intended position. Mr. P. could get the movement started, but the
degeneration in his cerebellum eliminated the help this structure gives
to rapid movements, and he couldn't stop his arms in time. When he tried
to move slowly, he could use visual and kinesthetic feedback from the
position of his arms to control the movement."

THE BASAL GANGLIA Another set of subcortical nuclei, the basal ganglia,
constitute an important component of the motor system. We know that they
are important because their destruction by disease or injury causes
severe motor deficits. The motor nuclei of the basal ganglia include the
caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus. The basal ganglia receive
most of their input from all regions of the cerebral cortex (but
especially the primary motor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex)
and the substantia nigra. The primary outputs of the basal ganglia are
as follows: the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor
cortex (via the thalamus), and motor nuclei of the brain stem that
contribute to the ventromedial pathways. Through these connections the
basal ganglia influence movements under the control of the primary motor
cortex and exert some direct control over the ventromedial system.
Figure 8.16 illustrates the components of the basal ganglia: the caudate
nucleus, the putamen, and the globus pallidus. It also shows some nuclei
associated with the basal ganglia: the ventral anterior nucleus and
ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus, the subthalamic nucleus, and the
substantia nigra of the ventral midbrain. Figure 8.16 shows some of the
more important connections of the basal ganglia and helps to explain the
role these structures play in the control of movement. For the sake of
clarity, this figure leaves out many connections, including inputs to
the substantia nigra from the basal ganglia and other structures. In the
following sections, we will more closely examine (1) connections between
the basal ganglia and cortex, and (2) the effects of motor behavior when
the basal ganglia are damaged by neurodegenerative disorders.

Connections with Cortex First, let's take a look at the connections
between the basal ganglia and cortex. The frontal, parietal, and
temporal cortex send axons to the caudate nucleus and the putamen, which
then connect with the globus pallidus, forming a loop. The globus
pallidus sends information back to the motor cortex via the ventral
anterior and ventrolateral nuclei of the thalamus, completing the loop.
This way, the basal ganglia can monitor somatosensory information and
are informed of movements being planned and executed by the motor
cortex. Using this information (and other information they receive

from other parts of the brain), they can then influence the movements
controlled by the motor cortex. Throughout this circuit, information is
represented somatotopically. That is, projections from neurons in the
motor cortex that cause movements in particular parts of the body
project to particular parts of the putamen, and this segregation is
maintained all the way back to the motor cortex. (See Figure 8.16.) Now
let's consider some of the complexities of the ­cortical--basal ganglia
loop. The links in the loop are made by both excitatory
(glutamate-secreting) neurons and inhibitory (GABA-secreting) neurons.
The caudate nucleus and putamen receive excitatory input from the
cerebral cortex. They send inhibitory axons to the internal and external
divisions of the globus pallidus (the GPi and the GPe, respectively).
The subthalamic nucleus also receives

excitatory input from the cerebral cortex, and it sends excitatory input
to the GPi. In Figure 8.16, the pathway shown in solid lines that
includes the GPi is known as the direct pathway. Neurons in GPi send
inhibitory axons to the ventral anterior and ventrolateral thalamus
(VA/VL thalamus), which send excitatory projections to the motor cortex.
The net effect of the loop is excitatory because it contains two
inhibitory links. Each inhibitory link (red arrow) reverses the sign of
the input to that link. Excitatory input to the caudate nucleus and
putamen causes these structures to inhibit neurons in the GPi. This
inhibition removes the inhibitory effect of the connections between the
GPi on the VA/VL thalamus; in other words, neurons in the VA/VL thalamus
become more excited. This excitation is passed on to the motor cortex,
where it facilitates movements. (Look again at Figure 8.16.)

08/11/2021 19:58

Control of Movement 255

The pathway shown in broken lines, which includes the GPe, is known as
the indirect pathway. Neurons in GPe send inhibitory input to the
subthalamic nucleus, which sends excitatory input to the GPi. From there
on, the circuit is identical to the one we just examined---­ except that
the ultimate effect of this loop on the thalamus and frontal cortex is
inhibitory. The globus pallidus also sends axons to various motor nuclei
in the brain stem that contribute to the ventromedial system. The effect
of this pathway is to inhibit the motor cortex. (Look once again at
Figure 8.16.) A third pathway shown in Figure 8.16 is known as the
hyperdirect pathway. Neurons in the pre-SMA send excitatory input to the
subthalamic nucleus, which sends excitatory input to the GPi. As we just
saw, the GPi has an inhibitory effect on the motor cortex, so the
hyperdirect pathway inhibits movements. The general functions of the
direct and indirect pathways have long been understood. However, the
hyperdirect pathway was recognized much more recently (Gerfen, 2000;
Nambu et al., 2002). This pathway bypasses the caudate nucleus and
putamen and is able to inhibit movement with a much shorter delay than
the indirect pathway. Most investigators believe that this pathway plays
a role in preventing or quickly stopping movements that are being
initiated by the direct pathway (Nachev et al., 2008; Nambu, 2008). For
example, suppose that you are jogging down a city street. As you
approach a cross street, you see that the stoplight is red, so you stop
running. The indirect pathway plays a role in the inhibition of your
jogging. (Perhaps not completely---perhaps you jog in place while you
wait for the light to change.) The light turns green, and this go signal
is reflected by increased activity of your direct pathway. You lean
forward and raise a foot to begin jogging again. Suddenly, you hear the
roar of a speeding car immediately to your left. You quickly stop, and
before you can turn your head to look for the source of the noise, a car
that has just run through the red light passes in front of you. Activity
in your hyperdirect pathway has just saved your life. Another important
input to the basal ganglia comes from the substantia nigra of the
midbrain. We saw in Chapter 4 that degeneration of the nigrostriatal
bundle, the dopaminergic pathway from the substantia nigra to the
caudate nucleus and putamen (the ­neostriatum), causes Parkinson's
disease, which we will discuss in more detail in the next submodule.
(Look again at Figure 8.16.) Neurodegenerative Disorders of the Basal
Ganglia Now that we have explored the connections between the basal
ganglia and motor cortex, we can begin to understand the symptoms and
treatment of two important neurological disorders that affect these
brain regions: Parkinson's dis-

ease and Huntington's disease. Each of these is a progressive,
neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor deficits. These
diseases are described in greater detail in Chapter 16. In general,
Parkinson's disease is characterized by an impairment in initiating
movement, particularly actions that were previously automatic, such as
regaining balance after being bumped or walking from point to point. The
symptoms of Parkinson's disease are caused by degeneration of
dopamine-secreting cells in the substantia nigra and subsequent
disruption of the afferent pathways to the caudate and putamen. (See
Figure 8.17.) In contrast, Huntington's disease is characterized by
uncontrollable movements and an impaired ability to cease motor
movements. The symptoms of Huntington's disease are produced by
degeneration of the GABAergic and acetylcholinergic neurons in the
caudate and putamen. The loss of inhibition provided by these
GABAsecreting neurons increases the activity of the GPe, which then
inhibits the subthalamic nucleus. As a consequence, the activity level
of the GPi decreases, and excessive movements occur.

Cortical Control of Movement: Descending Pathways LO 8.10 Describe the
components of the descending pathways. Next, we will examine the
pathways from the brain that are responsible for communicating
information to the muscles of the body. Neurons in the primary motor
cortex control movements by two groups of descending tracts, the lateral
group and the ventromedial group, named for their locations in the white
matter of the spinal cord. The lateral group consists of the
corticospinal tract, the corticobulbar tract, and the rubrospinal tract.
This system is primarily involved in controlling independent limb
movements, particularly movements of the hands and fingers. Independent
limb movements mean that

08/11/2021 19:58

256 Chapter 8 the right and left limbs make different movements or one
limb moves while the other remains still. These movements contrast with
coordinated limb movements, such as those involved in locomotion. The
ventromedial group consists of the vestibulospinal tract, the
tectospinal tract, the reticulospinal tract, and the ventral
corticospinal tract. These tracts control more automatic movements:
gross movements of the muscles of the trunk and coordinated trunk and
limb movements involved in posture and locomotion. Let's consider the
lateral group of descending tracts first. The corticospinal tract
consists of axons of cortical neurons that terminate in the gray matter
of the spinal cord. The largest concentration of cell bodies responsible
for these axons is located in the primary motor cortex, but neurons in
the parietal and temporal lobes also send axons through the
corticospinal tract. The axons leave the cortex and travel through
subcortical white matter to the ventral midbrain, where they enter the
cerebral peduncles. They leave the peduncles in the medulla and form the
pyramidal tracts, named for their shape. At the level of the caudal
medulla, most of the fibers decussate (cross over) and descend through
the contralateral spinal cord, forming the lateral corticospinal tract.
The rest of the fibers descend through the ipsilateral spinal cord,
forming the ventral corticospinal tract. Because of its location and
function, the ventral corticospinal tract is actually part of the
ventromedial group. (See Figure 8.18.) Most of the axons in the lateral
corticospinal tract originate in the regions of the primary motor cortex
and supplementary motor area that control the distal parts of the limbs:
the arms, hands, and fingers and the lower legs, feet, and toes. They
form synapses, directly or via interneurons, with motor neurons in the
gray matter of the spinal cord--- in the lateral part of the ventral
horn. These motor neurons control muscles of the distal limbs, including
muscles that move the arms, hands, and fingers. The axons in the ventral
corticospinal tract originate in the upper leg and trunk regions of the
primary motor cortex. They descend to the appropriate region of the
spinal cord and divide, sending terminal buttons into both sides of the
gray matter. They control motor neurons that move the muscles of the
upper legs and trunk. The corticospinal pathway controls hand and finger
movements and is required for moving the fingers independently when
reaching and manipulating. Postural adjustments of the trunk and use of
the limbs for reaching and locomotion are controlled by other systems.
The second of the lateral group of descending pathways, the
corticobulbar tract, projects to the medulla (sometimes called the
bulb). This pathway is similar to the corticospinal pathway, except that
it terminates in the motor nuclei of the fifth, seventh, ninth, tenth,
eleventh, and twelfth cranial nerves (the trigeminal, facial,

Figure 8.18 Lateral Group of Descending Motor Tracts The figure shows
the lateral corticospinal tract (purple lines), corticobulbar tract
(green lines), and rubrospinal tract (red lines). The ventral
corticospinal tract (blue lines) is part of the ventromedial group.

(nucleus ruber) of the midbrain. The red nucleus receives its most
important inputs from the motor cortex via the ­corticorubral tract and
(as we shall see later) from the cerebellum. Axons of the rubrospinal
tracts terminate on motor neurons in the spinal cord that control
independent movements of the forearms and hands---that is, movements
that are independent of trunk movements. (They do not control the
muscles that move the fingers.)

Figure 8.19 Ventromedial Group of Descending Motor Tracts

The figure shows the tectospinal tract (blue lines), lateral
reticulospinal tract (red lines), medial reticulospinal tract (brown
lines), and vestibulospinal tract (green lines).

Now let's consider the second set of pathways originating in the brain
stem: the ventromedial group. This group includes the vestibulospinal
tracts, the tectospinal tracts, and the reticulospinal tracts, as well
as the ventral corticospinal tract (already described). These tracts
control motor neurons in the ventromedial part of the spinal cord gray
matter. Neurons of all these tracts receive input from the portions of
the primary motor cortex that control movements of the trunk and
proximal muscles (that is, the muscles located on the parts of the limbs
close to the body). In addition, the reticular formation receives a
considerable amount of input from the premotor cortex and from several
subcortical regions, including the amygdala, hypothalamus, and basal
ganglia. The cell bodies of neurons of the vestibulospinal tracts are
located in the vestibular nuclei. As you might guess, this system plays
a role in the control of posture. The cell bodies of neurons in the
tectospinal tracts are located in the superior colliculus and are
involved in coordinating head and trunk movements with eye movements.
The cell bodies of neurons of the reticulospinal tracts are located in
many nuclei in the brain stem and midbrain reticular formation. These
neurons control several automatic functions, such as muscle tonus,
respiration, coughing, and sneezing, but they are also involved in
behaviors that are under direct neocortical control, such as walking.
(See Figure 8.19.) Table 8.2 summarizes the names of these pathways,
their locations, and the muscle groups they control.

Module Review: Control of Movement by the Brain Cortical Structures LO
8.7 Describe how motor control information is processed in the cortex.
The supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex receive information
from the parietal lobe and help to initiate movements through their
connections with the primary motor cortex, which is responsible for
causing movements of particular parts of the body.

Planning and Initiating Movements: Role of the Motor Association Cortex
LO 8.8 Describe the functions of the motor association cortex in
planning and initiating movement. The supplementary motor area is
involved in welllearned behavioral sequences. Neurons there fire at
particular points in behavioral sequences, and disruption or damage
impairs the ability to perform these sequences. The pre-SMA is involved
in awareness of our decisions to make spontaneous movements. The
premotor cortex is involved in learning and executing complex movements
that are guided by arbitrary sensory information, such as verbal
instructions.

Subcortical Structures LO 8.9 Describe the functions of subcortical
regions involved in control of motor behavior. The reticular formation
regulates muscle tone and is involved in some involuntary behaviors and
movements of specific body parts. The cerebellum controls repetitive
movements that require accurate aiming and

Complex Motor Behavior Now that you are familiar with the basic central
nervous system structures involved in motor control, we will turn our
attention to examining how these structures interact to produce several
examples of complex motor behavior. This module of the chapter will
focus on imitating and comprehending movements, and the control of
reaching and grasping. (See Figure 8.20.)

M08_CARL0287_13_GE_C08.indd 258

timing, smoothly guides movements, stops movements at the correct
time/position, and integrates sequences of movements. The basal ganglia
receive input from the motor cortex regions and also direct their output
to these regions and the ventromedial pathway. The basal ganglia also
control the inhibition of unwanted movements. Through these connections
the basal ganglia influence movements under the control of the primary
motor cortex and exert some direct control over the ventromedial system.

Cortical Control of Movement: Descending Pathways LO 8.10 Describe the
components of the descending pathways. The descending pathways relay
motor information from the cortex to the muscles of the body through the
lateral and ventromedial groups. The lateral group consists of the
corticospinal tract, the corticobulbar tract, and the rubrospinal tract
and is involved in the control of independent limb movements,
particularly movements of the hands and fingers. The ventromedial group
consists of the vestibulospinal tract, the tectospinal tract, the
reticulospinal tract, and the ventral corticospinal tract, which control
automatic trunk and limb movements involved in posture and locomotion.

Thought Question The primate brain includes many different brain
structures devoted wholly or in part to motor control. Identify one or
more of these regions and describe how motor control might be affected
by a lesion to this area.

Imitating and Comprehending Movements: Role of the Mirror Neuron System
LO 8.11 Describe the location, components, and functions of the mirror
neuron system. Rizzolatti and his colleagues (Gallese et al., 1996;
Rizzolatti et al., 2001; Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2010) made some
interesting observations that have changed the way we think about
imitating and comprehending the behavior of others.

Figure 8.20 Brain Regions Involved in Complex Motor Behavior

Figure 8.21 Representation of Mirror Neuron

In the human brain, the inferior parietal lobule and the ventral
premotor cortex constitute the primary mirror neuron circuit. The
parietal reach region plays a role in reaching, and the anterior
intraparietal sulcus plays a role in grasping.

This image depicts single electrode recording from a neuron in cortical
region F5. (a) The neuron was active during reaching and grasping
behavior (vertical lines at the top of the panel represent action
potentials from the neuron). (b) The same neuron was active while
observing a reaching and grasping behavior.

(b) Neuron in F5

(c) Neuron in F5

(d) Neuron in F5

The investigators found that neurons in an area of the rostral part of
the ventral premotor cortex in the monkey brain (referred to as area F5)
became active when monkeys saw people or other monkeys perform various
grasping, holding, or manipulating movements with objects or when they
performed these movements themselves. (See Figure 8.21.) The neurons
responded to either the sight or the execution of particular movements.
The investigators named these cells mirror neurons. These neurons,
located in the ventral premotor cortex, are reciprocally connected with
neurons in the posterior parietal cortex, and further investigation
found that this region also contains mirror neurons. Given the
characteristics of mirror neurons, we might expect that they play a role
in a monkey's ability to imitate the movements of other monkeys---and
Rizzolatti and his colleagues found that this inference was correct.
Several functional-imaging studies have shown that the human brain also
contains a circuit of mirror neurons in the rostral part of the inferior
parietal lobule (a region of the posterior parietal cortex) and the
ventral premotor area. For example, in a functional-imaging study,
Buccino and colleagues (2004) had non-musicians watch and then imitate
video clips of an expert guitarist placing his fingers on the neck of a
guitar to play a chord. Both watching and imitating the guitarist's
movements activated the mirror neuron circuit.

M08_CARL0287_13_GE_C08.indd 259

Several studies have found that the mirror neuron system is activated
most strongly when one watches a behavior in which one is already
competent. For example, Calvo-Merino and colleagues (2006) had
professional ballet dancers watch videos of men or women perform ballet
moves. Some moves are performed by men, some by women, and some by both
men and women, but all of the moves have been seen many times by both
male and female ballet dancers. The investigators found that when women
watched women's moves or when men watched men's moves, the mirror neuron
system was strongly activated. However, when women watched men's moves
or when men watched women's moves, much less activity was seen in this
circuit. The mirror neuron circuit develops sensitivity to the sight of
movements that the person actually performs, not simply

08/11/2021 19:58

260 Chapter 8 actions that the person has seen performed. Once this
sensitivity develops, the circuit is activated by watching another
person perform those movements. Mirror neurons are activated not only by
the performance of an action or the sight of someone else performing
that action but also by sounds that indicate the occurrence of a
familiar action. For example, Kohler and colleagues (2002) found that
mirror neurons in the ventral prefrontal cortex of monkeys became active
when the animals heard sounds they recognized, such as a peanut
breaking, a piece of paper being ripped, or a stick being dropped.
Individual neurons---the researchers called them audiovisual
neurons---responded to the sounds of particular actions and to the sight
of those actions being performed. Presumably, activation of these
neurons by these familiar sounds reminds the animals of the actions the
sounds represent. Haslinger and colleagues (2005) found that the
interaction between audition and vision worked in the other direction as
well. The investigators showed professional pianists silent videos of a
hand playing the piano or making meaningless finger movements above a
piano keyboard. Functional imaging showed that when the participants
watched actual piano playing, the mirror neuron system and visual cortex
were activated, as would be expected, but the auditory cortex was
activated as well. Presumably, the musicians imagined what it was like
to make the meaningful hand and finger movements, activating the mirror
neuron system, but also imagined what the piano would sound like when
the keys were pressed, activating the auditory cortex. Rizzolatti and
colleagues suggest that the mirror neuron circuit helps us to understand
the actions of others: \[A\]n action is understood when its observation
causes the motor system of the observer to "resonate." So, when we
observe a hand grasping an apple, the same population of neurons that
control the execution of grasping movements becomes active in the
observer's motor areas. . . . In other words, we understand an action
because the motor representation of that action is activated in our
brain. (2001, p. 661) By "resonation," Rizzolatti and colleagues mean
that the neural circuits responsible for performing a particular action
are activated when we see someone else beginning to perform that action
or even when we hear the characteristic sounds produced by that action.
Feedback from the activation of these circuits gives rise to the
recognition of the action. The next time you intently watch someone
executing a skilled action---say, pitching a baseball, kicking a soccer

ball, performing a difficult dance move, or playing a video game---see
whether you don't find yourself tensing the muscles that you would use
if you were performing the action. Presumably, the activation of the
mirror neuron circuit is responsible for this effect. As we will see in
Chapter 11, we also tend to copy facial expressions of emotion that
other people make, and feedback from doing so tends to evoke a similar
emotional state in us. A functional-imaging study by Iacoboni and
colleagues (2005) suggests that the mirror neuron system helps us to
understand other people's intentions. The researchers showed
participants video clips of an arm and hand reaching for and grasping a
mug. The actions were shown in isolation or in the context of objects
set out for a snack (mug, teapot, milk pitcher, sugar bowl, sealed jam
jar, plate of cookies, and the like) or the same objects after the snack
had been eaten (mug, milk pitcher overturned, cookies missing from the
plate, open jam jar, and the like). The first context suggests that the
intent of the action is that of drinking, and the second suggests that
the intent is that of cleaning up. The investigators found that watching
the reaching action activated the mirror neuron system of the ventral
premotor cortex, but there were differences in the activation when the
action occurred in the two different contexts. (There were no
differences in the activation caused by simply looking at the contexts.)
The authors concluded that the mirror neuron system encodes not only an
action but the intent of that action. (See Figure 8.22.)

Control of Movement 261

Control of Reaching and Grasping: Role of the Parietal Cortex LO 8.12
Summarize the contributions of the parietal cortex in reaching and
grasping behavior. Much of our behavior involves interacting with
objects in our environment. Many of these interactions involve reaching
for something and then doing something with it, such as picking it up,
moving it, or otherwise manipulating it. Researchers investigating these
interactions classify them into two major categories: reaching and
grasping. It turns out that different brain mechanisms are involved in
these two activities. Most reaching behavior is controlled by vision. As
we saw in Chapter 6, the dorsal stream of the visual system is involved
in determining the location of objects and, if they are moving, the
direction and speed of their movement. You may not be surprised to learn
that connections between the parietal lobe (the endpoint of the dorsal
stream of the visual association cortex) and the frontal lobe play a
critical role in reaching. As we saw in Chapter 6, several regions of
the visual association cortex are named for particular types of objects
that we perceive---for example, fusiform face area, extrastriate body
area, and parahippocampal place area. One region of the medial posterior
parietal cortex has been named the parietal reach region. Connolly and
colleagues (2003) found that when people were about to make a pointing
or reaching movement to a particular location, this region became
active. Presumably, the parietal cortex determines the location of the
target and supplies

information about this location to motor mechanisms in the frontal
cortex. (See Figure 8.20.) Another region of the posterior parietal
cortex, the anterior part of the intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), is
involved in controlling hand and finger movements involved in grasping
the target object. A functionalimaging study by Frey and colleagues
(2005) had people reach for objects of different shapes, which required
them to make a variety of hand and finger movements to hold onto the
objects. The brain activity directly related to grasping movements was
determined by subtracting the activity produced by reaching for and
simply touching the objects from the activity produced by reaching for
and grasping the objects. The grasping activity activated the aIPS. (See
Figures 8.20 and 8.23.) An experiment by Tunik and colleagues (2005)
confirmed the importance of the aIPS in grasping. The investigators had
participants reach for and grasp a rectangular object that was oriented
with its long side in a vertical or horizontal position. On some trials
("perturbed trials") the object suddenly rotated during the
participants' reaching movements, which required the participants to
adjust the position of their hand or fingers before they reached the
object. On some of these perturbed trials the investigators applied
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that disrupted the activity of
the aIPS. When the disruptive stimulation occurred shortly after the
rotation of the object, the participants' ability to accurately change
grip posture was disrupted. Stimulation of the hand area of the primary
motor cortex or other parts of the parietal lobe had no effect. The
visual input to the aIPS is from the dorsal stream of the visual system.
In a functional-imaging study by Shmuelof and Zohary (2005),
participants watched brief videos of a hand reaching out to grasp a
variety of objects. Sometimes the hand appeared in the left visual field
and the object appeared in the right visual field; sometimes the
locations for the hand and the object were reversed. (The participants
focused their gaze on a fixation point located between the hand and the
object.) This procedure meant that, for a particular trial, visual
information about an object was transmitted to one side of the brain,
and visual information about a hand shaped to grasp the object was
transmitted to the other side of the brain. Analysis of the brain
activation showed that information about the nature of the object
activated the ventral stream ("what") of the visual system and
information about the shape of the hand activated the aIPS, which is
part of the dorsal stream ("where"). The results suggest that the aIPS
is involved in recognition of grasping movements as well as their
execution. GRASPING BEHAVIOR

Module Review: Complex Motor Behavior Imitating and Comprehending
Movements: Role of the Mirror Neuron System LO 8.11 Describe the
location, components, and functions of the mirror neuron system. The
mirror neuron system is located in the ventral premotor cortex. The
neurons of the mirror neuron system are active when an individual
engages in a behavior as well as when the individual observes (or hears)
the behavior. Another circuit of mirror neurons is located in the
posterior parietal lobe. The proposed function of the mirror neuron
system is to help an individual understand the actions of others.

region, which calculates the reaching movement that must be made and
transmits this information to the motor association cortex. During the
reaching movement the cortex located in the anterior intraparietal
sulcus sends information to the motor association cortex that moves the
hand and fingers to be ready to grasp an object.

Thought Question This module describes many different research studies
investigating the role of the brain in complex behaviors in primates
(including humans). If you were a researcher in this area, which complex
behavior would you consider studying further, and why?

LO 8.12 Summarize the contributions of the parietal cortex in reaching
and grasping behavior. The dorsal stream of the visual association
cortex contributes spatial information to the parietal reaching

Deficits of Skilled Movements: Apraxias and Dyspraxia Damage to the
frontal or parietal cortex of the brain can produce a category of
movement deficits called apraxia. Literally, the term means "without
action," but apraxia differs from paralysis or weakness that occurs when
motor structures such as the precentral gyrus, basal ganglia, brain
stem, or spinal cord are damaged. Apraxia refers to the inability to
imitate movements or to produce them in response to verbal instructions
or the inability to demonstrate the movements that would be made in
using a familiar tool or utensil (Leiguarda & Marsden, 2000). Dyspraxia
encompasses other types of deficits in skilled motor behavior, such as
motor planning or executing a series of skilled movements.
Neuropsychological studies of dyspraxia and the apraxias have provided
information about the way skilled behaviors are organized and initiated.
There are four major types of apraxia, two of which we will discuss
first in this chapter. Limb apraxia refers to problems with movements of
the arms, hands, and fingers. Constructional apraxia refers to
difficulty in drawing or constructing objects. Oral apraxia refers to
problems with movements of the muscles used in speech. Apraxic agraphia
refers to a particular type of writing deficit. Because of

M08_CARL0287_13_GE_C08.indd 262

their relation to language, we will describe oral apraxia and the
various forms of agraphia in Chapter 14. The end of this module will
include a description of the biological basis of dyspraxia.

Limb Apraxia LO 8.13 Describe how brain lesions can produce limb
apraxia. Limb apraxia is characterized by the movement of the wrong part
of the limb, incorrect movement of the correct part, or correct
movements but in the incorrect sequence. It is assessed by asking
individuals to perform movements---for example, imitating hand gestures
made by an examiner. The most difficult movements involve pantomiming
particular acts without the presence of the objects that are normally
acted upon. For example, an examiner might say to a person, "Pretend you
have a key in your hand, and open a door with it." In response, a person
with limb apraxia might wave his wrist back and forth rather than
rotating it or might rotate his wrist first and then pretend to insert
the key. Or if asked to pretend that they are brushing their teeth, a
person with limb apraxia might use their finger as though it were a
toothbrush rather than pretending to hold a toothbrush in their hand. To
perform behaviors on verbal command without having a real object to
manipulate, a person must comprehend the command and be able to imagine
the missing

08/11/2021 19:58

Control of Movement 263

article as well as to make the proper movements; therefore, these
requests are the most difficult to carry out. Somewhat easier are tasks
that involve imitating behaviors performed by the experimenter.
Sometimes, a patient who cannot mime the use of a key can copy the
examiner's hand movements. The easiest tasks involve the actual use of
objects. For example, the examiner might give a person a door key and
ask them to demonstrate its use. If the brain lesion makes it impossible
for the person to understand speech, then the examiner cannot assess the
ability to perform behaviors on verbal command. In this case the
examiner can only measure the person's ability to imitate movements or
use actual objects. (See Heilman, Rothi, et al., 1983 for a review.) Why
does damage to the left parietal hemisphere, but usually not the right,
cause an apraxia of both hands? The answer seems to be that the right
hemisphere is involved with extrapersonal space and the left hemisphere
is involved with one's own body. A functional-imaging study by Chaminade
and colleagues (2005) supports this explanation. The investigators asked
participants to watch another person perform hand and arm gestures and
then either imitate the gestures or make different ones with the same
arm or the other arm. On the basis of the activity seen by fMRI scans,
the authors concluded that posterior regions of the right hemisphere
tracked the movements of the model in space, while the left parietal
lobe organized the movements that would be made in response. Although
the frontal and parietal lobes are both involved in imitating hand
gestures made by other people, the frontal cortex appears to play a more
important role in recognizing the meaning of these gestures. Pazzaglia
and colleagues (2008) tested people with limb apraxia caused by damage
to the left frontal or parietal lobes. They tested the peoples'
recognition of hand gestures by having them watch video clips in which a
person performed the gestures correctly or incorrectly. For example,
incorrect gestures included playing a broom as if it were a guitar or
pretending to hitchhike by extending the little finger instead of the
thumb. People with apraxia who have damage to the inferior frontal
gyrus, but not to the parietal cortex, showed deficits in comprehension
of the gestures.

Constructional Apraxia LO 8.14 Describe how brain lesions can produce
constructional apraxia. Constructional apraxia is caused by lesions of
the right hemisphere, particularly the right parietal lobe. People with
this disorder do not have difficulty making most types of skilled
movements with their arms and hands. They have no trouble using objects
properly, imitating their use, or pretending to use them. However, they
have

difficulty drawing pictures or assembling objects from elements such as
toy building blocks. The primary difficulty in constructional apraxia
appears to involve the ability to perceive and imagine geometrical
relations. For example, because of this difficulty, a person cannot draw
a picture of a cube, because they cannot imagine what the lines and
angles of a cube look like, not because of difficulty controlling the
movements of their arm and hand. (See Figure 8.24). Besides difficulty
drawing accurately, a person with constructional apraxia will likely
find other tasks involving spatial perception, such as following a map,
challenging.

Dyspraxia LO 8.15 Describe the biological basis of dyspraxia. Dyspraxias
can involve a variety of difficulties in planning, organizing, and
coordinating complex motor behaviors. Dyspraxias produce difficulties in
fine and gross motor behavior, often including speech. Complex motor
behavior relies on sensory information and difficulties with sensory
processing are often present in dyspraxia as well. While apraxias are
often the result of lesions, dyspraxias may be developmental in origin,
with symptoms present early in childhood. It is estimated that 5 percent
to 10 percent of children exhibit symptoms of dyspraxias, ranging from
mild to severe (Gibbs et al., 2007). Acquired dyspraxias may also
develop following a brain injury.

08/11/2021 19:58

264 Chapter 8 It is not yet clear what specific brain differences
underlie developmental dyspraxia; however, the brains of children with
dyspraxia exhibit a variety of functional and structural differences
compared to typically developing peers (Peters et al., 2013). Because
the symptoms of dyspraxia often include problems with imitation, some
researchers have speculated that the mirror neuron system may be
involved ­(Werner et al., 2012). Some researchers have assessed the
integration of visual processing with motor behavior by investigating
the role of the dorsal ("where") and ventral ("what") visual streams in
dyspraxia. O'Brien and colleagues compared the performance of children
with dyspraxia on tasks that required the dorsal or ventral stream.
Children's performance was reduced only on the ventral stream--­
dependent tasks. These results suggest that dyspraxia likely involves
brain structures in the extrastriate cortex or parvocellular pathway
related to form processing (O'Brien et al., 2002). Other researchers
have suggested dyspraxia may be due to problems activating broad
networks responsible for integrating sensory information and motor
planning. These changes could encompass integration of visual and motor
cortex activity with cerebellar function (Zwicker et al., 2012) or
reflect delays or changes in the development of circuits that integrate
activity of cortical and subcortical motor regions with activity of the
thalamus and cerebellum (Schiffman et al., 2015). Some researchers have
begun to investigate genetic differences that may underlie developmental
dyspraxia. One case study reported a mutation (called a
microduplication) of the PARK2 gene that was associated with
developmental dyspraxia (Palumbo et al., 2016). PARK2 codes for the
protein parkin and is expressed in the midbrain, basal ganglia, cerebral
cortex, and cerebellum (Huynh et al., 2000). PARK2 mutations have also
been associated with motor control symptoms of Parkinson's disease and
­autism spectrum disorders (see Chapter 16).

DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPRAXIA

ACQUIRED DYSPRAXIA Some types of acquired dyspraxias may be due to
reduced communication between the cortical hemispheres through the
corpus callosum (Tanaka et al., 1996). People who undergo split-brain
operations (see Chapter 14) may experience this type of dyspraxia,
sometimes called diagnostic dyspraxia (Ridley et al., 2016). Diagnostic
dyspraxia has also been reported in individuals whose brains developed
without a corpus ­callosum (Ridley et al., 2016; Sellal et al., 2019). In
one case, symptoms of acquired dyspraxia were successfully treated using
a form of TMS called repeated TMS, or rTMS. Applying rTMS to the right
motor cortex reduced dyspraxia symptoms on the left side of the body.
The patient's symptoms and response to treatment are described below.
The description highlights why these symptoms are also sometimes
referred to as "alien hand syndrome." G. G. was a 58-year-old
right-handed man without any remarkable past medical history until he
experienced a right temporo-parietal stroke. When doctors imaged his
brain, they discovered a complete callosal agenesis (failure to develop
a corpus callosum), which had been completely asymptomatic until the
stroke. In the months after the stroke, G. G. reported a specific motor
behavior in his left hand and leg that he could not consciously control.
His left hand interfered with motor behavior of his right hand. For
example, his left hand threw away a sock his right hand wanted to put
on, and when he walked by the dishwasher in his kitchen, he could not
stop himself from switching the machine on with his left hand, even if
it was empty. He tried to stop his left hand for more than an hour,
until it won and turned the machine on. Without a corpus callosum, G.
G.'s right SMA seemed unable to suppress unwanted motor commands. rTMS
inhibited the efferent part of the right parietal--­premotor movement
network. As the authors of G. G.'s case study reported: "The results
were strikingly positive: The dyspraxia disappeared, and the patient's
life returned to n ­ ormal." Source: Sellal, F., Cretin, B., Musacchio,

Dyspraxia LO 8.15 Describe the biological basis of dyspraxia.
Developmental dyspraxia may be due to structural or functional changes
in the mirror neurons system, the ventral stream, cortical regions
involved in sensory and motor integration, or broad networks integrating
these cortical regions with the cerebellum, thalamus, and other
subcortical motor regions. Genetic mutations may play a role in the
differences in these regions. Acquired dyspraxias can occur following
damage to the corpus callosum

that prevents the inhibition of unwanted motor behaviors by the
supplementary motor area and leads to s­ ymptoms described as "alien hand
syndrome."

Thought Question People with apraxia may experience a reduction in their
quality of life due to their symptoms. Suggest one or more ways that
patients might adapt their behavior to address motor deficits due to
limb or constructional apraxia.

Lately, Samira felt anxious about going to bed because of the unpleasant
experiences she had been having. Several times in the past few months,
while in bed waiting to fall asleep, she had felt as if she were
paralyzed. It was a strange feeling; was she really paralyzed, or was
she just not trying hard enough to move? She always fell asleep before
she was able to decide. A couple of times she woke up just before her
alarm went off and felt unable to move. Then the alarm would ring, and
she would quickly shut it off. That meant she really wasn't paralyzed,
did it not? At first, Samira did not report these episodes to anyone as
she was thrilled about her university life and future opportunities. She
had secured a full scholarship from a prestigious u ­ niversity to study
Physics. One day, while talking to her parents, Samira was overcome by a
sudden urge to sleep. She immediately laid down on the sofa, being
unable to move for a few minutes. Her parents were worried but
attributed this incident to fatigue. As days passed, they noticed Samira
was prone to falling asleep at odd times. They were concerned to see
that whenever Samira started laughing, crying, or showed other emotions,
she lost her muscle tone and became severely sleepy.

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 267

To understand what the matter was, Samira went to see the doctor. She
confirmed to the doctor that every time she was overcome by an urge to
sleep, she felt her knees buckle. All her strength seemed to slip away.
The doctor also found that Samira did not have great sleeping habits.
She would go to bed well after midnight and then wake up early in the
morning, barely clocking in five hours of sleep. She did not feel
refreshed in the morning at all and took frequent naps during the day.
Her naps would typically last for about one hour and had vivid dreams.
Samira was finding the naps very refreshing and was sure she was
snoring. The neurologist referred Samira to the sleep clinic, where
facilities allow doctors to investigate what exactly happens to a person
during sleep. Additional tests such as hypnograms with a special nap
test to assess different stages of sleep were also conducted to
investigate Samira's sleep abnormalities. The tests indicated that she
was suffering from a particular type of sleep disorder---narcolepsy with
cataplexy. This disorder is characterized by daytime drowsiness with
sudden attacks of sleep (narcolepsy), accompanied by a sudden loss of
muscle tone (cataplexy), which can be triggered by a strong emotion.

24/11/21 1:37 PM

268 Chapter 9 The doctor said to Samira and her anxious parents, "This
condition is typically caused by low levels of a particular hormone in
the brain called orexin that is involved in sleep. Fortunately, we can
usually control narcolepsy with medication. In fact, we have a new one
that does an

Miguel's story illustrates several aspects of sleep that will be
explored in more depth throughout the following chapter. Sleep is a
complex behavior that involves many regions of the brain. The regulation
of sleep and waking cycles is an intricate balance between activity in
neural circuits, the actions of hormones, and environmental factors. As
you read this chapter, consider the different aspects of sleep
represented in Miguel's case, from an intense motivation to sleep, to
visual hallucinations, to muscle paralysis. In fact, Miguel's experience
prompts a very basic question: Why do we sleep? We will attempt to
answer this question in several ways. In the first two modules of this
chapter we will describe what is known about the phenomenon of sleep and
why we do it. In the third module we will describe the search for the
chemicals and the neural circuits that control sleep and wakefulness. In
the fourth module we examine sleep disorders, including insomnia,
narcolepsy, sleepwalking, and others. In the final module of the chapter
we will discuss the brain's biological clock---the mechanism that
controls daily rhythms of sleep and wakefulness.

What Is Sleep? Sleep is a behavior. That statement might seem unusual,
because we often think of behaviors as activities that involve
movements, such as walking or talking. Except for the rapid eye
movements that accompany a particular stage, sleep is not distinguished
by movement. What characterizes sleep is that the insistent urge of
sleepiness (a motivation) forces us to seek out a quiet, warm,
comfortable place; lie down; and remain there for several hours (a
behavior). Because we remember very little about what happens while we
sleep, it can be easy to think of sleep more as a change in
consciousness than as a behavior. The change in consciousness is
undeniable, but it should not prevent us from noticing the behavioral
changes.

excellent job. There is no reason why you can't continue with your
education." Samira was delighted to know about the availability of
treatment for narcolepsy. With successful treatment, she will be able to
pursue her education and fulfil her dream of becoming a physicist.

adjacent to an observation room, where the experimenter spends the night
(trying to stay awake). The experimenter prepares the sleeper for
electrophysiological measurements by attaching electrodes to the scalp
to monitor the brain's activity with an electroencephalogram (EEG), and
to the face to monitor muscle activity, recorded as the electromyogram
(EMG). Electrodes attached around the eyes monitor eye movements,
recorded as the electro-­oculogram (EOG). In addition, other electrodes
and transducing devices can be used to monitor autonomic measures such
as heart rate, respiration, and changes in the ability of the skin to
conduct electricity. (See Figure 9.1.) When a person is awake, an EEG
typically shows two basic patterns of activity: alpha activity and beta
activity. Alpha activity consists of regular, medium-frequency waves of
8--12 Hz (hertz, which measures cycles per second). The brain produces
this activity when a person is resting quietly, not particularly aroused
or excited and not engaged in strenuous mental activity (such as problem
solving). Although alpha waves sometimes occur when a person's eyes are
open, they are much more prevalent when

Figure 9.1 Participant in a Sleep Study Electrodes allow researchers to
measure electrophysiological activity from the brain and the muscles in
the face and around the eyes.

Stages of Sleep LO 9.1

Describe the progression, behaviors, and EEG characteristics of the
stages of sleep.

The best research on human sleep is conducted in a sleep laboratory. A
sleep laboratory, usually located at a university or medical center,
consists of one or several small bedrooms

Sleep and Biological Rhythms 269

the eyes are closed. The other type of waking EEG pattern, beta
activity, consists of irregular, mostly ­low-amplitude waves of 13--30
Hz. In an EEG, amplitude describes the height of a wave. Beta activity
shows desynchrony and reflects the fact that many different neural
circuits in the brain are actively processing information.
Desynchronized activity occurs when a person is alert and attentive to
events in the environment or is thinking actively. EEG electrodes record
from many neurons all at once, reporting on the sum of their electrical
activity. If the cells are active at about the same time, their
electrical messages are synchronized and appear as a large, clear wave
in the EEG data. If they are active at random, their electrical messages
are desynchronized and appear as small, chaotic waveforms without a
clear pattern. Imagine that the activity of the neurons in a particular
cortical region is represented by the ripples created by throwing stones
into a pond. If a large rock is thrown into the pond, it makes a set of
large synchronized waves moving across the pond. If many small pebbles
are tossed into the pond at random, they create many small
desynchronized ripples. Some of the small ripples crash into each other
and cancel out the progress of other ripples. In this situation, the
pond is full of many small, chaotic individual ripples moving in every
direction, similar to the summed electrical activity of neurons that are
active when beta activity is recorded. Waves of electrical activity can
sweep across cortical regions like ripples across the pond. (See Figure
9.2.) Researchers and physicians have carefully examined the EEG record
of sleepers and identified particular patterns of waveform activity that
correspond with different periods, or stages, of sleep. The first
physiological description of sleep stages was published in 1957, and by
1968

Figure 9.2 Synchronous and Desynchronous EEG Activity

    their electrical messages are desynchronized and appear as small,

Rechtschaffen and Kales had published a manual for a standardized sleep
stage scoring method known as the R & K method (Dement & Kleitman, 1957;
Rechtschaffen & Kales, 1968). In addition to wakefulness, the original
scoring guidelines included four stages of non-REM sleep (stages 1--4)
and one stage of REM sleep, composed of EEG waveforms of different
frequencies and amplitudes. Since the early 2000s, a revised scoring
system has been proposed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM
method). The new system identifies stages of wakefulness (stage W),
three stages of non-REM sleep (NREM 1, 2, and 3) and one REM sleep stage
(stage R) (Berry et al., 2012; Silber et al., 2007). (See Table 9.1.)
Let's look at a typical night's sleep of a female college student in a
sleep laboratory, using the new sleep stage scoring guidelines. (An
experimenter would obtain similar results from a male, with one
exception, which is noted later.) Although most sleep research is still
conducted in sleep laboratories, the wide availability of watches and
wearable devices that can record locomotor movement and heart rate has
opened the door to less invasive, at-home data collection of some of the
basic measures used to assess sleep (Winnebeck et al., 2018). In our
sleep lab example, the experimenter attaches the electrodes, turns the
lights off, and closes the door. Our volunteer becomes drowsy and soon
enters stage 1 sleep, marked by the presence of some theta activity
(3.5--7.5 Hz), which indicates that the firing of neurons in the
neocortex is becoming more synchronized. This stage is actually a
transition between sleep and wakefulness; if we watch our volunteer's
eyelids, we will see that from time to time they slowly open and close,
and that her eyes roll upward and downward. (Look again at Table 9.1.)
During this time, the sleeper may experience hypnic jerks, muscle
contractions followed by relaxation. Many people experience these along
with a falling sensation during the transition to sleep
(Calandra-Buonaura et al., 2014). About 10 minutes later she enters
stage 2 sleep. The EEG during this stage is generally irregular but
contains periods of theta activity, sleep spindles, and K complexes.
Sleep spindles are short bursts of waves of 12--14 Hz that occur between
two and five times a minute during stages 1--3 of sleep. They appear to
play a role in consolidation of memories, and increased numbers of sleep
spindles are correlated with increased scores on tests of intelligence
(Fogel & Smith, 2011). (The role of sleep in memory is discussed later
in this chapter.) K complexes are sudden, sharp waveforms, which, unlike
sleep spindles, are usually found only during stage 2 sleep. They
spontaneously occur at the rate of approximately one per minute but
often can be triggered by noises---especially unexpected noises. Cash
and colleagues (2009) recorded the activity of single neurons in the
human cerebral cortex during sleep and found that K complexes consisted
of isolated periods

of neural inhibition. (The recordings were made from the brains of
patients who were being evaluated for neurosurgery.) K complexes appear
before delta waves, which occur in the deepest levels of sleep. New
research has begun to examine the creation and function of spindles and
K complexes in the transition to deeper sleep stages (Ioannides et al.,
2017). The person is sleeping soundly now, but if awakened, she might
report that she has not been asleep. This phenomenon often is reported
by nurses who awaken loudly snoring hospital patients early in the night
and find that the patients insist that they were lying there awake all
the time. About 15 minutes later the volunteer enters slowwave sleep,
signaled by high-amplitude delta activity (less than 3.5 Hz) in stage 3
sleep. (Look again at Table 9.1.) About 90 minutes after the beginning
of sleep, there is an abrupt change in some of the physiological
measures recorded from our volunteer. The EEG suddenly becomes mostly
desynchronized, with occasional occurrences of theta waves, very similar
to the record obtained during stage 1 sleep. (Refer back to Table 9.1.)
We can also see that her eyes are rapidly moving back and forth beneath
her closed eyelids. We can see this activity in the EOG, recorded from
electrodes attached to the skin around her eyes, or we can observe the
eye movements directly---the cornea produces a bulge in the closed
eyelids that can be seen to move about. We also see that the EMG becomes
silent. There is a loss of muscle tone. Aside from occasional twitching,
a person actually becomes paralyzed during REM sleep. This

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 270

peculiar stage of sleep is quite distinct from the quiet sleep we saw
earlier. It is referred to as REM sleep (named for the rapid eye
movements that characterize it). By most criteria, stage 3 is the
deepest stage of sleep. Only loud noises will awaken a person, and when
awakened, the person acts groggy and confused. In contrast, during REM
sleep a person might not react to most noises, but they are easily
aroused by meaningful stimuli, such as the sound of their name. Also,
when awakened from REM sleep, a person appears alert and attentive. If
we wake our volunteer during REM sleep and ask her what was going on,
she will almost certainly report that she had been dreaming. The dreams
of REM sleep tend to have a narrative, storylike progression of events.
On the other hand, if we wake her during slow-wave sleep and ask, "Were
you dreaming?" she will most likely say, "No." However, if we question
her more carefully, she might report a thought, an image, or some
emotion. During the rest of the night our volunteer's sleep alternates
between periods of REM and non-REM sleep. Each cycle is approximately 90
minutes long, containing a 20- to 30-minute bout of REM sleep. An 8-hour
sleep will contain four or five periods of REM sleep. Figure 9.3 shows a
graph of a typical night's sleep. The vertical axis indicates the EEG
activity that is being recorded. REM sleep and stage 1 sleep are placed
on the same line because similar patterns of EEG activity occur at these
times. Note that most slowwave sleep occurs during the first half of
night. Subsequent

In fact, the brain is very active in sleep. Next, we explore this topic
with a focus on what is known about brain activity in REM and slowwave
sleep. BRAIN ACTIVITY IN REM AND DREAMING The rate of

bouts of non-REM sleep contain more and more stage 2 sleep, and bouts of
REM sleep (indicated by the horizontal bars) become longer. REM sleep
paralysis occurs because most of our spinal and cranial motor neurons
are strongly inhibited. (The ones that control respiration and eye
movements are not inhibited.) At the same time the brain is very active.
Cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption are accelerated. Following
the sleep cycle, during most periods of REM sleep a male's penis and a
female's clitoris will become at least partially erect, and a female's
vaginal secretions will increase (Hirshkowitz & Schmidt, 2005; Schmidt &
Schmidt, 2004). People can have dreams with or without sexual content
and can also experience orgasm during sleep. Important differences
between REM sleep and slowwave sleep are listed in Table 9.2.

cerebral blood flow in the human brain during REM sleep is high in the
extrastriate cortex (visual association cortex) but low in the striate
(primary) visual cortex and the prefrontal cortex (Braun et al., 1998;
Madsen et al., 1991). Reduced activity in the striate cortex reflects
the fact that the (closed) eyes are not receiving visual input during
sleep. High activity in the extrastriate cortex likely reflects visual
hallucinations that occur during dreams. As you will read in Chapter 13,
the prefrontal cortex is involved in making plans, keeping track of the
organization of events in time, and distinguishing illusion from r­
eality. As some researchers have noted, dreams are characterized by good
visual images but are poorly organized with respect to time. For
example, past, present, and future are often interchanged in dreams
(Hobson, 1988). And as Melges (1982) put it, "The dreamer often has no
feeling of striving for long-term goals but rather is carried along by
the flow of time by circumstances that crop up in an unpredictable way."
This quote could also describe the daily life of a person whose
prefrontal cortex has been ­damaged. (See Figure 9.4.) Some people
experience lucid dreaming, or an awareness that they are dreaming and
are not awake. Some researchers hypothesize that activating the normally
inactive prefrontal

lucid dreaming. In line with this explanation, volunteers who received a
dose of an acetylcholinesterase inhibiting drug reported increased lucid
dreaming. The researchers suggested that increased cholinergic
transmission enhanced cortical activation (LaBerge et al., 2018). Other
researchers have directly stimulated the cortex with transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(Stumbrys et al., 2013) or transcranial alternating current stimulation
(tACS) over the frontal cortex (Voss et al., 2014) and reported
increases in lucid dreaming as well. Although preliminary, these lines
of research hint at the role of at least one brain region involved in
REM lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming may also occur in non-REM sleep. Eye
movements made during REM sleep may be related to the visual imagery
that occurs while we dream. Eye movements of a person while dreaming
during REM sleep are similar to what would be expected if the person was
actually watching an event while awake (Andrillion et al., 2015;
Roffwarg et al., 1962). In addition, evidence indicates that the
particular brain mechanisms active during

a dream are those that would become active if the events in the dream
were actually occurring. For example, cortical and subcortical motor
mechanisms become active during a dream that contains movement (or would
likely contain movement), as if the person were actually moving
(McCarley & Hobson, 1979; De Carli et al., 2015). In addition, if a
dream involves talking and listening, regions of the dreamer's brain
that are involved in speaking and listening become especially active
(Hong et al., 1996). Although narrative, storylike dreaming and the
associated brain activity most often occur during REM sleep, changes in
brain activity can also accompany dreamlike imagery experienced during
slow-wave sleep. Regional cerebral blood flow during slow-wave sleep is
generally decreased throughout the brain compared to waking. However,
some researchers have found localized increases in the visual and
auditory cortexes, which are hypothesized to be the neural basis for the
dreamlike imagery experienced during slow-wave sleep. Blood flow to the
thalamus and cerebellum is decreased in slow-wave sleep (Hofle et al.,
1997, Tüshaus et al., 2017).

BRAIN ACTIVITY IN SLOW-WAVE SLEEP

Module Review: What Is Sleep? Stages of Sleep LO 9.1 Describe the
progression, behaviors, and EEG characteristics of the stages of sleep.
Sleep stages generally progress through stages 1--3, followed by REM,
and are defined by changes in physiology, behavior, and EEG activity. In
the EEG, waking alertness consists of desynchronized beta activity
(13--30 Hz) while relaxation and drowsiness consist of alpha activity
(8--12 Hz). Muscle tone decreases throughout the stages, resulting in
deepest relaxation and paralysis in REM sleep. Stage 1 sleep consists of
alternating periods of alpha activity (8--12 Hz), irregular fast
activity, and theta activity (3.5--7.5 Hz), along with decreasing muscle
tone. The EEG of stage 2 sleep contains sleep spindles (short periods of
12--14 Hz activity) and occasional K complexes. Stage 3 sleep primarily
consists of delta activity (\< 3.5 Hz). REM sleep consists of theta and
beta activity.

Brain Activity During Sleep LO 9.2 Explain the patterns of brain
activity present during REM and slow-wave sleep.

the prefrontal cortex. This activity reflects a lack of visual input in
REM (little or no activation in the striate cortex), but the presence of
active visual hallucinations during dreaming (activation in the
extrastriate cortex). Lack of prefrontal cortex activity likely reflects
the lack of organization and planning that occur in dreams. Regional
cerebral blood flow during slow-wave sleep is generally decreased
throughout the brain compared to waking. However, localized increases in
the visual and auditory cortexes are hypothesized to be the neural basis
for the dreamlike imagery experienced during slow-wave sleep. Blood flow
to the thalamus and cerebellum is decreased in slow-wave sleep.

Why Do We Sleep? From past experience, you probably know how insistent
the urge to sleep can be and how uncomfortable it can feel when you have
to resist it and stay awake. Other than the effects of severe pain and
the need to breathe, sleepiness is probably the most insistent drive
that we can experience. People can commit suicide by refusing to eat or
drink, but even the most determined person cannot indefinitely defy the
urge to sleep. Sleep will come, sooner or later, no matter how hard a
person tries to stay awake.

Functions of Sleep LO 9.3

Suggest some possible general functions of sleep.

Sleep is a universal phenomenon among animals. Sleep has been identified
in every animal studied, from mammals to invertebrates. Some researchers
have speculated that even as the very first animals evolved, they slept
(Anafi et al., 2018). However, only warm-blooded vertebrates (mammals
and birds) exhibit clear REM sleep, with muscular paralysis, EEG signs
of desynchrony, and rapid eye movements. Birds such as flamingos, which
sleep while perched on one leg, do not lose tone in the muscles they use
to remain standing. Also, animals such as moles, which move their eyes
very little while awake, show few signs of eye movement while asleep.
The functions of REM sleep will be discussed separately, in a later
section. Sleep appears to be essential to long-term survival. Evidence
for this statement comes from the fact that sleep is found in some
species of mammals that would seem to be better off without it. For
example, some species of marine mammals and birds have developed an
extraordinary pattern of sleep: The cerebral hemispheres take turns
sleeping, presumably because that strategy always permits at least one
hemisphere to be alert and keep the animal from drowning or being
attacked by a predator (Mascetti, 2016). In addition, the eye
contralateral to the active hemisphere remains open. Some birds (for
example, mallard ducks) can also sleep with only one hemisphere, keeping
the opposite eye open to watch for predators (Rattenborg et al., 1999).
The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the porpoise (Phocoena
phocoena) both sleep with one hemisphere at a time (Mukhametov, 1984).
Figure 9.5 shows the EEG recordings from the two hemispheres in a
dolphin. Notice that slow-wave sleep occurs independently in the left
and right hemispheres. EFFECTS OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION As a means to study

extreme sleep deprivation experimentally, Rechtschaffen and his
colleagues (Rechtschaffen and Bergmann, 1995, 2002; Rechtschaffen et
al., 1983, 1989) devised a procedure to keep rats from sleeping without
forcing them to exercise continuously. (A group of control animals
exercised just as much as the experimental participants but were able

to engage in normal amounts of sleep.) As with humans, sleep deprivation
had serious effects in the rats. The control animals remained in perfect
health. However, the experimental animals looked sick and stopped
grooming their fur. They became weak and uncoordinated and lost their
ability to regulate their body temperature. Although they began eating
much more food than normal, their metabolic rates became so high that
they continued to lose weight. Eventually, the rats died. The cause of
death is still not understood. The rats' brains appeared to be normal,
and there were no obvious signs of inflammation or damage to other
internal organs. The animals' levels of stress hormones were not
unusually high, so the deaths could not be attributed to simple stress.
If they were given a high-calorie diet to compensate for their increased
metabolic rate, the rats lived longer, but eventually they succumbed
(Everson & Wehr, 1993). As we will see later in this chapter, damage to
parts of the basal forebrain causes insomnia, and if the animals do not
recover from their sleeplessness, they die. What happens when you
experience more mild forms of sleep deprivation and miss several hours,
or a whole night, of sleep? On one hand, missing one night of sleep is
not fatal and so we know that while sleep is important, we are able to
survive and function (reasonably well) in the short term despite
occasional lost sleep. On the other hand, if we look more closely,
several cognitive functions are disrupted by even one night of sleep
deprivation. Extended sleep loss amplifies these effects, especially on
tasks that require attention or vigilance (Lim & Dinges, 2010). Regular
or extensive sleep deprivation is also associated with adverse health
outcomes, including weight gain and obesity, diabetes, hypertension,
heart disease and stroke, depression, impaired immune function,
increased pain, and greater risk of accidents. Based on the results of
sleep deprivation studies, researchers have asked whether the primary
function of sleep is to allow the brain or the body to maintain healthy
functioning.

24/11/21 1:37 PM

274 Chapter 9 Sleep deprivation studies with human participants have not
obtained persuasive evidence that sleep is needed to keep the body
functioning normally. Horne (1978) reviewed over 50 experiments in which
people had been modestly deprived of sleep. He reported that most of
them found that sleep deprivation did not interfere with people's
ability to perform physical exercise. In addition, the studies found no
evidence of a physiological stress response to sleep deprivation. It
seems that the primary role of sleep is not rest and recuperation of the
body. However, people's cognitive abilities were affected; some people
reported perceptual distortions or even hallucinations and had trouble
concentrating on mental tasks. Even with only one night of sleep
deprivation, people's ability to recognize emotional facial expressions
is impaired (van der Helm et al., 2010). Perhaps sleep provides the
opportunity for the brain to rest. At the beginning of the chapter, we
first posed the question "Why do we sleep?" Researchers have attempted
to answer this question in a variety of ways. Although the issue is not
yet settled, most researchers believe that the primary function of
slow-wave sleep is to permit the brain to rest. In addition, slow-wave
sleep and REM sleep promote different types of learning, and REM sleep
appears to promote brain development.

Functions of Slow-Wave Sleep LO 9.4

Suggest some possible functions of slow-wave sleep.

What happens to sleep-deprived individuals after they are permitted to
sleep again? Most of them sleep longer the next night or two, but they
never regain all of the sleep they lost. In one remarkable case a
17-year-old boy stayed awake for 264 hours so that he could obtain a
place in the Guinness Book of World Records (Gulevich et al., 1966).
After his ordeal the boy slept for a little less than 15 hours and awoke
feeling fine. He slept slightly more than 10 hours the second night and
just under 9 hours the third. Almost 67 hours of missing sleep were
never made up. However, percentages of recovery were not equal for all
stages of sleep. Only 7 percent of stages 1 and 2 were made up, but 68
percent of slow-wave sleep and 53 percent of REM sleep were made up.
Other studies have found similar results, suggesting that slow-wave
sleep and REM sleep are prioritized over the other stages (Kales et al.,
1970). What do we know about the possible functions of slow-wave sleep?
What happens in slow-wave sleep that is so important? Although the human
brain contains only 2 percent of the total body weight, it expends 20
percent of the body's energy during quiet wakefulness. Both cerebral
metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow decline during slowwave sleep,
falling to about 75 percent of the waking level (Buchsbaum et al., 1989;
Maquet, 1995; Sakai et al., 1979).

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 274

In particular, the regions that have the highest levels of activity
during waking show the highest levels of delta waves---and the lowest
levels of metabolic activity---during slow-wave sleep. The presence of
slow-wave activity in a particular region of the brain appears to
indicate that that region is resting. As we know from behavioral
observation, people are unreactive to all but intense stimuli during
slowwave sleep and, if awakened, act groggy and confused, as if their
cerebral cortex has been shut down and has not yet resumed its
functioning. These observations suggest that during slow-wave sleep the
brain is indeed resting. Researchers also look to examples of
pathological sleep deprivation to learn more about the functions of
slow-wave sleep. An inherited neurological disorder called fatal
familial insomnia results in damage to portions of the thalamus
(Gallassi et al., 1996; Montagna et al., 2003; Sforza et al., 1995). The
symptoms of this disease, which is related to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
and bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow disease"; see Chapter
16), include deficits in attention and memory, followed by a dreamlike,
confused state; loss of control of the autonomic nervous system and the
endocrine system; increased body temperature; and insomnia. The first
signs of sleep disturbances are reductions in sleep spindles and K
complexes. As the disease progresses, slow-wave sleep completely
disappears, and only brief episodes of REM sleep (without the
accompanying paralysis) remain. As the name indicates, the disease is
fatal. Whether the insomnia, caused by the brain damage, contributes to
the other symptoms and to the patient's death is not known. Schenkein
and Montagna (2006a, 2006b) describe the case of a man diagnosed with a
form of fatal familial insomnia that usually causes death within 12
months. Because several relatives had died of this disorder, the man
knew what to expect, and he enlisted the aid of several physicians to
administer drugs and treatments designed to help him sleep. For several
months the treatments did help him to sleep, and the man survived about
a year longer than would have been expected, with a higher quality of
life during the course of his illness. However, it is unknown whether
his increased survival time was a direct result of the increased sleep.
The available evidence suggests that the brain needs to rest
periodically to recover from adverse side effects of its waking
activity. But what is the nature of these adverse effects? Siegel (2005)
suggests that among the waste products produced by the high metabolic
rate associated with waking activity of the brain are free radicals,
chemicals that contain at least one unpaired electron. Free radicals are
highly reactive oxidizing agents that can bind with electrons from other
molecules and damage the cells in which they are found through a process
known as oxidative stress. Prolonged sleep deprivation increased free
radicals in the brains of rats and resulted in oxidative stress

24/11/21 1:37 PM

Sleep and Biological Rhythms 275

(Ramanathan et al., 2002). During slow-wave sleep the reduced rate of
metabolism permits restorative mechanisms in the cells to destroy the
free radicals and prevent their damaging effects. Additional research
suggests that sleep enhances the removal of other neurotoxins from the
brain through the glymphatic system---­ connections between interstitial
fluid surrounding cells and the ­cerebrospinal fluid (Xie et al., 2013).
EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON SLOW-WAVE SLEEP Sleep deprivation
studies with humans suggest

that the brain may need slow-wave sleep to recover from the day's
physical activities. Another way to determine whether sleep is needed
for restoration of physiological functioning is to look at the effects
of daytime activity on nighttime sleep. If the function of sleep is to
repair the effects on the body of physical activity during waking hours,
then we should expect that sleep and exercise are related. We should
sleep more after a day of vigorous exercise than after a day spent
quietly at a desk or watching TV. The relationship between sleep and
exercise is probably subtle. Some early studies reported no changes in
slow-wave or REM sleep of healthy participants who spent 6 weeks resting
in bed (Ryback & Lewis, 1971) and little difference in the sleep of
individuals with spinal injuries that produced physical paralysis,
compared to control participants (Adey et al., 1968). On the other hand,
epidemiological studies suggest a positive relationship between physical
exercise and sleep quality and quantity (Youngstedt & Kline, 2006). A
meta-analysis of experimental studies reported that exercise
interventions had a modest effect on improving sleep quantity,
increasing time in stage 2 sleep, and reducing time in REM sleep
(Youngstedt et al., 1997). In contrast, a study of college students
comparing sleep on their most and least physically active days over a
3.5-month period reported a minimal effect of exercise on sleep. There
was no significant correlation between physical exercise and sleep in
this sample, and exercising more than 2 additional hours per day only
improved sleep efficiency about 1 percent (time asleep divided by time
in bed; Youngstedt et al., 2003). Although sleep provides the body with
rest, it seems unlikely that this is the primary overall function of
sleep, including slow-wave sleep. EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE ACTIVITY ON
SLOW-WAVE SLEEP If the primary function of slow-wave sleep is to

permit the brain to rest and recover from its daily cognitive activity,
then we might expect that a person would spend more time in slow-wave
sleep after a day of intense cerebral activity. Tasks that demand
alertness and mental activity do increase glucose metabolism in the
brain (Roland, 1984) and increase slow-wave sleep (Pugin et al., 2015).
The most significant increases in glucose metabolism are seen in the
frontal lobes, where slow-wave activity is most intense during non-REM
sleep. In an experiment that

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 275

supports this interpretation, Huber and colleagues (2004) had people
perform a motor learning task just before going to sleep. The task
required participants to make hand movements whose directions were
indicated by a visual display. During sleep the participants showed
increased slow-wave activity in the region of the neocortex that became
active while they were performing the task. Presumably, the increased
activity of these cortical neurons called for more rest during the
following night's sleep. A follow-up study by Huber and colleagues
(2006) found that immobilizing one arm for 12 hours produced the
opposite result: During sleep the people showed less slow-wave activity
in the regions of the neocortex that received somatosensory information
from that arm and controlled its movements. In an ingenious study, Horne
and Minard (1985) found a way to increase mental activity without
affecting physical activity and without causing stress. The
investigators told participants to show up for an experiment in which
they were supposed to take some tests designed to measure reading
skills. When the participants arrived, however, they were told that the
plans had been changed. They were invited for a day out, at the expense
of the experimenters. (Not surprisingly, the participants willingly
accepted.) They spent the day visiting an art exhibition, a shopping
center, a museum, an amusement park, a zoo, and an interesting mansion.
After a scenic drive through the countryside, they watched a movie in a
local theater. They were driven from place to place and did not become
overheated or tired by physical exercise. After the movie, they returned
to the sleep laboratory. They said they were tired, and they readily
fell asleep. Their sleep duration was normal, and they awoke feeling
refreshed. However, their slow-wave sleep was increased. After all that
mental exercise, the brain appears to have needed more slowwave sleep.

Functions of REM Sleep LO 9.5

Identify some possible functions of REM sleep.

REM sleep is a time of intense physiological activity. The eyes dart
about rapidly, the heart rate shows sudden accelerations and
decelerations, breathing becomes irregular, and the brain becomes more
active. It would be unreasonable to expect that REM sleep has the same
functions as slow-wave sleep. An early report on the effects of REM
sleep deprivation (Dement, 1960) observed that as the deprivation
progressed, participants had to be awakened from REM sleep more
frequently; the "pressure" to enter REM sleep built up. Furthermore,
after several days of REM sleep deprivation, participants would show a
rebound phenomenon when permitted to sleep normally; they spent a much
greater than normal percentage of the recovery night in REM sleep. This
rebound suggests that there is a need for a certain amount of REM
sleep---that

Sleep and Learning LO 9.6

Compare the roles of slow-wave and REM sleep in learning.

Research with both humans and laboratory animals indicates that sleep
does more than allow the brain to rest: It also aids in consolidating
long-term memories (Marshall & Born, 2007). Slow-wave sleep and REM
sleep play different roles in memory consolidation. As we will see in
Chapter 13, there are two major categories of long-term memory:
declarative memory (also called explicit memory) and nondeclarative
memory (also called implicit memory). Declarative memories include those
that people can talk about, such as memories of past episodes in their
lives. They also include memories of the relationships between stimuli
or events, such as the spatial relationships between landmarks that
permit us to navigate around our environment. Nondeclarative memories
include those gained through experience and practice that do not
necessarily involve an attempt to "memorize" information, such as
learning to drive a car, throwing and catching a ball, or recognizing a
person's face. Research has found that slow-wave sleep and REM sleep
play different roles in the consolidation of declarative and
nondeclarative memories. Let's explore evidence from two studies that
looked at the effects of a nap on memory consolidation. Mednick and
colleagues (2003) had participants learn a nondeclarative visual
discrimination task at 9:00 a.m. The participants' ability to perform
the task was tested 10 hours later, at 7:00 p.m. Some, but not all, of
the participants took a 90-minute nap during the day between training

Discrimination improvement

REM sleep is controlled by a regulatory mechanism. If selective
deprivation causes a deficiency in REM sleep, the deficiency is made up
later, when uninterrupted sleep is permitted. Researchers have long been
struck by the fact that the highest proportion of REM sleep is seen
during the most active phases of brain development in infancy and
childhood. Perhaps, then, REM sleep plays a role in this process
(Siegel, 2005). Species in which young are born with immature brains,
such as ferrets or humans, spend much more time in REM sleep than
species with young born with well-developed brains, such as guinea pigs
or cattle (Jouvet-Mounier et al., 1970; Roffwarg et al., 1966). But if
the function of REM sleep is to promote brain development, why do adults
have REM sleep? One possibility is that REM sleep facilitates the
massive changes in the brain that occur during development but also some
of the more modest changes responsible for learning that occur
throughout the lifespan. As we will see in the next submodule, evidence
does suggest that REM sleep facilitates learning---but so does slow-wave
sleep.

and testing. The investigators recorded the EEGs of the sleeping
participants to determine which of them engaged in REM sleep and which
of them did not. (All of them engaged in slow-wave sleep, because this
stage of sleep always comes first in healthy people.) The investigators
found that the performance of participants who did not take a nap was
worse when they were tested at 7:00 p.m. than it had been at the end of
training. The participants who engaged only in slow-wave sleep did about
the same during testing as they had done at the end of training.
However, the participants who engaged in REM sleep performed
significantly better. REM sleep strongly facilitated the consolidation
of a nondeclarative memory. (See Figure 9.6.) In the second study,
Tucker and colleagues (2006) trained participants on two tasks: a
declarative task (learning a list of paired words) and a nondeclarative
task (learning to trace a pencil-and-paper design while looking at the
paper in a mirror). Afterward, some of the participants were permitted
to take a nap lasting for about 1 hour. Their EEGs were recorded, and
they were awakened before they could engage in REM sleep. The
participants' performance on the two tasks was then tested 6 hours after
the original training. The investigators found that, compared with
participants who stayed awake, a nap consisting of just slow-wave sleep
increased the participants' performance on the declarative task but had
no effect on performance of the nondeclarative task. (See Figure 9.7.)
These two experiments (and many others we have not described) indicate
that REM sleep facilitates consolidation of nondeclarative memories and
that slow-wave sleep facilitates consolidation of declarative memories.

Peigneux and colleagues (2004) had participants learn their way around a
computerized virtual-reality town. This task is very similar to what
people do when they learn their way around a real town. They must learn
the r­ elative locations of landmarks and streets that connect them so
that they can find particular locations when the experimenter "placed"
them at various starting points. As we will see in Chapter 13, the
hippocampus plays an essential role in learning of this kind. Peigneux
and his colleagues used functional brain imaging to measure regional
brain activity and found that the same regions of the hippocampus were
activated during route learning and during slowwave sleep the following
night. These patterns were not seen during REM sleep. Using a similar
virtual reality navigation task, Wamsley and colleagues (2010) awakened

from slow-wave sleep during an afternoon nap that followed training and
asked them to report everything that they were thinking about. They
found that participants whose thoughts were related to the task
performed much better during a subsequent session on the navigation task
than those who did not report such thoughts. Although people who are
awakened during slow-wave sleep seldom report narrative dreams, the
sleeping brain rehearses information that was acquired during the
previous period of wakefulness. (See Figure 9.8.) Many studies with
laboratory animals have directly recorded the activity of individual
neurons in the animals' brains. These studies, too, indicate that the
brain appears to rehearse newly learned information during slow-wave
sleep (O'Neill et al., 2010). Chapter 13 reviews this evidence and
describes research on the relevant brain mechanisms.

slow-wave sleep. One important function of slow-wave sleep seems to be
to lower the brain's metabolism and permit it to rest. In support of
this hypothesis, research has shown that slow-wave sleep reduces the
brain's metabolic rate and that increased mental activity (the surprise,
fun-day-out experiment) can cause an increase in slow-wave sleep the
next night.

Functions of REM Sleep LO 9.5 Identify some possible functions of REM
sleep. The functions of REM sleep are less understood than those of
slow-wave sleep. REM sleep may promote brain development and facilitate
changes responsible for learning that occur throughout the lifespan.

Sleep and Learning LO 9.6 Compare the roles of slow-wave and REM sleep
in learning. Both REM sleep and slow-wave sleep promote learning: REM
sleep facilitates nondeclarative learning, and slowwave sleep
facilitates declarative learning.

Physiological Mechanisms of Sleep and Waking So far, we have discussed
the nature of sleep and its ­functions. Now it is time to examine what
researchers have discovered about the physiological mechanisms that are
responsible for the behavior of sleep and for its ­counterpart, alert
wakefulness.

Neural Control of Sleep LO 9.7

Explain how adenosine contributes to regulating sleep.

As we have seen, sleep is regulated. For example, if an organism is
deprived of slow-wave sleep or REM sleep, it will make up at least part
of the missed sleep when permitted to do so. In addition, the amount of
slow-wave sleep that a person obtains during a daytime nap is deducted
from the amount of slow-wave sleep they obtain the next night (Karacan
et al., 1970). These facts suggest that some physiological mechanism
monitors the amount of sleep that an organism needs and keeps track of
the sleep debt we incur during hours of wakefulness. What might this
mechanism be? One possible explanation is that the body produces a
sleep-promoting substance that accumulates during wakefulness and is
destroyed during sleep. The longer someone is awake, the longer they
have to sleep to deactivate this substance. And because REM sleep
deprivation produces an independent REM sleep debt, there might have to
be two substances, one for each stage of sleep. Where might such
substances be produced? If such a substance exists, it does not appear
to be found in the general circulation of the body. As we saw earlier,
the cerebral hemispheres of the bottlenose dolphin sleep at different
times (Mascetti, 2016; Mukhametov, 1984). If sleep

Thought Question In this module, you read about the roles of slow-wave
sleep and REM sleep in performance on declarative and nondeclarative
memory tasks. List some tasks from your own life that require you to use
your declarative and nondeclarative memory. Imagine that you have just
taught someone else how to perform these tasks. Using information from
this module, recommend how your "student" could use a nap to their
advantage in performing the task you have taught them. How long should
they sleep? When should they wake up? What kind of sleep stages should
they try to achieve to excel on the task?

were controlled by chemicals in the blood, the hemispheres should sleep
at the same time. This observation suggests that if sleep is controlled
by chemicals, these chemicals are produced within the brain and act
there. In support of this suggestion, Oleksenko and colleagues (1992)
obtained evidence that indicates that each hemisphere of the brain
incurs its own sleep debt. The researchers deprived a bottlenose dolphin
of sleep in only one hemisphere. When they allowed the animal to sleep
normally, they saw a rebound of slow-wave sleep only in the deprived
hemisphere. Benington and colleagues (1995) suggested that ­adenosine, a
nucleoside neuromodulator, might play a primary role in the control of
sleep, and subsequent ­studies have supported this suggestion. Astrocytes
maintain a small stock of nutrients in the form of glycogen, an
insoluble carbohydrate that is also stocked by the liver and the
muscles. In times of increased brain activity this glycogen is converted
into fuel for neurons. Prolonged wakefulness causes a decrease in the
level of glycogen in the brain as the brain uses the glycogen as fuel
(Kong et al., 2002). A fall in the level of glycogen causes an increase
in the level of extracellular adenosine, which has an inhibitory effect
on neural activity. This accumulation of adenosine serves as a
sleep-promoting substance. During slow-wave sleep, neurons in the brain
rest, and the astrocytes renew their stock of glycogen (Basheer et al.,
2004; Wigren et al., 2007). If wakefulness is prolonged, even more
adenosine accumulates, which inhibits neural activity and produces the
cognitive and emotional effects that are seen during sleep deprivation.
(As we saw in Chapter 4, caffeine blocks adenosine receptors to reduce
sleepiness.) In further support of this explanation for the role of
adenosine, Halassa and colleagues (2009) prepared a targeted mutation in
the brains of mice that interfered with the release of adenosine by
astrocytes. As a result, the animals spent less time than normal in
slow-wave sleep. (See Figure 9.9.)

Figure 9.9 Adenosine Inhibits Neural Function Astrocytes are responsible
for releasing adenosine into the extracellular space, which binds to
adenosine receptors on neurons. Adenosine accumulates during wakefulness
and is reduced during slow-wave sleep. Caffeine blocks the adenosine
receptors, preventing the inhibitory effect on neural activity and
reducing the effects of sleep deprivation. Neuron

As you probably know, people differ in their sleep need. Evidence
suggests that genetic factors affect the typical duration of a person's
slow-wave sleep. Rétey and colleagues (2005) discovered one of these
factors---variability in the gene that encodes for an enzyme, adenosine
deaminase, which is involved in the breakdown of adenosine. The
investigators found that people with the G/A allele for this gene, which
encodes for a form of the enzyme that breaks down adenosine more slowly,
spent approximately 30 minutes more time in slow-wave sleep than did
people with the more common G/G allele. Levels of adenosine in people
with the G/A allele decreased more slowly during slow-wave sleep, and as
a consequence the slow-wave sleep of people with G/A alleles was
prolonged. The role of adenosine as a sleep-promoting factor is
discussed in more detail later in this chapter, in a section devoted to
the regulation of sleep/wake transitions.

Neural Control of Arousal LO 9.8

Describe how neurochemical systems help regulate arousal.

As you have read, sleep consists of several different stages with very
different characteristics. The waking state, too, is nonuniform.
Sometimes we are alert and attentive, and sometimes we fail to notice
much about what is happening around us. Sleepiness has an effect on
wakefulness. If we are fighting to stay awake, the struggle might impair
our ability to concentrate on other things. But everyday observations
suggest that even when we are not sleepy, our alertness can vary. For
example, when we observe something very interesting (or frightening or
simply surprising), we become more alert and aware of our surroundings.
Circuits of neurons that secrete at least five different
neurotransmitters play a role in some aspect of an animal's level of
alertness and wakefulness---what is commonly

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 279

called arousal: acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine, and
orexin. ACETYLCHOLINE One of the most important neurotransmitters
involved in arousal---especially of the cerebral cortex---is
acetylcholine (ACh). Two groups of acetylcholinergic neurons, one in the
pons and one located in the basal forebrain, produce activation and
cortical desynchrony when they are stimulated (Jones, 1990; Steriade,
1996). A third group of acetylcholinergic neurons, located in the medial
septum, controls the activity of the hippocampus. (See Figure 9.10.)
Researchers have long known that acetylcholinergic agonists increase EEG
signs of cortical arousal and that acetylcholinergic antagonists
decrease them (Vanderwolf, 1992). Marrosu and colleagues (1995) used
microdialysis probes to measure the release of acetylcholine in the
hippocampus and neocortex, two regions whose activity is closely related
to an animal's alertness and behavioral arousal. They found that the
levels of ACh in these regions were high during both waking and REM
sleep---periods during which the EEG displayed desynchronized
activity---but low during slow-wave sleep. (See Figure 9.11.) Rasmusson
and colleagues (1994) electrically stimulated a region of the dorsal
pons and found that the stimulation activated the cerebral cortex and
increased the release of ACh there by 350 percent (as measured by
microdialysis probes). A group of acetylcholinergic neurons located in
the basal forebrain forms an essential part of the pathway that is
responsible for this effect. If these neurons were deactivated by
infusing a local anesthetic or drugs that blocked synaptic transmission,
the activating effects of the pontine stimulation were abolished. In
contrast, Cape and Jones (2000) found that drugs that activated these
neurons caused wakefulness. Lee and colleagues (2004) found that most
neurons in the basal forebrain showed a high rate of firing during both
waking and REM sleep and a low rate of firing during slow-wave sleep.
(See the pattern of acetylcholine release during waking and REM in the
cortex and hippocampus in Figure 9.11.) NOREPINEPHRINE Investigators
have long known that catecholamine agonists such as amphetamine produce
arousal and sleeplessness. These effects appear to be mediated primarily
by the noradrenergic system of the ­locus coeruleus (LC), located in the
dorsal pons. Neuron cell bodies in the locus coeruleus have axons that
branch widely, releasing norepinephrine (from axonal varicosities)
throughout the neocortex, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebellar cortex,
pons, and medulla. Norepinephrine-­ releasing terminals potentially
affect widespread and ­important regions of the brain. (See Figure 9.12.)
Aston-Jones and Bloom (1981) recorded the activity of noradrenergic
neurons of the LC across the sleep/waking cycle in rats. They found that
this activity was closely

related to behavioral arousal. The firing rate of these neurons was high
during wakefulness, low during slow-wave sleep, and almost zero during
REM sleep. Within a few seconds of awakening, the rate of firing
increased dramatically. (See Figure 9.13.) Carter and colleagues (2010)
used a viral vector to insert genes for two photosensitive proteins,
ChR2 and NpHR, into noradrenergic cells of the locus coeruleus. As we
saw in the description of optogenetics in Chapter 5, exposure of ChR2 to
blue light activates the neurons, and exposure of NpHR to yellow light
inhibits them. Previous experiments, which used electrical or chemical
stimulation, activated many neurons in and around the locus coeruleus
and produced effects that were not specific to noradrenergic neurons.
Carter and his colleagues found that stimulating the noradrenergic
neurons caused immediate waking, and inhibiting them decreased
wakefulness and increased slow-wave sleep. Most investigators believe
that activity of noradrenergic LC neurons increases an animal's
vigilance---its ability to pay attention to stimuli in the environment.
For example, Aston-Jones and colleagues (1994) recorded the electrical
activity of noradrenergic LC neurons in monkeys performing a task that
required them to watch for a particular stimulus to appear on a video
display. The investigators observed that the monkeys performed best when
the rate of firing of the LC neurons was high. After the

monkeys worked for a long time at the task, the neurons' rate of firing
decreased, and so did the monkeys' performance. These results support
the conclusion that activating LC neurons (and their release of
norepinephrine) increases vigilance. SEROTONIN A third neurotransmitter,
serotonin (5-HT),

also appears to play a role in activating behavior. Almost all of the
brain's serotonergic neurons are found in the ­raphe nuclei, which are
located in the medullary and pontine regions of the reticular formation.
The axons of these neurons

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 281

project to many parts of the brain, including the thalamus,
hypothalamus, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and neocortex. Stimulation of
the raphe nuclei causes locomotion and cortical arousal (as measured by
the EEG), whereas PCPA, a drug that prevents the synthesis of serotonin,
reduces cortical arousal (Peck & Vanderwolf, 1991). (See Figure 9.14.)
Jacobs and Fornal (1999) suggested that one specific contribution of
serotonergic neurons to activation is facilitation of continuous,
automatic movements, such as pacing, chewing, and grooming. On the other
hand, when animals engage in orienting responses to novel stimuli, the
activity of serotonergic neurons decreases. Perhaps serotonergic neurons
are involved in facilitating ongoing activities and suppressing the
processing of sensory information, preventing reactions that might
disrupt the ongoing activities. Other researchers have suggested
additional learning functions of these neurons based on their responses
to rewards and punishments (Cohen et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Liu et
al., 2014). Figure 9.15 shows the activity of serotonergic neurons,
recorded by Trulson and Jacobs (1979). As you can see, these neurons,
like the noradrenergic neurons studied by Aston-Jones and Bloom (1981),
were most active during waking. Their firing rate declined during
slow-wave sleep and became virtually zero during REM sleep. However,
once the period of REM sleep ended, the neurons temporarily became very
active again. HISTAMINE The fourth neurotransmitter implicated in the
control of wakefulness and arousal is histamine, a compound synthesized
from histidine, an amino acid.

You may already be aware that antihistamines, which are used to treat
allergies, can cause drowsiness. They do so by blocking histamine H2
receptors in the brain. More modern antihistamines cannot cross the
blood--brain barrier, so they do not cause drowsiness. The cell bodies
of histaminergic neurons are found in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN)
of the hypothalamus, located at the base of the brain just rostral to
the mammillary bodies. The axons of these neurons project primarily to
the cerebral cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, basal forebrain, and other
regions of the hypothalamus. The projections to the cerebral cortex
directly increase cortical activation and arousal, and projections

to acetylcholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain and dorsal pons do
so indirectly, by increasing the release of acetylcholine in the
cerebral cortex (Brown et al., 2001; Khateb et al., 1995). The activity
of histaminergic neurons is high during waking but low during slow-wave
sleep and REM sleep (Steininger et al., 1996). Drugs that prevent the
synthesis of histamine or block histamine H1 receptors decrease waking
and increase sleep (Lin et al., 1998). Also, infusing histamine into the
basal forebrain region of rats increases waking and decreases non-REM
sleep (Ramesh et al., 2004). Although histamine clearly plays an
important role in wakefulness and arousal, evidence suggests that
control of wakefulness is shared with the other neurotransmitters
discussed in this module. For example, Parmentier and colleagues (2002)
found that mice with a targeted mutation that blocked the synthesis of
histamine showed normal amounts of spontaneous wakefulness. However, the
animals showed less arousal in response to environmental stimuli. For
example, normal mice placed in a novel environment remain awake for 2--3
hours, but the histamine-deprived mice fell asleep within a few minutes.
Similarly, Takahashi and colleagues (2006) found that histaminergic
neurons did not respond to environmental stimuli unless the stimuli
elicited a state of overt attention. Gerashchenko and colleagues (2004)
suggested that the brain's arousal systems promote wakefulness at
different times or in different situations and that no single one of
these systems plays a critical role under all conditions. OREXIN Orexin
is a peptide neurotransmitter involved in the neural control of arousal.
This neurotransmitter has an interesting history. It is called
hypocretin by some researchers and orexin by others. The name
"hypocretin"

comes from the fact that the lateral hypothalamus contains the cell
bodies of all of the neurons that secrete this peptide. The name
"orexin" comes from the role this peptide plays in the control of eating
and metabolism, discussed in more detail in Chapter 12. Orexin also
plays a crucial role in the physiological and behavioral effects of some
drugs, discussed in Chapter 19. Two laboratories independently
discovered the peptide, and each gave it a different name. The cause of
narcolepsy is degeneration of orexinergic neurons in humans and a
hereditary absence of one type of orexin receptors in dogs. The cell
bodies of neurons that secrete orexin are located in the lateral
hypothalamus. Although there are only about 7,000 orexinergic neurons in
the human brain, the axons of these neurons project to almost every part
of the brain, including the cerebral cortex and all of the regions
involved in arousal and wakefulness, including the locus coeruleus,
raphe nuclei, tuberomammillary nucleus, and acetylcholinergic neurons in
the dorsal pons and basal forebrain (Sakurai, 2007). Orexin has an
excitatory effect in all of these regions. Mileykovskiy and colleagues
(2005) recorded the activity of single orexinergic neurons in
unanesthetized rats and found that the neurons fired at a high rate
during alert or active waking and at a low rate during quiet waking,
slowwave sleep, and REM sleep. The highest rate of firing was seen when
the rats were engaged in exploratory activity. (See Figure 9.16.)
Adamantidis and colleagues (2010) used genetic transfer to insert ChR2
protein into orexinergic neurons of the lateral hypothalamus of mice.
They found that optogenetic activation of these neurons with blue light
awakened the animals from either REM or non-REM sleep. Narcolepsy is
most often treated with modafinil, a drug that suppresses the drowsiness
associated with this disorder. Ishizuka and colleagues (2010) found that
the alerting effects of modafinil are exerted by stimulating the release
of orexin in the TMN, which activates the histaminergic neurons located
there. Table 9.3 summarizes the patterns of neurochemical activity in
the adenosine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine, and
orexin systems across the sleep/ waking cycle.

Neural Control of Sleep/Waking Transitions LO 9.9

Summarize factors involved in regulating transitions between sleep and
waking.

What controls the transition between sleep and waking? The following
sections explore homeostatic, allostatic, and circadian factors, as well
as the roles of the preoptic area, adenosine, and orexin in controlling
sleep/waking transitions. HOMEOSTATIC, ALLOSTATIC, AND CIRCADIAN FACTORS
If we go without sleep for a long time, we will

eventually become sleepy, and once we sleep, we will be likely to sleep
longer than usual and make up at least some of our sleep debt. This
control of sleep is homeostatic in nature, and follows the principles
that regulate our eating and drinking, which are described in Chapter
12. But under some conditions, it is important for us to stay
awake---for example, when we are being threatened by a dangerous
situation or when we are dehydrated and are looking for some water to
drink. This control of sleep is also allostatic in nature, a term that
refers to reactions to stressful

284 Chapter 9 events in the environment (danger, lack of water, and so
on) that serve to override homeostatic control. Finally, circadian
factors, or time of day factors, tend to restrict our period of sleep to
a particular portion of the day/night cycle. (Circadian control of sleep
cycles is described in the last section of this chapter.) As we saw
earlier in this chapter, the primary homeostatic factor that controls
sleep is the presence or absence of adenosine, a chemical that
accumulates in the brain during wakefulness and is destroyed during
slow-wave sleep. Allostatic control is mediated primarily by hormonal
and neural responses to stressful situations and by neuropeptides (such
as orexin) that are involved in hunger and thirst. This section
describes the neural circuitry that controls the transition between
sleep and waking and the means by which adenosine exerts its homeostatic
effect. When we are awake and alert, most of the neurons in our brain---­
especially those of the forebrain---are active, which enables us to pay
attention to sensory information and process this information, to think
about what we are perceiving, to retrieve and think about our memories,
and to engage in a variety of behaviors that we are called on to perform
during the day. The level of brain activity is largely controlled by the
five sets of arousal neurons described in the previous section. A high
level of activity of these neurons keeps us awake, and a low level puts
us to sleep. THE PREOPTIC AREA But what controls the activity of the
arousal neurons? What causes this activity to fall and put us to sleep?
The first hint at an answer to this question was suggested in the early
twentieth century by careful observations of a Viennese neurologist,
Constantin von Economo, who noticed that patients afflicted by a new
type of encephalitis in Europe and North America showed severe
disturbance in sleep and waking (Triarhou, 2006). Most patients slept
excessively, waking only to eat and drink. (We would now say that they
were wakened by allostatic factors.) According to von Economo, these
patients had brain damage at the junction of the brain stem and
forebrain, at a location that would destroy the axons of the arousal
neurons entering the forebrain. Some patients, however, showed just the
opposite symptoms: They slept only a few hours each day. Although they
were tired, they had difficulty falling asleep and usually awakened
shortly thereafter. Von Economo reported that patients who displayed
insomnia had damage to the region of the anterior hypothalamus. We now
know that this region, usually referred to as the preoptic area, is the
one most involved in control of sleep. The preoptic area contains
neurons whose axons form inhibitory synaptic connections with the
brain's arousal neurons. When our preoptic neurons (let's call them
sleep neurons) become active, they suppress the activity of our arousal
neurons, and we fall asleep (Saper et al., 2005).

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 284

Nauta (1946) found that destroying the preoptic area produced total
insomnia in rats. The animals subsequently fell into a coma and died;
their average survival time was only 3 days. The effects of electrical
stimulation of the preoptic area are just the opposite: Stimulation
causes drowsiness and sleep (Sterman & Clemente, 1962a, 1962b). The
majority of the sleep neurons are located in the ­ventrolateral preoptic
area (vlPOA). In addition, some are located in the nearby median
preoptic nucleus (MnPN). Damage to vlPOA neurons suppresses sleep (Lu et
al., 2000), and the activity of these neurons, measured by their levels
of Fos protein, increases during sleep. Experiments have shown that the
sleep neurons secrete the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and that they
send their axons to the five brain regions involved in arousal described
in the previous section (Gvilia et al., 2006; Sherin et al., 1998;
Suntsova et al., 2007). As we saw, activity of neurons in these five
regions causes cortical activation and behavioral arousal. Inhibition of
these regions, then, is necessary for sleep. Flip-Flop Circuits for
Sleep/Wake Transitions The sleep neurons in the preoptic area receive
inhibitory inputs from some of the same regions they inhibit, including
the tuberomammillary nucleus, raphe nuclei, and locus coeruleus (Chou et
al., 2002). The sleep neurons are inhibited by histamine, serotonin, and
norepinephrine inputs from these regions. As Saper and his colleagues
(Saper et al., 2001, 2010) suggest, this mutual inhibition may provide
the basis for establishing periods of sleep and waking. They note that
reciprocal inhibition also characterizes an electronic circuit known as
a flip-flop. A flip-flop can assume one of two states, usually referred
to as on or off---or 0 or 1 in computer applications. Either the sleep
neurons are active and inhibit the wakefulness neurons, or the
wakefulness neurons are active and inhibit the sleep neurons. Because
these regions are mutually inhibitory, it is impossible for neurons in
both sets of regions to be active at the same time. In fact, sleep
neurons in the vlPOA are silent until an animal shows a transition from
waking to sleep (Takahashi et al., 2009). (See Figure 9.17.) Stability
in Flip-Flop Circuits A flip-flop has an important advantage: It can
quickly switch from one state to another. It is most advantageous to be
either asleep or awake. A state that has some of the characteristics of
both sleep and wakefulness would be maladaptive. However, there is one
problem with flip-flops: They can be unstable. In fact, people with
narcolepsy and animals with damage to the orexinergic system of neurons
exhibit just this characteristic. They have great difficulty remaining
awake when nothing interesting is happening, and they have trouble
remaining asleep for an extended amount of time. (They also show
intrusions of the characteristics of REM sleep at inappropriate times.
We will discuss this phenomenon in the next module.)

Sleep and Biological Rhythms 285

Figure 9.17 The Sleep/Waking Flip-Flop According to Saper and colleagues
(2001), the major sleep-promoting region (the vlPOA) and the major
wakefulness-promoting regions (the basal forebrain and pontine regions
that contain acetylcholinergic neurons; the locus coeruleus, which
contains noradrenergic neurons; the raphe nuclei, which contain
serotonergic neurons; and the tuberomammillary nucleus of the
hypothalamus, which contains histaminergic neurons) are reciprocally
connected by inhibitory GABAergic neurons. (a) When the flip-flop is in
the "wake" state, the arousal systems are active, and the vlPOA is
inhibited, and the animal is awake. (b) When the flip-flop is in the
"sleep" state, the vlPOA is active, and the arousal systems are
inhibited, and the animal is asleep. Red arrows represent inhibitory
pathways. Black arrows represent excitatory pathways.

Saper and colleagues (2001, 2010) suggest that an important function of
orexinergic neurons is to help stabilize the sleep/waking flip-flop
through their excitatory connections to the wakefulness neurons.
Activity of this system of neurons tips the activity of the flip-flop
toward wakefulness and inhibits sleep. Perhaps your success at staying
awake in a boring lecture depends on maintaining a high rate of firing
of your orexinergic neurons, which would keep the flip-flop in the
waking state. (See Figure 9.18.) A mathematical model of the
sleep/waking flip-flop constructed by Rempe and colleagues (2010)
confirmed the role of orexigenic neurons in stabilizing the circuit.
Mochizuki and colleagues (2004) found that mice with a targeted mutation
against the orexin gene showed normal amounts of sleep and waking, but
their bouts of wakefulness and slow-wave sleep were very brief, showing
many more transitions between sleep and waking. These results provide
further support for the hypothesis that orexinergic neurons help
stabilize the sleep/waking flip-flop. ROLE OF ADENOSINE IN SLEEP/WAKING
TRANSITIONS As we saw earlier in this chapter, adenosine is re-

leased by astrocytes when neurons are metabolically active, and the
accumulation of adenosine produces drowsiness and sleep.
Porkka-Heiskanen and colleagues (2000) used microdialysis to measure
adenosine levels in several regions of the brain. They found that the
level of adenosine increased during wakefulness and slowly decreased
during sleep, especially in the basal forebrain. (See Figure 9.19.)
Scammell and colleagues (2001) found that infusing an adenosine agonist
into the vlPOA activated neurons there, decreased the activity of
histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus, and increased
slow-wave sleep. However, adenosine receptors are found on neurons in
many regions of the brain, including the orexinergic

it is unlikely that all of the sleep-promoting effects of adenosine
involve the neurons of the vlPOA. ROLE OF OREXIN IN SLEEP/WAKING
TRANSITIONS Seeing that orexinergic neurons help to hold the

sleep/waking flip-flop in the waking state, an important question to ask
is: What factors control the activity of orexinergic neurons? During the
waking part of the day/night cycle, orexinergic neurons receive an
excitatory signal from the biological clock that controls rhythms of
sleep and waking.

These neurons also receive signals from brain mechanisms that monitor
the animal's nutritional state: Hunger-related signals activate
orexinergic neurons, and satiety-related signals inhibit them.
Orexinergic neurons maintain arousal during the times when an animal
should search for food. In fact, if normal mice (but not mice with a
targeted mutation against orexin receptors) are given less food than
they would normally eat, they stay awake longer each day (Sakurai, 2007;
Yamanaka et al., 2003). Finally, orexinergic neurons receive inhibitory
input from the vlPOA, which means that sleep signals that arise from the
accumulation of adenosine can eventually overcome excitatory input to
orexinergic neurons, and sleep can occur. Orexinergic neurons are
involved in all three factors that control sleep and wakefulness:
homeostatic, allostatic, and circadian. (See Figure 9.20.)

Neural Control of Transition to REM LO 9.10 Describe the role of
flip-flop circuits controlling transitions to REM. As we saw earlier in
this chapter, REM sleep consists of desynchronized EEG activity,
muscular paralysis, rapid eye movements, and increased genital activity.
The rate of cerebral metabolism during REM sleep is as high as it is
during waking (Maquet et al., 1990), and if the skeletal muscles of the
body were not paralyzed, the level of physical activity would also be
high.

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 286

FLIP-FLOP CIRCUITS FOR TRANSITION TO REM REM sleep is controlled by a
flip-flop similar to the one that controls cycles of sleep and waking.
The sleep/waking flipflop determines when we wake and when we sleep.
Once we fall asleep, the REM flip-flop controls our cycles of REM sleep
and slow-wave sleep. Reviews by Fort and colleagues (2009) and Saper and
colleagues (2010) summarize the evidence for the REM flip-flop. A region
of the dorsal pons, just ventral to the locus coeruleus, contains REM-ON
neurons, cells that fire at a high rate only during REM. In rats this
region is known as the sublaterodorsal nucleus (SLD). A region of the
dorsal midbrain, the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter (vlPAG),
contains REM-OFF neurons, cells that suppress REM. For simplicity we
will refer to the REM-ON and REM-OFF regions. The REM-ON and REM-OFF
regions are interconnected by means of inhibitory GABAergic neurons.
Stimulation of the REM-ON region with infusions of glutamate agonists
produces most of the elements of REM sleep, whereas inhibition of this
region with GABA agonists disrupts REM sleep. In contrast, stimulating
the REM-OFF region suppresses REM sleep, whereas damage to this region
or infusions of GABA agonists dramatically increases REM sleep. (See
Figure 9.21.) The mutual inhibition of these two regions means that they
function like a flip-flop: Only one region can be active at any given
time. During waking, the REM-OFF region receives excitatory input from
the orexinergic neurons of the lateral hypothalamus, and this activation
tips the REM flip-flop into the

received from two sets of wakefulness neurons: the noradrenergic neurons
of the locus coeruleus and the serotonergic neurons of the raphe
nuclei.) When the sleep/waking flip-flop switches into the sleep phase,
slow-wave sleep begins. The activity of the excitatory orexinergic,
noradrenergic, and serotonergic inputs to the REM-OFF region begins to
decrease. Eventually, the REM sleep flip-flop switches to the on state,
and REM sleep begins. Figure 9.22 shows the control of the REM sleep
flip-flop by the sleep/waking flip-flop. Once sleep begins, the activity
of orexinergic neurons ceases, which removes one source of the
excitatory input to the REM-OFF region. As we saw in Figures 9.13 and
9.15, as sleep progresses, the activity of noradrenergic and
serotonergic neurons gradually decreases. As a consequence, more

Impairment in Narcolepsy We can see now why degeneration of orexinergic
neurons causes narcolepsy. The daytime sleepiness and the fragmented
sleep occur because without the influence of orexin, the sleep/waking
flipflop becomes unstable. The release of orexin in the REM-OFF region
normally keeps the REM flip-flop in the off state. With the loss of
orexinergic neurons, emotional episodes such as laughter or anger, which
activate the amygdala, tip the REM flip-flop into the on state---even
during waking---and the result is an attack of cataplexy. (Look again at
Figure 9.22.) In fact, a functional-imaging study by Schwartz and
colleagues (2008) found that when people with cataplexy watched humorous
sequences of photographs, the hypothalamus was activated less, and the
amygdala was activated more, than the same structures in control
participants. The investigators suggest that the loss of orexinergic
neurons removed an inhibitory influence of the hypothalamus on the
amygdala. The increased amygdala activity could account at least in part
for the increased activity of REM-ON neurons that occurs even

during waking in people with cataplexy. (See Figure 9.23.) Flip-Flop
Circuits Control REM Muscle Paralysis As we saw earlier, REM sleep has
several behavioral components, including rapid eye movements, genital
activity, and muscular paralysis. The last of these phenomena, muscular
paralysis, is particularly interesting. As you will read in the next
module, patients with REM sleep behavior disorder are not paralyzed
during REM sleep and therefore act out their dreams. The same thing
happens to cats when a lesion is made in a particular region of the
midbrain responsible for the muscular paralysis that occurs during REM
sleep (Jouvet, 1972). While asleep, the cats made movements and appeared
to play with invisible mice. The lesioned neurons are located just
ventral to the area we now know to be part of the REM-ON region (Lai et
al., 2010). Some of the axons that leave this region travel to the
spinal cord, where they excite inhibitory interneurons whose axons form
synapses with motor neurons. This means that when the REM flip-flop tips

to the on state, motor neurons in the spinal cord become inhibited and
cannot respond to the signals arising from the motor cortex in the
course of a dream. Damage to the REMON region removes this inhibition,
and the person (or one of Jouvet's cats) acts out his or her dreams.
(See Figure 9.24.) The fact that our brains contain an elaborate
mechanism whose sole function is to keep us paralyzed while we
dream---that is, to prevent us from acting out our dreams--- suggests
that the motor components of dreams are as important as the sensory
components. Perhaps the practice our motor system gets during REM sleep
helps improve our performance of behaviors we have learned that day.
Inhibiting motor neurons in the spinal cord prevents the movements being
practiced from actually occurring, with the exception of a few harmless
twitches of the hands and feet. Flip-Flop Circuits in Cortical Arousal,
Rapid Eye Movements, and Genital Activity in REM Neurons in the REM-ON
region also send axons to parts of the thalamus that help control
cortical arousal, which may at least partly account for the EEG
activation that is seen during REM sleep. In addition, they send axons
to glutamatergic neurons in the medial pontine reticular formation,
which, in turn, send axons to the acetylcholinergic neurons of the basal
forebrain. Activation

Tectum Movements REMs

of these forebrain neurons produces arousal and cortical desynchrony.
The control of rapid eye movements appears to be achieved by projections
from acetylcholinergic neurons in the dorsal pons to the tectum (Webster
& Jones, 1988). Little is known about the function of genital activity
that occurs during REM sleep or about the neural mechanisms responsible
for them. A study by Schmidt and colleagues (2000) found that lesions of
the lateral preoptic area in rats suppressed penile erections during REM
sleep but had no effect on erections during waking. Salas and colleagues
(2007) found that penile erections could be triggered by electrical
stimulation of acetylcholinergic neurons in the pons that become active
during REM sleep. The investigators note that evidence suggests that
these pontine neurons may be directly connected with neurons in the
lateral preoptic area and may be responsible for the erections. In
female rats, cells in the lateral hypothalamus (which also receives
cholinergic inputs) project to the clitoris and/or vagina (Marson &
Murphy, 2006). (Look again at Figure 9.24.)

Module Review: Physiological Mechanisms of Sleep and Waking Neural
Control of Sleep LO 9.7 Explain how adenosine contributes to regulating
sleep. Adenosine is released when neurons use glycogen, and it serves as
the link between increased brain metabolism

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 288

and the necessity of sleep. When neurons are active, glycogen is
depleted, and adenosine accumulates. Accumulating adenosine binds to
adenosine receptors and serves as a sleep-promoting signal. Glycogen is
replenished during slow-wave sleep, and adenosine levels decrease.

Sleep and Biological Rhythms 289

Neural Control of Arousal LO 9.8 Describe how neurochemical systems help
regulate arousal. Five systems of neurons appear to be important for
maintaining arousal. The acetylcholinergic system of the pons and the
basal forebrain is involved in cortical activation. The noradrenergic
system of the locus coeruleus is involved in vigilance. The serotonergic
system of the raphe nuclei is involved in activation of automatic
behaviors such as locomotion and grooming. The histaminergic neurons of
the tuberomammillary nucleus are involved in maintaining wakefulness.
The orexinergic system of the lateral hypothalamus is involved in
maintaining wakefulness.

Neural Control of Sleep/Waking Transitions LO 9.9 Summarize factors
involved in regulating transitions between sleep and waking. Homeostatic
control of sleep maintains the balance of sleep/waking at an optimal
level. Sleep can also be regulated by allostatic control, which responds
to environmental stressors to override homeostatic control when needed.
Circadian factors entrain periods of sleep to particular portions of the
light/dark cycle. Slow-wave sleep occurs when neurons in the
ventrolateral preoptic area (vlPOA) become active. These neurons inhibit
the systems of neurons that promote wakefulness. In turn, the vlPOA is
inhibited by these same wakefulness-­ promoting regions to create a
flip-flop circuit that keeps us either awake or asleep. The accumulation
of adenosine promotes sleep by inhibiting wakefulness-­ promoting regions
and activating the sleep-promoting

Disorders of Sleep Because we spend about one-third of our lives
sleeping, sleep disorders can have a significant impact on our quality
of life. They can also affect the way we feel while we are awake.

Insomnia LO 9.11 Describe the symptoms, treatment, and biological basis
of insomnia. Insomnia is a widespread experience, affecting
approximately 30 percent of adults (Roth, 2007). Primary insomnia is
characterized as difficulty falling asleep after going to bed or after
awakening during the night. Secondary ­insomnia is an inability to sleep
due to another mental or physical condition, such as pain, substance
use, or a psychological or neurological condition. A significant problem
in identifying insomnia is the challenge of self-reports. Most patients
who receive a

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 289

neurons of the vlPOA. Activity of the orexinergic neurons of the lateral
hypothalamus keeps the flip-flop that controls sleep and waking in the
"waking" state.

Neural Control of Transition to REM LO 9.10 Describe the role of
flip-flop circuits controlling transitions to REM. REM sleep is
controlled by another flip-flop circuit. The sublaterodorsal nucleus
(SLD) serves as the REM-ON region, and the ventrolateral periaqueductal
gray region (vlPAG) serves as the REM-OFF region. This flipflop is
controlled by the sleep/waking flip-flop. Only when the sleep/waking
flip-flop is in the "sleeping" state can the REM flip-flop switch to the
"REM" state. The muscular paralysis that prevents us from acting out our
dreams is produced by connections between neurons in the SLD that excite
inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord. Rapid eye movements and
genital activity in REM are produced by indirect connections with the
REM-ON region.

Thought Question Have you ever been lying in bed, almost asleep, when
you suddenly thought of something important you had forgotten to do? Did
you then suddenly become fully awake and alert? If so, neurons in your
brain's arousal systems likely became active, which aroused your
cerebral cortex. What do you think the source of this activation was?
What activated the arousal systems? How would you go about answering
this question? What research methods described in Chapter 5 would be
helpful?

prescription for a sleeping medication are given one on the basis of
their own description of their symptoms. Relatively few patients are
observed during a night's sleep in a sleep laboratory. Studies on the
sleep of people who report insomnia show that many people underestimate
the amount of time they actually sleep. For example, Rosa and Bonnet
(2000) found no differences in time spent sleeping between groups of
people who did or did not report insomnia. The researchers carefully
measured time asleep in a sleep laboratory setting. Many people
experience a sleep-deprived state not because they have insomnia but
because the demands of their daily schedules lead them to stay up late
or get up early (or both), resulting in less than the optimal amount of
sleep. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to serious health problems,
including increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular
disease (OrzelGryglewska, 2010).

24/11/21 1:38 PM

290 Chapter 9 Pharmacological (Sateia et al., 2017) and
nonpharmacological interventions can be effective for treating insomnia.
Nonpharmacological interventions include cognitive behavior therapy
(CBT), progressive relaxation techniques, and changes in sleep hygiene
(Morin et al., 2006; van Straten et al., 2018). Sleep hygiene
recommendations include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule (e.g.,
waking up and going to sleep at the same time each day), and keeping
bedrooms dark, quiet, and cool. Pharmacological interventions include a
class of drugs called the hypnotics. These drugs include zolpidem
(Ambien) and zaleplon (Sonata) which are agonists at the GABAA receptor.
Benzodiazepines and over-the-counter antihistamines such as
diphenhydramine are also used to treat insomnia (Benca, 2014). These
drugs can produce side effects such as sleepiness or difficulty
concentrating the following day. Chronic use of sleep-promoting drugs
can lead to tolerance and rebound insomnia (a return and increase in
insomnia) when their use is ended. New orexin receptor agonist and
melatonin receptor agonist drugs have also been developed as a treatment
for insomnia. (Melatonin is discussed in the final module of this
chapter.) These drugs may have fewer withdrawal effects and provide
another pharmacological treatment for insomnia (Sateia et al., 2017).
TREATMENT

SLEEP APNEA A particular form of insomnia is caused by

an inability to sleep and breathe at the same time. Patients with this
disorder, called sleep apnea, fall asleep and then cease to breathe.
Nearly all people, especially people who snore, have occasional episodes
of sleep apnea, but not to the extent that it interferes with sleep.
During a period of sleep apnea the level of carbon dioxide in the blood
stimulates chemoreceptors (neurons that detect the presence of certain
chemicals), and the person wakes up, gasping for air. The oxygen level
of the blood returns to normal, the person falls asleep, and the whole
cycle begins again. Because sleep is disrupted, people with this
disorder typically feel sleepy and groggy during the day. Many cases of
sleep apnea are caused by an obstruction of the airway that can be
corrected surgically or relieved by a device that attaches to the
sleeper's face and provides pressurized air that keeps the airway open
(Piccirillo et al., 2000; Sher, 1990).

Narcolepsy LO 9.12 Describe the symptoms, treatment, and biological
basis of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized
by sleep (or some of its components) at inappropriate times (Nishino,
2007). The symptoms include sleep attacks, cataplexy, and sleep
paralysis and are the result of changes in the orexin system. SLEEP
ATTACKS The primary symptom of narcolepsy is the sleep attack. In
narcolepsy, a sleep attack is an

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 290

overwhelming urge to sleep that can happen at any time but occurs most
often under monotonous, boring conditions. Sleep (which appears to be
entirely normal) generally lasts for 2--5 minutes. The person usually
wakes up feeling refreshed. Another symptom of narcolepsy---perhaps the
most striking one---is cataplexy. During a cataplectic attack, a person
will sustain varying amounts of muscle weakness. In some cases the
person will become completely paralyzed and slump down to the floor. The
person will lie there, fully conscious, for a few seconds to several
minutes. What apparently happens is that one of the phenomena of REM
sleep---muscular paralysis---occurs at an inappropriate time. This loss
of muscle tone is caused by massive inhibition of motor neurons in the
spinal cord. When this happens during waking, the person loses control
of their muscles. As in REM sleep, the person continues to breathe and
is able to control eye movements. Cataplexy is different from a
narcoleptic sleep attack. Cataplexy is usually precipitated by strong
emotional reactions or by sudden physical effort, especially if the
patient is caught unawares. Laughter, anger, or an effort to catch a
suddenly thrown object can trigger a cataplectic attack. In fact, as
Guilleminault and colleagues (1974) noted, even people who do not have
cataplexy sometimes lose muscle strength after a bout of intense
laughter. Miguel, the man described in the opener to this chapter, had
his first cataplectic attack when he was addressing the board of
directors of the company he worked for. Wise (2004) notes that patients
with narcolepsy often try to avoid thoughts and situations that are
likely to evoke strong emotions because they know that these emotions
are likely to trigger cataplectic attacks.

CATAPLEXY

REM sleep paralysis sometimes intrudes into waking at a time that does
not present any physical danger---just before or just after normal
sleep, when a person is already lying down. This symptom of narcolepsy
is referred to as sleep paralysis, an inability to move just before the
onset of sleep or on waking in the morning. A person can be snapped out
of sleep paralysis by being touched or by hearing someone call his or
her name. Sometimes, the mental components of REM sleep intrude into
sleep paralysis and the person dreams while lying awake, paralyzed.
These episodes, called h ­ ypnagogic hallucinations, are often alarming
or even terrifying. In the case study at the beginning of the chapter,
Miguel experienced a hypnagogic hallucination and thought that his
former roommate was trying to attack him with a hammer. SLEEP PARALYSIS

PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF NARCOLEPSY Fortunately, human narcolepsy is
relatively rare, with an incidence of approximately one in 2,000 people.
This hereditary disorder appears to involve a gene found on chromosome
6, but it is strongly influenced by unknown environmental

factors (Mahowald & Schenck, 2005; Mignot, 1998; Nishino, 2007). Years
ago, researchers began a program to maintain breeds of dogs that are
afflicted with narcolepsy, with the hopes that discovery of the causes
of canine narcolepsy would further our understanding of the causes of
human narcolepsy. Eventually, this research paid off. Lin and colleagues
(1999) discovered that a mutation of a specific gene is responsible for
canine narcolepsy. The product of this gene is a receptor for orexin.
There are two orexin receptors, A and B. Lin and his colleagues
discovered that the mutation responsible for canine narcolepsy involves
the orexin-B receptor. Chemelli and colleagues (1999) prepared a
targeted mutation in mice against the orexin gene and found that the
animals showed symptoms of narcolepsy. Like human patients with
narcolepsy, they went directly into REM sleep from waking and showed
periods of cataplexy while they were awake. Gerashchenko and colleagues
(2001, 2003) prepared a toxin that attacked only orexinergic neurons and
administered it to rats. The destruction of the orexin system produced
the symptoms of narcolepsy. Loss of orexinergic neurons is the cause of
most cases of narcolepsy in humans as well. Nishino et al. (2000)
performed an analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid of healthy participants
and patients with narcolepsy. They found a complete absence of orexin in
seven of the nine patients with narcolepsy. They hypothesized that the
cause of narcolepsy in these seven patients was a hereditary disorder
that caused the immune system to attack and destroy orexin-secreting
neurons. Most patients with narcolepsy are born with orexinergic
neurons, but during adolescence the immune system attacks these neurons,
and the symptoms of narcolepsy begin (Fontana et al., 2010). The
narcolepsy seen in the two patients with high levels of orexin may have
been caused by a mutation of a gene responsible for production of the
orexin-B receptor---the same mutation that causes canine narcolepsy.
Peyron and colleagues (2000a) reported the case of one patient with
early onset narcolepsy (before age 2) with a different genetic defect:
mutation of the gene responsible for the production of orexin. The
symptoms of narcolepsy can be treated with drugs. Sleep attacks can be
diminished by stimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), a
catecholamine agonist (Vgontzas & Kales, 1999). The REM sleep phenomena
(cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations) can be
alleviated by antidepressant drugs, which facilitate both serotonergic
and noradrenergic activity (Hublin, 1996; Mitler, 1994). As we will see
in Chapter 16, abnormalities in patterns of REM sleep are seen in people
experiencing depression. The fact that drugs that reduce depression also
suppress the phenomena of REM sleep is probably not coincidental.

TREATMENT OF NARCOLEPSY

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 291

At the present time, modafinil, a stimulant drug whose precise site of
action is still unknown, is widely used to treat narcolepsy (Fry, 1998;
Nishino, 2007). (Miguel, the man discussed in the opener to this
chapter, takes this drug.) Scammell and colleagues (2000) found that
administering modafinil increased the expression of Fos protein in
orexinergic neurons, which indicates that the neurons had been
activated. However, the drug must act on other targets, because the drug
treats the symptoms of people with narcolepsy, whose brains lack these
neurons. The connections of orexinergic neurons with other regions of
the brain involved in sleep and wakefulness are discussed later in this
chapter.

REM Sleep Behavior Disorder LO 9.13 Describe the symptoms, treatment,
and biological basis of REM sleep behavior disorder. As you now know,
REM sleep is typically accompanied by muscle paralysis. Although neurons
in the motor cortex and subcortical motor systems are extremely active
during REM sleep (McCarley & Hobson, 1979), people are unable to move at
this time. (The occasional twitches that are seen during REM sleep are
apparently signs of intense activity of motor neurons that are not
completely suppressed.) The fact that people are paralyzed while they
dream suggests the possibility that, if not for the paralysis, they
would act out their dreams. In REM sleep behavior disorder, the behavior
of people with this disorder corresponds with the contents of their
dreams in REM. Consider the following case:

I was a halfback playing football, and after the quarterback received
the ball from the center he lateraled it sideways to me and I'm supposed
to go around end and cut back over tackle and---this is very vivid---as
I cut back over tackle there is this big 280-pound tackle waiting, so I,
according to football rules, was to give him my shoulder and bounce him
out of the way . . . when I came to I was standing in front of our
dresser and I had \[gotten up out of bed and run and\] knocked lamps,
mirrors and everything off the dresser, hit my head against the wall and
my knee against the dresser. (Schenck et al., 1986, p. 294)

Like narcolepsy, REM sleep behavior disorder appears to be a
neurodegenerative disorder with at least some genetic component (Schenck
et al., 1993). It is often associated with neurodegenerative disorders
such as Parkinson's disease (Boeve et al., 2007). These disorders are
called α-synucleinopathies because they involve the inclusion of
α-synuclein protein in degenerating neurons. In addition, REM sleep
behavior disorder can be caused by brain d ­ amage---in some cases to the
neural circuits

24/11/21 1:38 PM

292 Chapter 9 in the brain stem that control the phenomena of REM sleep
(Culebras & Moore, 1989). The symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder
are the opposite of those of cataplexy. Instead of exhibiting paralysis
outside REM sleep, vpatients with REM sleep behavior disorder fail to
exhibit paralysis during REM sleep. As you might expect, drugs that are
used to treat the symptoms of cataplexy will worsen the symptoms of REM
sleep behavior disorder (Schenck & Mahowald, 1992). REM sleep behavior
disorder is usually treated by clonazepam, a benzodiazepine (Aurora et
al., 2010; Frenette, 2010).

Problems Associated with Slow-Wave Sleep LO 9.14 Describe the symptoms,
treatment, and biological basis of bedwetting, sleepwalking, and night
terrors. Some maladaptive behaviors occur during slow-wave sleep. These
behaviors include bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis), sleepwalking
(somnambulism), and night terrors (pavor nocturnus). All three events
occur most frequently in children. Often bedwetting can be treated with
antidiuretic drugs or training methods, such as having a special
electronic circuit ring a bell when the first few drops of urine are
detected in the bed sheet (a few drops usually precede the ensuing
flood; Perrin et al., 2015). Night terrors consist of anguished screams,
trembling, a rapid pulse, and usually no memory of what caused the
terror. Night terrors and somnambulism usually resolve themselves as the
child gets older. Neither of these phenomena is related to REM sleep; a
sleepwalking person is not acting out a dream. Especially when it occurs
in adulthood, sleepwalking appears to have a genetic component (Hublin
et al., 1997). Sleepwalking has been used as a defense in several
homicide cases in which the defendant claimed to have

committed acts of violence while sleepwalking in slowwave sleep. For an
interesting account of one case study, see Cartwright (2004). Sometimes,
people can engage in other complex behaviors while sleepwalking.
Consider the following cases: One evening Ed Weber got up from a nap on
the sofa, polished off a half-gallon of chocolate chip ice cream, then
dozed off again. He woke up an hour later and went looking for the ice
cream, summoning his wife to the kitchen and insisting, to her
astonishment, that someone else must have eaten it. \[T\]elevision talk
show host Montel Williams . . . told viewers he had removed raw foods
from his refrigerator because "I wake up in the morning and there's a
pack of chicken and there's a bite missing out of it . . . . I can take
a whole pound of ham or bologna . . . and then wake up in the morning
and not realize that I had \[eaten\] it and ask, 'Who ate my lunch
meat?'" (Boodman, 2004, p. HE01)

Schenck and colleagues (1991) reported 19 cases of people with histories
of eating during the night while they were asleep, which they labeled
sleep-related ­eating ­ isorder. Almost half of the patients had become
overd weight from night eating. Once patients realize that they are
eating in their sleep, they often employ stratagems such as keeping
their food under lock and key or setting alarms that will awaken them
when they try to open their refrigerator. Sleep-related eating disorder
usually responds well to dopaminergic agonists or topiramate, an
antiseizure medication, and may be provoked by zolpidem, a
benzodiazepine agonist that has been used to treat insomnia (Howell &
Schenck, 2009). An increased incidence of nocturnal eating in family
members of people with this disorder suggests that heredity may play a
role (De Ocampo et al., 2002).

Module Review: Disorders of Sleep Insomnia LO 9.11 Describe the
symptoms, treatment, and biological basis of insomnia. Primary insomnia
is characterized as difficulty falling asleep after going to bed or
after awakening during the night. Secondary insomnia is an inability to
sleep due to another mental or physical condition, such as pain,
substance use, or a psychological or neurological condition.

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 292

Insomnia treatments include cognitive behavior therapy (CBT),
progressive relaxation techniques, changes in sleep hygiene, as well as
hypnotic, benzodiazepine, and antihistamine drugs. Research has found no
difference in time spent sleeping between people with and without
insomnia. Insomnia can be caused by sleep apnea, and can be treated with
surgery or a medical device to keep the airway open.

biological basis of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is characterized by sleep (or
some of its components) at inappropriate times. The symptoms of
narcolepsy include sleep attacks, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and
hypnagogic hallucinations. Narcolepsy is associated with mutations of a
gene in chromosome 6 for the orexin receptor or a lack of orexin. Some
patients develop narcolepsy after an autoimmune attack of orexin
neurons. Narcolepsy is treated with stimulants, antidepressants, or
modafinil.

REM Sleep Behavior Disorder LO 9.13 Describe the symptoms, treatment,
and biological basis of REM sleep behavior disorder. REM sleep behavior
disorder is caused by a neurodegenerative disease that damages brain
mechanisms that produce paralysis during REM sleep. As a result, the
patient acts out his or her dreams. REM behavior disorder can be treated
with a benzodiazepine.

Biological Clocks

biological basis of bedwetting, sleepwalking, and night terrors. During
slow-wave sleep some people experience bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis),
sleepwalking (somnambulism), or night terrors (pavor nocturnus). These
problems are most common in children, who usually outgrow them. People
with sleep-related eating disorder seek and consume food while
sleepwalking. Treatments include training for bed wetting, dopamine
agonists, or topiramate for sleep eating. Many children eventually
outgrow problems associated with slow-wave sleep.

Thought Question Suppose you were spending the night at a friend's house
and, hearing a strange noise during the night, got out of bed and found
your friend walking around, still asleep. How would you tell whether
your friend was sleepwalking or had REM sleep behavior disorder?

Figure 9.25 Wheel-Running Activity of a Rat

Much of our behavior follows regular rhythms. For example, we saw that
the stages of sleep are organized around a 90-minute cycle of REM and
slow-wave sleep. Our daily pattern of sleep and waking follows a 24-hour
cycle. Many animals display seasonal rhythms in which reproductive
behaviors and hormone levels show annual fluctuations. In recent years
investigators have learned much about the neural mechanisms that are
responsible for these rhythms.

Top: The animal's activity occurs at "night" (that is, during the 12
hours the light is off). Middle: The period of waking follows the new
dark period when the light cycle is changed. Bottom: When the animal is
maintained in constant dim illumination, it displays a free-running
activity cycle of approximately 25 hours, which means that its period of
waking begins about 1 hour later each day. The horizontal bars represent
the portion of the light/dark cycle that the animal is active.

LO 9.15 List examples of circadian rhythms and zeitgebers. Daily rhythms
in behavior and physiological processes are found throughout the plant
and animal world. These cycles are generally called circadian rhythms.
(Circa means "about," and dies means "day"; therefore, a circadian
rhythm is one with a cycle of approximately 24 hours.) Some of these
rhythms are passive responses to changes in illumination. However, other
rhythms are controlled by mechanisms within the organism---by "internal
clocks." For example, Figure 9.25 shows the activity of a rat during
various conditions of illumination. Each horizontal line represents 24
hours. Black lines indicate the time the rat spends running on a wheel
in wakefulness. Remember, rats

294 Chapter 9 are nocturnal animals, active at night. Actual records
from a rat would show more variability and some short periods of waking
during the day and perhaps some catnaps (ratnaps?) during the night. The
upper portion of the figure shows the activity of the rat during a
normal day/night cycle, with alternating 12-hour periods of light and
dark. Next, the light/dark cycle was shifted. The dark portion of the
cycle now began 4 hours earlier. The animal's activity cycle quickly
followed the change. (See the middle portion of Figure 9.25.) Finally,
dim lights were left on continuously. The cyclical pattern in the rat's
activity remained. Because there were no cycles of light and dark in the
rat's environment, the source of rhythmicity must be located within the
animal. This means that the animal must possess an internal biological
clock. You can see that the rat's clock was not set precisely to 24
hours. When the illumination was held constant, the clock ran a bit
slow. The animal began its bout of activity approximately 1 hour later
each day. (See the bottom portion of Figure 9.25.) The phenomenon
illustrated in Figure 9.25 is typical of the circadian rhythms shown by
many species. A free-running clock, with a cycle of approximately 25
hours, controls some biological functions---in this case, sleep and
wakefulness. Regular daily variation in the level of illumination (that
is, sunlight and darkness) normally keeps the clock adjusted to 24
hours. Light serves as a zeitgeber (German for "time giver") and
synchronizes the endogenous rhythm. Studies with many species of animals
have shown that if they are maintained in constant darkness (or constant
dim light), a brief period of bright light will reset their internal
clock, advancing or slowing it depending on when the light flash occurs
(Aschoff, 1979). For example, if an animal is exposed to bright light
soon after dusk, the biological clock is set back to an earlier
time---as if dusk had not yet arrived. On the other hand, if the light
occurs late at night, the biological clock is set ahead to a later
time---as if dawn had already come. Using zeitgebers such as clocks or
other time cues, individuals who are blind or live in polar regions with
extended periods of light or dark easily adapt to a 24-hour environment.
Like other animals, humans exhibit circadian rhythms. Our normal period
of inactivity begins several hours after the start of the dark portion
of the day/night cycle and persists for a variable amount of time into
the light portion. Without the benefits of modern civilization we would
probably go to sleep earlier and get up earlier than we do. We use
artificial lights to delay our bedtime and window shades to extend our
time for sleep. Under constant illumination our biological clocks will
run free, gaining or losing time like a watch that runs too slow or too
fast. Different people have different cycle lengths, but most people in
that situation will begin to live a "day" that is approximately 25 hours
long. This works out quite well, because the morning light, acting as a
zeitgeber, simply resets the clock.

M09_CARL0287_13_GE_C09.indd 294

The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus LO 9.16 Explain how the suprachiasmatic
nucleus regulates circadian rhythms. What brain regions might be
involved in maintaining circadian rhythms? A specific region of the
hypothalamus, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, receives light
information from the environment and uses it to entrain behaviors to a
24-hour light/dark cycle. Researchers working independently in two
laboratories (Moore & Eichler, 1972; Stephan & Zucker, 1972) discovered
that the primary biological clock of the rat is located in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Confirming its role
in maintaining circadian rhythms, researchers found that lesions of the
SCN disrupt daily patterns of wheel running, drinking, and hormonal
secretion (Moore & Eichler, 1972; Stephan & Zucker, 1972). The SCN also
provides the primary control over the timing of sleep cycles. As
nocturnal animals, rats sleep during the day and forage and feed at
night. Lesions of the SCN abolish this pattern. Sleep occurs in bouts
randomly dispersed throughout both day and night (Ibuka & Kawamura,
1975; Stephan & Nuñez, 1977). However, rats with SCN lesions still
obtain the same amount of sleep that normal animals do. The lesions
disrupt the circadian control of sleep but do not affect its homeostatic
control. Figure 9.26 shows the SCN in the hypothalamus. The SCN actually
consists of two suprachiasmatic nuclei clusters of neurons at the base
of the brain, just above the optic chiasm. The suprachiasmatic nuclei of
the rat consist of approximately 8,600 small neurons, tightly packed
into a volume of 0.036 mm3 (Moore et al., 2002). Because light is the
primary zeitgeber for most mammals' activity cycles, we would expect
that the SCN receives input from the visual system. Indeed, anatomical
studies have revealed a direct projection from the retina to the SCN:
the retinohypothalamic pathway (Aronson et al., 1993; Hendrickson et
al., 1972). (See Figure 9.27.) The photoreceptors in the retina that
provide photic information to the SCN are neither rods nor cones---the
cells that provide us with the information used for visual perception.
Freedman and colleagues (1999) found that targeted mutations against
genes necessary for production of both rods and cones did not disrupt
the synchronizing effects of light. However, when they removed the
mice's eyes, these effects were disrupted. These results suggested that
there is a special photoreceptor that provides information about the
ambient level of light that synchronizes circadian rhythms. Provencio
and colleagues (2000) found the photochemical responsible for this
effect, which they named melanopsin. ROLE IN CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS

296 Chapter 9 Unlike the other retinal photopigments, which are found in
rods and cones, melanopsin is present in ganglion cells---the neurons
whose axons transmit information from the eyes to the rest of the brain.
Melanopsin-containing ganglion cells are sensitive to light, and their
axons terminate in the SCN. They also terminate in the region of the
midbrain that controls the response of the pupils to changes in the
level of illumination (Berson et al., 2002; Gooley et al., 2003; Hattar
et al., 2002). Apparently, m ­ elanopsin-containing ganglion cells, and
not rods and cones, are involved in the pupillary response to light
(Gamlin et al., 2007). Because the synchronizing effects of light on the
SCN are mediated by specialized ganglion cells and not by rods and
cones, people who have become blind because of loss of these
photoreceptors can still show normal circadian rhythms. Although they
cannot see, the melanopsincontaining ganglion cells in their retinas can
still detect changes in light levels and synchronize the activity of
their SCN (Hatori & Panda, 2010). SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS CONTROL OF
SLEEP AND WAKING How does the SCN control cycles of

sleep and waking? Efferent axons of the SCN responsible for organizing
cycles of sleep and waking terminate in the subparaventricular zone
(SPZ), a region just dorsal to the SCN (Deurveilher & Semba, 2005). Lu
and colleagues (2001) found that excitotoxic lesions of the ventral part
of the SPZ disrupted circadian rhythms of sleep and waking. The ventral
SPZ projects to the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH), which
in turn projects to several brain regions, including two that play
critical roles in the control of sleep and waking: the vlPOA and the
orexinergic neurons of the lateral hypothalamus. The projections to the
vlPOA are inhibitory and inhibit sleep, whereas the projections to the
orexinergic neurons are excitatory and promote wakefulness (Saper et
al., 2005). The activity of these connections

varies across the day/night cycle. In diurnal animals (such as
ourselves) the activity of these connections is high during the day and
low during the night. (See Figure 9.28.) Although connections of SCN
neurons with the SPZ play a critical role in circadian control of sleep
and waking, several experiments suggest that the SCN can also control
these rhythms by secretion of chemicals that diffuse through the brain's
extracellular fluid. Lehman et al., (1987) destroyed the SCN and then
transplanted in its place a new set of suprachiasmatic nuclei obtained
from donor animals. The grafts succeeded in reestablishing circadian
rhythms, even though very few synaptic connections were observed between
the graft and the recipient's brain. Convincing evidence for chemical
communication between the SCN and other parts of the brain comes from a
transplantation study by Silver and colleagues (1996). Silver and her
colleagues first destroyed the SCN in a group of hamsters, abolishing
their circadian rhythms. Then, a few weeks later, they removed SCN
tissue from donor animals and placed it in tiny semipermeable capsules,
which they then implanted in the animals' third ventricles. Nutrients
and other chemicals could pass through the walls of the capsules,
keeping the SCN tissue alive, but the neurons inside the capsules were
not able to establish synaptic connections with the surrounding tissue.
Nevertheless, the transplants reestablished circadian rhythms in the
recipient animals. Evidence suggests that the chemical signal may be a
prokineticin 2 (PK2), a protein contained in a subset of SCN neurons
(Zhang et al., 2009). Presumably, the chemicals secreted by cells in the
SCN affect rhythms of sleep and waking by diffusing into the SPZ and
binding with receptors on neurons located there. In fact, Hu and
colleagues (2007) found that mice with a targeted mutation against the
PK2 gene showed disrupted circadian rhythms.

Sleep and Biological Rhythms 297

THE NATURE OF THE CLOCK All clocks must have a time base that makes them
"tick." Mechanical clocks use flywheels or pendulums; electronic clocks
use quartz crystals. The SCN, too, must contain a physiological
mechanism that parses time into units. After years of research,
investigators are finally beginning to discover the nature of the
biological clock in the SCN. Several studies have demonstrated daily
activity rhythms in the SCN, which indicates that the circadian clock is
indeed located there. A study by Schwartz and Gainer (1977) nicely
demonstrated day/night fluctuations in the activity of the SCN. The
investigators injected some rats with radioactive 2-DG during the day
and injected others at night. The animals were then euthanized, and
autoradiographs of cross sections through the brain were prepared. (2-DG
autoradiography was described in Chapter 5.) The autoradiographs
revealed radioactivity (representing a high metabolic rate) in the SCN
when 2-DG was administered during the day, but not during the night. The
"ticking" of the biological clock within the SCN is due to activity
within individual neurons themselves. Several studies have succeeded in
keeping individual SCN neurons alive in a culture medium. Welsh and
colleagues (1995) removed tissue from the rat SCN and dissolved the
connections between the cells with papain, an enzyme that is sometimes
used as a meat tenderizer. The cells were placed on top of an array of
microelectrodes so that their electrical activity could be measured.
Unlike neurons in the intact SCN, whose rhythms are synchronized, the
cultured neurons displayed individual, independent circadian rhythms in
activity.

What causes intracellular ticking? Circadian rhythms in the SCN are
produced as protein production rises to a certain level in the cell.
When this maximal level is reached, the high concentration of protein

GENE PRODUCTS

in the cell turns off its own production through a negative feedback
loop (see Chapter 12 for a review of negative feedback and homeostasis).
As a result, the levels of the protein begin to decline, removing the
inhibition, starting the production cycle again. This mechanism was
first discovered in Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly.
Subsequent research with mammals revealed a similar system. (See
Golombek & Rosenstein, 2010 for a review.) The system involves at least
seven genes and their proteins and two interlocking feedback loops. When
one of the proteins produced by the first loop reaches a sufficient
level, it starts the second loop, which eventually inhibits the
production of proteins in the first loop, and the cycle begins again.
The intracellular ticking is regulated by the time it takes to produce
and degrade a set of proteins. (See Figure 9.29.) Yan and Silver (2004)
found that if animals that are kept in the dark are exposed to a brief
period of bright light, the levels of these proteins change.
Furthermore, pulses of light presented during different phases of the
animal's circadian rhythm produce different effects on the production of
these proteins. As we saw earlier, exposure to light at different times
of day had different effects on the animals' behavior, setting their
biological clocks either forward or backward (Aschoff, 1979). Genetic
studies have found evidence for similarities between the human SCN and
that of laboratory animals. Toh and colleagues (2001) found that a
mutation on chromosome 2 of a gene for one of the proteins involved in
the feedback loops we mentioned earlier in this submodule (per2) is
responsible for the advanced sleep phase syndrome. This syndrome causes
a 4-hour advance in rhythms of sleep and temperature cycles. People with
this syndrome fall asleep around 7:30 p.m. and awaken around 4:30 a.m.
The mutation appears to change the relationship between the zeitgeber of
morning light and the phase of the circadian clock that

gene, found on chromosome 1. This syndrome consists of a 4-hour delay in
sleep/waking rhythms. People with this disorder are typically unable to
fall asleep before 2:00 a.m. and have great difficulty waking before
midmorning. Allebrandt and colleagues (2010) found yet another set of
gene variants (in the clock gene) that affect people's sleep duration.

Control of Seasonal Rhythms: The Pineal Gland and Melatonin LO 9.17
Describe the relationship between the pineal gland and melatonin.
Although the SCN has an intrinsic rhythm of approximately 24 hours, it
also plays a role in much longer rhythms. (We could say that it is
involved in a biological calendar as well as a biological clock.) THE
PINEAL GLAND The control of seasonal rhythms in-

volves another part of the brain: the pineal gland (Bartness et al.,
1993). This structure sits on top of the midbrain, just in front of the
cerebellum. (See ­Figure 9.30.) The pineal gland secretes a hormone
called ­melatonin, so named because it has the ability in certain animals
(primarily fish, reptiles, and amphibians) to turn the skin temporarily
dark. (The dark color is produced by a chemical known as melanin.) In
mammals, melatonin controls seasonal rhythms. Neurons in the SCN make
indirect connections with neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the
hypothalamus (the PVN). The axons of these neurons travel all the way to
the spinal cord, where they form synapses with preganglionic neurons of
the sympathetic nervous system. The postganglionic neurons innervate the
pineal gland and control the secretion of melatonin. In response to
input from the SCN, the pineal gland secretes melatonin during the
night. This melatonin acts back on various structures in the brain
(including the SCN, whose cells contain melatonin receptors) and
controls hormones, physiological processes, and behaviors that show
seasonal variations. During long nights a large amount of melatonin is
secreted, and the animals go into the winter phase of their annual
cycle. Lesions of the SCN, the PVN, or the pineal gland disrupt seasonal
rhythms that are controlled by day length---and so do knife cuts that
interrupt the neural connection between the SCN and the PVN, which
indicates that this is one function of the SCN that is mediated through
its neural connections with another structure. Furthermore, although
transplants of fetal suprachiasmatic nuclei will restore circadian
rhythms in animals with SCN lesions, they will not restore seasonal
rhythms, because the transplanted tissue does not MELATONIN

establish neural connections with the PVN (Ralph & Lehman, 1991). (See
Figure 9.31.)

Changes in Circadian Rhythms: Shift Work and Jet Lag LO 9.18 Suggest why
shift work and jet lag result in changes in circadian rhythms. When
people abruptly change their daily rhythms of activity, their internal
circadian rhythms, controlled by the SCN, become desynchronized with
those in the external environment. For example, if a person who normally
works on a day shift begins working on a night shift or if someone
travels east or west across several time zones, his or her SCN will
signal the rest of the brain that it is time to sleep during the work
shift (or the middle of the day, in the case of jet travel). This
disparity between internal rhythms and the external environment results
in sleep disturbances and mood changes and interferes with people's
ability to function during waking hours. Problems such as ulcers,
depression, and accidents related to sleepiness are more common in
people whose work schedules shift frequently (Drake et al., 2004). Jet
lag is a temporary phenomenon. After several days, people who have
crossed several time zones find it easier to fall asleep at the
appropriate time, and their daytime alertness improves. Shift work can
present a more enduring problem when people are required to change
shifts often. The solution to jet lag and to the problems caused by
shift work is to get the internal clock synchronized with the external
environment as quickly as possible. One way to start is to try to
provide strong zeitgebers at the appropriate time. If a person is
exposed to bright light before the low point in the daily rhythm of body
temperature (which occurs an hour or two before the person usually
awakens), the person's

circadian rhythm is delayed. If the exposure to bright light occurs
after the low point, the circadian rhythm is advanced (Dijk et al.,
1995). In fact, several studies have shown that exposure to bright
lights at the appropriate time helps to ease the transition to a new
circadian pattern (Boulos et al., 1995). Similarly, people adapt to
shift work more rapidly if artificial light is kept at a brighter level
in the workplace and if their bedroom is kept as dark as possible
(Horowitz et al., 2001). The role of melatonin in seasonal rhythms is
well established. Studies conducted in recent years suggest that
melatonin may also be involved in circadian rhythms. As we saw,
melatonin is secreted during the night, which, for diurnal mammals such
as ourselves, is the period during which we sleep. But although our
species lacks strong seasonal rhythms, the daily rhythm of melatonin
secretion persists. It seems that melatonin must have some functions
besides regulation of seasonal rhythms. Studies have found that
melatonin, acting on receptors in the SCN, can affect the sensitivity of
SCN

Spinal cord

neurons to zeitgebers and can itself alter circadian rhythms (Gillette &
McArthur, 1995; Starkey et al., 1995). Researchers do not yet understand
exactly what role melatonin plays in the control of circadian rhythms,
but they have already discovered practical applications. Melatonin
secretion normally reaches its highest levels early in the night, at
around bedtime. Investigators have found administering melatonin at the
appropriate time (in most cases, just before going to bed) significantly
reduces the adverse effects of both jet lag and shifts in work schedules
(Arendt et al., 1995; Deacon & Arendt, 1996). Blind people who have
experienced eye injuries or sustained retinal damage that includes their
melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells as well as their rods and
cones will show unsynchronized, free-running circadian rhythms. In such
cases, bedtime melatonin has been used to synchronize their circadian
rhythms and has improved their cycles of sleep (Skene et al., 1999).

dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus to regions of the brain involved
in sleep and waking. Individual neurons, rather than circuits of
neurons, are responsible for the "ticking." Each tick, approximately 24
hours long, consists of the production and breakdown of a series of
proteins in two interlocking loops that act back on the genes
responsible for their own production.

Control of Seasonal Rhythms: The Pineal Gland and Melatonin LO 9.17
Describe the relationship between the pineal gland and melatonin. The
SCN and the pineal gland control annual rhythms. During the night the
SCN signals the pineal gland to secrete melatonin. Prolonged melatonin
secretion, which occurs during winter, causes animals to enter the
winter phase of their annual cycle. Melatonin also appears to be
involved in synchronizing circadian rhythms: The hormone can help people
to adjust to the effects of shift work or jet lag and even synchronize
the daily rhythms of blind people for whom light cannot serve as a
zeitgeber.

Changes in Circadian Rhythms: Shift Work and Jet Lag LO 9.18 Suggest why
shift work and jet lag result in changes in circadian rhythms. Shift
work and jet lag result in changes in circadian rhythms because of
desynchronization between the SCN and zeitgebers in the external
environment.

Thought Question Until recently (in terms of the evolution of our
species), our ancestors tended to go to sleep when the sun set and wake
up when it rose. Once our ancestors learned how to control fire, they
undoubtedly stayed up somewhat later, sitting in front of a fire. With
the development of cheap, effective lighting, many members of our
species adopted the habit of staying up late and waking several hours
after sunrise. Considering that our biological clock and the neural
mechanisms it controls evolved long ago, do you think the changes in our
daily rhythms impair any of our physical and intellectual abilities? If
so, how? If not, why not?

suggest that people's gender identity and sexual orientation were not
under the strong control of biological factors and that these
characteristics could be shaped by the way a child was raised (Money &
Ehrhardt, 1972). Identical twin boys were raised similarly until 7
months of age, when the penis of one of the boys was accidentally
removed during circumcision. The cautery (a device that cuts tissue by
means of electric current) was adjusted too high, and instead of
removing just the foreskin, the current burned off the entire penis. The
parents decided to raise the child as a girl. John became Joan. Joan's
parents started dressing her in girls' clothing and treating her like a
little girl. Surgeons performed an operation, removing the testes and
creating a vagina. At first, psychologists who studied Joan reported
that she was a typically developing girl and concluded that it was a
child's upbringing that determined their gender identity. Many people
saw this case as a triumph of socialization over biology.

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 302

Unfortunately, this conclusion was premature (Diamond & Sigmundson,
1997). Although Joan did not know that her biological sex at birth was
male, she was unhappy with a female gender identity. She felt that her
gender was male and even tried to stand to urinate. When, as an unhappy
adolescent, Joan considered suicide, her family and physicians agreed to
support Joan's decisions to stop estrogen treatment and start taking
androgens, and have a mastectomy. Surgeons also began creating a
phallus. Joan became John again. We now know this person's real names:
Bruce became Brenda, who then chose the name David after resuming a male
gender again. A book has told David's story (Colapinto, 2000), and a
2002 television documentary (NOVA's Sex: Unknown) presented interviews
with David, his mother, the psychologist who worked with the family, and
others involved in this unfortunate case. Sadly, David subsequently lost
his job, he and his wife separated, and in May 2004, at the age of 38,
he committed suicide.

Reproductive and Parental Behavior

This case illustrates the power and complexity of our sexual development
and identity. Sexual and reproductive behaviors constitute an important
category of social behaviors. Behavioral neuroscience has often
considered these sexually dimorphic behaviors, which refers to behaviors
that differ in males and females. Many lines of research suggest that
hormones present both before and after birth play an important role in
the development and control of these behaviors. More recently, however,
behavioral neuroscientists have begun to view reproductive behaviors as
a more diverse set of behaviors, making assigning them as strictly
"male" or "female" difficult. In addition, some behaviors in this
category may be universal, and others show substantial overlap in their
expression by biological males and females. Some researchers have
suggested a "mosaic" approach to understanding what have been considered
male- and female-typical behaviors and brain regions, in which some
features are more common in males, or females, or both. The mosaic of
behaviors is influenced not only by biological factors, but by the
environment as well (Joel et al., 2015). A debate is currently underway
among neuroscientists about the best way to collect and interpret brain
and behavioral data to improve our understanding of sex and gender
(Chekroud et al., 2016; Del Giudice et al., 2016; Joel et al., 2015,
2016; Joel & Fauso-Sterling, 2016; McEwen & Milner, 2017; Rosenblatt,
2016). Throughout this chapter, we will refer to sex differences
primarily based on research that has conceptualized sexually dimorphic
differences between males and females. This approach reflects the
majority of research in this area to date, but keep in mind that the
nature of this research is dynamic, and our understanding and the
language used to describe these behaviors will likely change in the
future. This chapter begins with a discussion of sexual development. We
then examine the hormonal and neural influences on sexual behavior and
orientation, as well as gender identity. In the final module, we focus
on how hormonal and neural controls influence parenting behavior.

Sexual Development A person's chromosomal sex is determined at the time
of fertilization. However, this event is only the first in a series of
steps that culminates in the development of our complex sexual and
gender identities. The language we use to describe our sexual selves
continues to evolve as we learn more about the nature of our identity,
but, generally speaking, the term sex typically refers to the genetic or
physiological characteristics of male and female members of a species,
while the term gender typically refers to the socially influenced
identity, roles, and/or behavior of an individual. Intersex is a broad
term used to describe

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 303

303

a variety of combinations of biologically male and female
characteristics, such as external female genitalia and internal male sex
organs. The term transgender is used to describe a gender identity that
is different from the sex identified or assigned at birth. This module
considers the major features of sexual development, from production of
gametes to development of internal sex organs and external genitalia. As
you read, notice the variety and complexity of factors involved in
sexual development.

Production of Gametes and Fertilization LO 10.1

Describe gamete production and fertilization.

All cells of the human body (other than sperm or ova) contain 23 pairs
of chromosomes. The genetic information that programs the development of
a human is contained in the DNA that constitutes these chromosomes. We
pride ourselves on our ability to miniaturize computer circuits on
silicon chips, but that accomplishment looks primitive when we consider
that the blueprint for a human being is too small to be seen by the
naked eye. The production of gametes (ova and sperm) entails a special
form of cell division called meiosis. This process produces cells that
contain one set of each of the pairs of chromosomes. At fertilization, a
single sperm and ovum join, sharing their 23 single chromosomes to
reconstitute the 23 pairs. A person's genetic sex is determined at the
time of fertilization of the ovum by sperm. Twenty-two of the 23 pairs
of chromosomes determine the organism's physical development independent
of its sex. The last pair consists of two sex chromosomes, which contain
genes that determine whether the offspring will be genetically male or
female. There are two types of sex chromosomes: X chromosomes and Y
chromosomes. In humans, genetic females have two X chromosomes (XX). All
the ova that a woman produces will contain an X chromosome. Genetic
males have an X and a Y chromosome (XY). When a man's sex chromosomes
divide, half the sperm contain an X chromosome, and the other half
contain a Y chromosome. A Y-bearing sperm produces an XY-fertilized ovum
and therefore a genetic male. An X-bearing sperm produces an
XX-fertilized ovum and therefore a genetic female. (See Figure 10.1.)

Development of the Sex Organs LO 10.2

Explain how gonads, internal sex organs, and external genitalia develop.

Males and females can differ in many ways: Their bodies can be
different, parts of their brains can be different, and their
reproductive behaviors can be different. Are all these differences
directly encoded on the tiny Y chromosome,

the sole piece of genetic material that distinguishes genetic males from
females? The answer is no. The X chromosome and the 22 nonsex
chromosomes found in the cells of both males and females contain all the
information needed to develop the bodies of either sex. Exposure to sex
hormones, both before and after birth, is responsible for much of sexual
diversity. What the Y chromosome does control is the development of the
glands that produce male sex hormones. GONADS There are three general
categories of sex organs: the gonads, the internal sex organs, and the
external genitalia. The gonads---testes or ovaries---are the first to
develop. Gonads have a dual function: They produce ova or sperm, and
they secrete hormones. Through the sixth week of prenatal development,
male and female fetuses are identical. Both sexes have a pair of
identical undifferentiated gonads, which have the potential of
developing into either testes or ovaries. The factor that controls their
development appears to be a single gene on the Y chromosome called SRY
(sex-determining region Y). This gene produces a protein that binds to
the DNA of cells in the

undifferentiated gonads and causes them to become testes. If the SRY
gene is not present, the undifferentiated gonads become ovaries. Some
instances of XX males have been reported. This can occur when the SRY
gene becomes translocated from the Y chromosome to the X chromosome
during production of the father 's sperm. Although the SRY gene begins
the process of gonadal differentiation, at least two other genes are
also necessary for completion of this process. Once the gonads have
developed, another series of events is set into action that contributes
to the individual's sexual development. These events are directed by
hormones, which affect sexual development in two ways. During prenatal
development these hormones have organizational effects, which influence
the development of a person's sex organs and brain. These effects are
permanent and persist throughout the person's life. The second role of
sex hormones is to produce activational effects. These effects occur
later in life, after the sex organs have developed. For example,
hormones activate the production of sperm, make erection and ejaculation
possible, and also induce ovulation. Because the bodies of adult males
and females have been organized differently, sex hormones will have
different activational effects. Table 10.1 compares the features of
organizational and activational hormone effects. Early in embryonic
development the internal sex organs are bisexual, and all embryos
contain the precursors for both female and male sex organs. However,
during the third month of gestation, only one of these precursors
develops. The precursor of the internal female sex organs, which
develops into the fimbriae and fallopian tubes, the uterus, and the
inner two-thirds of the vagina, is called the Müllerian system. The
precursor of the internal male sex organs, which develops into the
epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles, is called the Wolffian
system. These systems were named after their discoverers, Müller and
Wolff. (See Figure 10.2.) The development of internal sex organs of a
fetus is determined by the presence or absence of hormones that are
secreted by testes. If these hormones are present, the Wolffian system
develops. If they are not, the Müllerian system develops. The Müllerian
(female) system needs no additional hormonal stimulus from the gonads to
develop. (Turner syndrome, a disorder of sexual development that

will be discussed later in this chapter, provides evidence for this
process.) In contrast, the cells of the Wolffian (male) system do not
develop unless they are stimulated to do so by a hormone. The testes
secrete two types of hormones. The first, a peptide hormone called
antiMüllerian hormone, does exactly what its name says: It prevents the
Müllerian (female) system from developing. It therefore has a
defeminizing effect. The second, a set of steroid hormones called
androgens, stimulates the development of the Wolffian system. Androgens
have a masculinizing effect. Two different androgens are responsible for
masculinization. The first, testosterone, is secreted by the testes and
gets its name from these glands. An enzyme called 5α reductase converts
some of the testosterone into another ­androgen, known as
dihydrotestosterone. In Chapter 2, you read that hormones exert their
effects on target cells by stimulating the appropriate hormone receptor.
The precursor of the male internal sex organs---the Wolffian
system---contains androgen receptors that are coupled to cellular
mechanisms that promote growth and division. When molecules of androgens
bind with these receptors, the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal
vesicles develop and grow. In contrast, the

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 305

cells of the Müllerian system contain receptors for antiMüllerian
hormone that prevent growth and division. The presence of anti-Müllerian
hormone prevents the development of the female internal sex organs. The
fact that the internal sex organs of the human embryo are bisexual and
could potentially develop as either male or female is dramatically
illustrated by two genetic disorders: androgen insensitivity syndrome
and persistent Müllerian duct syndrome. Some people are insensitive to
androgens; they have androgen insensitivity syndrome (MacLean et al.,
1995; Money & Ehrhardt, 1972). The cause of androgen insensitivity
syndrome is a genetic mutation that prevents the formation of
functioning androgen receptors. (The gene for the androgen receptor is
located on the X chromosome.) The primitive gonads of a genetic male
fetus with androgen insensitivity syndrome become testes and secrete
both anti-Müllerian hormone and androgens. The lack of androgen
receptors prevents the androgens from having a masculinizing effect. As
a result, the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate
do not develop. However, the anti-Müllerian hormone still has its
defeminizing effect, preventing the female internal sex organs from
developing. The uterus, fimbriae, and Fallopian

08/11/2021 20:14

306 Chapter 10 tubes do not develop either, and the vagina is shallow.
The external genitalia are female, and at puberty the person develops a
woman's body. Without a uterus and ovaries, however, the person cannot
have children. Most cases of second genetic disorder, persistent
Müllerian duct syndrome, result from a failure to produce anti-Müllerian
hormone or the absence of receptors for this hormone (Josso et al.,
2005; Picard et al., 2017; Warne & Zajac, 1998). When this syndrome
occurs in genetic males, androgens have their masculinizing effect, but
defeminization does not occur, and the person is born with both sets of
internal sex organs, male and female. The presence of the additional
female sex organs usually interferes with functioning of the male sex
organs. The development of a test based on a molecular probe for SRY was
intended to ensure that potential competitors for the women's Summer
Olympic events in Atlanta in 1996 had no SRY gene and therefore were not
men attempting to compete as women. However, this controversial test
could erroneously identify XY women with androgen insensitivity syndrome
as men. Given that androgens cannot stimulate muscle development in
people whose cells are insensitive to these hormones, the presence of
the SRY gene did not indicate that individuals were men trying to
compete as women. Women with androgen insensitivity syndrome have
women's bodies, with muscular strength typical of women. However,
science and common sense prevailed, and this form of testing was
eliminated by the time of the 2000 Summer Olympics. So far, you have
read about only male sex hormones. What about prenatal sexual
development in females? The hormones produced by female sex organs are
not needed for the Müllerian system to develop. People with Turner
syndrome have only one sex chromosome: a single X chromosome. Instead of
having XX cells, people with Turner syndrome have X0 cells---0 \[zero\]
indicating a missing sex chromosome. In most cases the existing X
chromosome comes from the mother, which means that the cause of the
disorder results from the genetic information carried by a sperm
(Knebelmann et al., 1991). Because a Y chromosome is not present, testes
do not develop. In addition, because two X chromosomes are needed to
produce ovaries, these glands do not develop. But even though people
with Turner syndrome have no gonads, their biological development is
female, with typical female internal sex organs and external
genitalia---which is evidence that fetuses do not require ovaries or the
hormones they produce to develop as females. Individuals with Turner
syndrome typically take supplemental estrogen to induce puberty and
sexual maturation, but without ovaries they cannot produce ova.

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 306

The external genitalia are the visible sex organs, including the penis
and scrotum in males and the labia, clitoris, and outer part of the
vagina in females. (See Figure 10.3.) As you just read, the external
genitalia do not require female sex hormones to become female. In the
presence of dihydrotestosterone, the external genitalia will become
male. The development of a person's external genitalia is determined by
the presence or absence of an androgen, which explains why people with
Turner syndrome have female external genitalia even though they lack
ovaries. People with androgen insensitivity syndrome have female
external genitalia too, because without androgen receptors, their cells
cannot respond to the androgens produced by their testes. As you read,
the enzyme 5α reductase converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone to
contribute to masculinization of external genitalia. Discovery of a
mutation of

the gene encoding for the enzyme 5α reductase helped researchers better
understand the process of masculinization of external genitalia. This
mutation has been identified in some families, and it can temporarily
prevent masculinization of the external genitalia. Genetically male (XY)
individuals with the mutation may be born with ambiguous genitalia and
initially assumed to be female. These individuals then experience
masculinization of the external genitalia by growing a penis at puberty,
when testosterone levels increase (Imperato-McGinley et al., 1974).
Figure 10.4 summarizes the hormonal factors that control the ­development
of the gonads, internal sex organs, and genitalia.

Sexual Maturation LO 10.3

Compare organizational and activational effects of hormones on primary
and secondary sex characteristics.

The primary sex characteristics are influenced by organizational effects
of hormones and include the gonads, internal sex organs, and external
genitalia. These structures are present at birth. The secondary sex
characteristics, such as enlarged breasts and widened hips or a beard
and deep voice, are influenced by the activational effects of hormones
and do not appear until puberty. At puberty the gonads are stimulated to
produce their hormones, and these hormones cause the person to mature
sexually. The onset of puberty occurs when cells in the hypothalamus
secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormones (GnRH), which stimulate the
production and release of two gonadotropic hormones by the anterior
pituitary gland. The gonadotropic hormones stimulate the gonads to
produce their hormones, which are ultimately responsible for sexual
­maturation. (See Figure 10.5.)

The two gonadotropic hormones are follicle-­ stimulating hormone (FSH)
and luteinizing hormone (LH), named for the effects they produce in a
female (production of a follicle and its subsequent luteinization, to be
described in the next module of this chapter). However, the same
hormones are produced in males, where they stimulate the testes to
produce sperm and to secrete testosterone. If male and female pituitary
glands are exchanged in rats, the ovaries and testes respond to the
hormones secreted by the new glands, respectively (Harris & Jacobsohn,
1951--1952).

08/11/2021 20:14

308 Chapter 10 The secretion of GnRH, which directs the production of
the gonadotropic hormones, which in turn stimulate puberty and
production of the sex hormones secreted by the gonads, is under the
control of another peptide: ­kisspeptin. (The unusual name of this
peptide refers to Hershey, Pennsylvania, the location of the laboratory
where the gene that encodes for the peptide was discovered. This city is
also the home of the company that makes Hershey's Kisses, a chocolate
candy.) Kisspeptin, produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the
hypothalamus, is essential for the initiation of puberty and the
maintenance of male and female reproductive ability (Millar et al.,
2010). For over a century the age at which children (particularly girls)
reach puberty has been diminishing in many countries, presumably because
of improved nutrition (Foster & Nagatani, 1999). Girls who remain
unusually thin through exercise and diet tend to reach puberty later,
while girls who are obese tend to reach puberty earlier (Frisch, 1990).
As we will see in Chapter 12, leptin, a peptide hormone secreted by
well-nourished fat cells, provides an important signal to the brain
concerning the amount of fat tissue in the body. If body fat increases,
the level of leptin in the blood increases and signals the brain to
suppress appetite. This hormone also plays a role in determining the
onset of puberty in females: It acts on leptin receptors found on
kisspeptin-secreting neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Smith et al.,
2006). In response to the gonadotropic hormones (usually called
gonadotropins) the gonads secrete steroid sex hormones. The ovaries
produce estradiol, one of a class of hormones known as estrogens. The
testes produce testosterone, an androgen. Both types of glands also
produce a

small amount of the primary hormones of the other sex. The gonadal
steroids affect many parts of the body. Both estradiol and androgens
initiate closure of the growing portions of the bones to end skeletal
growth. In females, estradiol also causes breast development, uterine
lining growth, changes in body fat distribution, and female genitalia
maturation. In males, androgens stimulate growth of facial, axillary
(underarm), and pubic hair; lower the voice; alter the hairline on the
head (often causing baldness later in life); stimulate muscular
development; and cause genital growth. This description leaves out two
of the female secondary characteristics: axillary and pubic hair. These
characteristics are produced not by estradiol but rather by ­androgens
secreted by the cortex of the adrenal glands. Even a male who is
castrated before puberty (whose testes are removed) will grow axillary
and pubic hair, stimulated by his own adrenal androgens. Flexibility in
the expression of some of the secondary sex characteristics remains
throughout life. If a genetically male individual is treated with an
estrogen (for example, to control an ­androgen-dependent tumor), the
person will grow breasts, and the facial hair will become finer and
softer. However, the person's voice will remain low, because the
enlargement of the larynx is permanent. Conversely, a genetically female
individual who receives high levels of an androgen (usually from a tumor
that secretes androgens) will grow a beard, and their voice will become
lower. A list of the principal sex hormones and examples of their
effects are presented in Table 10.2. Note that some of the effects
included here are discussed later in this chapter.

LO 10.3

Describe gamete production and fertilization.

Gametes are produced through meiosis, a cell division process that
results in cells that contain one member of each pair of chromosomes.
During fertilization, a single sperm and ovum join, sharing their 23
single chromosomes to reconstitute the 23 pairs.

Development of the Sex Organs LO 10.2

Explain how gonads, internal sex organs, and external genitalia develop.

Compare organizational and activational effects of hormones on primary
and secondary sex characteristics.

Masculinization and defeminization are referred to as organizational
effects of hormones; activational effects occur later in development, at
around the time of puberty and throughout adulthood. Organizational
effects impact the initial development of sex organs and genitalia
(primary sex characteristics that are present at birth). Activational
effects occur at puberty as a result of mature gonads that produce sex
hormones.

The SRY gene controls the development of testes from undifferentiated
gonads. Without this gene, ovaries develop. Organizational effects of
hormones control the development of internal sex organs. The Y
chromosome controls the development of glands that produce male sex
hormones, which cause the development of the Wolffian system. Without
exposure to these hormones, the Müllerian system develops. In the
presence of dihydrotestosterone, male external genitalia develop.
Without exposure to this hormone, female genitalia develop.

Thought Question

Control of Sexual Behavior by Hormones and Pheromones

The primary feature that distinguishes menstrual cycles from estrous
cycles is the monthly growth and loss of the lining of the uterus. The
other features are approximately the same, except that the estrous cycle
of other mammals can be shorter. For example, the estrous cycle of rats
is 4 days. Also, the sexual behavior of other female mammals with
estrous cycles is linked to ovulation, whereas most female primates can
engage in sexual behavior at any time during their menstrual cycle.
Menstrual cycles and estrous cycles consist of a sequence of events that
are controlled by hormonal secretions of the pituitary gland and
ovaries. These glands interact, with the secretions of one affecting
those of the other. A cycle begins with the secretion of gonadotropins
by the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones (especially FSH)
stimulate the growth of ovarian follicles, small spheres of epithelial
cells surrounding each ovum. Women usually produce one ovarian follicle
each month. If two are produced and fertilized, dizygotic (fraternal)
twins will develop. Monozygotic (identical) twins develop from the same
ovum and follicle. As ovarian follicles mature, they secrete estradiol,
which causes growth of the lining of the uterus in preparation for
implantation of the ovum, if it is fertilized by a sperm. Feedback from
the increasing level of estradiol eventually triggers the release of a
surge of

As you have read, hormones have organizational and activational effects
on the internal sex organs, genitals, and secondary sex characteristics.
All of these effects influence a person's behavior by interacting
directly with the nervous system. This module considers how some of
these hormones affect female reproductive cycles, sexual behavior of
laboratory animals, organizational effects of androgens, and human
sexual behavior. This module also includes a discussion of a closely
related topic---pheromones.

Hormonal Control of Female Reproductive Cycles LO 10.4

Summarize the roles of hormones in phases of the menstrual cycle.

The reproductive cycle of female primates is called a menstrual cycle.
Females of other species of mammals also have reproductive cycles,
called estrous cycles.

Techniques exist that can separate X- and Y-bearing sperm. This
technology could be used selectively to reduce the likelihood that a
fetus will inherit a deleterious gene, or to determine the genetic sex
of an offspring. Use of these techniques has sparked medical, ethical,
and legal debates about its use. In addition to chromosomes, what other
factors are involved in a person's sexual development?

LH by the anterior pituitary gland. Figure 10.6 shows how the uterine
changes correspond with hormone changes. The LH surge causes ovulation:
The ovarian follicle ruptures, releasing the ovum. Under the continued
influence of LH, the ruptured ovarian follicle becomes a corpus luteum,
which produces estradiol and progesterone. (Look again at Figure 10.6.)
Progesterone promotes pregnancy (gestation) by maintaining the lining of
the uterus and inhibiting the ovaries from producing another follicle.
Meanwhile, the ovum enters one of the fallopian tubes and begins its
progress toward the uterus. If it meets sperm cells during its travel
down the fallopian tube and becomes fertilized, it begins to divide, and
several days later it will implant itself into the uterine wall. If the
ovum is not fertilized or if it is fertilized too late to develop
sufficiently by the time it gets to the uterus, the corpus luteum will
stop producing estradiol and progesterone, and then the lining of the
walls of the uterus will be shed. At this point, menstruation will
begin.

Hormonal Control of Sexual Behavior of Laboratory Animals LO 10.5

Compare the roles of hormones in sexual behavior of male and female
rodents.

The interactions between sex hormones and the human brain can be
difficult to study. As a result, researchers often turn to two sources
of information: experiments with

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 310

28 days

animals and various developmental disorders in humans. We will first
consider the evidence gathered from research with laboratory animals.
The sexual behavior of rats has been studied more than that of any other
laboratory animal (Hull & Dominguez, 2007). When a male rat encounters a
receptive female, he will spend some time nuzzling her and sniffing and
licking her genitals, mount her, and engage in pelvic thrusting
(rhythmic movement of the hindquarters, causing genital friction). He
will mount her several times, achieving intromission (entry of the penis
into the female's vagina) on most of the mountings. After several
intromissions, the male will ejaculate (discharge semen). After
ejaculating, the male refrains from sexual activity for a period of time
(minutes, in the rat). Most mammals will return to copulate several
times, finally showing a longer pause, called a refractory period.
Sexual behavior of male rodents depends on testosterone, a fact that has
long been recognized (Bermant & Davidson, 1974). If a male rat is
castrated (its testes are removed), his sexual activity eventually
ceases. However, the behavior can be reinstated by injections of
testosterone. The neural basis of this activational effect will be
described later in this chapter. Other hormones play a role in male
sexual behavior. Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the posterior
pituitary gland that contracts the milk ducts and causes milk

Reproductive and Parental Behavior

ejection in lactating females. It is also produced in males, where it
plays no role in lactation. Oxytocin is released at the time of orgasm
in both males and females and appears to contribute to the contractions
of the smooth muscle in the male ejaculatory system and of the vagina
and uterus in females (Carmichael et al., 1987; Carter, 1992). The
effects of oxytocin release can be seen in lactating women, who may
release some milk at the time of orgasm. Oxytocin plays an important
role in establishing pair bonds, a phenomenon that will be discussed
later in this chapter. FEMALES Female mammals also display a variety of
sexual behaviors. In some rodent species, such as hamsters, the female
adopts a posture that exposes her genitals to the male during a
receptive period in the estrous cycle, called estrus. This behavior is
called the lordosis response. The four phases of the rat estrous cycle
(estrus, metestrus, diestrus, and proestrus), along with their
corresponding hormone levels, are presented in Figure 10.7. Notice the
similarities and differences in this cycle compared to the human
menstrual cycle. Female rodents are very active in initiating
copulation. If a male attempts to copulate with a nonreceptive rodent,
the female will either leave the male or rebuff him. When the female is
in a receptive state, she will often approach the male, nuzzle him,
sniff his genitals, and show behaviors characteristic of her species.
For example, a ­ receptive ­ female rat will exhibit quick, short, hopping
movements and rapid ear wiggling, which most male rats appear to find
irresistible (McClintock & Adler, 1978). Sexual behavior of female
rodents depends on the gonadal hormones present during estrus: estradiol
and

311

progesterone. In rats, estradiol increases about 40 hours before the
female becomes receptive; just before receptivity occurs, the corpus
luteum begins secreting large quantities of progesterone (Feder, 1981).
Ovariectomized rats (rats whose ovaries have been removed) are not
sexually receptive. Although sexual receptivity can be produced in
ovariectomized rodents by administering large doses of estradiol alone,
the most effective treatment duplicates the normal sequence of hormones:
a small amount of estradiol, followed by progesterone. Progesterone
alone is ineffective and requires estradiol to "prime" its
effectiveness. Priming with estradiol takes about 16--24 hours, after
which an injection of progesterone produces receptive behaviors within
an hour (Takahashi, 1990). This pattern of estradiol "priming" followed
by progesterone results in sexual receptivity. The neural mechanisms
responsible for these effects will be described later in this chapter.
Studies with targeted mutations confirm the importance of estradiol and
progesterone on sexual behavior in female rodents. Rissman and
colleagues (1997) found that female mice without estrogen receptors were
unreceptive to males even after treatment with estradiol and
progesterone, and Lydon and colleagues (1995) observed similar effects
in female mice without progesterone receptors. The sequence of estradiol
followed by progesterone has three effects on female rats: It increases
their receptivity, increases their proceptivity, and increases their
attractiveness. Receptivity refers to a female's ability and willingness
to copulate by displaying lordosis when a male attempts to mount her.
Proceptivity refers to a female's interest in copulation, as shown by
seeking out a male and engaging in behaviors that tend to increase

Figure 10.7 Comparison of Menstrual Cycle of Humans and Estrous Cycle of

    each approximately 1 day long. Ovulation occurs during the estrus

Attractiveness refers to physiological and behavioral changes in the
female that affect the male. The male rat (along with many other male
mammals) is most responsive to females who are in the estrus phase of
the estrous cycle ("in heat"). Male rodents will ignore a female whose
ovaries have been removed, but injections of estradiol and progesterone
will restore her attractiveness (and also change her behavior toward the
male). The stimuli that increase a male rat's sexual interest include
her odor and her behavior. In some species, visible changes, such as
swollen skin in the genital region of a female monkey, are other
examples of attractivness.

Organizational Effects of Androgens on Behavior: Masculinization and
Defeminization LO 10.6

Contrast behavioral masculinization and defeminization in rodents.

If a rodent's brain is not exposed to androgens during a critical period
of development, the animal will engage in female sexual behavior as an
adult (if the animal is then given estradiol and progesterone). This
critical time comes shortly after birth for rats and for several other
species of rodents that are born in a rather immature condition. For
example, if a male rat is castrated immediately after birth, permitted
to grow to adulthood, and then given injections of estradiol and
progesterone, it will respond to the presence of another male by
displaying female-like behavior and lordosis (Blaustein & Olster, 1989).
In contrast, if a rodent brain is exposed to androgens during
development, two phenomena occur: behavioral defeminization and
behavioral masculinization. Behavioral defeminization refers to the
organizational effect of androgens that prevents the animal from
displaying female sexual behavior in adulthood. As we will see later,
this effect is accomplished by suppressing the development of neural
circuits controlling female sexual behavior. For example, if a female
rodent is ovariectomized and given an injection of testosterone
immediately after birth, she will not respond to a male rat when, as an
adult, she is given injections of estradiol and progesterone. Behavioral
masculinization refers to the organizational effect of androgens that
enables animals to engage in male sexual behavior in adulthood. This
effect is accomplished by stimulating the development of neural circuits
controlling male sexual behavior. For example, if the female rodent in
the previous example is given testosterone in adulthood rather than
estradiol and progesterone, she will mount and attempt to copulate with
a

to specific studies.) (See Figure 10.8.) Although much of the research
on organizational effects of androgens has focused on the time period
around birth, some researchers have suggested that the window for
organizational effects extends from the time of birth until puberty.
Organizational effects differ from the activational effects of hormones
at puberty because the organizational effects are relatively permanent
and are retained, even if the hormones are no longer present. Although
the brain's sensitivity to testosterone exposure decreases through the
period of time leading up to puberty, it is still responsive to
organizational effects (Schulz et al., 2009; see Figure 10.10).

Human Sexual Behavior LO 10.7

Compare the activational effects of hormones on sexual behavior in men
and women.

Human sexual behavior, like that of other mammals, is influenced by
activational effects of gonadal hormones and, almost certainly, by
organizational effects as well. If hormones have organizational effects
on human sexual behavior, they must exert these effects by affecting
brain development. Although there is good evidence that prenatal
androgen exposure affects human brain development, the consequences of
this exposure are not yet fully understood. The evidence pertaining to
these issues is discussed later, in a module on sexual orientation.

female mammals other than higher primates is controlled by the ovarian
hormones estradiol and progesterone. (In some species, such as cats and
rabbits, only estradiol is necessary.) As Wallen (1990) points out, the
ovarian hormones control not only the interest of an estrous female in
mating but also her ability to mate. Female rodents do not engage in
lordosis outside of estrus, making copulation impossible outside of
estrus. The evolutionary process in rats seems to have selected animals
that mate only at a time when the female is able to become pregnant. In
higher primates (including our own species) the ability to engage in
sexual behavior is not controlled by ovarian hormones. There are no
physical barriers to sexual intercourse during any part of the menstrual
cycle. Although ovarian hormones do not solely control women's sexual
activity, they may influence women's sexual interest, behavior, and
physiology. For example, women report increased sexual behavior during
the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle (Wilcox et al., 2004). Whether
women experience obvious physical changes during the fertile period of
their menstrual cycle is currently being investigated. Roberts and
colleagues (2004) took photos of women's faces during fertile and
nonfertile phases of their menstrual cycle and found that both men and
women judged the photos taken during the fertile period to be more
attractive than those taken during a nonfertile period. (See Figure
10.9.) Other studies have found greater attractiveness ratings for
women's face shape (Oberzaucher et al., 2012), voices (Pipitone &
Gallup, 2008), body odors (Kuukasjärvi et al., 2004), and gait (Provost
et al., 2008) during fertile phases. In addition, women's attraction to
male features appears to vary across the menstrual cycle, as do other
physiological measures, odors, voice, and behaviors. Research has begun
to investigate the interactions between behaviors and physiology of
pair-bonded couples, which also seem to vary across fertile and
nonfertile phases of the menstrual cycle (for review, see Gangestad &
Haselton, 2015). Other research has found increased flirting behavior by
women in the fertile phase, but this behavior is directed toward
potential partners the women preferred for shortterm, rather than
long-term, relationships (for a clever research design, see Cantú et
al., 2014). A study of lesbian couples (whose menstrual cycles and
fluctuations in ovarian hormones are likely to be synchronized) found a
significant increase in sexual interest and activity during the middle
portions of the women's cycles (Matteo & Rissman, 1984), which suggests
that ovarian hormones can influence women's sexual interest. A study of
heterosexual partners by Van Goozen and colleagues (1997) supports this
suggestion. The investigators found that the sexual activity initiated
by men and women showed very different relationships to the

08/11/2021 20:14

314 Chapter 10 woman's menstrual cycle (and hence to her level of
ovarian ­hormones). Men initiated sexual activity at about the same rate
throughout a woman's cycle, whereas sexual activity initiated by women
showed a peak around the time of ovulation, when estradiol levels are
highest. (See Figure 10.11.) Similarly, Bullivant and colleagues (2004)
found that women were more likely to initiate sexual activity and were
more likely to engage in sexual fantasies just before and during the
surge in luteinizing hormone that stimulates ovulation. Wallen (2001)
points out that although ovarian hormones may affect a woman's sexual
interest, her behavior is influenced by other factors as well. For
example, if a woman does not want to become pregnant and does not have
absolute confidence in her method of birth control, she may avoid sexual
intercourse at midcycle, around the time of ovulation---even if her
potential sexual interest is at a peak. In fact, Harvey (1987) found
that women were more likely to engage in autosexual activity at this
time. On the other hand, women who want to become pregnant are more
likely to initiate sexual intercourse during the time when they are most
likely to conceive. A review by Gangestad and Thornhill (2008) suggests
that women's interest in sexual partners changes across the menstrual
cycle in a particular way. Women do not become indiscriminately more
interested in sexual contact during their fertile period, which occurs
around the time of ovulation. Instead, because they are more likely to
become pregnant if they engage in unprotected sex at that time, they
become more selective in mate choice. In particular, they become more
attracted to characteristics that might indicate high genetic quality
(or did so in the evolution of our species). For example, Gangestad and
Thornhill note that

studies have shown that at midcycle, women's preference increases for
the sight of facial and bodily masculinity, for masculine behavioral
displays, for masculine vocal qualities, for androgen-related scents,
and for body symmetry, which correlates with genetic fitness. These
changes may be irrelevant for women in monogamous relationships who have
already chosen their partners, or for women using hormone-based
contraceptives such as birth control pills, which stabilize levels of
circulating hormones. Changes in interest in sexual partners across
fertile and nonfertile periods is pronounced in female chimpanzees
(Stumpf & Boesch, 2005). During their nonfertile periods, female
chimpanzees initiate sexual activity with many males in their group.
However, during their period of peak fertility, they become much more
selective and tend to mate with the same few males---presumably, those
that showed the most promise of being able to supply good genes for
their offspring. Several studies suggest that women's sexual interest
can be stimulated by androgens. There are two primary sources of
androgens in the female body: the ovaries and the adrenal glands. The
primary ovarian sex steroids are estradiol and progesterone, but these
glands also produce testosterone. The adrenal glands produce another
androgen, androstenedione, along with other adrenocortical steroids.
However, the available evidence indicates that androgens by themselves
(in the absence of estradiol) do not directly stimulate women's sexual
interest but appear to amplify the effects of estradiol. For example,
Shifren and colleagues (2000) studied women aged 31--56 who had their
ovaries removed and were receiving estrogen-replacement therapy. The
women were given either a placebo or testosterone, delivered through
transdermal patches. Although the estrogen replacement plus placebo
produced a positive effect, the addition of testosterone produced an
even greater increase in sexual activity and rate of orgasm: The
percentage of women who had sex fantasies, masturbated, and had
intercourse increased two to three times over baseline levels, and these
women reported higher levels of well-being. ACTIVATIONAL EFFECTS OF SEX
HORMONES IN MEN Although women and mammals with estrous cy-

cles differ in their behavioral responsiveness to sex hormones, men more
closely resemble other mammals in their behavioral responsiveness to
testosterone. Without testosterone, sperm production and sexual interest
cease. In a double-blind study, Bagatell and colleagues (1994) gave a
placebo or a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist to male
volunteers to suppress secretion of testicular androgens. Within 2
weeks, the participants who received the GnRH antagonist reported a
decrease in sexual interest, sexual fantasy, and intercourse. Men who
received replacement doses of testosterone along with the antagonist did
not show these changes.

Reproductive and Parental Behavior

Effects of Pheromones LO 10.8

Describe the roles of pheromones in reproductive behavior.

Hormones transmit messages from one part of the body (the secreting
gland) to another (the target tissue). Another class of chemicals,
called pheromones, carries messages from one animal to another.
Pheromones are released by one animal and directly affect the physiology
or behavior

30 % Change in testosterone over baseline

Declining sexual activity after castration is variable however. As
reported by Money and Ehrhardt (1972), some men decrease sexual activity
immediately, whereas others show a slow, gradual decline over several
years. Wallen and his colleagues (Wallen et al., 1991; Wallen, 2001)
injected a GnRH antagonist in seven adult male rhesus monkeys that were
part of a larger group. The injection suppressed testosterone secretion,
and sexual behavior declined after 1 week. However, the decline was
related to the animal's social rank and sexual experience: More sexually
experienced, high-ranking males continued to copulate. In fact, the
­highest-ranking male continued to copulate and ejaculate at the same
rate as before receiving the antagonist, even though his testosterone
secretion was suppressed for almost 8 weeks. The mounting behavior of
the lowest-ranking monkey completely ceased and did not resume until t­
estosterone secretion recovered from the anti-GnRH treatment.
Testosterone not only affects sexual activity but also is affected by
it---or even by thinking about it. This effect occurs in both men and
women. Among men, anecdotal accounts of changes related to increased
testosterone in anticipation of seeing a partner after a separation
suggests this pattern; however, testosterone changes in response to
viewing sexual content are mixed (reviewed in Goldey & van Anders,
2015). In rodents, LH and testosterone release can be classically
conditioned in anticipation of sexual activity (Graham & Desjardins,
1980). Women can experience increased testosterone level in anticipation
of sexual activity. Researchers have reported increases in women's
testosterone levels before sexual activities (compared to control
activities; van Anders et al., 2007). Hamilton and Meston (2010) studied
women in long-distance relationships who saw their romantic partners
only intermittently. The investigators found that the women's
testosterone levels in saliva increased the day before they rejoined
their partners---presumably in anticipation of their reunion. These
findings support the conclusions from previous research that
testosterone, as well as estradiol, plays a role in women's sexual
interest and activity. In another study, Goldey and van Anders (2011)
found that imagining a positive sexual encounter with an attractive
person increased testosterone levels among women, but only those not
taking hormone contraceptives. (See Figure 10.12.)

of another. In mammalian species most pheromone communication occurs via
specialized receptors that detect the presence of pheromone molecules,
similar to olfaction. Some of these chemicals, like hormones, affect
reproductive behavior. As you learned in Chapter 7, detecting odors is
accomplished by the olfactory bulbs, which constitute the primary
olfactory system. However, many of the effects that pheromones have on
reproductive cycles are mediated by another sensory organ---the
vomeronasal organ (VNO)--- which consists of a small group of sensory
receptors arranged around a pouch connected by a duct to the nasal
passage. The VNO, which is present in all orders of mammals except for
cetaceans (whales and dolphins), projects to the accessory olfactory
bulb, located immediately behind the olfactory bulb (Wysocki, 1979).
(See Figure 10.13.) The VNO contains over 200 G-protein-linked receptor
molecules that detect many of the chemicals that serve as

316 Chapter 10 pheromones (Dulac & Axel, 1995; Ryba & Tirindelli, 1997;
Stowers & Marton, 2005). These receptor molecules are only distantly
related to the ones present in the olfactory epithelium. The accessory
olfactory bulb sends axons to the medial nucleus of the amygdala, which
in turn projects to the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus and to
the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. (As you learned in Chapter
7, so does the main olfactory bulb.) The neural circuit responsible for
the effects of pheromones appears to involve these regions. As we will
see, the preoptic area, the medial amygdala, the ventromedial nucleus of
the hypothalamus, and the medial preoptic area all play important roles
in reproductive behavior. (See Figure 10.14.) ANIMAL EXAMPLES Although
the VNO can respond to some airborne molecules, it is primarily
sensitive to nonvolatile compounds found in urine or other substances
(Brennan & Keverne, 2004). Luo and colleagues (2003) found that neurons
of the vomeronasal system responded only when mice were actively
investigating another animal's face or anogenital region. The neurons
selectively responded to different strains of mice and between male and
female mice.

In related research, He and colleagues (2008) investigated cells of the
mouse VNO and reported that although many neurons were activated by
mouse urine, only two or three responded uniquely to urine from males,
and approximately eight responded uniquely to urine from females. It
seems, then, that a small number of receptors are tuned specifically to
chemicals secreted by males or females. Urine from different individuals
produced different patterns of activity of large numbers of neurons,
undoubtedly reflecting the existence of different concentrations of
large numbers of chemicals in the animals' urine. The VNO is essential
for the ability of a rodent to identify the sex of another individual.
Normally, when a male mouse smells another mouse, he approaches and
sniffs the other mouse's face and anogenital region. In mammals,
pheromones are found in urine, vaginal secretions, saliva, and tears.
This investigatory behavior permits the animal to detect nonvolatile
chemicals secreted by the other animal. If the other animal is a female
in estrus, the male courts and mates with her. If it is an unfamiliar
male, he attacks it. If it is a familiar male (say, one of its
littermates), he will usually tolerate its presence. The main olfactory
system stimulates investigatory behavior when the presence of another
mouse is detected, and information provided by the vomeronasal system
determines the gender, estrous condition, and identity of the other
animal. Without the information from the VNO, the animal
indiscriminately displays sexual behavior. In contrast, if a male mouse
is made anosmic (incapable of detecting odors) by removing the olfactory
bulbs, by a genetic knockout that prevents transducing olfactory
information in the main olfactory epithelium, or by applying a chemical
that damages olfactory receptors, he will not approach and sniff another
mouse and, consequently, will not attack or attempt to mate with it
(Mandiyan et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2006). If transduction of chemical
information in the VNO is prevented by a knockout of a gene required for
this process (TRPC2), mice can no longer distinguish between males and
females (Stowers et al., 2002). The males of some species produce
sex-attractant pheromones that affect the behavior of females. For
example, a pheromone present in the saliva of boars (male pigs) elicits
sexual behavior in sows. This response persists even after the sow's VNO
is destroyed, which suggests that the main olfactory system can detect
the pheromone and elicit the behavior (Dorries et al., 1997). Other male
pheromones that attract females are also detected by the main olfactory
system. For example, Mak and colleagues (2007) found that the odor of
soiled bedding taken from the cage of a male mouse activated neurons in
the main olfactory system and hippocampus of female mice. The odor even
stimulated neurogenesis (production of new neurons). The researchers
found new neurons in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus.

08/11/2021 20:14

Reproductive and Parental Behavior

Moreover, bedding from cages of dominant males stimulated neurogenesis
more effectively than did bedding from subordinate males. Pheromones can
affect reproductive physiology or behavior in several ways. When groups
of female mice are housed together, their estrous cycles slow down and
eventually stop. This phenomenon is known as the LeeBoot effect (van der
Lee & Boot, 1955). If groups of females are exposed to the pheromones of
a male (or of his urine), they begin cycling again, and their cycles
tend to be synchronized. This phenomenon is known as the Whitten effect
(Whitten, 1959). The Vandenbergh effect (Vandenbergh et al., 1975) is
the acceleration of the onset of puberty in a female rodent caused by
the pheromone of a male. Both the Whitten effect and the Vandenbergh
effect are caused by a group of compounds that are present only in the
urine of intact adult males (Ma et al., 1999; Novotny et al., 1999). The
urine of a juvenile or castrated male will not produce these effects.
The production of the pheromone by a male requires the presence of
testosterone. The Bruce effect (Bruce, 1960) occurs when a recently
impregnated female mouse encounters a male mouse other than the one with
which she mated, and the pregnancy is aborted. This effect, too, is
caused by a substance secreted in the urine of intact males---but not of
males that have been castrated. In this way, a male mouse that
encounters a pregnant female is able to prevent the birth of offspring
carrying another male's genes and subsequently mate with the female
himself. This phenomenon may be advantageous from the female's (and new
male's) point of view. The fact that the new male has managed to take
over the old male's territory indicates that he is likely to be
healthier. Therefore, his genes will contribute to offspring that are
more likely to survive. (See Table 10.3.) HUMAN EXAMPLES The topic of
human pheromones has generated a great deal of debate and critique of
the available evidence. After reading about the examples summarized
here, what will you conclude about the strength of the evidence for
active human pheromones?

It appears that at least some pheromone-related phenomena can occur in
humans. Early research in this area revealed that women who spend a
large amount of time together tend to have menstrual cycles that are
synchronized by pheromones (McClintock, 1971; Russell et al., 1980).
These results were confirmed by Stern and McClintock (1998), who found
that compounds from the armpits of women that were collected around the
time of ovulation lengthened other women's menstrual cycles, and
compounds collected late in the cycle shortened them. Preti and
colleagues (2003) performed a similar experiment but exposed women to
extracts of sweat collected from men. They found that the extract (but
not a placebo) advanced the onset of the next pulse of the women's LH
secretion, reduced tension, and increased relaxation. Several studies
have found that compounds present in human sweat have different effects
in men and women. Singh and Bronstad (2001) had men smell T-shirts that
had been worn by women for several days. The men reported that shirts
worn by women during the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle smelled
more pleasant and more attractive than those worn during the nonfertile
phase. Jacob and McClintock (2000) found that the androgenic chemical
androstadienone (AND), found in men's sweat, increases alertness and
positive mood in women but decreases positive mood in men. Wyart and
colleagues (2007) found that women who smelled AND showed higher levels
of cortisol (an adrenal hormone involved in a variety of emotional
behaviors) and reported a more positive mood and an increase in sexual
arousal. Saxton and colleagues (2008) applied a solution containing AND
or a placebo to women's upper lips and then had them participate in a
"speeddating" event organized by a private agency at a local bar. During
the event, the women met and talked with several men, one at a time, for
3 minutes each. Afterward, the women were asked to rate the men's
attractiveness. Most of the women exposed to AND found the men they met
to be more attractive. In another line of human pheromone research, men
show a brain response to a chemical found in women's urine. A
functional-imaging study by Savic and colleagues (2001) found that the
estrogenic chemical estratetraene (EST) activated the paraventricular
nucleus and dorsomedial hypothalamus in men but not in women. Sweat and
urine might not be the only vehicles for pheromone communication in
humans. Research has investigated hand shaking and the potential for
pheromonemediated communication via this behavior (Frumin et al., 2015).
Some research has even sought to address the presence and effects of
pheromones found in tears derived from emotion (but not an irritant, or
saline control condition). So far, results of these investigations have
yielded potentially conflicting results, and additional research and
replication

will be needed to clarify the extent of pheromone production in various
secretions of the human body (Gelstein et al., 2011; Gračanin et al.,
2016; Sobel, 2017). What sensory organ detects the presence of human
pheromones? Although humans have a small VNO located along the nasal
septum (bridge of tissue between the nostrils) approximately 2 cm from
the opening of the nostril (GarciaVelasco & Mondragon, 1991), the human
VNO is generally thought to be a vestigial, nonfunctional organ. The
density of neurons in the VNO is very sparse, and investigators have not
found any neural connections from this organ to the brain (Doty, 2001).
Evidence suggests that human reproductive physiology is affected by
pheromones, but these chemical signals may be detected by the "standard"
olfactory s­ ystem--- the receptor cells in the olfactory
epithelium---and not by cells in the VNO. In support of this conclusion,
Savic and colleagues (2009) found that EST activated the brains of men
with intact olfactory systems, but not those of men whose olfactory
epithelium had been destroyed by nasal polyps but whose VNOs were
intact. Other researchers have suggested that a different class of
receptors, the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) may be
responsible for pheromone detection in some species. TAARs in the
epithelium of the mouse olfactory system are sensitive to amines in
mouse urine that may function as pheromones (Liberles & Buck, 2006).
(See Figure 10.15.) Some TAARs are exceptionally sensitive to stimuli,
making them an interesting target for future research in this area
(Zhang et al., 2013). TAARs have been identified in human epithelium
(Carnicelli et al., 2010); however, more research is needed to fully
understand their functions.

Hormonal Control of Female Reproductive Cycles

Hormonal Control of Sexual Behavior of Laboratory Animals

LO 10.4

LO 10.5

Summarize the roles of hormones in phases of the menstrual cycle.

The menstrual cycle begins with the maturation of one or more ovarian
follicles, which occurs in response to the secretion of FSH by the
anterior pituitary gland. As the ovarian follicle matures, it secretes
estradiol, which causes the lining of the uterus to develop. When
estradiol reaches a critical level, it causes the pituitary gland to
secrete a surge of LH, triggering ovulation. The empty ovarian follicle
becomes a corpus luteum, under the ­continued influence of LH, and
secretes estradiol and progesterone. If pregnancy does not occur, the
corpus luteum stops producing hormones, and ­menstruation begins.

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 318

Compare the roles of hormones in sexual behavior of male and female
rodents.

Sexual behavior of male rodents depends on testosterone. Sexual behavior
of female rodents depends on estradiol and progesterone. In rats, after
being primed with estradiol, progesterone levels increase just before
the onset of the receptive period. Both estradiol and progesterone are
low in the estrus phase, and then increase moderately in the metestrus
phase before decreasing again in diestrus. Both of these hormones
increase more in the proestrus phase, which ends with ovulation. Levels
of both hormones decline after ovulation and return to estrus levels.
Oxytocin is released at the time of orgasm in both males and females and
appears to contribute to the contractions of the smooth muscle in the
male ejaculatory system and of the vagina and uterus.

Organizational Effects of Androgens on Behavior: Masculinization and
Defeminization

Effects of Pheromones

LO 10.6

Pheromones are chemicals that signal information among members of the
same species. They are detected by receptors in the vomeronasal organ of
some species and convey information about an animal's sex, estrous
condition, and identity. Odorants present in the urine of female mice
affect their estrous cycles, lengthening and eventually stopping them
(the Lee-Boot effect). Odorants present in the urine of male mice
abolish these effects and cause the females' cycles to become
synchronized (the Whitten effect). (Phenomena similar to the Lee-Boot
effect and the Whitten effect also occur in women.) Odorants can also
accelerate the onset of puberty in females (the Vandenbergh effect). In
addition, the odor of the urine from a male other than the one that
impregnated a female mouse will cause her to abort (the Bruce effect).
Pheromones appear to play a role in human behavior, and may influence
menstrual cycles, mood, changes in attractiveness ratings, and brain
activity.

Contrast behavioral masculinization and defeminization in rodents.

In response to prenatal androgen exposure, behavioral defeminization
occurs and inhibits female sexual behavior in adulthood. Behavioral
masculinization enables individuals to engage in male sexual behavior in
adulthood.

Human Sexual Behavior LO 10.7

Compare the activational effects of hormones on sexual behavior in men
and women.

Testosterone has an activational effect on the sexual behavior of men.
Women do not require estradiol or progesterone to experience sexual
interest or to engage in sexual behavior. Some research suggests
proceptivity may be related to ovarian hormones, even in higher
primates. Studies with women suggest that variations in levels of
ovarian hormones across the menstrual cycle affect sexual interest but
that other factors (such as initiation of sexual activity by partners or
a desire to avoid or attain pregnancy) can also affect sexual behavior.
The presence of androgens may facilitate the effect of e­ stradiol on
women's sexual interest.

Neural Control of Sexual Behavior The control of sexual behavior---at
least in laboratory ­animals---involves different neural mechanisms in
males and females. This module describes these mechanisms.

Male Sexual Behavior LO 10.9

Identify the role of spinal and brain mechanisms in male sexual
behavior.

Both spinal and brain mechanisms are important in the neural control of
male sexual behavior. These mechanisms coordinate to control male sexual
posturing, erection, and ejaculation. Erection and ejaculation are
controlled by circuits of neurons that reside in the lumbar section of
the spinal cord in rats (Coolen et al., 2004; Coolen, 2005) and humans
(Chéhensse et al., 2017). These circuits are called the spinal
ejaculation generator. However, brain mechanisms have both excitatory
and inhibitory control of these circuits. The medial preoptic area

just rostral to the hypothalamus, is the forebrain region most critical
for male sexual behavior. (As we will see later in this chapter, it is
also critical for other behavior, including maternal behavior.)
Electrical stimulation of this region elicits male copulatory behavior
(Malsbury, 1971), and sexual activity increases the firing rate of
single neurons in the MPA (Mas, 1995; Shimura et al., 1994). In
addition, the act of copulation activates neurons in the MPA (Oaknin et
al., 1989; Robertson et al., 1991; Wood & Newman, 1993). Dominguez, Gil,
and Hull (2006) found that mating increased the release of glutamate in
the MPA and that infusion of glutamate into the MPA increased the
frequency of ejaculation. Will and colleagues (2017) report increases in
glutamate as well as dopamine, in the MPA following sexual activity.
Finally, destruction of the MPA abolishes male sexual behavior (Heimer &
Larsson, 1966/1967). The organizational effects of androgens are
responsible for changes in brain structure. Gorski and colleagues (1978)
discovered a nucleus within the MPA of the rat that is three to seven
times larger in males than in females. This area is called the sexually
dimorphic nucleus (SDN) of the preoptic area.

08/11/2021 20:14

320 Chapter 10 (This brain region, which is called the uncinate nucleus
in humans, is sexually dimorphic in our species as well and corresponds
with gender identity.) The size of this nucleus is controlled by the
amount of androgens present during fetal development. According to Rhees
and colleagues (1990a, 1990b), the critical period for masculinization
of the rat SDN appears to start on the eighteenth day of gestation and
end once the animals are 5 days old. (Normally, rats are born on the
twentysecond day of gestation.) De Jonge and colleagues (1989) found
that lesions of the rat SDN decrease masculine sexual behavior in rats.
(See Figure 10.16.) The MPA does not act alone. It receives chemosensory
input from the vomeronasal organ through connections with the medial
amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). The MPA
also receives somatosensory information from the genitals, the central
tegmental field of the midbrain, and the medial amygdala. Androgens also
exert their activational effects on neurons in the MPA and associated
brain regions. If a male rodent is castrated in adulthood, its sexual
behavior will cease. However, the behavior can be reinstated by
implanting a small amount of testosterone directly into the MPA or in
two regions whose axons project to the MPA: the central tegmental field
and the medial amygdala (Coolen & Wood, 1999; Sipos & Nyby, 1996). Both
of these regions contain a high concentration of androgen receptors in
the male rat brain (Cottingham & Pfaff, 1986).

As we saw earlier in this chapter, the primary and accessory olfactory
systems play important roles in rodent reproductive behavior. Both of
these systems send axons to the medial nucleus of the amygdala, which in
turn sends axons to the MPA. Several studies (for example, Heeb & Yahr,
2000; Lehman & Winans, 1982) have found that ­lesions of the medial
amygdala abolished the sexual behavior of male rodents, presumably
because the lesions disrupted the activating effects of pheromones on
the MPA. The medial amygdala, like the MPA, is sexually dimorphic: One
region within this structure (which contains an especially high
concentration of androgen receptors) is 85 percent larger in male rats
than in female rats (Hines et al., 1992). The MPA also receives
somatosensory ­information from the genitals through connections with the
central tegmental field of the midbrain and the medial amygdala. The act
of copulation activates neurons in both of these ­regions (Gréco et al.,
1998). As we saw previously, the lumbar region of the spinal cord
contains a group of neurons that play a critical role in ejaculation
(Coolen et al., 2004). Anatomical tracing studies suggest that the most
important connections between the MPA and the spinal ejaculation
generator are accomplished through the ­periaqueductal gray matter (PAG)
of the midbrain and the nucleus paragigantocellularis (nPGi) of the
medulla (Marson & McKenna, 1996; Normandin & Murphy, 2008). The nPGi
normally inhibits spinal cord sexual reflexes, so one of the tasks of
the pathway originating

in the MPA is to suppress this inhibition. The MPA suppresses the nPGi
directly through an inhibitory pathway and does so indirectly by
inhibiting the activity of the PAG, which normally excites the nPGi. The
inhibitory connections between neurons of the nPGi and those of the
spinal ejaculation generator are serotonergic. As Marson and McKenna
(1992) showed, application of serotonin (5-HT) to the spinal cord
suppresses ejaculation. This connection may explain a side effect of
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Men who take SSRIs as a
treatment for depression often report that they have no trouble
attaining an erection but have difficulty achieving an ejaculation.
Presumably, the action of the drug as an agonist at the serotonergic
synapses in the spinal cord increases the inhibitory influence of nPGi
on the spinal ejaculation generator. Ejaculation is accompanied by
neural activity in many brain regions, including the junction between
the midbrain and the diencephalon, which includes the ventral tegmental
area (probably involved in the pleasurable, reinforcing effects of
orgasm), other midbrain regions, several thalamic nuclei, the lateral
putamen (part of the basal ganglia), and the cerebellum. Decreased
activity is seen in the amygdala and nearby entorhinal cortex (Holstege
et al., 2003b). The amygdala is involved in defensive behavior, fear,
and anxiety---emotions that interfere with erection and ejaculation.
Decreased amygdala activation is also seen when people who are deeply in
love see pictures of their loved one (Bartels & Zeki, 2000, 2004).
Figure 10.17 summarizes several lines of research evidence for the
neural basis for male sexual behavior.

LO 10.10 Identify the role of brain mechanisms in female sexual
behavior. Similar to males, the spinal areas involved in female sexual
behavior also span the lumbar region (Alexander et al., 2016), and
another region in the ventral forebrain plays a role in female sexual
behavior: the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH). A female
rat with bilateral lesions of the ventromedial nuclei will not display
lordosis, even if she is treated with estradiol and progesterone.
Conversely, electrical stimulation of the ­ ventromedial nucleus
facilitates female sexual behavior ­ (Pfaff & Sakuma, 1979). The medial
amygdala of males receives chemosensory information from the vomeronasal
system and somatosensory information from the genitals, and it sends
efferent axons to the medial preoptic area. These connections are found
in females as well. In addition, neurons in the medial amygdala send
efferent axons to the VMH. In fact, copulation or stimulation of the
genitals or flanks of a female rat increases the activation of neurons
in both the medial amygdala and the VMH (Pfaus et al., 1993; Tetel et
al., 1993). As we saw earlier, sexual behavior of female rats is
activated by a priming dose of estradiol, followed by progesterone. The
estrogen primes the behavior and the progesterone stimulates the sexual
behavior. Injections of these hormones directly into the VMH will
stimulate sexual behavior even in females whose ovaries have been
removed (Pleim & Barfield, 1988; Rubin & Barfield, 1980).

322 Chapter 10 If a chemical that blocks the production of progesterone
receptors is injected into the VMH, the animal's sexual behavior is
disrupted (Ogawa et al., 1994). In this way, estradiol and progesterone
exert their effects on female rodent sexual behavior by activating
neurons in this nucleus. The neurons of the ventromedial nucleus send
axons to the periaqueductal gray matter. This region, too, has been
implicated in female sexual behavior (Sakuma & Pfaff, 1979a, 1979b,
1980a, 1980b). Rose (1990) recorded from single neurons in the
ventromedial hypothalamus of freely moving female hamsters and found
that injections of progesterone (following estradiol pretreatment)
increased the activity level of these neurons, particularly when the
animals were displaying lordosis. Tetel and colleagues (1994) found that
neurons in both the VMH and the medial amygdala that showed increased
Fos production when the animal's genitals were stimulated also contained
estrogen receptors. It appears that the stimulating effects of estradiol
and genital stimulation converge on the same neurons. How does estradiol
prime a female's sensitivity to progesterone? Estradiol increases the
production of progesterone receptors, which greatly increases the
effectiveness of progesterone. Blaustein and Feder (1979) administered
estradiol to ovariectomized guinea pigs and found a 150 percent increase
in the number of progesterone receptors in the hypothalamus. Presumably,
the estradiol activates genetic mechanisms in the nucleus that are
responsible for the production of progesterone receptors.

Daniels and colleagues (1999) injected a transneuronal retrograde
tracer, pseudorabies virus, in the muscles responsible for the lordosis
response in female rats. They found that the pathway innervating these
muscles was as previous studies predicted: VMH → PAG → nPGi → motor
neurons in the ventral horn of the lumbar region of the spinal cord. As
we saw previously, the brain regions that control male genital reflexes
include the MPA, PAG, and nPGi. Researchers interested in anatomical
tracing (Marson, 1995; Marson & Murphy, 2006) found retrograde labeling
in these three brain structures (and some others as well) after
administering the retrograde tracer to the clitorises and vaginas of
female rats. It seems likely that erections of the penis and clitoris
are controlled by similar brain mechanisms. This finding is not
surprising, because these organs derive from the same embryonic tissue.
Holstege and colleagues (2003a) observed activation in the junction
between the midbrain and diencephalon, the lateral putamen, and the
cerebellum, during orgasm in women, just as was observed in men
(Holstege et al., 2003b). They also saw activation in the PAG, a
critical region for copulatory behavior in female laboratory animals.
Imaging research in women has replicated this finding and identified a
potentially wider range of brain regions involved in female orgasm,
including sensory, motor, reward, frontal cortical, and brainstem
regions (Wise et al., 2017). Figure 10.18 summarizes several lines of
research evidence for brain regions involved in neural control of female
rodent sexual behavior.

Reproductive and Parental Behavior

Formation of Pair Bonds LO 10.11 Compare the roles of oxytocin and
vasopressin in pair bonding. In approximately 5 percent of mammalian
species, individuals form monogamous, long-lasting partnerships.
Although there are diverse patterns, there is no doubt that pair bonding
occurs in some species, including our own. As naturalists and
anthropologists have pointed out, monogamy is not always exclusive: In
many species of animals, humans included, individuals sometimes cheat on
their partners. In addition, people can display serial
monogamy---intense relationships that last for a period of time, that
are replaced with similarly intense relationships with new partners.
Further reflecting the diverse patterns of pair-bonding that can occur,
members of some cultures engage in polygamy. Several laboratories have
investigated pair bonding utilizing several closely related species of
voles (small rodents that are often mistaken for mice). The different
species appear to be almost identical but they display very different
patterns of behavior. Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are
monogamous; males and females form pair bonds after mating, and the
fathers help to care for the pups. In the wild, most prairie voles whose
mates die never find another partner (Getz & Carter, 1996). Meadow voles
(Microtus pennsylvanicus) are promiscuous and polygamous; after mating,
the male leaves, and the mother cares for the pups by herself. Studies
of these vole species revealed a relationship between monogamy and the
levels of two peptides in the brain: vasopressin and oxytocin. These
compounds are both released as hormones by the posterior pituitary gland
and as neurotransmitters by neurons in the brain. In males, vasopressin
appears to play the more important role. Monogamous voles have a higher
level of V1a vasopressin receptors in the ventral forebrain than do
polygamous voles (Insel et al., 1994). This difference appears to be
responsible for the presence or absence of monogamy in the voles. Lim
and Young (2004) found that mating induced the production of Fos protein
in the ventral forebrain of male prairie voles and that an injection of
a drug that blocks V1a receptors disrupted the formation of pair bonds.
Lim and colleagues (2004) performed an even more convincing experiment.
They injected a genetically modified virus that contained the gene for
the V1a receptor into the ventral forebrain of normally polygamous male
meadow voles. This manipulation increased the synthesis of the V1a
receptor in this brain region and transformed the animal's behavior from
polygamy to monogamy. Unlike prairie voles, which spend much time in
physical contact with their partners after mating, meadow voles normally
spend little time with

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 323

323

them. Lim and colleagues found that male meadow voles with artificially
increased levels of V1a receptors spent much more time huddling side by
side with their mates. In female voles, oxytocin appears to play a more
significant role in pair bonding. Mating stimulates the release of
oxytocin, and peripheral injection of oxytocin or injection into the
cerebral ventricles facilitates pair bonding in female prairie voles
(Williams et al., 1994). In contrast, a drug that blocks oxytocin
receptors disrupts the formation of pair bonds (Cho et al., 1999). Many
investigators believe that oxytocin and vasopressin may play a role in
pair bonding in humans. For example, after intercourse, at a time when
blood levels of oxytocin are increased, people report feelings of
calmness and well-being, which are certainly compatible with the
formation of bonds with one's partner. However, it is difficult to
envision ways to perform definitive research on this topic.
Experimenters can study the effects of these hormones or their
antagonists on pair bonding in laboratory animals, but cannot do so with
humans. Studies have found, however, that oxytocin affects human social
behaviors less momentous than pair bonding. For example, Rimmele and
colleagues (2009) found that people who received an intranasal spray of
oxytocin before looking at photos of faces were more likely to remember
these faces later. The hormone had no effect on memory of photos of
nonsocial stimuli such as houses, sculptures, or landscapes. Heinrichs
and colleagues (2003) found that injections of oxytocin caused
relaxation and a reduction of anxiety in human participants. In
addition, Kosfeld and colleagues (2005) found that oxytocin increased
trust. The investigators had participants play a "trust" game, in which
they were given money, some or all of which they could give to another
player (the trustee) to invest. If the trustee made money with his
investment (all participants were male), he could share the winnings
with the first player---or he could be selfish and keep everything for
himself. Fifty minutes before the start of the game, the participants
received a nasal spray containing oxytocin or a placebo. The oxytocin
appeared to increase people's trust in other people: The participants
who received the oxytocin gave 18 percent more money to the trustees,
and they were twice as likely to give them all of their money to invest.
A second study found that oxytocin did not simply make the participants
feel more confident. The participants were no more likely to risk their
money in an investment game that did not involve other people. As
research in this area has progressed, it has become more apparent that
the effects of oxytocin are not indiscriminately prosocial. For example,
oxytocin administration increases trust, empathy, and altruism, but
often

08/11/2021 20:14

324 Chapter 10 only among group members or under specific conditions
(van Anders, 2013; Van Ijzendoorn, 2012). In some cases, oxytocin has
been associated with aggression, possibly as a means to protect in-group
members and resources, but at the cost of out-group members (Beery,
2015; De Dreu, 2015). On the other hand, oxytocin administration reduced

outgroup rejection when that behavior was promoted as a social norm
(Marsh et al., 2017). Research with oxytocin has raised many important
questions regarding the neural and neuroendocrine correlates of social
and reproductive behavior. We expect many new avenues for this research
in the future.

Module Review: Neural Control of Sexual Behavior Male Sexual Behavior LO
10.9

Identify the role of spinal and brain mechanisms in male sexual
behavior.

Sexual reflexes such as sexual posturing, erection, and ejaculation are
organized in the spinal cord. Neurons in the lumbar region of the rat
spinal cord play a critical role in triggering an ejaculation. Brain
mechanisms have excitatory and inhibitory control of the circuits
responsible for erection and ejaculation. Stimulating the MPA produces
copulatory behavior; destroying it permanently abolishes the behavior.
Damaging the SDN (part of the MPA) in laboratory animals impairs mating
behavior. Ejaculation in men is accompanied by increased behavior in the
brain's reinforcement mechanisms, several thalamic nuclei, the lateral
putamen, and the cerebellum.

Female Sexual Behavior LO 10.10 Identify the role of brain mechanisms in
female sexual behavior. The most important forebrain region for female
sexual behavior is the VMH. Destroying the VMH abolishes copulatory
behavior in rodents, and stimulating it facilitates this behavior. Both
estradiol and progesterone exert their facilitating effects on female
rodent sexual behavior in this region, and studies have confirmed the
existence of progesterone and estrogen receptors there. The priming
effect of estradiol is caused by an increase in progesterone receptors
in the VMH. The steroid sensitive neurons of the VMH send axons to the
PAG of the

Sexual Orientation Sexual orientation encompasses a long-term pattern of
emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to other individuals.
Research indicates that sexual orientation is a continuum. Examples of
sexual orientation can include gay or lesbian (having emotional,
romantic, or sexual attractions to members of one's own gender),
bisexual, polysexual or pansexual

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 324

midbrain. These neurons, through their connections with the medullary
reticular formation, control the particular responses that constitute
female sexual behavior. Orgasm in women is accompanied by increased
activity in regions similar to those activated during ejaculation in men
and the periaqueductal gray matter.

Formation of Pair Bonds LO 10.11 Compare the roles of oxytocin and
vasopressin in pair bonding. Vasopressin and oxytocin, peptides that
serve as hormones and as neurotransmitters in the brain, appear to
facilitate pair bonding. The insertion of the gene for vasopressin
receptors in the basal forebrain of polygamous male voles induces
monogamous behavior. Vasopressin plays a key role in males, and oxytocin
plays a key role in females for pair bonding. In humans, oxytocin
appears to be involved in a variety of important social behaviors.

Thought Question Using information from this chapter (particularly the
details in Figures 10.15 and 10.16), make two recommendations to an
organization working on a breeding program for an endangered rodent
species. Suggest interventions or strategies that could be used to
increase reproductive behavior in males and females. Imagine that
experts working with the organization have access to any possible
intervention (such as brain stimulation, hormone exposure, or pheromone
exposure).

(having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to people with a
variety of genders), heterosexual or straight (having emotional,
romantic, or sexual attractions to members of another gender), or
asexual (does not experience sexual attraction or has little interest in
sexual behavior) (American Psychological Association, 2008, 2020).
Evidence suggests that about 3.5 percent of the U.S. population
identifies with a sexual orientation other than heterosexual (Gates,
2011).

Reproductive and Parental Behavior

What contributes to a person's sexual orientation? Researchers once
believed that sexual orientation was determined by childhood
experiences, especially through interactions between parent and child.
Early research failed to find support for this idea (Bell et al., 1981).
Since that time, neuroscience research has revealed new biological
contributions to the development of sexual orientation, however the
factors involved in a complex phenomenon like sexual orientation are
myriad. This module will focus on what is currently understood about the
biological factors involved in sexual orientation, but it is likely only
a sampling of the many yet undiscovered interacting factors involved.
Research in this area has identified development of specific brain
structures, fraternal birth order, maternal immune sensitivity, and
heritability as some of the factors that appear to be involved in sexual
orientation. Much of the biological evidence supports a role for
organizational hormone effects, and, as you will read in this module,
most research suggests that biological factors related to sexual
orientation are at play before birth (Bogaert & Skorska, 2011;
Breedlove, 2017; Burri et al., 2011; Hines, 2011; Rahman, 2005).

Activational and Organizational Effects of Hormones LO 10.12 Compare
activational and organizational effects of hormones in sexual
orientation. What role might sex hormones play in influencing sexual
orientation? Could prenatal organizational effects or later activational
effects of sex hormones contribute to sexual orientation? It appears
that sexual orientation is not strongly related to variations in the
levels of sex hormones during adulthood in the majority of individuals.
Many studies have examined the levels of testosterone in gay and
heterosexual men and found no differences. Similarly, most studies have
found no difference in sex hormones between groups of women who are
heterosexual and those who are not. A few studies suggest that some
lesbian women have elevated levels of testosterone---but still lower
than those found in men (Meyer-Bahlburg, 1984; Hines, 2011). Men who
experience reduced testosterone in adulthood do not change their sexual
orientation, and men and women who are treated with sex hormones for
medical reasons do not change their sexual orientation, further
suggesting that exposure to hormones in adulthood is not a factor in the
development of sexual orientation (Hines, 2011). In contrast, studies of
individuals with a rare 5α-reductase deficiency syndrome suggest that
the activational effect of hormones (or at least androgens) may play a
role in both gender identity and sexual orientation in some cases. In
this disorder, individuals with an XY genotype and male sex organs are
not exposed to the high levels of androgens prenatally and therefore do
not experience

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 325

325

organizational effects of masculinization of sex organs. At puberty,
increased testosterone levels prompt activational effects and the
development of secondary sex characteristics. Until puberty, individuals
with 5α-​reductase deficiency syndrome are often raised as girls, but the
majority have a male gender identity at puberty and are sexually
attracted to women (Bramble et al., 2017; Sobel & Imperato-- McGinley,
2004). This complicated example illustrates the difficulty in
determining the roles of environmental influence, biology, and
organizational and activational effects in gender identity and sexual
orientation. Another biological contributor to sexual orientation may be
a subtle difference in brain structure caused by differences in prenatal
exposure to androgens. Prenatal exposure to sex hormones produces
permanent, organizational effects (see the "Development of Sex Organs"
section for review). The following sections describe evidence from
research concerning congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen
insensitivity, cloacal exstrophy, heritability, and prenatal factors
that suggest prenatal sex hormone exposure permanently influences brain
development and structure, resulting in later behavior related to sexual
orientation.

Role of Steroid Hormones LO 10.13 Describe examples that indicate a role
of prenatal hormone exposure in sexual orientation. Several converging
lines of evidence suggest that prenatal hormone exposure is involved in
sexual orientation. Studies involving individuals with prenatal exposure
to progesterone, elevated levels of androgens, and congenital
insensitivity to androgens have yielded some clues to the role of
steroid hormones in sexual orientation. PRENATAL PROGESTERONE EXPOSURE
Recent ­research has investigated the influence of prenatal progesterone
exposure on sexual orientation. Reinisch and colleagues (2017) surveyed
young adults who were prenatally exposed to synthetic progesterone.
Compared to a matched, nonexposed control group, significantly more
­progesterone-exposed individuals reported a "nonheterosexual
self-labeled identity" and sexual behavior that involved an individual
of the same sex. The researchers further reported that self-labeled
nonheterosexual identity was associated with increased dosage and
duration of prenatal progesterone exposure. The researchers suggest that
epigenetic mechanisms involving prenatal hormone exposure may be
involved in a complex development of sexual orientation.

Evidence suggests that prenatal hormone exposure can affect human social
behavior and sexual orientation, as well as anatomy. In a disorder known
as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH),

CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA

08/11/2021 20:14

326 Chapter 10 the adrenal glands secrete increased amounts of
androgens. The increased androgen secretion begins prenatally, and the
syndrome causes prenatal masculinization. Boys (XY chromosomes) born
with CAH experience masculinization. Girls (XX chromosomes) with CAH are
born with an enlarged clitoris and partially fused labia. CAH suggests
that the interaction between androgen exposure and chromosomes is
important in sexual orientation, as you'll read in a moment (Bramble et
al., 2017). Once diagnosed with CAH, people are typically given a
synthetic hormone to suppress excessive androgen secretion. As a group,
a larger percentage of women with CAH describe themselves as bisexual,
gay, or lesbian, compared to the general population (Bramble et al.,
2017; Cohen-Bendahan et al., 2005b). These studies provide insight into
the biological factors that may be important in sexual orientation, and
contribute to the growing list of relevant social and psychological
factors involved (Jordan-Young, 2012). Meyer-Bahlberg and colleagues
(2008) studied women with a milder form of CAH called nonclassical CAH
(NCAH). Girls born with NCAH have female genitalia at birth and do not
show signs of increased androgen levels until late childhood or
adolescence, when they receive hormones to suppress androgen secretion.
Compared to the general population, women with NCAH, like those with
CAH, are more likely to self-identify as lesbian or bisexual. Higher
androgen exposure is more likely to be associated with identifying as
lesbian. Evidence of increased androgen exposure in this population is
suggested by features impacted by androgen exposure during development:
More masculine patterns of otoacoustic emissions in the inner ear
(McFadden & Pasanen, 1999), eyeblink patterns (Rahman et al., 2003) and
length of long bones of the arms (Martin & Nguyen, 2004). Research
investigating chromosomal disorders suggests a role for chromosomes not
only in sexual development, but also in the development of gender
identity (Bramble et al., 2017). For example, about 5 percent of genetic
females with CAH identify as transgender (compared to about 0.3 percent
of individuals in the general population; Bramble et al., 2017; Dessens
et al., 2005; Gates, 2011). Studies of CAH (which exposes genetically
female fetuses to higher levels of androgens) suggest an interaction
between organizational hormone effects and chromosomal sex may play a
role in gender identity. CLOACAL EXSTROPHY Studies of genetic males with
cloacal exstrophy, who are born without a penis, further support the
conclusion that prenatal exposure to androgens contributes to a male
gender identity and a straight or heterosexual sexual orientation.
Individuals with cloacal exstrophy have XY chromosomes and are exposed
to androgens prenatally. These individuals fully develop testes but not
a penis. In the past, many individuals born

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 326

with cloacal exstrophy were raised as girls; however, approximately 50
percent of individuals with cloacal exstrophy have a male gender
identity. Individuals with cloacal exstrophy are often sexually
attracted to women (Gooren, 2006; Meyer-Bahlberg, 2005; Reiner, 2005).
ANDROGEN INSENSITIVITY SYNDROME Studies of in-

dividuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome (described in the section
on development of internal sex organs), provide a different example of
prenatal hormone exposure and its relationship to sexual orientation. It
was previously reported that individuals with this syndrome are often,
though not always, attracted to male partners (Wisniewski et al., 2000).
Recent research has called this conclusion into question, and emphasizes
the importance of improved understanding of the interactions between
prenatal androgen exposure, chromosomal sex, and sexual orientation
­(Brunner et al., 2016).

Sexual Orientation and the Brain LO 10.14 Describe research on sexually
dimorphic brain structures and sexual orientation. As you read earlier
in this chapter, sexual dimorphism refers to differences between males
and females, including differences in brains and behaviors. Anatomical
and functional studies suggest dimorphic differences in the corpus
callosum, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, and
throughout several neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine systems
(Breedlove, 1994; Cahill, 2006; Choleris et al., 2018; Cosgrove et al.,
2007; Goldstein et al., 2001; Ruigrok et al., 2014; Swaab et al., 1995).

Reproductive and Parental Behavior

Most investigators believe that the sexual dimorphism of the human brain
is a result of differential exposure to androgens prenatally and during
early postnatal life. Additional changes could occur at the time of
puberty, when another surge in androgens occurs. Sexual dimorphism in
the human brain could also be a result of differences in the social
environments of men and women. Because we cannot manipulate hormone
exposure in people like we can with laboratory animals, it might be a
long time before enough evidence is gathered to support definite
conclusions. In addition, some dimorphic features may be better
conceptualized along a continuum, rather than as two distinct categories
of sex or gender, and some features show overlap in both males and
females. McCarthy and colleagues (2012) provide a summary and research
recommendations for more inclusive study of sexual dimorphisms in
neuroscience. In the future, the field may adopt a continuum-based or
polymorphic perspective on sex and gender. For now, the results of most
studies focus on dimorphisms. The following section summarizes what is
currently known in this area as it relates to sexual orientation. The
end of this section also includes the results of preliminary
neuroscience research into brain structures associated with another
topic: gender identity. Several studies have examined the brains of gay
and heterosexual men and women, with an interest in identifying
differences in dimorphic structures. So far, these studies have found
differences in the size of three different subregions of the brain: the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a sexually dimorphic nucleus of the
hypothalamus, and the anterior commissure (Bao & Swaab, 2011; Allen &
Gorski, 1992; LeVay, 1991; Swaab & Hofman, 1990). (See Figure 10.19.)
You are already familiar, from Chapter 9, with the SCN. The anterior
commissure is a fiber bundle that interconnects parts of the left and
right temporal lobes. However, from what we know about brain functions,
there is no reason to expect that differences in the SCN or the corpus
callosum would play a role in sexual orientation. Also, a follow-up
study confirmed the existence of a sexually dimorphic nucleus in the
hypothalamus but failed to find a relationship between its size and
sexual orientation in men (Byne et al., 2001). Functional-imaging
studies have found that the brains of gay men and women reacted
differently to the odors of AND and EST, two chemicals that may serve as
human pheromones. Savic and colleagues (2005) found that the response of
brain regions of gay men to AND and EST was similar to that of the
heterosexual women. Berglund and colleagues (2006) found that the
response of brain regions of lesbian women to these substances was
similar to those of heterosexual men. These studies suggest that a
person's sexual orientation affects (or is affected by) their response
pattern to these potential pheromones.

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 327

327

Garcia-Falgueras and Swaab (2008) found another sexually dimorphic
region of the human brain: the uncinate nucleus of the hypothalamus.
They found that this nucleus, which is the human version of the medial
preoptic nucleus (a nucleus within the POA) in rodents, is approximately
twice as large in men as in women. (See Figure 10.20.) The size of this
nucleus is the same in transgender and cisgender women. The
investigators also provide evidence that the neurons in the uncinate
nucleus send axons to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST),
the size of which was previously shown to be related to gender identity.
The authors suggest that these two structures are part of a neural
circuit that is involved in a person's gender identity. Additional
research has begun to explore dimorphic brain structures related to
gender identity. The size of a particular region of the forebrain, the
central subdivision of BNST, is larger in men than in women (Zhou et
al., 1995). In transgender women the size of this nucleus is consistent
with cisgender women. The size of this nucleus was the same in men,
regardless of their sexual orientation.

328 Chapter 10 Kruijver and colleagues (2000) replicated these results
and found that the size of this region in transgender and cisgender men
was the same. The size of the BNST appears to be related to gender
identity, not sex assigned at birth or sexual orientation. Other lines
of research have begun to employ fMRI, PET single-photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
techniques to better understand brain structure and function involved in
gender identity (Guillamon et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2015). It is
difficult to conclude that any of the brain regions mentioned in this
section are directly involved in people's sexual orientation or gender
identity. It is also possible that differences may lie elsewhere in the
brain, in some regions as yet unexplored by researchers. However, the
observation that differences in brain structure are related to variation
in sexual orientation and gender identity suggests that biological
factors, including which combination of chromosomes a person inherits
and exposure to prenatal hormones, contribute to important aspects of
self-identity.

Role of Prenatal Environment in Sexual Orientation LO 10.15 Summarize
the relationships between prenatal environmental factors and sexual
orientation. Some research has investigated additional factors of the
prenatal environment that are related to sexual orientation. One clue
arose based on the observation that gay men tend to have a unique
pattern of siblings, deemed the fraternal birth order effect (for review
see Blanchard, 2018). Blanchard (2001) and Bogaert (2006) found that gay
men tend to have more older brothers, but not more older sisters or
younger brothers or sisters. In contrast, the numbers of brothers or
sisters (younger or older) of women of any sexual orientation did not
differ, nor did the age of the mother or father or the interval between
births. The presence of older brothers and sisters had no effect on
women's sexual orientation. The data obtained by Blanchard suggest that
the odds of a man identifying as gay increased by approximately 33
percent for each older brother. This pattern has been replicated across
many, but not all, subsequent studies (Blanchard, 2018). What might
explain this observation? One explanation suggests that when mothers are
exposed to several male fetuses, their immune system may become
sensitized to proteins that only males possess (such as Y-linked
proteins). As a result, the response of the mother's immune system may
affect the prenatal brain development of sexually dimorphic structures
of later male fetuses. Most men who have several older brothers are not
gay, so even if this hypothesis is correct, it appears that only some
women become sensitized to a protein produced

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 328

by their male fetuses. In addition, this relationship appears to hold
true primarily among right-handed individuals (handedness is also
determined prenatally) and has been demonstrated across diverse samples
(Bogaert & Skorska, 2011). Antibodies to a Y-linked protein are
increased among mothers of gay sons, and increased antibody production
is associated with a greater number of sons, providing a possible
mechanism and support for this hypothesis (Bogaert et al., 2017). Other
researchers have critiqued this line of research on several grounds,
including its failure to explain all instances of sexual orientation,
suggesting instead that epigenetic mechanisms may be responsible
(Gavrilets et al., 2018).

Heredity and Sexual Orientation LO 10.16 Summarize what is currently
known about the role of heredity in sexual orientation. Another factor
that may play a role in sexual orientation is heredity. A study of
nearly 500,000 individuals identified five candidate gene locations
involved in hormone regulation and olfaction that were associated with
same-sex sexual behavior. However, these gene locations together
explained less than 25 percent of the variability in sexual behavior in
the sample, meaning that the large majority of variability in human
sexual behavior remains unexplained by specific genetic locations. From
this result, the researchers concluded that sexual behavior is
influenced by the complex interactions of many other locations on the
genome, which remain to be identified (Ganna et al., 2019). Prior to
undertaking studies of specific locations on the genome, early support
for the role of heredity in sexual orientation came from twin studies.
Twin studies take advantage of the fact that identical twins have
identical genes, whereas the genetic similarity between fraternal twins
is, on the average, 50 percent. Bailey and Pillard (1991) found that the
concordance rate for sexual orientation among twin brothers was 52
percent for identical twins and only 22 percent for fraternal twins---a
difference of 30 percent. Other studies have shown differences of up to
60 percent (Gooren, 2006), suggesting that a genetic component plays a
role in sexual orientation in men. Some studies (Hamer et al., 1993;
Sanders et al., 2014) have reported correlations between a region of the
X chromosome called Xq28 and sexual orientation in men, while others
have found no relationship (Rice et al., 1999). Genetic factors also
appear to affect female sexual orientation. Bailey and colleagues (1993)
found that the concordance of female monozygotic twins for sexual
orientation was 48 percent, while that of dizygotic twins was 16
percent. Another study, by Pattatucci and Hamer (1995), found an
increased prevalence of lesbian and bisexual sexual orientation in
sisters, daughters, nieces, and female cousins (through a paternal
uncle) of women with same-sex partners.

Table 10.4 Summary of Factors Possibly Contributing to Sexual
Orientation Factor

Description

Genetics/Heredity

Twin studies suggest that heredity may play a role in sexual orientation
in both men and women.

Hormone exposure Organizational effects

Evidence from prenatally androgenized girls, and androgen insensitivity
suggests a role for prenatal a ­ ndrogen exposure in sexual orientation.

Activational effects

There is limited evidence in support of activational effects of hormones
in sexual orientation. One example may come from the interaction between
chromosomes and activational effects of hormones in gender identity and
sexual o ­ rientation of ­individuals with 5α-reductase deficiency
syndrome.

Environment Prenatal environment

Boys with more older brothers have a higher likelihood of identifying as
gay. Increased antibodies to a Y-linked protein have been found in
mothers of gay sons, supporting the fraternal birth order effect.

Postnatal environment

There is little evidence to suggest that postnatal biological factors
play large roles in sexual orientation.

For several decades, investigators have been puzzled by an apparent
paradox. On average, gay men have approximately 80 percent fewer
children than heterosexual men (Bell & Weinberg, 1978). This reduced
fecundity should exert strong selective pressure against any genes
involved in gay sexual orientation. Some investigators have suggested
that gay men may have an important supportive role in their families,
increasing the fecundity of their relatives, who share some of their
genes (Wilson, 1975). However, more recent studies (Bobrow & Bailey,
2001; Rahman & Hull, 2005) have found that gay men do not provide more
financial or emotional support to their siblings. A study by
Camperio-Ciani and colleagues (2004) suggests a possible explanation.
They found that the female maternal relatives (for example, maternal
aunts and

grandmothers) of gay men had higher fecundity rates. No differences were
found in the female paternal relatives. Because men are likely to share
an X chromosome with female maternal relatives but not with female
paternal relatives, the investigators suggested that a gene or genes on
the X chromosome that are involved in men's sexual orientation also
increase a female's fecundity. To summarize, evidence suggests that
important biological factors---prenatal environments, hormonal exposure,
and heredity---may affect a person's sexual orientation (see also Table
10.4). We can hope that research on the biological origins of sexual
orientation will reduce prejudice and misunderstanding and help people
to better understand the variety of sexual orientations and gender
identities that exist.

Module Review: Sexual Orientation Activational and Organizational
Effects of Hormones LO 10.12 Compare activational and organizational
effects of hormones in sexual orientation. There is little support for a
role of activational effects of hormones in sexual orientation. There is
stronger evidence for a role of organizational effects of hormones in
sexual orientation.

Role of Steroid Hormones LO 10.13 Describe examples that indicate a role
of prenatal hormone exposure in sexual orientation. Studies of
prenatally androgenized girls suggest that organizational effects of
androgens influence the development of sexual orientation;
androgenization appears to enhance the likelihood of a lesbian sexual
orientation. Studies of genetic males with cloacal exstrophy,

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 329

who are born without a penis, support the conclusion that prenatal
exposure to androgens promotes a male gender identity and heterosexual
sexual orientation. If androgens cannot act (as they cannot in cases of
androgen insensitivity syndrome), the person's anatomy and behavior are
feminized. Recent research has suggested a role for prenatal
progesterone exposure in sexual orientation.

Sexual Orientation and the Brain LO 10.14 Describe research on sexually
dimorphic brain structures and sexual orientation. The sizes of some
specific regions of the telencephalon and diencephalon are different in
males and females, and the shape of the corpus callosum may also be
sexually dimorphic. Several postmortem studies have examined the brains
of gay and heterosexual men and women. So far, these studies have found
differences in the size of three different subregions of the brain: the
suprachiasmatic

orientation.

Heredity and Sexual Orientation LO 10.16 Summarize what is currently
known about the role of heredity in sexual orientation. Twin studies
suggest that heredity may play a role in sexual orientation in men and
women.

Thought Question

Gay men tend to have more older brothers. When mothers are exposed to
several male fetuses, their immune system may become sensitized to
proteins that only males possess, which may influence the prenatal
environment and subsequent sexual orientation of the child.

Whatever the relative roles played by biological and environmental
factors may be, most investigators agree that a person's sexual
orientation is not a matter of choice. What brain or endocrine-based
evidence supports this assertion?

Parental Behavior

Nest-building provides one important example of maternal behavior.
During gestation, female rats and mice build nests. The form this
structure takes depends on the material available for its construction.
In the laboratory the animals are usually given strips of paper or
lengths of rope or twine. A good brood nest, as it is called, is shown
in Figure 10.21. This nest is made of hemp rope. A piece of the rope is
shown below the nest. The mouse laboriously shredded the rope and then
wove an enclosed nest, with a small hole for access to the interior.
Prolactin and progesterone play important roles in rodent nest-building
­behavior (Vocci & Carlson, 1973).

In most mammalian species, reproductive behavior takes place at the time
of conception, as well as after offspring are born. This module examines
the role of hormones in the initiation and maintenance of parental
behavior, and the role of the neural circuits that are responsible for
their expression. Most of the research has involved rodents. Less is
known about the neural and endocrine bases of parental behavior in
primates. Although most research on the physiology of parental behavior
has focused on maternal behavior, some researchers study paternal
behavior shown by the males of some species. Parental behavior of human
fathers is very important for the offspring of our species, but the
physiological basis of this behavior is not yet well understood.

kind of rope the mouse used to construct it. Source: Carlson, Neil

Maternal Behavior of Rodents LO 10.17 Describe examples of rodent
maternal behavior. The final test of the fitness of an animal's genes is
the number of offspring that survive to a reproductive age. Just as the
process of natural selection favors reproductively competent animals, it
favors those that care adequately for their young, if their young in
fact require care. Rat and mouse pups certainly do; they cannot survive
without a mother to attend to their needs. At birth, rats and mice
resemble fetuses. The infants are blind (their eyes are still shut), and
they can only wriggle helplessly. They are poikilothermous
("cold-blooded"); their brain is not yet developed enough to regulate
body temperature. They even lack the ability to release their own urine
and feces spontaneously and must be helped to do so by their mother. As
we will see shortly, this phenomenon actually serves a useful function.

Reproductive and Parental Behavior

At the time of parturition (birth of offspring) the female begins to
groom and lick the area around her vagina. As a pup begins to emerge,
she assists the uterine contractions by pulling the pup out with her
teeth. She then eats the placenta and umbilical cord and cleans off the
fetal membranes---a quite delicate operation. (A newborn pup looks as
though it is sealed in very thin plastic wrap.) After all the pups have
been born and cleaned up, the mother will probably nurse them. Milk is
usually present in the mammary glands very near the time of birth.
Periodically, the mother licks the pups' anogenital region, stimulating
reflexive urination and defecation. Friedman and Bruno (1976) have shown
the utility of this mechanism. They noted that a lactating female rat
produces approximately 48 grams (g) of milk on the tenth day of
lactation. This milk contains approximately 35 milliliters (ml) of
water. The experimenters injected some of the pups with tritiated
(radioactive) water and later found radioactivity in the mother and in
the littermates. They calculated that a lactating rat normally consumes
21 ml of water in the urine of her young, thus recycling approximately
twothirds of the water she gives to the pups in the form of milk. The
water, traded back and forth between mother and young, serves as a
vehicle for the nutrients---fats, protein, and sugar---contained in
milk. Because each day the milk production of a lactating rat is
approximately 14 percent of her body weight (for a human weighing 120
pounds, that would be around 2 gallons), the recycling is extremely
useful, especially when the availability of water is a problem. Besides
cleaning, nursing, and helping her offspring urinate and defecate, a
female rodent will retrieve pups if they leave or are removed from the
nest. The mother will even construct another nest in a new location and
move her litter there, should the conditions at the old site become
unfavorable (for example, when an inconsiderate experimenter puts a heat
lamp over it). The way a female rodent picks up her pup is quite
consistent: She gingerly grasps the animal, managing not to injure it
with her very sharp teeth. (We can personally attest to the sharpness of
a mouse's teeth and the strength of its jaw muscles.) She then carries
the pup with a characteristic prancing walk, her head held high. (See
Figure 10.22.) The pup is brought back to the nest and is left there.
The female then leaves the nest again to search for another pup. She
continues to retrieve pups until she finds no more; she does not count
her pups and then stop retrieving when she has them all. A mouse or rat
will usually accept all the pups she is offered, if they are young
enough. One of the authors once observed two lactating female mice with
nests in corners of the same cage, diagonally opposite each other.
Disturbing their nests triggered a long bout of retrieving, during which
each mother stole youngsters from the other's nest. The mothers kept up
their exchange for a long time, passing each other in the middle of the
cage.

Under normal conditions, one of the stimuli that induce a female rat to
begin taking care of pups is the act of parturition. Female rodents
normally begin taking care of their pups as soon as they are born. Some
of this effect is caused by prenatal hormones, but the passage of the
pups through the birth canal also stimulates maternal behavior:
Artificially distending the birth canal in nonpregnant females
stimulates maternal behavior, whereas cutting the sensory nerves that
innervate the birth canal slows the ­appearance of maternal behavior
(Graber & Kristal, 1977; Yeo & Keverne, 1986).

Hormonal Control of Maternal Behavior LO 10.18 Explain the role of
hormones in maternal behavior. As we saw earlier in this chapter, most
sexually dimorphic behaviors are controlled by the organizational and
activational effects of sex hormones. Maternal behavior is somewhat
different in this respect. First, there is no evidence that
organizational effects of hormones play a role in parental behavior.
Under the correct conditions, males will take care of infants. Second,
although maternal behavior is affected by hormones, it is not controlled
by them. Most virgin female rats will begin to retrieve and care for
young pups after having infants placed with them for several days
(Wiesner & Sheard, 1933). And once the rats are sensitized, they will
thereafter take care of pups as soon as they encounter them;
sensitization lasts for a lifetime. Although hormones are not essential
for the activation of maternal behavior, many aspects of maternal
behavior

are facilitated by hormones. Nest-building behavior is facilitated by
progesterone, the principal hormone of pregnancy (Lisk et al., 1969).
After parturition, mothers continue to maintain their nests, and they
construct new nests if necessary, even though their blood level of
progesterone is very low then. Although pregnant female rats will not
immediately care for foster pups that are given to them during
pregnancy, they will do so as soon as their own pups are born. The
hormones that influence a female rodent's responsiveness to her
offspring are the ones that are present shortly before parturition.
Figure 10.23 shows the levels of the three hormones that have been
implicated in maternal behavior: progesterone, estradiol, and prolactin.
Note that just before parturition the level of estradiol begins rising,
then the level of progesterone falls dramatically, followed by a sharp
increase in prolactin, the hormone produced by the anterior pituitary
gland that is responsible for milk production. If ovariectomized virgin
female rats are given progesterone, estradiol, and prolactin in a
pattern that duplicates this sequence, the time it takes to sensitize
their maternal behavior is drastically reduced (Bridges et al., 1985).
As we saw in the previous module, pair bonding involves vasopressin and
oxytocin. In at least some species, oxytocin also appears to be involved
in formation of a bond between mother and offspring. In rats the
administration of oxytocin facilitates the establishment of maternal
behavior (Insel, 1997). Van Leengoed and colleagues (1987) injected an
oxytocin antagonist into the cerebral

ventricles of rats as soon as they began giving birth. The experimenters
removed the pups from the cage as soon as they were born. When the pups
were given back to the mothers 40 minutes later, their mothers ignored
them. Control rats that were given a placebo began caring for their pups
as soon as the pups were returned to them. (See Table 10.5.)

Neural Control of Maternal Behavior LO 10.19 Identify brain regions and
neural pathways involved in maternal behavior. The medial preoptic area,
the region of the forebrain that plays the most critical role in male
sexual behavior, appears to play a similarly important role in maternal
behavior. Numan (1974) found that lesions of the MPA disrupted both nest
building and pup care in rodents. The mothers ignored their offspring.
However, female

08/11/2021 20:14

Reproductive and Parental Behavior

sexual behavior was unaffected by these lesions. Del Cerro and
colleagues (1995) found that the metabolic activity of the MPA, measured
by 2-DG autoradiography, increased immediately after parturition. They
also found that virgin female rodents whose maternal behavior had been
sensitized by exposure to pups showed increased activity in the MPA.
Stimuli that facilitate pup care activate the MPA. Prolactin appears to
exert its stimulating effect on maternal behavior by acting on receptors
in the medial preoptic area. Bridges and colleagues (1997, 2001) found
that an infusion of prolactin into the MPA of virgin female rats that
have been primed with estradiol and progesterone stimulated maternal
behavior, and an infusion of a prolactin antagonist into the MPA delayed
the onset of maternal behavior. Olfaction plays an important role in
sensitization of maternal behavior in the rat. A virgin female rat does
not normally approach a rat pup; in fact, when she encounters one, she
retreats from the pup. Fleming and Rosenblatt (1974) confirmed that the
avoidance is based on smell. They rinsed the olfactory mucosa of virgin
female rats with zinc sulfate, which temporarily eliminates olfactory
sensitivity. The treatment abolished the animals' aversion to the pups,
and they started taking care of the pups sooner than control rats did.
Sensitization involves overcoming a natural aversion to the odor of
pups. But sensitization of maternal behavior involves more than
overcoming an aversion to pups---it involves a physiological process in
the female that makes pups and their odors attractive to her. On the
last day of pregnancy a female rat carrying her first litter spends more
time around bedding that has been in contact with rat pups (Kinsley &
Bridges, 1990). Lee and colleagues (2000) also found that postpartum
female rats, but not pregnant rats, would learn to press a lever to
receive access to pups. Numan (2007) has reviewed research from his
laboratory that has traced the neural pathways responsible for the two
forms of sensitization to pups: inhibition of circuits responsible for
the aversion to the odor of pups and activation of circuits responsible
for caring for pups. It turns out that the MPA is involved in both forms
of sensitization. First, let's consider the aversive response that
virgin females make toward the odor of pups. As we saw earlier in this
chapter, the olfactory system provides input to the medial amygdala,
which plays an important role in sexual behavior. Lesions of the medial
amygdala abolish the aversion of virgin females to pups just as
treatment with zinc sulfate does, which indicates that the medial
amygdala plays a role in mediating the aversive effects of pup odors.
Some neurons in the medial amygdala send axons to the anterior
hypothalamus (AH), which in turn projects to the periaqueductal gray

M10_CARL0287_13_GE_C10.indd 333

333

matter (PAG). Because studies have shown that connections between the AH
and the PAG play a role in defensive behavior and avoidance responses,
Numan (2007) suggests that the role of the MPA in habituation to the
odor of pups may be to inhibit the activity of the AH → PAG circuit.
(See Figure 10.24.) The neural circuitry of the system responsible for
caring for pups is somewhat more complex. As you learned earlier, in the
discussion of the neural basis of male sexual behavior, the MPA sends
axons to the midbrain and lower brain stem. Numan and Numan (1997) found
that neurons of the MPA that were activated by the performance of
maternal behavior sent their axons to the ventral tegmental area (VTA).
In turn, dopaminergic neurons in the VTA send axons to the nucleus
accumbens (NAC). As we will see in Chapters 13 and 18, the VTA → NAC
system is critically involved in motivation and reinforcement. For
example, this system is activated when a hungry animal receives food, a
thirsty animal receives water, an animal gets the opportunity to engage
in sexual activity---or a sensitized or lactating female encounters
pups. In fact, an fMRI study with rats (yes, their tiny little heads
really were put in a special fMRI scanner) found that regions of the
brain that are involved in reinforcement are activated when the mothers
are presented with their pups (Ferris et al., 2005). The same regions
are activated by artificial reinforcers such as cocaine. However,
cocaine activates these regions only in virgin females; lactating
females actually showed a reduction of activation there when they
received injections of the drug. To a lactating female the presence of
pups becomes extremely reinforcing, and the potency of other stimuli,
which might distract her from providing maternal care, appears to become
weaker. Numan (2007) and his colleagues have shown that dopamine is
released in the NAC during maternal behavior, and that lesions of the
NAC or injection of a dopamine antagonist into the NAC disrupt maternal
behavior. Finally, axons from the NAC project to the ventral pallidum, a
region of the basal ganglia involved in control of motivated behaviors,
and injection of muscimol into the ventral pallidum suppressed maternal
behavior. (Muscimol, a GABA agonist, inhibits neural activity.) An fMRI
study with humans found that when mothers looked at pictures of their
infants, brain regions involved in reinforcement and those that contain
receptors for oxytocin and vasopressin showed increased activity.
Regions involved with negative emotions, such as the amygdala, showed
decreased activity (Bartels & Zeki, 2004). We already know that mothers
(and fathers too) form intense bonds with their infants, so it should
not come as a surprise that regions involved with reinforcement should
be activated by the sight of their faces.

Neural Control of Paternal Behavior LO 10.20 Identify brain regions and
neural pathways involved in paternal behavior. Newborn infants of most
species of mammals are cared for by their mother and their mother feeds
them. However, males of about 5 percent of mammalian species share the
task of infant care with the mothers (Kleiman & Malcolm, 1981), and the
brains of these fathers show some interesting differences compared with
those of nonpaternal fathers of other species.

Lesions along pathway from VNO to the amygdala also facilitate the onset
of maternal behavior in nulliparous rats. (Fleming et al., 1979, 1980,
1983)

Monogamous male prairie voles form pair bonds with their mates and help
to care for their offspring, while polygamous male meadow voles leave
the female after mating. The release of vasopressin, elicited by mating,
facilitates this process. The size of the MPA, which plays an essential
role in maternal behavior, shows less sexual dimorphism in monogamous
voles than in promiscuous voles (Shapiro et al., 1991). Kirkpatrick and
colleagues (1994) found that when male prairie voles were exposed to a
pup, neurons in the MPA were activated. In addition, lesions of the MPA
produce severe

deficits in paternal behavior of male rats and another species of
monogamous voles (Lee & Brown, 2007; Rosenblatt et al., 1996; Sturgis &
Bridges, 1997). The MPA appears to play a similar role in parental
behavior of both males and females. Less is known about the brain
mechanisms involved in human paternal behavior, but evidence suggests
that prolactin, oxytocin, and testosterone facilitate a father's role in
infant care. In another paternal species, California mice, the presence
of offspring increases blood prolactin levels (Gubernick & Nelson,
1989). In marmosets, physical contact with young was associated with
increased prolactin in caregiving adult males (da Silva Mota et al.,
2006). Among humans, Fleming and colleagues (2002) found that fathers
with higher blood levels of prolactin reported stronger feelings of
sympathy and activation when they heard the cries of infants. Gordon and
colleagues (2010) found that higher levels of paternal prolactin were
associated with more exploratory toy-manipulating play behavior with
their infants, and that higher levels of oxytocin were associated with
synchronous, coordinated emotional behavior between father and infant.
Paternal behavior is also associated with dynamic changes in
testosterone. In a longitudinal study, Gettler and colleagues (2011)
measured testosterone levels in 624 young adult men for 4.5 years. Men
with the highest levels of testosterone at the beginning of the study
were most likely to become partnered fathers by the end of the study.
When they became fathers, the men experienced large decreases in
testosterone, especially when the children were newborns.

The study was conducted in the Philippines, where fathers are frequently
involved in paternal care. Fathers with at least 1 hour of paternal care
per day had lower levels of testosterone compared to fathers that
reported less paternal care. (See Figure 10.25.) The authors of the
study suggest that changes in testosterone are part of an evolved
strategy for reproductive success (Gettler et al., 2011).

behavior. Rodent maternal behavior includes nest building, delivering
pups, cleaning pups, keeping them warm, nursing them, and retrieving
them if they are moved out of the nest. The mothers must even induce
their pups' urination and defecation, and the mother's ingestion of the
urine recycles water, which is often a scarce commodity.

Hormonal Control of Maternal Behavior LO 10.18 Explain the role of
hormones in maternal behavior. Nest-building behavior is facilitated by
progesterone, the principal hormone of pregnancy. Injections of

facilitates the onset of maternal behavior.

involved in maternal behavior. Injections of progesterone, estradiol,
and prolactin that duplicate the sequence that occurs during pregnancy
facilitate maternal behavior. The hormones appear to act in the medial
preoptic area (MPA). Connections between the MPA and the medial amygdala
are responsible for the suppression of the aversive effects of the odor
of pups, and a different circuit starting with the MPA is involved in
establishing the reinforcing effect of pups and enhancing motivation to
care for them: MPA S VTA S NAC S ventral pallidum. An fMRI study with
rats showed activation of brain mechanisms of reinforcement when the
mothers were presented with their pups. Women who look at pictures of
their infants show increased ­activity in similar brain regions.

relatively rare in mammalian species, but research indicates that sexual
dimorphism of the MPA is less pronounced in male voles of monogamous,
but not promiscuous, species. Lesions of the MPA abolish paternal
behavior of male rats. Some aspects of parental

care may be related to blood levels of prolactin, oxytocin, and
testosterone in human fathers.

Thought Question Adults in a variety of species often care for young
that they are not biologically related to. If you could research the
biological mechanisms of these care-giving behaviors, what circuits or
pathways would you investigate and why?

Samantha has a rare neurological condition, Urbach-Wiethe disease, which
progressively damages neural tissue. UrbachWiethe disease affects about
100 people in the world (van Honk et al., 2016). The disease has
affected Samantha's temporal lobes, causing bilateral amygdala
destruction. Samantha demonstrates typical measures of attention,
cognition, memory, visual ability, language, and executive function such
as planning and decision making. She is a single mother of three boys,
and has been described by interviewers as "pleasant and friendly, and
reflective and thoughtful" (Tranel et al., 2006, p. 224). She exhibits
empathy for others, and has experienced considerable adversity in her
life, including difficult childhood experiences, the loss of a parent at
a young age, and limited financial and social resources.

Samantha's case highlights the role of one brain region in emotion. From
this example, we learn that damage to the amygdala impairs fear. Fear is
an example of an emotion that consists of a feeling (being afraid),
physiological changes (for example, increased heart rate), and behaviors
(fighting, freezing, or fleeing). Researchers consider emotions to have
multiple components that extend beyond just the feeling of the emotion
to include changes throughout the body that help prepare us to respond
to an emotional

experiences and exhibits a lack of fear and anger in most contexts, and
cannot recognize these emotions in others. For example, she did not
report experiencing fear when watching movie clips from scary films such
as The Shining and The Silence of the Lambs. Other people with amygdala
damage due to Urbach-Wiethe disease have described a variety of
similarly reduced fear sensitivities (Phelps et al., 1998; Markowitsch
et al., 1994); however, at least some individuals demonstrate a very
fast initial response to fear-inducing images. Some researchers have
speculated that other brain regions quickly react to fear-inducing
stimuli, while the amygdala then directs and allocates resources to
coordinate an emotional response (Pishnamazi et al., 2016).

situation. Most of us use the word emotion to refer to just the
feelings, but not the other components of an emotional response. Even
though they are sometimes easy to overlook, physiological changes and
behaviors associated with emotion are important for survival. For
example, if you ­encounter a hungry predator, feeling afraid may not give
you a survival advantage, but your increased heart rate, blood flow to
your muscles (physiological changes), and fleeing ­(behavior) might!

Emotion 339

Much of the neuroscience research on emotion has focused on the emotions
of fear, aggression, and impulse control. The first two modules in this
chapter consider the patterns of behavioral and physiological responses
that constitute the emotions of fear and aggression. The third section
describes the role of emotions in impulse control, moral judgments and
social behavior. The fourth section describes the communication of
emotions---their expression and recognition. The final section examines
the nature of the feelings that accompany emotions. Each of these
emotions and emotional behaviors has important implications for our
survival.1

Fear Fear is an adaptive emotional response that is coordinated in the
brain by the nuclei of the amygdala. An extensive body of research
exists investigating the neurological basis for fear in laboratory
animals and human volunteers.

Components of Emotional Response LO 11.1

Describe the three components of an emotional response.

An emotional response consists of three types of components: behavioral,
autonomic, and hormonal. The behavioral component consists of muscular
movements that are appropriate to the situation that elicits them. For
example, a dog defending its territory against an intruder first adopts
an aggressive posture, growls, and shows its teeth. If the intruder does
not leave, the defender runs toward it and attacks. Autonomic responses
facilitate the behaviors and provide quick mobilization of energy for
vigorous movement. In this example the activity of the sympathetic
branch increases while that of the parasympathetic branch decreases. As
a consequence, the dog's heart rate increases, and changes in the size
of blood vessels shunt the circulation of blood away from the digestive
organs toward the muscles. Hormonal responses reinforce the autonomic
responses. The hormones secreted by the adrenal medulla--- epinephrine
and norepinephrine---further increase blood flow to the muscles and
cause nutrients stored in the muscles to be converted into glucose. In
addition, the adrenal cortex secretes steroid hormones, which also help
to make glucose available to the muscles. (See Figure 11.1.) 1

As you will see, negative emotions receive much more attention from
researchers than positive ones do. Most of the research on the
physiology of emotions has been limited to fear and anger---emotions
associated with situations in which we may defend ourselves or our loved
ones. The physiology of behaviors associated with positive
emotions---such as those associated with love, caring for one's
offspring, or enjoying delicious food---is described in other chapters.

Emotional Response

The following modules discuss the control of emotional behaviors and the
autonomic and hormonal responses that accompany them. These components
are controlled by separate neural systems. The integration of the
components of fear appears to be controlled by the amygdala.

Research with Laboratory Animals LO 11.2

Outline evidence for the roles of the amygdala and ventromedial
prefrontal cortex in animal models of emotion.

The amygdala plays an important role in responding to emotional
situations that have biological significance, such as those that warn of
pain or other unpleasant consequences or signify the presence of food,
water, salt, potential mates or rivals, or infants in need of care. For
example, neurons in various nuclei of the amygdala become active when
emotionally relevant stimuli are presented (Jacobs & McGinty, 1972;
Leonard et al., 1985; O'Keefe & Bouma, 1969; Rolls, 1982). This module
describes research on the role of the amygdala in organizing emotional
responses produced by aversive stimuli. The amygdala (or, more
precisely, the amygdaloid complex) is located within the temporal lobes.
It consists of several groups of nuclei, each with different inputs and
outputs---and with different functions (Amaral et al., 1992; Pitkänen et
al., 1997; Stefanacci & Amaral, 2000). The amygdala has been subdivided
into approximately 12 regions, each containing several subregions.
However, we will focus on just three major regions: the lateral nucleus,
the basal nucleus, and the central nucleus. The lateral nucleus (LA)
receives information from all regions of the neocortex, including the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the thalamus, and the hippocampal
formation. The lateral nucleus sends information to the basal nucleus
(B) and to other parts of the brain, including the ventral striatum (a
brain region involved in the effects of reinforcing stimuli on learning)
and the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus, whose projection region is
the prefrontal cortex. The LA and B nuclei send information to the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the central nucleus (CE),

08/11/2021 20:18

340 Chapter 11 which projects to regions of the hypothalamus, midbrain,
pons, and medulla that are responsible for the expression of the various
components of emotional responses. As we will see, activation of the
central nucleus elicits a variety of emotional responses: behavioral,
autonomic, and hormonal. (See Figure 11.2.) The central nucleus of the
amygdala is the most important part of the brain for emotional responses
to aversive stimuli. When threatening stimuli are perceived, neurons in
the central nucleus become activated (Pascoe & Kapp, 1985; Campeau et
al., 1991). Damage to the central nucleus (or to the nuclei that provide
it with sensory information) reduces or abolishes a wide range of
emotional behaviors and physiological responses. After the central
nucleus has been destroyed, animals no longer show signs of fear when
confronted with stimuli that have been paired with aversive events. They
also act tamer when handled by humans, their blood levels of stress
hormones are lower, and they are less likely to develop ulcers or other
forms of stress-induced illnesses (Coover et al., 1992; Davis, 1992;
LeDoux, 1992). Monkeys typically show signs of fear when they see a
snake, but those with amygdala lesions do not (Amaral, 2003). In
contrast, when the central amygdala is stimulated, animals show
physiological and behavioral signs of fear and agitation (Davis, 1992),
people report feeling afraid (Gloor et al., 1982; Halgren et al., 1978;
White, 1940), and

long-term stimulation of the central nucleus produces stress-induced
illnesses such as gastric ulcers (Henke, 1982). These observations
suggest that the autonomic and endo­ crine responses controlled by the
central nucleus are among those responsible for the harmful effects of
longterm stress (see Chapter 18). Figure 11.3 summarizes the regions
receiving information from the central amygdala and the responses they

produce fear reactions---for example, loud unexpected noises, the
approach of large animals, heights, or (for some species) specific
sounds or odors. Even more important, however, is the ability to learn
that a particular stimulus or situation is dangerous or threatening.
Once the learning has taken place, that stimulus or situation will evoke
fear: heart rate and blood pressure will increase, the muscles will
become more tense, the adrenal glands will secrete epinephrine, and the
animal will proceed cautiously, alert and ready to respond. The most
basic form of emotional learning is a conditioned emotional response,
which is produced by a neutral stimulus that has been paired with an
emotion-producing stimulus. The word conditioned refers to the process
of classical conditioning, which is described in more detail in Chapter
13. Classical conditioning occurs when a neutral stimulus is regularly
followed by a stimulus that automatically evokes a response. For
example, if a dog regularly hears a bell ring just before it receives
some food that makes it salivate, it will begin salivating as soon as it
hears the sound of the bell. Several laboratories have investigated the
role of the amygdala in the development of classically conditioned
emotional responses. For example, these responses can be produced in
rats by presenting a stimulus such as a novel floor texture (represented
by the color blue in Figure 11.4), followed by a brief electrical shock
delivered to the feet through the floor on which the animals are
standing. By itself the shock produces an unconditioned emotional
response: The animal jumps, its heart rate and blood pressure increase,
its breathing becomes more rapid, and its adrenal glands secrete
catecholamines and steroid stress hormones. After several pairings of
the new texture and the shock, classical conditioning is normally
established. The next day, if the conditioned floor texture is presented
alone---not followed by a shock---physiological monitoring will show the
same

physiological responses the animals produced when they were shocked
during training. In addition, they will show a species-typical defensive
response called freezing. In other words, the animals act as if they
were expecting to receive a shock. The texture becomes a conditioned
stimulus (CS) that elicits freezing: a conditioned response (CR). (See
Figure 11.4.) The physical changes responsible for a conditioned
emotional response take place in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala
(Paré et al., 2004). Neurons in the lateral nucleus communicate with
neurons in the central nucleus, which in turn communicate with regions
in the hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, and medulla that are responsible
for the behavioral, autonomic, and hormonal components of a conditioned
emotional response. More recent studies indicate that the neural
circuitry responsible for the process of classical conditioning is
actually more complex than that (Ciocchi et al., 2010; Duvarci et al.,
2011; Haubensak et al., 2010; Karalis et al., 2016; Tovote et al.,
2015), but the details of this process can be found in Chapter 13, which
discusses the physiology of learning and memory. EXTINCTION The neural
mechanisms responsible for classically conditioned emotional responses
to ­fear-related stimuli evolved because they play a role in an animal's
survival and increase the likelihood that an animal can avoid dangerous
situations. Animals also have a mechanism that can help them learn a
different response to a stimulus. For example, if the CS (tone or floor
texture) is presented repeatedly by itself, the previously established
CR (emotional response) eventually disappears---it becomes extinguished.
After all, the value of a conditioned emotional response is that it
prepares an animal to confront (or, better yet, avoid) an aversive
stimulus. If the CS occurs repeatedly but the aversive stimulus does not
follow, then it is better for the emotional response---which

Figure 11.4 An Example of a Conditioned Emotional Response In this
example, a rat experiences a shock in an enclosure with a novel floor
texture (shown in blue) (CS). The shock produces a fear response that
induces freezing behavior. After pairing the shock with the blue floor,
the animal displays freezing behavior in all enclosures with blue floors
(CR). The animal displays no fear-related behavior in an unconditioned
environment (enclosure with a purple floor).

Figure 11.5 Extinction In this example, rats experience fear
conditioning, pairing a novel floor (represented by the color blue) with
a shock. The rats are divided into two groups and experience extinction
(exposures to novel floors with no shock) in new enclosures with either
purple or green floors, as demonstrated by standing up and engaging in
exploratory behavior. When the groups of animals are tested after
extinction, the animals demonstrate extinction in the same enclosure
where they learned not to respond to the floor (extinction). Extinction
learning is context dependent. In this example, when extinction occurs
in one environment, or context (green floor), it does not generalize to
a new environment (purple floor) where the rat will experience fear and
engage in freezing behavior. Conditioning

itself is disruptive and unpleasant---to disappear. And that is exactly
what happens. Extinction is not the same as forgetting. Instead, the
animal learns that the CS is no longer followed by an aversive stimulus,
and, as a result of this learning, the expression of the CR is
inhibited. The memory for the association between the CS and the
aversive stimulus is not erased. (See Figure 11.5.) Conditioned response
inhibition is supplied by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
(Amano et al., 2010; Sotres-Bayon & Quirk, 2010). Lesioning the vmPFC
impairs extinction, and extinction training activates neurons there.
Besides playing an essential role in extinction of conditioned emotional
responses, the vmPFC can modulate the expression of fear in different
circumstances. Depending on the situation, one subregion of the
prefrontal cortex can become active and suppress a conditioned fear
response, and another subregion can become active and enhance the
response. The vmPFC is located just where its name suggests, at the
bottom front of the cerebral hemispheres. (See Figure 11.6.) The vmPFC
receives direct inputs from the dorsomedial thalamus, temporal cortex,
ventral ­tegmental area, olfactory system, and amygdala. Its

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 342

outputs go to several brain regions, including the cingulate cortex,
hippocampal formation, temporal cortex, lateral hypothalamus, and
amygdala. Finally, it communicates with other regions of the prefrontal
cortex. Its inputs provide it with information about what is happening
in the environment and what plans are being made by the

rest of the frontal lobes, and its outputs permit it to affect a variety

organized by the amygdala. (See Table 11.1.)

Research with Humans LO 11.3

Describe the roles of the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in
human emotion.

We humans also acquire conditioned emotional responses. Let's use an
example to illustrate this. Suppose you are studying with a friend and
decide to have a snack. You put some food in the microwave to heat it
up. The microwave makes an unusual noise and you open it to check on
your food. Opening the door gives you a painful electrical shock. Your
first response would be a defensive reflex: You would let go of the
door, which would end the shock. This response is specific because it is
aimed at terminating the painful stimulus. In addition, the painful
stimulus would elicit nonspecific responses controlled by your autonomic
nervous system: For example, your eyes would dilate, your heart rate and
blood pressure would increase, and you would breathe faster. The painful
stimulus would also trigger the secretion of some stress-related
hormones, another nonspecific response. Suppose that a while later you
visit your friend again and make popcorn in the microwave. Your friend
tells you that the microwave is perfectly safe. It has been fixed. Just
seeing the microwave and thinking of using it again makes you a little
nervous, but you accept your friend's assurance, open the door, and
place the popcorn inside. Just then, it makes the same unusual noise
that it did when it shocked you. What would your response be? Almost
certainly, you would let go of the door again, even if it did not give
you a shock. Your pupils would dilate, your heart rate and blood
pressure would increase, and your endocrine glands would secrete some
stress-related hormones. The unusual sound would trigger a conditioned
emotional response. The amygdala is involved in emotional responses in
humans too. One

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 343

early study observed the reactions of people who were being evaluated
for surgical removal of parts of the brain to treat severe seizure
disorders. This study found that stimulation of parts of the brain (for
example, the hypothalamus) produced autonomic responses that are often
associated with fear and anxiety but only when the amygdala was
stimulated did people also report that they actually felt afraid (Gloor
et al., 1982; Halgren et al., 1978; White, 1940). Inman and colleagues
(2018) studied the response of patients undergoing intracranial EEG
monitoring for seizures as their amygdalae were stimulated with
microelectrodes. The researchers recorded autonomic components of a fear
response and asked patients to report their emotional responses. Most of
the patients experienced the autonomic response without a subjective
emotional response, while other patients experienced both an autonomic
and emotional response to the stimulation. These researchers concluded
that stimulating the amygdala may produce changes in autonomic
components without necessarily producing a fearful emotional response.
Many studies have shown that lesions of the amygdala decrease people's
emotional responses. For example, Bechara and colleagues (1995) and
LaBar and colleagues (1995) found that people with amygdala lesions have
impaired acquisition of a conditioned emotional response, just as rats
do. Most human fears are probably acquired socially, not through
firsthand experience with painful stimuli (Olsson et al., 2007). For
example, a child does not have to be attacked by a dog to develop a fear
of dogs: They can develop this fear by watching another person being
attacked or (more often) by seeing another person display signs of fear
when encountering a dog. People can also acquire a conditioned fear
response through instruction. For example, suppose that someone is told
(and believes) that if a warning light goes on, they should leave the
room immediately because the light is connected to a sensor that detects
dangerous levels of carbon monoxide gas. If the light does go on, the
person will leave the room and is also likely to experience a fear
response while doing so. We saw that the vmPFC plays a critical role in
extinction of a conditioned emotional response in animal models. The
same is true for humans. Phelps and colleagues (2004) directly
established a conditioned emotional response in volunteers by pairing
the appearance of a square visual stimulus with electric shocks to the
wrist and then extinguished the response by presenting the squares
alone, without any shocks. Increased activity of the medial prefrontal
cortex correlated with extinction of the conditioned response.

344 Chapter 11 EMOTIONAL MEMORY Damage to the amygdala interferes with
the effects of emotions on memory. Normally, when people encounter
events that produce a strong emotional response, they are more likely to
remember these events. Cahill and colleagues (1995) studied a patient
with bilateral degeneration of the amygdala similar to Samantha's at the
beginning of this chapter. The researchers narrated a story about a
young boy walking with his mother on his way to visit his father at
work. To accompany the story, they showed a series of slides. During one
part of the story, the boy was injured in a traffic accident, and
gruesome slides illustrated his injuries. When this slide show is
presented to healthy volunteers, they remember more details from the
emotion-laden part of the story. However, a patient with amygdala damage
showed no such increase in memory. In another study, researchers
questioned patients with Alzheimer 's disease who had witnessed the
devastating earthquake that struck Kobe, Japan, in

1995. They found that memory of this frightening event was inversely
      correlated with amygdala damage: The more a patient's amygdala was
      degenerated, the less likely it was that the patient remembered
      the earthquake (Mori et al., 1999). As we saw in Chapter 7,
      Patient I. R., a woman who had sustained damage to the auditory
      association cortex, was unable to perceive or produce melodic or
      rhythmic aspects of music (Peretz et al., 2001). She could not
      tell the difference between consonant (pleasant) and dissonant
      (unpleasant) music. However, she was still able to recognize the
      mood conveyed by music. Gosselin and colleagues (2005) found that
      patients with damage to the amygdala showed the opposite symptoms:
      They had no trouble with musical perception but were unable to
      recognize scary music. They could still recognize happy and sad
      music. These results suggest that amygdala lesions impair
      recognition of a musical style that is normally associated with
      fear.

Module Review: Fear Components of Emotional Response LO 11.1

Describe the three components of an emotional response.

The behavioral component consists of muscular movements that are
appropriate to the situation that elicits them. Autonomic responses
facilitate the behaviors and provide quick mobilization of energy for
vigorous movement. Hormonal responses reinforce the autonomic responses.

Research with Laboratory Animals LO 11.2

Outline evidence for the roles of the amygdala and ventromedial
prefrontal cortex in animal models of emotion.

The amygdala organizes behavioral, autonomic, and hormonal responses to
a variety of situations, including those that produce fear, anger, or
disgust. It receives inputs from the olfactory system, the association
cortex of the temporal lobe, the frontal cortex, and the rest of the
limbic system. Its outputs go to the frontal cortex, hypothalamus,
hippocampal formation, and brain stem nuclei that control autonomic
functions and some species-typical behaviors. Electrical recordings of
single neurons in the amygdala indicate that some of them respond when
the animal perceives particular stimuli with emotional significance.
Stimulating the amygdala leads to emotional responses, and destroying it
disrupts them. Pairing neutral stimuli with those that elicit emotional

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 344

responses results in classically conditioned emotional responses.
Learning these responses takes place primarily in the amygdala.
Extinction of conditioned emotional responses involves inhibitory
control of amygdala activity by the vmPFC.

Research with Humans LO 11.3

Describe the roles of the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in
human emotion.

Functional-imaging and lesion studies with humans indicate that the
amygdala is involved in emotional conditioning and emotional memory in
our species, too. However, many of our conditioned emotional responses
are acquired by observing the responses of other people or even through
verbal instruction. The vmPFC plays an important role in extinction of a
conditioned emotional response.

Thought Question Phobias can be seen as dramatic examples of condi­
tioned emotional responses. These responses can even be contagious. We
can acquire them without direct experience with an aversive stimulus.
For example, a child who sees a parent show signs of fear in the
presence of a dog may also develop a fear reaction to the dog. Do you
think that some biases or prejudices might be learned in this way, too?

Emotion 345

Aggression Almost all species of animals engage in aggressive behaviors,
which involve threatening gestures or actual attacks directed toward
other animals. Aggressive behaviors are species-typical, which means
that the patterns of movements (for example, posturing, biting,
striking, or hissing) are organized by neural circuits whose development
is largely programmed by an animal's genes. Many aggressive behaviors
are related to reproduction. For example, aggressive behaviors that gain
access to mates, defend territory needed to attract mates or to provide
a site for building a nest, or defend offspring against intruders can
all be regarded as reproductive behaviors. Other aggressive behaviors
are related to self-defense, such as that of an animal threatened by a
predator or an intruder of the same species. Aggressive behaviors can
consist of actual attacks, or they may simply involve threat behaviors,
which consist of postures or gestures that warn the adversary to leave
or it will become the target of an attack. The threatened animal might
show defensive behaviors---threat behaviors or an actual attack against
the animal that is threatening it---or it might show submissive
behaviors---behaviors that indicate that it accepts defeat and will not
challenge the other animal. In the natural environment most animals
display far more threats than actual attacks. Threat behaviors are
useful in reinforcing social hierarchies in organized groups of animals
or in warning intruders away from an animal's territory. They have the
advantage of not involving actual fighting, which can harm one or both
of the combatants. Predation involves a member of one species attacking
a member of another species, usually for food. While engaged in
attacking a member of the same species or defending itself against the
attack, activity of the sympathetic branch of an animal's autonomic
nervous system is high. In contrast, a predatory attack lacks a high
level of sympathetic activation. A predator is not angry with its prey;
attacking the prey is simply a means to an end.

Research with Laboratory Animals LO 11.4

Distinguish the roles of serotonin and neural circuitry in animal models
of aggression and predation.

The motor behaviors that an animal displays during aggression are
programmed by neural circuits in the brain stem. Whether an animal
attacks depends on many factors, including the nature of the eliciting
stimuli in the environment and the animal's previous experience. The
activity of the brain stem circuits appears to be controlled by the
hypothalamus and the amygdala, which also influence many

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 345

other species-typical behaviors. The activity of the limbic system is
controlled by perceptual systems that detect the status of the
environment, including the presence of other animals. A series of
studies by Shaikh, Siegel, and their colleagues (reviewed by Gregg &
Siegel, 2001) investigated the neural circuitry involved in aggressive
attack and predation by recording from the brains of cats. They found
that aggressive attack and predation can be elicited by stimulation of
different parts of the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG). In addition,
the hypothalamus and amygdala influence attack and predation behaviors
through excitatory and inhibitory connections with the PAG. Three
principal regions of the amygdala and two regions of the hypothalamus
affect defensive rage and predation, both of which appear to be
organized by the PAG. A possible connection between the lateral
hypothalamus and the ventral PAG has not yet been verified. Figure 11.7
summarizes some of the neural connections involved in predation and
defensive behavior.

ROLE OF SEROTONIN The cumulative results of many studies suggest that
the activity of serotonergic synapses inhibits aggression (e.g., Audero
et al., 2013). In contrast, destruction of serotonergic axons in the
forebrain (Vergnes et al., 1988) or targeted mutation to reduce
serotonin synthesis (Mosienko et al., 2012) facilitates aggressive
attack, presumably by removing an inhibitory effect. Genetic studies
with a variety of species confirm that serotonin has an inhibitory role
in aggression. For example, selective breeding of rats and silver foxes
has yielded animals that display tameness and friendly responses to
human contact, and these animals show increased brain levels of
serotonin and 5-HIAA (a metabolite of serotonin) (Popova, 2006).
Selectively bred tame foxes show genetic alterations that support the
conclusion that changes in the serotonin systems are involved in their
lack of aggressive behaviors (Wang et al., 2018). A group of researchers
has studied the relationship between serotonergic activity and
aggressiveness in a free-ranging colony of rhesus monkeys (reviewed by
Howell et al., 2007). The researchers assessed serotonergic activity by
capturing the monkeys, removing a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, and
analyzing it for 5-HIAA. When serotonin 5-HT is released, most of the
neurotransmitter is taken back into the terminal buttons by means of
reuptake, but some escapes and is broken down to 5-HIAA, which finds its
way into the cerebrospinal fluid. High levels of 5-HIAA in the CSF
indicate an elevated level of serotonergic activity. The researchers
found that young male monkeys with the lowest levels of 5-HIAA showed a
pattern of risk-taking behavior, including high levels of aggression
directed toward animals that were older and much larger than themselves.
These individuals were much more likely to take dangerous unprovoked
long leaps from tree to tree at a height of more than 7 m (27.6 ft).
They were also more likely to pick fights that they could not possibly
win. Of the preadolescent male monkeys that the investigators followed
for 4 years, a large percentage of those with the lowest 5-HIAA levels
died, while all of the monkeys with the highest levels survived. (See
Figure 11.8.) Most of the monkeys that died were killed by other
monkeys. In fact, the first monkey to be killed had the lowest level of
5-HIAA and was seen attacking two mature males the night before his
death. Serotonin does not simply inhibit aggression; rather, it exerts a
controlling influence on risky behavior, which includes aggression. The
monkeys low in 5-HIAA weren't just more inclined to attack other
animals, they were also more likely to take bigger risks, such as taking
longer leaps between trees.

Steve was hyperactive, irritable, and disobedient as a toddler . . . .
After dropping out of school at age 14, Steve spent his teen years
fighting, stealing, taking drugs, and beating up girlfriends . . . .
School counseling, a probation officer, and meetings with child
protective services failed to forestall disaster: At 19, several weeks
after his last interview with researchers, Steve visited a girlfriend
who had recently dumped him, found her with another man, and shot him to
death. The same day he tried to kill himself. Now he's serving a life
sentence without parole. (Holden, 2000, p. 580) Steve's case illustrates
the emergence of aggressive behaviors early in life. This case also
demonstrates a pervasive pattern of aggressive behavior. Neuroscience
research has begun to reveal some of the factors involved in aggressive
behavior in humans. In this section, we will look at two factors
associated with human aggression: heredity and serotonin. ROLE OF
HEREDITY Early experiences can foster later aggressive behavior, but
studies have shown that heredity plays a significant role as well. For
example, Viding and colleagues (2005, 2008) studied a group of same-sex
twins at the ages of 7 years and 9 years and found a higher correlation
between monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins on measures of antisocial
behavior and levels of callous, unemotional behavior, which indicates a
genetic component in development of these traits. Various studies have
suggested that the heritability of aggression ranges from about 50
percent to 65 percent; however, additional research to better understand
the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is still needed (Waltes et al.,
2016).

08/11/2021 20:18

Emotion 347

Which inherited genes are responsible for aggressive behavior? It is
unlikely that one gene (or even a small number of genes) is solely
responsible for aggressive behavior. Some researchers have become
interested in the heritability of genes involved in serotonin signaling
and aggression (you'll read more about the role of serotonin in human
aggression next). Changes in genes that regulate the production of
tryptophan hydroxylase (an enzyme involved in serotonin synthesis),
serotonin receptors, serotonin transporters, and monoamine oxidases
(MAOs; enzymes that inactivate serotonin) may be involved in the
heritability of aggressive behaviors (Waltes et al., 2016). A recent
study identified a variety of genes associated with human aggression,
including genes involved in serotonin and dopamine signaling
(Zhang-James & Faraone, 2016). In a study using a different
methodological approach, researchers confirmed the finding of genes
associated with serotonin and dopamine signaling, as well as
hormonerelated genes, involved in aggressive behavior (Fernàndez--
Castillo & Cormand, 2016). Because aggressive behavior is more common in
men than women, the Y chromosome is another candidate of interest. You
have already read about the role of serotonin in aggressive behavior,
but why did dopamine genes turn up in multiple genetic studies?
Aggressive behaviors involve the mesolimbic dopamine system, possibly
because it provides the motivation to engage in the behavior. Drugs that
block dopamine receptors reduce aggression. However, the role of
dopamine in aggression is complicated. Some studies that have used
genetic manipulations to alter dopamine signaling have reported
conflicting results among measures of aggression (for review, see Nelson
& Trainor, 2007). ROLE OF SEROTONIN Some, but not all, studies have
found that serotonergic neurons play an inhibitory role in

human aggression (Duke et al., 2013). Reduced serotonin release
(indicated by low levels of 5-HIAA in the CSF) is associated with
aggression and other forms of antisocial behavior, including assault,
arson, murder, and child abuse (Lidberg et al., 1984, 1985; Virkkunen et
al., 1989). Among men with a history of aggression, those with the
lowest serotonergic activity were most likely to have close relatives
with a history of similar behavior problems (Coccaro et al., 1994). On
the other hand, more recent studies have reported a very weak inverse
relationship between serotonin and aggression, suggesting that more
research is needed (Duke et al., 2013). If low levels of serotonin
release contribute to aggression, drugs that act as serotonin agonists
might help to reduce aggressive behavior. Coccaro and colleagues found
that fluoxetine (Prozac), a serotonin agonist, decreased irritability
and aggressiveness (1997), and reduced impulsive aggression (Coccaro,
Lee, & Kavoussi, 2009). Figure 11.9 depicts some of the neuronal and
molecular pathways involved in serotonergic regulation of aggression.

Hormonal Control of Aggressive Behavior LO 11.6

Critique the role of hormones in aggression.

Many instances of aggressive behavior are related to reproduction. For
example, males of some species establish territories that attract
females during the breeding season. To do so, they must defend the
territories against the intrusion of other males. Even in species in
which breeding does not depend on establishing a territory, males may
compete for access to females, competition that also involves aggressive
behavior. Females, too, often compete with other

which to rear their offspring, and they will defend their offspring
against the intrusion of other animals. As you learned in Chapter 10,
most reproductive behaviors are controlled by the organizational and
activational effects of hormones; therefore, it makes sense that many
forms of aggressive behavior are, like mating, affected by hormones. Two
adult female rodents that meet in a neutral territory are less likely
than males to fight. But aggression between females, like aggression
between males, appears to be facilitated by testosterone. Van de Poll
and colleagues (1988) ovariectomized female rats and then gave them
daily injections of testosterone, estradiol, or a placebo for 14 days.
The animals were then placed in a test cage, and an unfamiliar female
was introduced. As Figure 11.10 shows, testosterone increased
aggressiveness, whereas estradiol had no effect. Androgens have an
organizational effect on the aggressiveness of females, and a certain
amount of prenatal androgenization appears to occur naturally. Most
rodent fetuses share their mother's uterus with brothers and sisters,
arranged in a row like peas in a pod. A female mouse may have zero, one,
or two brothers adjacent to her. Researchers refer to these females as
0M, 1M, or 2M, respectively. (See Figure 11.11.) Being next to a male
fetus has an effect on a female's blood levels of androgens prenatally.
Vom Saal and Bronson (1980) found that females located between two males
had significantly higher levels of testosterone in their blood than did
females located between two females (or between a female and the end of
the uterus). When they are tested as adults, 2M females are more likely
to exhibit interfemale aggressiveness. Females of some primate species
(for example, rhesus monkeys and baboons) are more likely to engage in
fights around the time of ovulation (Carpenter, 1942; Saayman,

1971). This phenomenon is probably caused by their increased sexual
interest and consequent proximity to males. Another period of fighting
occurs just before menstruation (Mallow, 1979; Sassenrath et al., 1973).
During this time, females tend to attack other females. In humans,
progesterone levels in the luteal phase (before menstruation) appear to
be related to aggression in women. Low concentrations of progesterone in
the luteal phase were associated with high levels of selfreported
aggression and irritability (Ziomkiewicz et al., 2012). Denson and
colleagues (2018) synthesized the results of behavioral neuroscience
studies of aggression in women. Figure 11.12 summarizes key findings
related to prenatal neural and hormonal factors associated with
aggression in women. AGGRESSION IN MALES Adult males of many species
fight for territory or access to females. In laboratory rodents,
androgen secretion occurs prenatally, decreases, and then increases
again at the time of puberty. Intermale aggressiveness also begins
around the time of puberty, which suggests that the behavior is
controlled by neural circuits that are stimulated by androgens. It has
long been known that castration reduces aggressiveness, and injections
of testosterone reinstate it (Beeman, 1947). In Chapter 10 we saw that
early androgenization has an organizational effect. The secretion of
androgens early in development modifies the developing brain, making
neural circuits that control male sexual behavior become more responsive
to testosterone. Similarly, early androgenization has an organizational
effect that stimulates the development of

testosterone-sensitive neural circuits that facilitate intermale
aggression after activational hormone exposure at puberty. The
organizational effect of androgens on intermale aggression (aggressive
displays or actual fights between two males of the same species) is
important, but it is not an all-or-none phenomenon. Prolonged
administration of testosterone will eventually induce intermale
aggression even in rodents that were castrated immediately after birth.
Exposure to androgens early in life decreases the amount of exposure
that is necessary to activate aggressive behavior later in life (vom
Saal, 1983). Thus, early androgenization sensitizes the neural circuits:
The earlier the androgenization, the more effective is the
sensitization. (See Figure 11.13.) In Chapter 10 we also saw that
androgens stimulate male sexual behavior by interacting with androgen
receptors in neurons located in the medial preoptic area (MPA). This
region appears to be important in mediating the effects of androgens on
intermale aggression as well. Implanting testosterone in the MPA
reinstated intermale aggression in castrated male rats (Bean & Conner,
1978). Presumably, the testosterone directly activated the behavior by
stimulating the androgen-sensitive neurons located there. The MPA
appears to be involved in several behaviors related

to reproduction: male sexual behavior, maternal behavior, and intermale
aggression. Males of most species more readily attack other males but
usually do not attack females. Their ability to discriminate the sex of
the intruder appears to be based on the presence of particular
pheromones. Intermale aggression was abolished in mice by cutting the
vomeronasal nerve, which

08/11/2021 20:18

350 Chapter 11 deprives the brain of input from the vomeronasal organ
(Bean, 1982). And if the urine of female mice is painted on a male
mouse, he will not be attacked if he is introduced into another male's
cage (Dixon, 1973; Dixon & Mackintosh, 1971). A targeted mutation
against proteins that are essential for the detection of pheromones by
the vomeronasal organ abolishes a male mouse's ability to discriminate
between males and females. Because male intruders were not recognized as
rival males, they were not attacked. In fact, the mice with the targeted
mutation attempted to copulate with the intruders (Prince et al., 2013;
Stowers et al., 2002). EFFECTS OF ANDROGENS ON HUMAN AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR
Testosterone is often the first thing people

associate with human aggressive behavior. However, the relationship
between testosterone and human behavior is more complicated than it's
often made out to be. As Sapolsky (2017) notes: Additional studies show
that testosterone promotes prosociality in the right setting. In one,
under circumstances where someone's sense of pride rides on honesty,
testosterone decreased men's cheating in a game. In another, subjects
decided how much of a sum of money they would keep and how much they
would publicly contribute to a common pool shared by all the players;
testosterone made most subjects more prosocial. What does this mean?
Testosterone makes us more willing to do what it takes to attain and
maintain status. And the key point is what it takes. Engineer social
circumstances right, and boosting testosterone levels during a challenge
would make people compete like crazy to do the most acts of random
kindness." (Sapolsky, 2017, p. 107) Several lines of research support
the conclusion that testosterone does not automatically increase
aggression. For example, administering testosterone in lab settings
increases activity of the amygdala, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal
gray region (areas important in detecting a threat), but only in
response to viewing angry faces (Goetz et al., 2014; Hermans et al.,
2008; Radke et al., 2015; van Wingen et al., 2009). Other studies have
reported that administering testosterone increased aggressive behavior
and competitive motivation, but only among men and women who were
already high in trait dominance (a characteristic of being assertive,
forceful, and self-assured). A follow-up study found that testosterone
only increased aggression among men who had traits of high dominance and
low impulse control (Carré et al., 2017). In another study, some
participants who received testosterone were more prosocial and generous
in a game that involved responding to high and low offers of money. The
effects of testosterone depended on the context. In response to an
unfair offer, testosterone increased punishment and aggression. In
response to a generous offer, testosterone increased generosity (Dreher
et al., 2016).

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 350

Under different circumstances, repeated use of high doses of
testosterone can increase aggressive behavior in rodent models (Wood,
2008; Wood et al., 2013). What mechanisms might be responsible for
increased aggression? Testosterone does not seem to increase motivation
for aggression or decrease impulse control directly. Instead,
testosterone must increase aggression through another means. Some
research suggests testosterone increases aggression through
disinhibition, meaning that a behavior that would typically be inhibited
(e.g., attacking another individual) is not, making it more likely to
occur (Wood et al., 2013). Taken together, the research on testosterone
suggests that this hormone increases the behaviors that help an
individual secure a high social status. Depending on the context and the
traits of the individual, testosterone might increase aggression, or it
might increase prosocial behaviors, (for review, see Carré & Archer,
2018). Figure 11.14 illustrates the influence of testosterone on some of
the different strategies used by rodents and humans to achieve and
maintain high status. Notice the variety and flexibility available in
the wide range of human social status behaviors that may be influenced
by testosterone. The remainder of this module describes research on the
organizational and activational effects of hormones, the environment,
and alcohol, and their roles in human aggression. ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTS
Prenatal androgenization increases aggressive behavior in all species
that have been studied, including primates. After puberty, androgens
also begin to have activational effects. Boys' testosterone levels begin
to increase during the early teens, at which time aggressive behavior
and intermale fighting also increase (Mazur, 1983). Boys' social status
changes during puberty, and testosterone affects their muscles as well
as their brains, so we cannot be certain that the effect is hormonally
produced or, if it is, that it is mediated by the brain. As we saw
earlier in this chapter, the small amount of prenatal exposure to
androgens that a 2M female rodent receives has measurable organizational
effects on aggressive behavior. Cohen-Bendahan and colleagues (2005a)
­compared the proneness to aggression in 13-year-old female dizygotic
twins who had shared the uterus with a brother (1M females) with those
who had shared it with a sister (0M ­females). They found a modest but
statistically significant increase in aggressiveness in the 1M girls.
The testosterone levels of the 1M and 0M girls did not differ, so the
­increased aggressiveness may have been a result of increased prenatal
exposure to androgens. It is impossible to rule out the ­possibility that
being raised with a same-aged brother might have an effect on a girl's
proneness to aggression too. As we saw in Chapter 10, girls with
congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are exposed to unusually high
levels of androgens---produced by their own adrenal glands--- during
prenatal development. The effects of this exposure

include a preference for boys as playmates, interest in toys and games
that boys typically prefer, and, in adulthood, an increased prevalence
of sexual attraction to other women. Parental socialization and
biological differences contribute to sex-typical toy play, but not other
characteristics such as spatial ability (Wong et al., 2012). Berenbaum
and Resnick (1997) found that women and adolescent girls with CAH
displayed higher levels of aggression, as measured by parents' ratings
and paper-and-pencil tests. Scientifically rigorous evidence concerning
the activational effects of androgens on aggression in adulthood is
difficult to obtain in humans. In the past, authorities attempted to
suppress aggression by castrating convicted male sex offenders.
Investigators reported that aggressive attacks disappeared, along with
the offender's sex drive (Hawke, 1951; Laschet, 1973; Sturup, 1961).
However, the studies typically lack appropriate control groups and
usually do not measure aggressive behavior directly. Some perpetrators
of aggression, especially sexual assault, have been treated with
synthetic steroids that inhibit the production of androgens by the
testes. Treatment with drugs may be preferable to castration because the
effects of drugs are reversible. However, the efficacy of treatment with
antiandrogens has yet to be established conclusively. According to
Walker and Meyer (1981), these drugs decrease sex-related aggression but
have no effect on other forms of aggression. In fact, Zumpe and
colleagues (1991) found that one of these drugs decreased sexual
activity

and aggression toward females when administered to male monkeys but
actually increased intermale aggression. Another way to determine
whether androgens affect aggressiveness in humans is to examine the
testosterone levels of people who exhibit varying levels of aggressive
behavior. However, even though this approach poses fewer ethical
problems, it presents methodological ones. First, let's review some
evidence. In a review of the literature, Archer (1994) found that most
studies found a positive relationship between men's testosterone levels
and their level of aggressiveness. For example, Dabbs and Morris (1990)
studied 4,462 U.S. military veterans. The men with the highest
testosterone levels had records of more antisocial activities, including
assaults on other adults and histories of more trouble with parents,
teachers, and classmates during adolescence. The largest effects were
seen in men of lower socioeconomic status. Similar to testosterone's
role in achieving social status, Mazur and Booth (1998) suggest that the
primary social effect of androgens may be on dominance. If androgens
enhance motivation to dominate others, that motivation may sometimes
lead to aggression but not in all situations. For example, a person
might strive to defeat others symbolically (through athletic competition
or acquisition of symbols of status) rather than through direct
aggression. Role of Environment In any event we must remember that
correlation does not necessarily indicate causation. A person's
environment can affect his or her testosterone level. For example,
losing a competition causes a fall in blood levels of

352 Chapter 11

Anabolic Steroids As news reports have publicized, some athletes take
anabolic steroids to increase their muscle mass and strength and,
supposedly, to increase their competitiveness. Anabolic steroids include
natural androgens and synthetic hormones with androgenic effects. We
might expect that these hormones would increase aggressiveness, a
response sometimes called "roid rage" in popular media. Anabolic
steroids are used by less than 1 percent of the population in United
States and other countries (e. g., Sweden, and Australia) (Dunn, 2015).
Yates and colleagues (1992) found that male weight lifters who were
taking anabolic steroids were more aggressive and hostile than those who
were not. While, approximately 40 percent of anabolic steroid users
report increased aggression, approximately 60 percent do not (Dunn,
2015). The role of anabolic steroid use in aggression is not yet clear,
and we cannot be certain that steroid use is responsible for the
increased aggressiveness; it could be that the men who were already more
competitive and aggressive are more likely to choose to take steroids
(Dunn, 2015; Yates et al., 1992). Alcohol An interesting set of
experiments with another species of primates might have some relevance
to human

testosterone (Elias, 1981; Mazur & Lamb, 1980). Even winning or losing a
game of chance carried out in a psychology laboratory can affect
participants' testosterone levels: Winners feel better afterward and
have a higher level of testosterone (McCaul et al., 1992). Bernhardt and
colleagues (1998) found that basketball and soccer fans showed an
increase in testosterone levels if their team won and a decrease if it
lost. People adopting open, expressive postures (called "power poses")
may experience an increase in testosterone levels and feelings of power,
but not necessarily aggression (Carney et al., 2010). However, some
researchers have critiqued the "power pose" research and failed to
replicate the changes in testosterone (Crede & Phillips, 2017; Ranehill
et al., 2015; Smith & Apicella, 2017). We cannot be sure in any
correlational study that high testosterone levels cause people to become
dominant or aggressive; perhaps their success in establishing a position
of dominance increases their testosterone levels relative to those of
the people they dominate.

aggression and alcohol use. Evidence suggests that the effects of
alcohol may interact with those of androgens. Winslow and Miczek (1985,
1988) found that alcohol increases intermale aggression in dominant male
squirrel monkeys, but only during the mating season, when their blood
level of testosterone is two to three times higher than that during the
nonmating season. These studies suggest that the effects of alcohol
interact both with social status and with testosterone. (See Figure
11.15.) This suggestion was confirmed by Winslow and colleagues (1988),
who tested monkeys during the nonmating season. They found that alcohol
increased the aggressive behavior of dominant monkeys if the monkeys
were also given injections of testosterone. However, these treatments
were ineffective in subordinate monkeys, which presumably had learned
not to be aggressive. The next step will be to find the neural
mechanisms that are responsible for these interactions.

Module Review: Aggression Research with Laboratory Animals LO 11.4

Distinguish the roles of serotonin and neural circuitry in animal models
of aggression and predation.

Aggressive behaviors are species-typical and serve useful functions most
of the time. The PAG appears to be involved in defensive behavior and
predation. These

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 352

mechanisms are modulated by the hypothalamus and amygdala. The activity
of serotonergic neurons appears to inhibit risk-taking behaviors,
including aggression. Destruction of serotonergic axons in the forebrain
enhances aggression, and administration of drugs that facilitate
serotonergic transmission reduces it. Low CSF levels of 5-HIAA (a
metabolite of serotonin) are correlated with increased risk-taking and
aggressive

behavior in monkeys. High levels of brain serotonin and 5-HIAA in rats
and silver foxes are associated with reduced aggression.

Low CSF levels of 5-HIAA are correlated with increased risk-taking and

Impulse Control Many investigators believe that impulsive violence is a
consequence of faulty emotional regulation. For many of us, frustrations
may elicit an urge to respond emotionally, but we usually manage to calm
ourselves and suppress these urges. The ventromedial prefrontal
cortex---which includes the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the
subgenual anterior cingulate cortex---plays an important role in
regulating our responses to such situations.

Role of the vmPFC LO 11.7

Describe the role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in impulse
control.

You read earlier about the role of the vmPFC in inhibiting a conditioned
fear response. Similarly, the vmPFC is involved in inhibiting emotional
behavior, such as impulsive violence or aggression. The importance of
the vmPFC in control of emotional behavior is demonstrated by the
effects of damage to this region. One famous case comes from the
mid-1800s. Phineas Gage, the foreman of a railway construction crew, was
using a steel rod to ram a charge of blasting powder into a hole that
had been drilled in solid rock. Suddenly, the charge exploded and sent
the rod into his cheek, through his brain, and out the top of his head.
(See Figure 11.16.) He survived, but by many accounts he was a different
man. Before his injury, Gage was described as serious, industrious, and
energetic. Afterward, he was described as childish, irresponsible, and
thoughtless of others. Some accounts suggested that he was unable to
make or carry out plans, and his actions and mood appeared

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 353

social status, testosterone can increase generosity. When it does
increase aggression, testosterone may do so through disinhibition.
Androgens primarily affect offensive attack. They are not necessary for
defensive behaviors, which are shown by females as well as males.
Research suggests that the primary effect of androgens may be to
increase motivation to achieve dominance and that increased aggression
may be secondary to this effect. It is not clear whether higher androgen
levels promote dominance or whether successful dominance increases
androgen levels.

Thought Question From the point of view of evolution, aggressive
behavior and a tendency to establish dominance have useful functions. In
particular, they increase the likelihood that only the healthiest and
most vigorous animals will reproduce. Can you think of examples of
beneficial and detrimental effects of these tendencies among members of
our own species?

to be prone to sudden changes. It was initially believed that his
accident largely destroyed the vmPFC bilaterally (Damasio et al., 1994);
however, some researchers have suggested that the damage was limited to
the left vmPFC only (Ratiu and Ion-Florin, 2004). In addition, a
reexamination of the historical evidence suggests that Gage may have
made substantial recovery following the accident, with less impairment
to his emotional and impulse control than initially believed, consistent
with damage to only one half of the vmPFC (Macmillan & Lena, 2010).
Gage's controversial accident aside, damage to the vmPFC causes serious
and often debilitating impairments of behavioral control and decision
making. These impairments appear to be a consequence of emotional
dysregulation. People whose vmPFC has been damaged by disease or
accident are still able to accurately assess the significance of
particular situations but only in a theoretical sense. For example,
patient E. R. experienced bilateral damage of the vmPFC produced by a
benign tumor, which was successfully removed (Eslinger & Damasio, 1985).
E. R. displayed excellent social judgment and when he was given
hypothetical situations involving moral, ethical, or practical dilemmas
and asked what the people involved should do, he always gave sensible
answers and justified them with carefully reasoned logic. However, his
own life was a different matter. He spent his life's savings, lost one
job after another, and was unable to distinguish between trivial
decisions and important ones. Eventually, his wife left him and sued for
divorce. Although E. R. "had learned and used normal patterns of social
behavior before his brain lesion, and . . . could recall such patterns .
. . real-life situations failed to evoke them" (p. 1737).

Evidence suggests that the vmPFC serves as an interface between brain
mechanisms involved in automatic emotional responses (both learned and
unlearned) and those involved in the control of complex behaviors. This
role includes using our emotional reactions to guide our behavior and in
controlling the occurrence of emotional reactions in various social
situations. Anderson and colleagues (2006) obtained ratings of emotional
behaviors of patients with lesions of the vmPFC, such as frustration
tolerance, emotional instability, anxiety, and irritability, from the
patients' relatives. They also obtained ratings of the patients'
real-world competencies, such as judgment, planning, social
inappropriateness, and financial and occupational status, from both
relatives and clinicians. They found a significant correlation between
emotional dysfunction and impairments in real-world competencies. There
was no relationship between cognitive abilities and realworld
competencies, which strongly suggests that emotional problems lie at the
base of the real-world difficulties exhibited by people with vmPFC
damage. Raine and colleagues (1998) found evidence of decreased
prefrontal activity and increased subcortical activity (including the
amygdala) in the brains of c­ onvicted murderers. These changes were
primarily seen in impulsive,

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 354

emotional murderers. Cold-blooded, calculating, predatory
murderers---whose crimes were not a­ ccompanied by anger and
rage---showed more typical patterns of brain activity. Presumably,
increased activation of the amygdala reflected an increased tendency for
display of negative emotions, and the decreased activation of the
prefrontal cortex reflected a decreased ability to inhibit the activity
of the amygdala and control the emotions. Similarly, Raine and
colleagues (2000) found that people with antisocial personality disorder
showed an 11 percent reduction in volume of the gray matter of the
prefrontal cortex. An interesting functional-imaging study by Nili and
colleagues (2010) suggests that the vmPFC plays a role in brain
mechanisms of courage. Nili and his colleagues scanned the brains of
people who were or were not afraid of snakes. While the people were in
the scanner, they could press buttons that controlled the action of a
conveyer belt that brought a live snake toward or away from them. People
who were not afraid of snakes brought the snake near them and showed no
signs of fear. However, people who were afraid of snakes did show signs
of fear as the snake approached. Some of the fearful people pressed the
button that moved the snake away from them, but others brought the snake
near to them, even though they were clearly afraid.

Figure 11.17 Role of the vmPFC The participants' task was to reach
maximal proximity to either a live snake or a toy bear, by repeatedly
choosing whether to bring the object closer or move it away, while
undergoing fMRI brain scanning. A display of courage was accompanied by
activation of a region of the vmPFC, the subgenual anterior cingulate
cortex. Source: Nili, U., Goldberg, H., Weizman, A., and Dudai, Y.

In other words, they showed courage---they overcame their fear. A
display of courage was accompanied by activation of a region of the
vmPFC, the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Participants who
succumbed to their fear---that is, those who moved the snake away---did
not show activation of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. (See
Figure 11.17.)

Brain Development and Impulse Control LO 11.8

Provide evidence for a developmental factor in impulse control.

Many investigators believe that impulsive violence is a consequence of
faulty emotional regulation. The amygdala plays an important role in
provoking anger and violent emotional reactions, and the prefrontal
cortex plays an important role in suppressing such behavior by making us
see its negative consequences. The amygdala matures early in
development, but the prefrontal cortex matures much later, during late
childhood and early adulthood. (See Figure 11.18.) As

the prefrontal cortex matures, adolescents show increases in speed of
cognitive processing, abstract reasoning ability, ability to shift
attention from one topic to another, and ability to inhibit
inappropriate responses (Yurgelun-Todd, 2007). In fact, a structural
imaging study by Whittle and colleagues (2008) found that aggressive
behavior during parent--child interactions in adolescence was positively
related to the volume of the amygdala and negatively related to the
relative volume of the right medial prefrontal cortex.

Serotonin and Impulse Control LO 11.9

Explain the role of serotonin in impulse control regulation.

Earlier in this chapter we saw that decreased activity of serotonergic
neurons is associated with aggression, violence, and risk taking. As we
saw, decreased activity of the prefrontal cortex is also associated with
antisocial behavior. These two facts appear to be linked. The prefrontal
cortex receives a major projection of serotonergic axons. Research

356 Chapter 11 indicates that serotonergic input to the prefrontal
cortex activates this region. For example, a functional-imaging study by
Mann and colleagues (1996) showed that fenfluramine, a drug that
stimulates the release of 5-HT, increases the activity of the prefrontal
cortex, which presumably inhibits the activity of the amygdala and
suppresses aggressive behavior. Crockett and colleagues (2010) found
that a single high dose of a 5-HT agonist decreased the likelihood of
participants making a decision to cause harm in scenarios that presented
moral dilemmas. It seems likely, therefore, that an abnormally low level
of serotonin release can result in decreased activity of the prefrontal
cortex and increased likelihood of utilitarian judgments (the next
module includes more information about utilitarian judgments) or, in the
extreme, antisocial behavior. Several studies have found evidence for
deficits in serotonergic innervation of the PFC associated with
impulsive behavior. New and colleagues (2002) found that a
serotonin-releasing drug increased the activity of the orbitofrontal
cortex in healthy, nonviolent participants but failed to do so in
participants with a history of impulsive aggression. A
functional-imaging study found evidence for lower levels of serotonin
transporters in the medial prefrontal cortex of people with impulsive
aggression (Frankle et al., 2005). Because serotonin transporters are
found in the membrane of serotonergic terminal buttons, this study
suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex of people in this sample
contains decreased serotonergic input. As we saw earlier, impulsive
aggression has been successfully treated with selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine. A functional-imaging study by
New and colleagues (2004) measured regional brain activity of people
with histories of impulsive aggression before and after 12 weeks of
treatment with fluoxetine. They found that the drug increased the
activity of the prefrontal cortex and reduced aggressiveness.

Moral Decision Making LO 11.10

Describe the brain regions involved in emotional aspects of moral
decision making involving impulse control.

Evidence suggests that emotional reactions guide moral judgments as well
as decisions involving personal risks and rewards and that the
prefrontal cortex plays a role in these judgments as well. In the past,
moral judgments were believed to be a product of conscious, rational
decision making. However, recent research on the role of neural
mechanisms of emotion suggests that emotions play an important
role---perhaps the most important role---in the formation of moral
judgments. Consider the following moral dilemma (Thomson, 1986): You see
a runaway trolley hurtling down a track leading to a cliff. There are
five people on the track. Without your

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 356

intervention these people will soon die. However, you are standing near
a switch that will shunt the trolley off to another track, where the
vehicle will stop safely. But there is another person on that track, and
he will be killed if you throw the switch to save the five people on the
other track. Should you stand by and watch the trolley kill the five
people, or should you save them---and kill the man on the other track?
Most people conclude that the better choice would be to throw the
switch; saving five people justifies the sacrifice of one man. This
decision is based on conscious, logical application of a rule that it is
better to kill one person than five people. But consider a variation of
this dilemma. As before, the trolley is hurtling toward doom, but there
is no switch at hand to shunt it to another track. Instead, you are
standing on a bridge over the track. A very large man is standing there
too, and if you give him a push, his body will fall onto the track and
stop the trolley. (In this scenario, you are too small to stop the
trolley, so you cannot save the five people by sacrificing yourself.)
What should you do? (See Figure 11.19.) Most people feel repugnance at
the thought of pushing the man off the bridge and balk at the idea of
doing so, even though the result would be the same as the first dilemma:
one person lost, five people saved. Whether we kill someone by sending a
trolley his way or by pushing him off a bridge into the path of an
oncoming trolley, he dies when the trolley strikes him. But somehow,
imagining yourself pushing a person's body and causing his death seems
more emotionally wrenching than throwing a switch that changes the
course of a runaway trolley. Thus, moral judgments appear to be guided
by emotional reactions and are not simply the products of rational,
logical decision-making processes. In a functional-imaging study, Greene
and colleagues (2001) presented people with moral dilemmas such as the
one we just described and found that thinking about them activated
several brain regions involved in emotional reactions, including the
vmPFC. Making innocuous decisions, such as whether to take a bus or
train to some destination, did not activate these regions. Perhaps,
then, our reluctance to push someone to his death is guided by the
unpleasant emotional reaction we feel when we contemplate this action.
Let's reconsider the contrast between the decision to throw a switch to
save five lives and the decision to shove someone onto the tracks to
accomplish the same goal. Consideration of the first dilemma generates a
much smaller emotional reaction than consideration of the second dilemma
does, and consideration of only the second dilemma strongly activates
the vmPFC. We might expect that people with vmPFC damage, who show
impairments of emotional reaction, might choose to push the man onto the
track in the second dilemma. In fact, that is exactly what they do.
Koenigs and colleagues (2007) presented nonmoral, impersonal moral, and
personal moral scenarios to patients with vmPFC lesions, patients with
brain damage not including this region, and healthy controls.

Figure 11.19 Moral Decision-Making Scenario: The Case of the Trolley In
scenario (a) a person must decide to throw a switch to save five people
or one person. In scenario (b) a person must decide to push a man off a
bridge to save five people. (a)

Table 11.2 lists examples of the scenarios that the investigators of the
study presented to their participants. Koenigs and his colleagues
predicted that patients with vmPFC lesions should make the same
decisions as participants in the other two groups on the nonmoral and
impersonal moral judgments, because these decisions are normally solved
rationally, without a strong emotional component. Only the outcome, or
utility, of the choice need be considered. However, the emotional
deficits of

patients with prefrontal damage would be expected to lead to utilitarian
judgments even in the case of personal moral ­judgments---and that is
precisely what was seen. The patients with vmPFC lesions were much more
likely to say "yes" to the question posed at the end of the scenarios.
Reluctance to push someone to his death even though that action would
save the lives of others might be caused by the unpleasant thought of
what it would feel like to commit that action and see the man fall to
his death. If this

Brownies (Nonmoral scenario) You have decided to make a batch of
brownies for yourself. You open your recipe book and find a recipe for
brownies. The recipe calls for a cup of chopped walnuts. You don't like
walnuts, but you do like macadamia nuts. As it happens, you have both
kinds of nuts available to you. Would you substitute macadamia nuts for
walnuts in order to avoid eating walnuts? Speedboat (Impersonal moral
scenario) While on vacation on a remote island, you are fishing from a
seaside dock. You observe a group of tourists board a small boat and set
sail for a nearby island. Soon after their departure you hear over the
radio that there is a violent storm brewing, a storm that is sure to
intercept them. The only way that you can ensure their safety is to warn
them by borrowing a nearby speedboat. The speedboat belongs to a miserly
tycoon who would not take kindly to your borrowing his property. Would
you borrow the speedboat in order to warn the tourists about the storm?
Lifeboat (Personal moral scenario) You are on a cruise ship when there
is a fire on board, and the ship has to be abandoned. The lifeboats are
carrying many more people than they were designed to carry. The lifeboat
you're in is sitting dangerously low in the water---a few inches lower,
and it will sink. The seas start to get rough, and the boat begins to
fill with water. If nothing is done it will sink before the rescue boats
arrive, and everyone on board will die. However, there is an injured
person who will not survive in any case. If you throw that person
overboard the boat will stay afloat and the remaining passengers will be
saved. Would you throw this person overboard in order to save the lives
of the remaining passengers?

358 Chapter 11 is true, then perhaps people with vmPFC lesions say that
they are willing to push the man off the bridge because thinking about
doing so does not evoke an unpleasant emotional reaction. In fact,
Moretto and collegues (2009) found that people without brain damage
showed physiological

signs of an unpleasant emotional reaction when they contemplated pushing
the man off the bridge---and said that they would not push him. People
with vmPFC lesions did not show signs of this emotional reaction---and
said that they would push him.

Module Review: Impulse Control Role of the vmPFC LO 11.7

Describe the role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in impulse
control.

The vmPFC plays an important role in emotional reactions. This region
communicates with the dorsomedial thalamus, temporal cortex, ventral
tegmental area, olfactory system, amygdala, cingulate cortex, lateral
hypothalamus, and other regions of the frontal cortex, including the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. People with vmPFC lesions show impulsive
behavior and often display outbursts of inappropriate anger. They are
able to explain the implications of complex social situations but often
respond inappropriately when they find themselves in these situations.
Decreased prefrontal activity and increased subcortical activity are
associated with impulsive, violent behavior. People with antisocial
personality disorder have reduced gray matter volume in the prefrontal
cortex. The activity of the vmPFC increases when people show courageous
behavior (impulse control)---letting a snake approach them even though
they fear snakes.

Brain Development and Impulse Control LO 11.8

Provide evidence for a developmental factor in impulse control.

The amygdala is part of a circuit involved in anger and violence and
matures before the prefrontal cortex, which suppresses violent behavior.
Research found that

Communication of Emotions As described earlier in this chapter, emotions
are organized responses (behavioral, autonomic, and hormonal) that
prepare an animal to deal with existing situations in the environment,
such as events that pose a threat to the organism. For our earliest
premammalian ancestors that is likely all there was to emotions. But
over time, other responses, with new functions, evolved. Many species of
animals (including our own) communicate their emotions to others through
postural changes, facial expressions, and nonverbal sounds (such as
sighs, screams, and growls). These expressions serve useful social
functions: They tell other individuals how we feel and---more
importantly---what we are likely to do. For

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 358

aggressive behavior during adolescence was positively related to the
volume of the amygdala and negatively related to the relative volume of
the right medial prefrontal cortex.

Serotonin and Impulse Control LO 11.9

Explain the role of serotonin in impulse control regulation.

Serotonergic input to the prefrontal cortex inhibits the amygdala and
suppresses aggressive and impulsive behavior. Increasing serotonergic
activity reduces impulsive behavior. The vmPFC of people with impulsive
aggression contains less dense serotonergic input.

Moral Decision Making LO 11.10 Describe the brain regions involved in
emotional aspects of moral decision making involving impulse control.
The vmPFC is involved in making moral judgments. When people make
judgments that involve conflicts between utilitarian judgments and
personal moral judgments, the vmPFC is activated. People with damage to
the vmPFC display utilitarian moral judgments.

Thought Question Is there value in understanding the neural basis of
moral behavior and decision making? How might this information be used
by clinicians, police, judges, jury members, or educators?

example, such expressions of emotion warn a rival that we are angry and
to stay away or tell friends that we are sad and would like some comfort
and reassurance. This module examines such expression and communication
of emotions.

Facial Expression of Emotions: Innate Responses LO 11.11

Describe evidence in support of emotional expressions as innate
responses.

Charles Darwin (1872/1965) suggested that human expressions of emotion
evolved from similar expressions in other animals. He said that
emotional expressions are innate,

08/11/2021 20:18

Emotion 359

unlearned responses consisting of a complex set of movements,
principally of the facial muscles. A person's sneer and a wolf's snarl
are biologically determined response patterns, both controlled by innate
brain mechanisms, just as are coughing and sneezing. (Of course, people
can sneer and wolves can snarl for quite different reasons.) Some of
these movements resemble the behaviors themselves and may have evolved
from them. For example, a snarl shows one's teeth and can be seen as an
anticipation of biting. Darwin obtained evidence for his conclusion that
emotional expressions were innate by observing his own children and by
corresponding with people living in various isolated cultures around the
world. He reasoned that if people all over the world, no matter how
isolated from each other, show the same facial expressions of emotion,
then these expressions must be inherited instead of learned. The logical
argument goes like this: When groups of people are isolated for many
years, they develop different languages. We can say that the words
people use are arbitrary; there is no biological basis for using
particular words to represent particular concepts. However, if facial
expressions are inherited, then they should take approximately the same
form in people from all cultures, despite their isolation from one
another. And Darwin did, indeed, find that people in different cultures
used the same patterns of movement of facial muscles to express a
particular emotional state. Classic research by Ekman and his colleagues
(Ekman & Friesen, 1971; Ekman, 1980) tends to confirm Darwin's
hypothesis that facial expression of emotion uses an innate,
species-typical repertoire of movements of facial muscles (Darwin,
1872/1965). For example, Ekman and Friesen (1971) studied the ability of
members of an isolated tribe in New Guinea to recognize facial
expressions of emotion produced by members of other cultures. They had
no trouble doing so, and they produced facial expressions that were
readily recognized by the researchers. Figure 11.20 shows four
photographs taken from videotapes of a man from this tribe reacting to
stories designed to evoke facial expressions of happiness, sadness,
anger, and disgust. Because the same facial expressions were used by
people who had not previously been exposed to each other, Ekman and
Friesen concluded that the expressions were innate, unlearned behavior
patterns. In contrast, different cultures use different words to express
particular concepts; production of these words does not involve innate
responses but must be learned. Other researchers have compared the
facial expressions of blind and sighted people. They reasoned that if
the facial expressions of the two groups are similar, then the
expressions are innate for our species and do not require learning by
imitation. In fact, the facial expressions of young blind and sighted
children are very similar (Woodworth & Schlosberg, 1954; Izard, 1971).
In addition, a study of the emotional expressions of people competing in
(and winning or losing) athletic events in the 2004 Paralympic Games
found no

differences between the expressions of congenitally blind,
noncongenitally blind, and sighted athletes (Matsumoto & Willingham,
2009). Both the cross-cultural studies and the investigations of blind
people confirm the innate quality of these facial expressions of
emotion. A study by Sauter and colleagues (2010) reached similar
conclusions. The investigators carried out a vocal version of the study
by Ekman and Friesen. They presented European English-speakers and
people living in isolated northern Namibian villages with recordings of
sounds of nonverbal vocalizations to situations that would be expected
to produce the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, or
amusement. The participants were told a story and then heard two
different vocalizations (sighs, groans, laughs, etc.), one of which
would be appropriate for the emotion produced by the story. Members of
both cultures had no difficulty choosing the correct vocalizations of
members of their culture and the other culture.

Neural Basis of the Communication of Emotions: Recognition LO 11.12

Summarize the neural basis of emotional recognition, including
laterality, direction of gaze, imitation, and disgust.

Effective communication is a two-way process. That is, the ability to

08/11/2021 20:18

360 Chapter 11 expression is useful only if other people are able to
recognize them. In fact, Kraut and Johnston (1979) unobtrusively
observed people in circumstances that would be likely to make them
happy. They found that happy situations (such as making a strike while
bowling, seeing the home team score, or experiencing a beautiful day)
produced only small signs of happiness when the people were alone.
However, when the people were interacting socially with other people,
they were much more likely to smile. For example, bowlers who made a
strike usually did not smile when the ball hit the pins, but rather when
they turned around to face their companions. Jones and colleagues (1991)
found that even 10-month-old children showed this tendency to display
emotion when an audience was present. Recognition of another person's
facial expression of emotions is generally automatic, rapid, and
accurate. Tracy and Robbins (2008) found that observers quickly
recognized brief expressions of a variety of emotions. If they were
given more time to think about the expression they had seen, the
participants showed very little improvement. Rapid assessments are
sometimes called "thin slice" judgments by researchers. Thin slice
assessments of situations and behaviors with emotional content (such as
deception or communication) have been found to be as accurate when
exposure to content is less than 30 seconds, as when it is 300 seconds.
Additional time to assess emotional content does not lead to greater
accuracy in these examples either (Ambady and Rosenthal, 1992). Similar
research in music reported accurate assessment of emotional content in
songs after only 300--400 milliseconds of exposure (Krumhansl, 2010).
People can express emotions through their body language, as well as
through muscular movements of their face (de Gelder, 2006). For example,
a clenched fist might accompany an angry facial expression, and a
fearful person may run away. The sight of photographs of bodies posed in
postures of fear activates the amygdala, just as the sight of fearful
faces does (Hadjikhani & de Gelder, 2003). Meeren and colleagues (2005)
prepared computer-modified photographs of people showing facial
expressions of emotions that were either

congruent with the person's body posture (for example, a facial
expression of fear and a body posture of fear) or incongruent (for
example, a facial expression of anger and a body posture of fear). The
researchers asked people to identify the facial expressions shown in the
photos and found that the ratings were faster and more accurate when the
facial and body expressions matched. In other words, when we look at
other people's faces, our perception of their emotion is affected by
their body posture as well as by their facial expression. We recognize
other people's feelings by means of vision and ­audition---seeing their
facial expressions and hearing their tone of voice and choice of words.
Many studies have found that the right hemisphere plays a more important
role than the left hemisphere in comprehension of emotion. For example,
Bowers and colleagues (1991) found that patients with right hemisphere
damage had difficulty producing or describing mental images of facial
expressions of emotions. Several functional-imaging studies have
confirmed these results. For example, George and colleagues (1996) had
participants listen to some sentences and identify their emotional
content. In one condition, the participants listened to the meaning of
the words and said whether they described a situation in which someone
would be happy, sad, angry, or neutral. In another condition, the
participants judged the emotional state from the tone of the voice. The
investigators found that comprehension of emotion from word meaning
increased the activity of the prefrontal cortex bilaterally, the left
hemisphere more than the right. Comprehension of emotion from tone of
voice increased the activity of only the right prefrontal cortex. (See
Figure 11.21.) Heilman, Watson, and Bowers (1983) recorded a
particularly interesting case of a man with a disorder called pure word
deafness, caused by damage to the left temporal cortex. (This syndrome
is described in Chapter 14.) The man could not comprehend the meaning of
speech but had no difficulty identifying the emotion being expressed by
its intonation. This case, like the functional-imaging study by George
and

most important information for this task. Krolak-Salmon and colleagues
(2004) recorded electrical potentials from the amygdala and visual
association cortex through electrodes that had been implanted in people
who were being evaluated for neurosurgery to alleviate a seizure
disorder. They presented the people with photographs of faces showing
neutral expressions or expressions of fear, happiness, or disgust. They
found that fearful faces produced the largest response and that the
amygdala showed activity before the visual cortex did. The rapid
response suggests that visual information that the amygdala receives
directly from the subcortical visual system (which conducts information
very rapidly) permits it to recognize facial expressions of fear. Some
people with blindness caused by damage to the visual cortex can
recognize facial expressions of emotion even though they have no
conscious awareness of looking at a person's face, a phenomenon known as
affective blindsight (Anders et al., 2004; de Gelder et al., 1999).
Tamietto and colleagues (2009) confirmed that "emotional contagion" can
take place even without conscious awareness. They presented photographs
of faces expressing happiness or fearfulness to the sighted and blind
fields of people with unilateral visual cortex lesions. Although the
people did not report seeing an emotional expression (or even a face) in
their blind fields, they automatically made facial expressions of their
own that matched those of the faces in the photographs. Figure 11.22
shows the contraction of a "smile muscle" and a "frown

ROLE OF THE AMYGDALA AND PREFRONTAL As we saw in the previous module,
the CORTEX

amygdala plays a special role in emotional responses. It plays a role in
emotional recognition as well. For example, several studies have found
that lesions of the amygdala (the result of degenerative diseases or
surgery for severe seizure disorders) impair people's ability to
recognize facial expressions of emotion, especially expressions of fear
(Adolphs et al., 1994, 1995; Calder et al., 1996; Young et al., 1995).
In addition, functional-imaging studies (Morris et al., 1996; Whalen et
al., 1998) have found large increases in the activity of the amygdala
when people view photographs of faces expressing fear, but only small
increases (or even decreases) when they look at photographs of happy
faces. However, amygdala lesions do not appear to affect people's
ability to recognize emotions in tone of voice (Adolphs & Tranel, 1999;
Anderson & Phelps, 1998). Several studies suggest that the amygdala
receives visual information that we use to recognize facial expressions
of emotion directly from the thalamus and not from the visual
association cortex. Adolphs (2002) notes that the amygdala receives
visual input from two sources: subcortical and cortical. The subcortical
input (from the superior colliculus and the pulvinar, a large nucleus in
the posterior thalamus) appears to provide the

indicates that visual information concerning emotional expressions can
take place without conscious awareness.

muscle" under these conditions. Note that the appropriate muscles
contracted when the happy or fearful face was presented to either the
sighted field ("seen stimuli") or the blind field ("unseen stimuli"). As
we saw in Chapter 6, the visual cortex receives information from two
systems of neurons. The magnocellular system provides information about
movement, depth, and very subtle differences in brightness in the scene
before our eyes. This system appeared early in evolution of the
mammalian brain and provides most mammals (dogs and cats, for example)
with a monochromatic, somewhat fuzzy image of the world. The
parvocellular system is found only in some primates, including humans.
This system provides us with color vision and detection of fine details.
The part of the visual association cortex responsible for recognition of
faces, the fusiform face area, receives information primarily from the
parvocellular system. The information that the amygdala receives from
the superior colliculus and the pulvinar has its origin in the more
primitive magnocellular system. (See Figure 11.23.) An ingenious
functional-imaging study by Vuilleumier and colleagues (2003) presented
people with pictures of faces showing neutral or fearful expressions.
Some of the pictures were normal, some had been filtered with a computer
program so that they showed only high spatial frequencies, and some had
been filtered to show only low spatial frequencies. (Chapter 6 described
the concept of spatial frequencies.) As Figure 11.24 shows, high spatial
frequencies show fine details of transitions between light and dark, and
low spatial frequencies show fuzzy images. These photos primarily
stimulate the parvocellular and magnocellular systems, respectively.
Vuilleumier and his colleagues found that the fusiform face area was
better at recognizing individual faces and primarily used high spatial
frequency (parvocellular) information to do so. (See Figure 11.23.) In
contrast, the amygdala

(and the superior colliculus and pulvinar, which provide it with visual
information) was able to recognize an expression of fear based on low
spatial frequency (magnocellular) information but not on high spatial
frequency information. Krolak-Salmon and cvolleagues (2004) recorded
electrical potentials from the amygdala and visual association cortex
through electrodes that had been implanted in peo­ple who were being
evaluated for neurosurgery to ­alleviate a seizure disorder. They
presented the people with photographs of faces showing neutral
expressions or expressions of fear, happiness, or disgust. They found
that fearful faces produced the largest response and that the amygdala
showed activity before the visual cortex did. The rapid response
supports the conclusion that the amygdala receives visual information
from the magnocellular system (which conducts information very rapidly)
that permits it to recognize facial expressions of fear. So far, the
evidence suggests that the amygdala plays an indispensable role in
recognition of facial expressions of fear. However, a study by Adolphs
and colleagues (2005) suggests that, under the appropriate conditions,
other regions of the brain can perform this task. Adolphs and colleagues
discovered that S. M., a woman with bilateral amygdala damage, failed to
look at the eyes when she examined photographs of faces. Spezio and
colleagues (2007) conducted a similar study, but this one measured S.
M.'s eye movements while she was actually conversing with another
person. Like the study by Adolphs and colleagues this one found that S.
M. failed to direct her gaze to the other person's eyes. In contrast,
she spent a large amount of time looking at the other person's mouth.
(See Figure 11.25.) By themselves, eyes are able to convey a fearful
expression. A functional-imaging study by Whalen and colleagues (2004)
found that viewing the fearful eyes shown in Figure 11.26 activated the
ventral amygdala, the region that receives the majority of the cortical
and subcortical inputs to the amygdala. The fact that S. M. did not look
at eyes suggests a cause for her failure to detect only this emotion. In
fact, when

Fear

Happiness

Adolphs and colleagues (2005) instructed S. M. to look at the eyes of
the face she was examining, she was able to recognize an expression of
fear. However, unless she was reminded to do so, she soon stopped
looking at eyes, and her ability to recognize a fearful expression
disappeared again. PERCEPTION OF DIRECTION OF GAZE Perrett and his
colleagues (1992) discovered an interesting brain function that may be
related to recognition of emotional expression. They found that neurons
in the monkey's superior temporal sulcus (STS) are involved in
recognition of the direction of ­another monkey's gaze---or even that of
a human. They found that some neurons in this region responded when the
monkey looked at photographs of a monkey's face or a human face but only
when the gaze of the face in the photograph was oriented in a particular
direction. For ­example, Figure 11.27 shows the activity level of a
neuron that ­responded when a human face was looking upward. Why is gaze
important in recognition of emotions? First, it is important to know
whether an emotional expression is directed toward you or toward someone
else. For example, an angry expression directed toward you means
something very different from a similar expression directed toward
someone else. And if someone else shows signs of fear, the expression
can serve as a useful warning, but only if you can figure out what the
person is looking at. In fact, Adams and Kleck (2005) found that people
more readily recognized anger if the eyes of another person were
directed toward the observer and fear if they were directed somewhere
else. As Blair (2008) notes, an angry expression directed toward the
observer means that the other person wants the observer to stop what he
or she is doing. The neocortex that lines the STS seems to provide such
information. Lesions there disrupt monkeys' ability to discriminate the
direction of another animal's gaze, but they do not impair the monkeys'
ability to recognize other animals' faces (Campbell et al., 1990;
Heywood & Cowey, 1992). As we saw in Chapter 6, the posterior parietal
c­ortex---the endpoint of the dorsal stream of visual ­analysis---is
concerned with perceiving the location of objects in space.

A functional-imaging study by Pelphrey and colleagues (2003) had people
watch an animated cartoon of a face. When the direction of gaze changed,
increased activity was seen in the right STS and posterior parietal
cortex. Presumably, the connections between neurons in the STS and the
parietal cortex enable the orientation of another person's gaze to
direct one's attention to a particular location in space. Adolphs and
colleagues (2000) discovered a possible link between somatosensation and
emotional recognition. They compiled computerized information about the
locations of brain damage in 108 patients with localized brain lesions
and correlated this information with the patients' ability to recognize
and identify facial expressions of emotions. They found that the most
severe damage to this ability was caused by damage to the somatosensory
cortex of the right hemisphere. (See Figure 11.28.) They suggest that
when we see a facial expression of an emotion, we unconsciously imagine
ourselves making that expression. Often, we do more than imagine making
the expressions---we actually imitate what we see. Adolphs and
colleagues suggest that the somatosensory representation of what it
feels like to make the perceived expression provides cues we use to
recognize the emotion being expressed in the face we are viewing. In
support of this hypothesis, Adolphs and his colleagues report that the
ability of patients with right hemisphere lesions to recognize facial
expressions of emotions is correlated with their ability to perceive
somatosensory stimuli. That is, patients with somatosensory impairments
(caused by right-hemisphere lesions) also had impairments in recognition
of emotions.

Right hemisphere

Left hemisphere

Hussey and Safford (2009) reviewed a considerable amount of evidence
that supports this hypothesis (the so-called simulationist hypothesis).
For example, neuroimaging studies have shown that brain regions that are
activated when particular emotional expressions are observed are also
activated when these expressions are imitated. In addition, a study by
Pitcher and colleagues (2008) used transcranial magnetic stimulation to
disrupt the normal activity of brain regions involved in visual
perception of faces or perception of somatosensory feedback from one's
own face. They found that disruption of either region impaired people's
ability to recognize

Emotion 365

facial expressions of emotion. Finally, a study by Oberman and
colleagues (2007) had people hold a pen between their teeth, which
interfered with smiling. When they did so, they had difficulty
recognizing facial expressions of happiness, but not expressions of
disgust, fear, and sadness, which involve the upper part of the face
more than smiling does. We are beginning to understand the neural
circuit that provides this form of feedback. Research has found that
mirror neurons play an important role in the control of movement
(Gallese et al., 1996; Rizzolatti et al., 2001; Rizzolatti & Sinigaglia,
2010). Mirror neurons are activated when an animal performs a particular
behavior or when it sees another animal performing that behavior.
Presumably, these neurons are involved in learning to imitate the
actions of others. These neurons, which are located in the ventral
premotor cortex of the frontal lobe, receive input from the superior
temporal sulcus and the posterior parietal cortex. This circuit is
activated when we see another person perform a goal-directed action, and
feedback from this activity helps us to understand what the person is
trying to accomplish. Carr and colleagues (2003) suggest that the mirror
neuron system, which is activated when we observe facial movements of
other people, provides feedback that helps us to understand how other
people feel. In other words, the mirror neuron system may be involved in
our ability to empathize with the emotions of other people. A
neurological disorder known as Moebius syndrome provides further support
for this hypothesis. Moebius syndrome is caused by defective development
of nerves involved in the movement of facial muscles. Because of this
paralysis, people affected with this syndrome cannot make facial
expressions of emotion. In addition, they have difficulty recognizing
the emotional expressions of other people (Cole, 2001). Perhaps their
inability to produce facial expressions of emotions makes it impossible
for them to imitate the expressions of other people, and the lack of
internal feedback from the motor system to the somatosensory cortex may
make the task of recognition more difficult. In Chapter 8 you read about
research on audiovisual neurons---neurons that respond to the sounds of
particular actions and to the sight of those actions. Warren and
colleagues (2006) obtained evidence that audiovisual neurons play a role
in communication of emotions, too. The investigators asked volunteers to
make emotional sounds in response to written scenarios that presented
situations expected to evoke triumph, amusement, fear, and disgust. The
volunteers were asked not to make verbal responses such as "yuck" or
"yippee" but to restrict themselves to nonverbal vocal responses. These
sounds were presented to participants while they underwent fMRI
scanning. The scans showed that hearing the emotional vocalizations
activated the same regions of the brain that were activated by facial
expressions of these emotions. When we hear other people make nonverbal
emotional sounds, our mirror

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 365

neuron system is activated, and the feedback from this activation may
contribute to our recognition of the emotions being expressed by these
sounds. PERCEIVING DISGUST Several studies have found that damage to the
insular cortex and basal ganglia impair people's ability to recognize
facial expressions of a very specific emotion: disgust (Calder et al.,
2000; Sprengelmeyer et al., 1996; Sprengelmeyer et al., 1997). In
addition, a functional-imaging study by Wicker and colleagues (2003)
found that both smelling a disgusting odor and seeing a face of a person
showing an expression of disgust activate the insular cortex. Disgust is
an emotion provoked by something that tastes or smells bad---or by an
action that we consider to be in bad taste. Disgust produces a very
characteristic facial expression. As we saw in Chapter 7, the insula
contains the primary gustatory cortex, so perhaps it is not a
coincidence that this region is also involved in recognition of "bad
taste." A functional-imaging study by Thielscher and Pessoa (2007) asked
participants to press one of two levers to indicate whether the facial
expression they saw was one of disgust or fear. The expressions varied
in intensity, and one of them was actually neutral, indicating neither
disgust nor fear. Nevertheless, the participants were asked to press one
of the levers on every trial, indicating disgust or fear. When the
participants saw faces expressing disgust, the insular cortex and part
of the basal ganglia were activated. What was particularly interesting
was that even when the participants were watching a neutral expression,
if they pressed the "disgust" lever, the "disgust" regions of the brain
were activated. The results of an online survey presented on the British
Broadcasting Corporation Science website suggest that the emotion of
disgust has its origins in avoidance of disease. The survey presented
pairs of photos and asked people to indicate which photos were more
disgusting. The people who responded indicated that the one that
appeared to hold a potential threat of disease was more disgusting. For
example, a yellow liquid that has soaked a tissue looks more like a body
fluid than a blue liquid does. (See Figure 11.29.)

We saw in the previous submodule that the amygdala is involved in the
recognition of other people's facial expression of emotions. Research
indicates that it is not involved in the expression of facial emotions,
as shown in the following case.

fact, she couldn't even identify it in herself. When she saw a
photograph of herself showing fear, she could not tell what emotion her
face had been expressing. However, she had no difficulty recognizing
individual faces, and she could easily identify male and female faces
and accurately judge their ages. What is particularly interesting is
that the amygdala lesions did not impair S. P.'s ability to produce her
own facial expressions of fear. She had no difficulty accurately
expressing fear, anger, happiness, sadness, disgust, and surprise. She
could express emotion, but not recognize it. Facial expressions of
emotion are automatic and involuntary (although, they can be modified by
display rules). It is not easy to produce a realistic facial expression
of emotion when we do not really feel that way. In fact, Ekman and
Davidson have confirmed an early observation by a nineteenthcentury
neurologist, Guillaume-Benjamin Duchenne de Boulogne, that genuinely
happy smiles, as opposed to false smiles or social smiles people make
when they greet someone else, involve contraction of a muscle near the
eyes, the lateral part of the orbicularis oculi---now sometimes referred
to as Duchenne's muscle (Ekman, 1992; Ekman & Davidson, 1993). As
Duchenne put it, "The first \[zygomatic major muscle\] obeys the will
but the second \[orbicularis oculi\] is only put in play by the sweet
emotions of the soul; the . . . fake joy, the deceitful laugh, cannot
provoke the contraction of this latter muscle" (Duchenne, 1862/1990,
p. 72). (See Figure 11.30.) The difficulty actors have in voluntarily
producing a convincing facial expression of emotion is one of the
reasons that led Constantin Stanislavsky to develop his

lost the ability to recognize facial expressions of fear. In

system of method acting, in which actors attempt to imagine themselves
in a situation that would lead to the desired emotion. Once the emotion
is evoked, the facial expressions follow naturally (Stanislavsky, 1936).
This observation is confirmed by two ­neurological disorders with
complementary symptoms (Hopf et al., 1992; Michel et al., 2008; Topper
et al., 1995; Urban et al., 1998). The first, volitional facial paresis,
is caused by damage to the face region of the primary motor cortex or to
the fibers connecting this region with the motor nucleus of the facial
nerve, which controls the muscles responsible for movement of the facial
muscles. (Paresis, from the Greek "to let go," refers to a partial
paralysis.) The interesting thing about volitional facial paresis is
that the patient cannot voluntarily move the facial muscles but will
express a genuine emotion with those ­muscles. For example, Figure 11.31a
shows a woman trying to pull her lips apart and show her teeth. Because
of the lesion in the face region of her right primary motor cortex, she
could not move the left side of her face. However, when she laughed
(Figure 11.31b), both sides of her face moved normally.

volitional facial paresis caused by a right hemisphere lesion tries to

In contrast, emotional facial paresis is caused by damage to the insular
region of the prefrontal cortex, to the white matter of the frontal
lobe, or to parts of the thalamus. This system joins the system
responsible for voluntary movements of the facial muscles in the medulla
or caudal pons. People with this disorder can move their face muscles
voluntarily but do not express emotions on the affected side of the
face. Figure 11.31c shows a man pulling his lips apart to show his
teeth, which he had no trouble doing. Figure 11.31d shows him smiling;
as you can see, only the left side of his mouth is raised. He had a
stroke that damaged the white matter of the left frontal lobe. These two
syndromes clearly indicate that different brain mechanisms are
responsible for voluntary movements of the facial muscles and automatic,
involuntary expression of emotions involving the same muscles.
LATERALITY OF EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION As we saw

in the previous submodule, the right hemisphere plays a more significant
role in recognizing emotions in the voice or facial expressions of other
people---­especially negative emotions. The same hemispheric
­specialization appears to be true for expressing emotions. When people
show emotions with their facial muscles, the left side of the face
usually makes a more intense expression. For example, Sackeim and Gur
(1978) cut photographs of people who were expressing emotions into right
and left halves, prepared mirror images of each of them, and pasted them
together, producing so-called chimerical faces (from the mythical
Chimera, a fire-breathing monster, part goat, part lion, and part
serpent). They found that the left halves were more expressive than the
right ones. Because motor control is contralateral, the results suggest
that the right hemisphere is more expressive than the left. Moscovitch
and Olds (1982) made more natural observations of people in restaurants
and parks and found that the left side of their faces appeared to make
stronger expressions of emotions. They confirmed these results in the
laboratory by analyzing videotapes of people telling sad or humorous
stories. A review of the literature by Borod and colleagues (1998) found
dozens of other studies that obtained similar results. Left hemisphere
lesions do not usually impair vocal expressions of emotion. For example,
people with Wernicke's aphasia (described in Chapter 13) usually
modulate their voice according to mood, even though the words they say
make no sense. In contrast, right hemisphere lesions do impair
expression of emotion, both facially and by tone of voice. Using the
chimerical faces technique, Hauser (1993) found that rhesus monkeys,
like humans, express emotions more strongly in the left sides of their
faces. Analysis of videotapes further showed that emotional expressions
also begin sooner in the left side of the face. These findings suggest
that hemispherical specialization for emotional expression appeared
before the emergence of our own species.

Several studies have investigated the brain mechanisms involved in
laughter, an expression of emotion more intense than smiling. Arroyo and
colleagues (1993) reported the case of a patient who had seizures that
were accompanied by mirthless l­aughter--- that is, the patient laughed
but was neither happy nor amused. Recordings made with depth electrodes
indicated that the seizure began in the left anterior cingulate gyrus.
Removal of a noncancerous tumor located nearby ended both the seizures
and the mirthless laughter. The authors suggest that the anterior
cingulate cortex may be involved in the muscular movements that produce
laughter. In contrast, stimulation of subthalamic nuclei in patients
undergoing deep brain stimulation to treat Parkinson's disease resulted
in mirthful laughter (Krack et al., 2001). Shammi and Stuss (1999) found
that damage to the right vmPFC impaired people's ability to
understand--- and be amused by---jokes. For example, consider the
following joke: Mr. Smith's neighbor approaches him and asks, "Say, are
you using your lawnmower this afternoon?" "Yes, I am," replies
Mr. Smith. Which alternative finishes the joke?

d.  "The birds are always eating my grass seed." The funny alternative
    in this example is (b). But people with ventromedial prefrontal
    damage usually chose (a), presumably because its slapstick aspect
    reminded them of humor that they had seen in the past. A
    functional-imaging study by Goel and Dolan (2001) found that
    different types of jokes activated different regions of the brain,
    but all of them activated one region: the right vmPFC. Another
    functional-imaging study by the same authors (Goel & Dolan, 2007)
    presented participants with socially appropriate and socially
    inappropriate cartoon jokes. The investigators found that
    increasingly funny jokes produced increasing activation of several
    regions, including the nucleus accumbens (a region involved in
    reinforcement and reward) and the right vmPFC, while jokes with
    increasing violation of social norms produced increasing activation
    of several regions, including the right amygdala and the left
    orbital frontal cortex. (See Figure 11.32.)

Emotion 369

Neural Basis of the Communication of Emotions: Recognition LO 11.12
Summarize the neural basis of emotional recognition, including
laterality, direction of gaze, imitation, and disgust. Recognition of
other people's emotional expressions involves the right hemisphere more
than the left. Studies show that recognition of particular faces
involves neural circuits different from those needed to recognize facial
expressions of emotions. The amygdala plays a role in recognition of
emotional expression; lesions of the amygdala disrupt the ability to
recognize facial expressions of fearfulness. One of the reasons that
bilateral amygdala damage impairs recognition of fearful facial
expressions appears to be failure to look at people's eyes. Neurons in
the superior temporal sulcus are sensitive to direction of gaze and
transmit this information to other parts of the brain, including the
amygdala. Mirror neurons in the ventral premotor cortex receive visual
information concerning the facial expression of other people that
activate the neural circuits responsible for these expressions. Feedback
from this activity, which may be transmitted to the somatosensory
cortex, helps us to comprehend the emotional intentions of other people.
Damage to the basal ganglia and insular cortex disrupts recognition of
facial expressions of disgust, and functional-imaging studies show
increased activity in the insular cortex (which contains the primary
gustatory cortex) when people smell disgusting odors or

Feeling Emotions So far, this chapter has explored autonomic, endocrine,
and behavioral components of emotion, and how we communicate emotions.
We've saved the most debated aspect of emotion for last: the subjective
feeling of emotion. Now that you've read how your brain and body respond
to an emotional situation with changes in autonomic activity, hormones,
and behavior, what about how you feel during an emotional response? How
do you interpret all of the physiological changes you are experiencing
in your body, and then what do you call it? It can get confusing fast!
Historically, psychologists have proposed several different theories of
emotion. As you'll read, neuroscience has generated data to strongly
support some, but not all, of these theories. These theories are
summarized in Figure 11.33. As you can see in the figure, many of the
theories include the same components (such as autonomic nervous system
arousal and conscious fear), but the order of the components is
different. Notice that the theories

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 369

see faces displaying disgust. Damage to the right somatosensory cortex
results in impaired facial emotion recognition and is thought to be due
to impaired ability to imitate the emotion.

Neural Basis of the Communication of Emotions: Expression LO 11.13
Summarize the neural basis of emotional expression, including
laterality, laughter, and humor. The anterior cingulate gyrus appears to
play a role in the motor aspects of laughter, while the appreciation of
humor appears to involve the right vmPFC. Genuine expressions of emotion
are controlled by special neural circuits. The best evidence for this
assertion comes from the complementary syndromes of emotional and
volitional facial paresis. People with emotional facial paresis can move
their facial muscles voluntarily but not in response to an emotion,
whereas people with volitional facial paresis show the opposite
symptoms. In addition, the left halves of people's faces---and the faces
of monkeys---tend to be more expressive than the right halves.

Thought Question Do you think it is important to be able to recognize
other people's emotions? Why? Suppose that you could no longer recognize
people's facial expressions of emotions. What consequences would that
loss have for you?

all involve multiple steps too. For example, the common sense,
James-Lange, and Cannon-Bard theories all involve a first response,
which leads to a second response. The Schachter-Singer cognitive arousal
theory includes two responses, but the first response involves BOTH
cognitive appraisal of an emotional situation and concurrent autonomic
nervous system arousal. Some of these theories, such as the
Schachter-Singer theory, arose from research in cognitive psychology and
cognitive neuroscience and are beyond the scope of this chapter.
Although we will not discuss them in depth, an appreciation for
alternative theories of emotion is important and demonstrates the
breadth of study in this area. The field of affective neuroscience (the
neuroscience of emotion) has focused on two of these theories in
particular: The James-Lange theory and the facial feedback theory. We
will first review the history and evidence for the James-Lange theory.
(See Dalgleish, 2004; Dalgleish et al., 2009; and Friedman, 2010, for a
review of the history of affective neuroscience, including many examples
from this chapter).

Summarize the evidence for and against the James-Lange theory of

William James (1842--1910), an American psychologist, and Carl Lange
(1834--1900), a Danish physiologist, independently suggested similar
explanations for emotion, which most people refer to collectively as the
James-Lange theory

FEAR

Facial expression

Cognitive interpretation of face motions

FEAR

(James, 1884; Lange, 1887). Basically, the theory states that
emotion-producing situations elicit an appropriate set of physiological
responses, such as trembling, sweating, and increased heart rate. The
situations also elicit behaviors, such as clenching fists or fighting.
The brain receives sensory feedback from the muscles and from the organs
that produce these responses, and it is this feedback that constitutes
our feeling of emotion.

08/11/2021 20:18

Emotion 371

James said that our own emotional feelings are based on what we find
ourselves doing and on the sensory feedback we receive from the activity
of our muscles and internal organs. In this way, when we find ourselves
trembling and feel queasy, we experience fear. Where feelings of
emotions are concerned, we are self-observers. The two aspects of
emotions reported in the first two modules of this chapter (patterns of
emotional responses and expressions of emotions) give rise to the third:
feelings. (See Figure 11.34.) James's description of the process of
emotion might strike you as opposite of your own experience. Many people
think that they feel an emotion first, and behavior is a secondary
event. But have you ever found yourself in an unpleasant confrontation
with someone else and discovered that you were trembling, even though
you did not think that you were so bothered by the encounter? Or did you
ever find yourself blushing in response to something someone said about
you even though you didn't feel particularly embarrassed? Or did you
ever find tears coming to your eyes while you watched a film that you
did not think was affecting you? What could you conclude about your
emotional states in situations like these? A well-known physiologist,
Walter Cannon, criticized James's theory. He said that the internal
organs were relatively insensitive and that they could not respond very
quickly, so feedback from them could not account for our feelings of
emotions. In addition, he observed that cutting the nerves that provide
feedback from the internal organs to the brain did not alter emotional
behavior (Cannon, 1927). However, subsequent research indicated that
Cannon's criticisms are not relevant. For example,

although the viscera are not sensitive to some kinds of stimuli, such as
cutting and burning, they provide much better feedback than Cannon
suspected. Moreover, many changes in the viscera can occur rapidly
enough that they could be the causes of feelings of emotion. Cannon
cited the fact that cutting the sensory nerves between the internal
organs and the central nervous system does not abolish emotional
behavior in laboratory animals. However, this observation misses the
point. It does not prove that feelings of emotion survive this surgical
disruption---only that emotional behaviors do. We do not know how the
animals feel; we know only that they will snarl and attempt to bite if
threatened. In any case, James did not attribute all feelings of emotion
to the internal organs; he also said that feedback from muscles was
important. The threat might make the animal snarl and bite, and the
feedback from the facial and neck muscles might constitute a "feeling"
of anger, even if feedback from the internal organs was cut off. But we
have no way to ask the animal how it felt. James's theory is difficult
to verify experimentally because it attempts to explain feelings of
emotion, not the causes of emotional responses, and feelings are private
events. Some anecdotal evidence supports the theory. For example, Sweet
(1966) reported the case of a man in whom some sympathetic nerves were
severed on one side of the body to treat a cardiovascular disorder. The
man---a music lover---reported that the shivering sensation he felt
while listening to music now occurred only on the unoperated side of his
body. He still enjoyed listening to music, but the surgery had altered
his emotional reaction. In one of the few tests of James's theory,
Hohman (1966) collected data from people with spinal cord damage. He
asked these people about the intensity of their emotional feelings. If
feedback is important, one would expect that emotional feelings would be
less intense if the injury were high (that is, close to the brain) than
if it were low, because a high spinal cord injury would make the person
become insensitive to a larger part of the body. In fact, this result is
precisely what Hohman found: The higher the injury, the less intense the
feeling was. As one of Hohman's participants said: I sit around and
build things up in my mind, and I worry a lot, but it's not much but the
power of thought. I was at home alone in bed one day and dropped a
cigarette where I couldn't reach it. I finally managed to scrounge
around and put it out. I could have burned up right there, but the funny
thing is, I didn't get all shook up about it. I just didn't feel afraid
at all, like you would suppose. (Hohman, 1966, p. 150) Another
participant showed that angry behavior (an emotional response) does not
appear to depend on feelings of emotion. Instead, the behavior is evoked
by the situation

08/11/2021 20:18

372 Chapter 11 (and by the person's evaluation of it) even if the spinal
cord damage has reduced the intensity of the person's emotional
feelings: Now, I don't get a feeling of physical animation, it's sort of
cold anger. Sometimes I act angry when I see some injustice. I yell and
cuss and raise hell, because if you don't do it sometimes, I've learned
people will take advantage of you, but it doesn't have the heat to it
that it used to. It's a mental kind of anger. (Hohman, 1966, p. 151)

Feedback from Emotional Expressions LO 11.15

Critique evidence for the facial feedback hypothesis.

James stressed the importance of two aspects of emotional responses:
emotional behaviors and autonomic responses. As we saw earlier in this
chapter, a particular set of ­muscles---those of the face---helps us to
communicate our emotional state to other people. Several experiments
suggest that feedback from the contraction of facial muscles can affect
people's moods and even alter the activity of the autonomic nervous
system. People can be directed to move particular facial muscles to
simulate the emotional expressions of fear, anger, surprise, disgust,
sadness, and happiness. Ekman and his colleagues (Ekman, Levenson, &
Friesen, 1983; Levenson, Ekman, & Friesen, 1990) asked participants to
follow a set of directions to make facial expressions. While the
participants made the expressions, the investigators monitored several
physiological responses controlled by the autonomic nervous system. The
simulated expressions did alter the activity of the autonomic nervous
system. In fact, different facial expressions produced somewhat
different patterns of activity. For example, anger increased heart rate
and skin temperature, fear increased heart rate but decreased skin
temperature, and happiness decreased heart rate without affecting skin
temperature. Strack, Stepper, and Martin (1988) extended this research
and proposed the facial feedback hypothesis, which explains, for
example, that smiling expressions make us feel happier, while frowning
makes us feel sadder. Why should a particular pattern of movements of
the facial muscles cause changes in mood or in the activity of the
autonomic nervous system? Does this fit with the James-Lange theory of
emotion? Perhaps the connection is a result of experience; in other
words, perhaps the occurrence of particular facial movements along with
changes in the autonomic nervous system leads to classical conditioning,
so that feedback from the facial movements becomes capable of eliciting
the autonomic response---and a change in perceived emotion. Or perhaps
the connection is innate.

M11_CARL0287_13_GE_C11.indd 372

As we saw earlier, the adaptive value of emotional expressions is that
they communicate feelings and intentions to others. The research
presented earlier in this chapter on the role of mirror neurons and the
somatosensory cortex suggests that one of the ways we communicate
feelings is through unconscious imitation. Recent replications have
found support for the facial feedback hypothesis (Coles et al., 2017;
Marsh et al., 2018). Several studies have found that interfering with
muscular movement associated with a particular emotion decreased
people's ability to experience that emotion (Lewis, 2018; Lewis &
Bowler, 2009) or recognize emotion (Lewis, 2018). Injections of a very
dilute solution of botulinum toxin (Botox) into facial muscles can
reduce wrinkling of the skin caused by chronic contraction of facial
muscles. Lewis and colleagues studied people who had been treated with
injections of Botox into the corrugator muscle, whose contraction is
responsible for a large part of the facial expression of frowning, which
is associated with negative emotions. These muscles are engaged in the
Duchenne smile. They found that these people showed significantly less
negative mood, compared with people who had received other forms of
cosmetic treatment. They have also investigated the effects of Botox
into the orbicularis oculi muscles around the eyes that are responsible
for crow's feet or laughter lines. Injections into these muscles
produced no change in anxiety or depression, ­but did decrease people's
ability to accurately identify emotional e­ xpressions (Lewis, 2018).
This is likely because these muscles are involved in the expression of
positive emotion and smiles. Collectively, these results, like those
described earlier in this submodule, suggest that feedback from a p ­
erson's facial expressions can affect his or her mood. A
functional-imaging study by Damasio and colleagues (2000) asked people
to recall and try to ­ ­re-­experience past episodes from their lives that
evoked feelings of sadness, happiness, anger, and fear. The
­investigators found that recalling these emotions activated the
participants' somatosensory cortex and upper brain stem nuclei involved
in control of internal organs and detection of sensations received from
them. These responses are certainly compatible with James's theory. As
Damasio and colleagues put it, Emotions are part of a neural mechanism
based on structures that regulate the organism's current state by
executing specific actions via the musculoskeletal system, ranging from
facial and postural expressions to complex behaviors, and by producing
chemical and neural responses aimed at the internal milieu, viscera and
telencephalic neural circuits. The consequences of such responses are
represented in both subcortical regulatory structures . . . and in
cerebral cortex . . ., and those representations constitute a critical
aspect of the neural basis of feelings. (2000, p. 1049)

08/11/2021 20:18

Emotion 373

This area of neuroscience is not without controversy. In contrast to the
research described in the previous paragraphs, a large-scale study
involving 17 different replications failed to find evidence to support
the facial feedback hypothesis (Wagenmakers et al., 2016). Reconciling
these vastly different results, other researchers have suggested the
facial feedback phenomenon occurs only when participants do not know
they are being observed (as in the original study). These researchers
point out that participants were observed in the 2016 replication study
and may have responded differently because they were being watched
(Noah, Schul, & Mayo, 2018). The tendency to imitate the expressions of
other people was also previously thought to be innate.

Field and colleagues (1982) had adults make facial expressions in front
of infants. The infants' own facial expressions were videotaped and
subsequently rated by people who did not know what expressions the
adults were displaying. Field and her colleagues found that newborn
babies (with an average age of 36 hours) tended to imitate the
expressions they saw and proposed that the effect occurs too early in
life to be a result of learning. In contrast, other studies have been
unable to replicate infant imitation (Koepke et al., 1983; Oostenbroek
et al., 2016; Meltzoff et al., 2017). It is clear that despite decades
of research, there is still more to learn about the origins of our
feelings and expressions of emotion.

Module Review: Feeling Emotions The James-Lange Theory LO 11.14
Summarize the evidence for and against the James-Lange theory of
emotion. From the earliest times, people recognized that emotions were
accompanied by feelings that seemed to come from inside the body, which
probably provided the impetus for developing physiological theories of
emotion. James and Lange suggested that emotions were primarily
responses to situations. Feedback from the physiological and behavioral
reactions to emotion-producing situations gave rise to the feelings of
emotion; feelings are the results, not the causes, of emotional
reactions. Hohman's study of people with spinal cord damage supported
the James-Lange theory; people who could no longer feel the reactions
from most of their body reported that they no longer experienced intense
emotional states. Cannon proposed that the body could not respond
quickly enough to account for feedback and feelings of emotion; however,
this was not supported by subsequent research.

activity of the autonomic nervous system. Perhaps feedback from these
changes explains why an emotion can be "contagious": We see someone
smile with pleasure, we ourselves imitate the smile, and the internal
feedback makes us feel at least somewhat happier. The tendency to mimic
the facial expression of others appears to be a consequence of activity
in the brain's system of mirror neurons; however, it is not clear when
this pattern of activity develops. Many researchers have failed to
replicate infant imitation, calling into question whether this is an
innate emotional behavior.

Thought Question As you read earlier in this chapter, people with
volitional and emotional facial paresis cannot generate facial
expressions under certain conditions. What impact might the lack of
facial expression have on the brain? What impact might it have on
relationships with other people?

Gianna was a frail baby with weak muscle tone and poor reflexes. She ate
very little, apparently because she was so weak. For several years she
was underweight. Her motor development and cognitive development were
much slower than that of her peers, she often seemed to have trouble
breathing, and her hands and feet were especially small. Eventually, her
appetite seemed to improve. She began gaining weight and soon surpassed
other children of her age. With these changes also came a change in her
personality. Previously, she had been passive and reserved, but now she
began to display tantrums. She also showed compulsive ­b

The biggest change, though, was her appetite. She ate everything she
could and never seemed satisfied. At first her parents were so pleased
to see Gianna finally gaining weight that they gave her food whenever
she asked for it. But after a while it was clear that she was becoming
obese. A specialist who diagnosed her condition told her parents that
they would have to strictly limit Gianna's food intake and prescribed
appetitesuppressing medications. Because of her weak muscles and low
metabolic rate, she needed only 1,200 calories per day to maintain a
normal weight. But Gianna was constantly looking for food. She would
take food out of the refrigerator until her parents installed a lock on
it and on the cabinets where they put food. They had to be careful of
how they disposed of leftover food because Gianna would take it out of
the garbage and eat it.

Gianna had Prader-Willi syndrome, caused by deletion of several genes in
a segment of chromosome 15. This region appears to be involved in the
production of proteins that are critical to normal functioning of the
hypothalamus, which helps integrate signals of hunger and satiety. Most
cases of Prader-Willi syndrome appear to be caused by random accidents
that occur during the production of the father's sperm cells. The
prevalence of Prader-Willi syndrome is approximately 1 to 3 out of every
10,000 individuals (Cassidy et al., 2011). As you will learn in this
chapter, progress has been made in understanding the neural and hormonal
mechanisms that control appetite and regulate body weight. Undoubtedly,
we will soon learn which of these mechanisms are disrupted in
Prader-Willi syndrome. To help us regulate our food and water needs, the
digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and excretory systems have evolved.
We also have the behaviors necessary for finding and consuming food and
water. Regulation of nutrient and water balance is part of a process
called homeostasis ("similar standing"). This chapter discusses how
mammals achieve homeostatic control of fluid and nutrient balance
through ingestive behavior: intake of food, water, and minerals, such as
sodium. First, we will examine the general nature of regulatory
mechanisms; then we will consider drinking and eating and the neural
mechanisms that are responsible for these behaviors. Finally, we will
explore some research on obesity and eating disorders.

Drinking To understand any ingestive behavior, such as drinking and
eating, we must understand the general physiological regulatory
mechanisms that maintain the constancy of some internal characteristics
of the organism in the face of external variability---for example,
keeping body temperature constant despite changes in the temperature of
the environment.

too. Because of Gianna's special needs, the school appointed an

a set point (the optimal value of the system variable), a detector that
monitors the value of the system variable, and a correctional mechanism
that restores the system variable to the set point. The activity of the
system is regulated by negative feedback, a process whereby the effect
produced by an action serves to diminish or terminate the action. An
example of a regulatory system is a room whose temperature is regulated
by a thermostatically controlled heater. (See Figure 12.1.) The system
variable is the air temperature of the room, and the detector for this
variable is a thermostat. This device can be adjusted so that contacts
of a switch will be closed when the temperature falls below a preset
value (the set point). Closure of the contacts turns on the correctional
mechanism---the coils of the heater. If the room cools below the set
point of the thermostat, the thermostat turns the heater on, and the
heater warms the room. The rise in room temperature causes the
thermostat to turn the heater off. Because the activity of the
correctional mechanism (heat production) feeds back to the thermostat
and causes it to turn the heater off, this process is called negative
feedback. Negative feedback is an essential characteristic of all
regulatory systems. Ingestive behaviors are correctional mechanisms that
replenish the body's depleted stores of water or nutrients. Because of
the delay between ingestion and replenishment of the depleted stores,
ingestive behaviors are controlled by satiety mechanisms as well as by
detectors that monitor the system variables. Satiety mechanisms are
brain-based mechanisms that reduce hunger or thirst related to behaviors
that result in adequate intake of nutrients or water.

Inhibition

Satiety mechanisms are required because of the physiology of our
digestive system. For example, suppose you spend some time in a hot, dry
environment and lose body water. The loss of water causes internal
detectors to initiate the correctional mechanism: drinking. You quickly
drink a glass or two of water and then stop. What stops your ingestive
behavior? The water is still in your digestive system, and has not yet
moved into the fluid surrounding your cells, where it is needed.
Therefore, although drinking was initiated by detectors that measure
your body's need for water, it was stopped by other means. There must be
a satiety mechanism that says, in effect, "Stop---this water, when
absorbed by the digestive system into the blood, will eventually
replenish the body's need." Satiety mechanisms monitor the activity of
the correctional mechanism (in this case, drinking), not the system
variables themselves. When a sufficient amount of drinking occurs, the
satiety mechanisms stop further drinking in anticipation of the
replenishment that will occur later. (See Figure 12.2.) To maintain our
internal environment at its optimal state, we have to drink some water
from time to time. The rest of this module describes the control of this
form of ingestive behavior.

Two Types of Thirst LO 12.2

Compare osmometric and volumetric thirst.

Approximately two-thirds of the body's water is contained in the
intracellular fluid, the fluid portion of the cytoplasm of cells. The
rest is extracellular fluid, which includes intravascular fluid (the
blood plasma), cerebrospinal fluid, and interstitial fluid (fluid that
bathes our cells). The volume of intracellular and intravascular fluid
must be kept within precise limits. Losing intracellular water deprives
cells of the ability to perform many chemical reactions, and gaining
water can cause their membranes to rupture. The volume of intravascular
fluid must be closely regulated because of the mechanics of the
operation of the heart. If the blood volume falls too low, the heart can
no longer pump the blood effectively; if the volume is not restored,

failure will result. This condition is called hypovolemia. The vascular
system of the body can make some adjustments for lost blood volume by
contracting the muscles in smaller veins and arteries, reducing the
space blood must fill, but this correctional mechanism has definite
limits. For our bodies to function properly, the volume of intracellular
and intravascular fluid must be regulated. Intracellular and
intravascular fluids are monitored by two different sets of receptors:
one measuring cell volume (intracellular) and another measuring blood
volume (intravascular). Most of the time, we ingest more water than we
need, and the kidneys excrete the excess. However, if the levels of
water fall too low, correctional mechanisms--- drinking water---are
activated. Because losing water from either the intracellular or
intravascular fluid compartments stimulates drinking, researchers have
adopted the terms osmometric thirst and volumetric thirst to describe
them. The term volumetric refers to the volume of the blood plasma. The
term osmometric will be explained in greater detail in the next section,
but in general it refers to an increase in osmotic pressure on
intracellular fluid that occurs when a cell is dehydrated. The term
thirst generally refers to a sensation that people say they have when
they are dehydrated, but because we do not know how other animals feel,
thirst simply means a tendency to seek water and to ingest it. Our
bodies lose water continuously, primarily through evaporation. Each
breath exposes the moist inner surfaces of the respiratory system to the
air, which causes the loss of a small amount of water. In addition, our
skin is not completely waterproof, and some water finds its way through
the layers of the skin and evaporates from the surface. The moisture
that is lost through evaporation is pure water. (See Figure 12.3.) The
body loses water through sweating, too; but because it loses salt along
with the water, sweating produces a need for sodium as well as for
water. OSMOMETRIC THIRST Osmometric thirst occurs when the solute
concentration of the interstitial fluid increases. Solutes are
substances, such as salts, dissolved in a solution. An increase in
interstitial solute concentration draws water

out of the cells, and they shrink in volume. The term osmometric refers
to the fact that the detector cells are actually responding to
(metering) changes in the concentration of the interstitial fluid that
surrounds them. Osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable
membrane from a region of low solute concentration to one of high solute
concentration. The existence of neurons that respond to changes in the
solute concentration of the interstitial fluid was first hypothesized by
Verney (1947), who suggested that these detectors, which he called
osmoreceptors, are neurons whose firing rate is affected by their level
of hydration. If the interstitial fluid surrounding osmoreceptors
becomes more concentrated, the cells shrink because they lose water
through osmosis. Shrinking causes the cells to alter their firing rate,
which sends signals to other parts of the brain. Zhang and colleagues
(2007) found that osmoreceptors are a special kind of mechanoreceptor
that transduce changes in the volume of the cell into changes in
membrane potential, and in turn, affect the neural firing rate. (See
Figure 12.4). When we eat a salty meal, we experience a pure osmometric
thirst. The salt is absorbed from the digestive system into the blood
plasma. The salt concentration of the blood draws water from the
interstitial fluid, which

in turn causes water to leave the cells. The osmoreceptors responsible
for osmometric thirst are located in a brain region known as the lamina
terminalis. The lamina terminalis contains two specialized
circumventricular organs: the OVLT and the SFO. (See Figure 12.5.) The
organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and the subfornical
organ (SFO) are located outside the blood--brain barrier. That means
that substances dissolved in the blood pass easily into the interstitial
fluid within these organs. Evidence suggests that most of the
osmoreceptors responsible for osmometric thirst are located in the OVLT,
but some are also located in the SFO (McKinley et al., 2004). In a
functional-imaging study by Egan and colleagues (2003), the
investigators administered intravenous injections of a salty solution to
human volunteers while their brains were being scanned. The researchers
observed strong activation of several brain regions, including the
lamina terminalis and the anterior cingulate cortex. When the
participants were permitted to drink water, they did so and almost
immediately reported that their thirst had been satisfied.
Simultaneously, the activity in the anterior cingulate cortex returned
to baseline values. However, the activity in the lamina terminalis
remained high. These results suggest that the activity of the anterior
cingulate cortex reflected the participants' thirst, which was
immediately relieved by a drink of water. (As we saw in Chapter 7,
activity of this region is correlated with people's perception of the
unpleasantness of painful stimuli.) In contrast, the continued activity
in the lamina terminalis reflected the fact that the blood plasma still
contained a high concentration of solutes. (See Figure 12.6.) After all,
it takes around 20 minutes for a drink of water to be absorbed into the
general circulation. As we saw in the discussion of Figure 12.2, satiety
is an anticipatory mechanism, triggered by the act of drinking. The fall
in the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex appears to reflect the
activation of this satiety mechanism.

As solute concentration of the interstitial fluid increases, water

(b) 

Two other functional-imaging studies (Farrell et al., 2006; Xiao et al.,
2006) confirm that thirst activates the anterior cingulate cortex. An
anatomical tracing study by Hollis and colleagues (2008) found that in
rats, osmoreceptive neurons in the OVLT were connected to the cingulate
cortex via the dorsal midline nuclei of the thalamus. This pathway
between the osmoreceptors in the OVLT and the

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 380

cingulate cortex is probably responsible for the activation seen in the
functional-imaging studies. Volumetric thirst occurs when the volume of
the blood plasma---the intravascular volume---decreases. When we lose
water through evaporation, we lose it from all three fluid compartments:
intracellular, interstitial, and intravascular. This means that
evaporation produces both volumetric and osmometric thirst. In addition,
bleeding, vomiting, and diarrhea all cause loss of blood volume
(hypovolemia) without depleting the intracellular fluid. Blood loss is
the most obvious cause of pure volumetric thirst. From the earliest
recorded history, reports of battles note that the wounded survivors
called out for water. In addition, because hypovolemia involves a loss
of sodium as well as water, volumetric thirst leads to a salt appetite.
Detector cells in the heart and kidneys help monitor blood volume and
induce volumetric thirst when intravascular fluid is low. Cells in the
kidneys detect decreases in blood flow. In response to low blood volume,
the kidneys are responsible for the presence of the hormone angiotensin
following a cascade of biochemical events. Angiotensin initiates
drinking and a salt appetite, causes the kidneys to conserve water and
salt, and increases blood pressure. Therefore, reduced blood flow to the
kidneys causes water and salt to be retained, encourages the animal to
find and ingest water and salt, and allows the organism to compensate
for reduced VOLUMETRIC THIRST

24/11/21 1:44 PM

Ingestive Behavior 381

blood volume until fluid balance can be restored. A second set of
receptors for volumetric thirst is located in the atria of the heart.
These baroreceptor cells are stretch sensitive and detect when blood
volume in the heart falls. Reduced blood flow to the heart increases
drinking, and severing the nerves to the atrial baroreceptors decreases
drinking, demonstrating the important role of these receptor cells
(Fitzsimmons & Moore-Gillon, 1980; Quillen et al., 1990).

Neural Mechanisms of Thirst LO 12.3

Outline the neural mechanisms of thirst.

As you read, the osmoreceptors that initiate drinking are located in the
OVLT and SFO of the lamina terminalis. The lamina terminalis seems to be
the part of the brain where osmometric and volumetric signals are
integrated to control drinking. The signal for volumetric thirst is
provided by angiotensin. Because this peptide does not cross the
blood--brain barrier, it cannot directly affect neurons in the brain
except for those located outside the blood--brain barrier, such as the
OVLT and SFO. In fact, research indicates that the SFO is where blood
angiotensin acts to produce thirst. (Refer again to Figure 12.5.)
Simpson and colleagues (1978) found that very low doses of angiotensin
injected directly into the SFO caused drinking and that destruction of
the SFO or injection of a drug that blocks angiotensin receptors
abolished the drinking that normally occurs when

SUBFORNICAL ORGAN (SFO)

angiotensin is injected into the blood. In addition, Phillips and Felix
(1976) found that injections of minute quantities of angiotensin into
the SFO increased the firing rate of single neurons located there.
Evidently, these neurons contain angiotensin receptors. Neurons in the
SFO send their axons to another part of the lamina terminalis: the
median preoptic nucleus (not to be confused with the medial preoptic
nucleus), a small nucleus wrapped around the front of the anterior
commissure, a fiber bundle that connects the amygdala and anterior
temporal lobe. (Refer to the inset in Figure 12.5.) On the basis of
these findings, Thrasher and his colleagues (1989) suggested that the
median preoptic nucleus acts as an integrating system for most or all of
the stimuli for osmometric and volumetric thirst. As you just read, the
median preoptic nucleus receives information from angiotensin-sensitive
neurons in the SFO. In addition, this nucleus receives information from
the OVLT (which contains osmoreceptors) and from the nucleus of the
solitary tract (which receives information from the atrial
baroreceptors). Excitotoxic lesions of the median preoptic nucleus,
which destroy cell bodies but spare axons passing through the structure,
cause severe deficits in osmometric thirst (Cunningham et al., 1992).
According to Thrasher and his colleagues, the median preoptic nucleus
integrates the information it receives and, through its efferent
connections with other parts of the brain, controls drinking. (See
Figure 12.7.)

382 Chapter 12 This region of the lamina terminalis seems to play a
critical role in fluid regulation in humans as well. As we saw earlier,
functional imaging indicates that osmometric thirst increases the
activity of this region. In addition, McIver and colleagues (1991)
reported that brain damage

that includes this region can cause adipsia---lack of drinking. The
patients report no sensation of thirst even after they are given an
injection of hypertonic saline. To survive, they must deliberately drink
water at regular intervals each day, even though they feel no need to do
so.

Module Review: Drinking Physiological Regulatory Mechanisms LO 12.1

Explain the characteristics of a physiological regulatory mechanism.

A regulatory system contains four features: a system variable (the
variable that is regulated), a set point (the optimal value of the
system variable), a detector to measure the system variable, and a
correctional mechanism to change it. Physiological regulatory systems,
such as control of body fluids and nutrients, require a satiety
mechanism to anticipate the effects of the correctional mechanism,
because the changes brought about by eating and drinking occur only
after a considerable period of time.

Two Types of Thirst LO 12.2

Compare osmometric and volumetric thirst.

Osmometric thirst occurs when the interstitial fluid draws water out of
cells. This event, which can be caused by evaporation of water from the
body or by ingestion of a salty meal, is detected by osmoreceptors in
the hypothalamus. Activation of these osmoreceptors stimulates drinking.
The sensation of thirst in humans appears to involve the anterior
cingulate cortex. Volumetric thirst occurs along with osmometric thirst
when the body loses fluid and is often caused by blood loss, vomiting,
and diarrhea. The primary stimulus for volumetric thirst is provided by
a fall in blood flow to the kidneys and heart. This event triggers the
formation of

What Is Metabolism? Eating is one of the most important things we do,
and it can also be one of the most pleasurable. Much of what an animal
learns to do is motivated by the constant struggle to obtain food, and
the need to eat undoubtedly shaped the evolutionary development of our
own species. Control of eating is even more complicated than control of
drinking. We can achieve water balance by the intake of two ingredients:
water and sodium chloride. When we eat, we must obtain adequate amounts
of

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 382

angiotensin, which increases blood pressure and stimulates changes that
inhibit the secretion of water and sodium by the kidneys and induce a
sodium appetite.

Neural Mechanisms of Thirst LO 12.3

Outline the neural mechanisms of thirst.

A nucleus in the lamina terminalis, the median preoptic nucleus,
receives and integrates osmometric and volumetric information.
Information about hypovolemia conveyed by angiotensin reaches the median
preoptic nucleus directly from the SFO. Osmotic information reaches this
nucleus from osmoreceptors in both the OVLT and the SFO. Neurons in the
median preoptic nucleus stimulate drinking through their connections
with other parts of the brain. The anterior cingulate cortex also
receives information from the OVLT via the dorsal midline nucleus of the
thalamus, and this region may be involved in sensations of thirst.

water can lead to health problems, can you predict what happens when an
individual consumes too much water? Write a memo to your campus health

carbohydrates, fats, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals other than
sodium. For this reason, our eating behaviors are more complex, as are
the physiological mechanisms that control them. When we eat, molecules
that were once part of other living organisms are incorporated into our
own bodies. We ingest these molecules for two reasons: to construct and
maintain our own organs and to obtain energy for muscular movements and
for keeping our bodies warm. In other words, we need both building
blocks and fuel. Although food used for building blocks is essential, we
will discuss only the food used for fuel,

24/11/21 1:44 PM

Ingestive Behavior 383

because most of the molecules we eat get "burned" to provide energy for
movement and heating. To stay alive, our cells must have fuel and
oxygen. Fuel comes from the digestive tract, and its presence there is a
result of eating. But the digestive tract is sometimes empty; in fact,
most of us wake up in the morning in that condition. So there has to be
a reservoir that stores nutrients to keep the cells of the body
nourished when the gut is empty. There are two reservoirs: one
short-term and the other long-term. The short-term reservoir stores
carbohydrates, and the long-term reservoir stores fats. When the
digestive tract is empty, we are in the fasting phase. When the
digestive tract is full, we are in the absorptive phase. These phases
will be described in greater detail in upcoming modules. Table 12.1
provides an example of how the reservoirs and phases might be used by
the nervous system in a typical day's activities. Just as it helps to
know about the fluid compartments of the body and how the kidneys
function to understand the physiology of drinking, understanding
metabolism is the key to understanding ingestive behaviors. Your first
inclination might be to skip over this module, but that may make it more
challenging to understand the experiments described later. The rest of
this chapter describes research on the control of eating: metabolism,
regulating body weight, the environmental and physiological factors that
begin and stop a meal, and the neural mechanisms that monitor the
nutritional state of our bodies and control our ingestive behavior. It
also describes two serious eating disorders: obesity and anorexia
nervosa. Despite all the effort that has gone into understanding the
physiology of ingestive behavior, these disorders are still difficult to
treat. Our best hope of finding effective treatments is to achieve a
better understanding of the physiology of metabolism and ingestive
behavior.

The Short-Term Reservoir LO 12.4

Describe the function, location, and contents of the short-term
reservoir.

The short-term reservoir sustains our fuel needs for several hours
between meals. It is located in the cells of the liver and the muscles,
and it is filled with a complex, insoluble carbohydrate called glycogen.
For simplicity we will focus only on the liver. Cells in the liver
convert glucose (a simple, soluble carbohydrate) into glycogen and store
the glycogen. They are stimulated to do so by the presence of insulin, a
peptide hormone produced by the pancreas. When glucose and insulin are
present in the blood, some of the glucose is used as a fuel, and some of
it is stored as glycogen. Later, when all of the food has been absorbed
from the digestive tract, the glucose levels in the blood begin to fall.
The fall in glucose is detected by cells in the pancreas and in the
brain. The pancreas responds by stopping its secretion of insulin and
starting to secrete a different peptide hormone: glucagon. Glucagon's
effects are the opposite of insulin's effects. Glucagon stimulates the
conversion of glycogen (stored in the liver) into glucose.
(Unfortunately, the terms glucose, glycogen, and glucagon are similar
enough that it is easy to confuse them. Even worse, you will soon
encounter another one: glycerol.) (See Figure 12.8.) The liver takes up
excess glucose and stores it as glycogen when plenty of glucose is
available, and it releases glucose from its reservoir when the digestive
tract empties and the level of glucose in the blood begins to fall. The
carbohydrate reservoir in the liver is reserved primarily for the
central nervous system (CNS). When you wake in the morning, your brain
is being fed by your liver, which is in the process of converting
glycogen to glucose and releasing it into the blood. The glucose reaches
the CNS, where it is absorbed and metabolized by the neurons and the
glia. This process can continue for a few hours, until all of the
carbohydrate reservoir in the liver is used up. (The average liver holds
approximately 300 calories of carbohydrate.) Usually, we eat some food
before this reservoir gets depleted, which permits us to refill it. But
if we do not eat, the CNS (and the rest of the body) must start living
on the products of the long-term reservoir.

The Long-Term Reservoir LO 12.5

involved in the breakdown and utilization of stored nutrients. When the
digestive system is empty, activity of the sympathetic axons that
innervate adipose tissue, the pancreas, and the adrenal medulla
increases. All three effects (direct neural stimulation, secretion of
glucagon, and secretion of catecholamines) cause triglycerides in the
long-term fat reservoir to be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids.
The fatty acids can be directly metabolized by cells in all of the body
except the brain, which needs glucose. That leaves glycerol. The liver
takes up glycerol and converts it to glucose. That glucose, too, is
available to the brain. Why do the cells of the rest of the body treat
the brain so kindly, letting it consume almost all the glucose? The
cells of the body require the presence of insulin (which binds to
insulin receptors) in order to take up and utilize glucose. Cells in the
brain do not contain insulin receptors, and these cells can absorb
glucose even when insulin is not present.

Describe the function, location, and contents of the long-term
reservoir.

Our long-term reservoir consists of adipose tissue (fat tissue). This
reservoir is filled with triglycerides. Triglycerides are complex
molecules that contain glycerol (a soluble carbohydrate, also called
glycerine) combined with three fatty acids (stearic acid, oleic acid,
and palmitic acid). Adipose tissue is found under the skin and in
various locations in the abdominal cavity. It consists of cells that are
capable of absorbing nutrients from the blood, converting them to
triglycerides, and storing them. These cells can expand in size. For
example, the primary physical difference between a person who is obese
and a person who is not is the size (and not the number) of their fat
cells. The size of the fat cells is determined by the amount of
triglycerides the cells contain. The long-term fat reservoir is what
keeps us alive when we are fasting. As we begin to use the contents of
our shortterm carbohydrate reservoir, fat cells start converting
triglycerides into fuels that the cells can use and releasing these
fuels into the bloodstream. As we just saw, when we wake in the morning
with an empty digestive tract, our brain (in fact, all of the CNS) is
living on glucose released by the liver. But what about the other cells
of the body? They are living on fatty acids, reserving the glucose for
the brain. Recall from Chapter 3, the sympathetic nervous system is
primarily

The bottom half of Figure 12.9 reviews the metabolism that takes place
while the digestive tract is empty, which physiologists refer to as the

pancreas to stop secreting insulin and to start secreting glucagon. The

means that most of the cells of the body can no longer use glucose. As a
result, all the glucose present in the blood is reserved for the CNS.
The presence of glucagon and the absence of insulin instruct the liver
to start drawing on the short-term carbohydrate reservoir---to start
converting its glycogen into glucose. The presence of glucagon and the
absence of insulin, along with increased activity of the sympathetic
nervous system, also instruct fat cells to start drawing on the
long-term fat reservoir---to start breaking down triglycerides into
fatty acids and glycerol. Most of the body lives on the fatty acids,
while the glycerol, which is converted into glucose by the liver, gets
used by the brain. If fasting is prolonged, proteins (especially protein
found in muscle) will be broken down to amino acids, which can be
metabolized by all of the body except the CNS.

Absorptive Phase LO 12.7

Compare pathways for using glucose, fat, and amino acids in the
absorptive phase.

The phase of metabolism that occurs when food is present in the
digestive tract is called the absorptive phase. After reading about the
fasting phase, this one is simple. Suppose

that we eat a balanced meal of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The
carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, and the proteins are broken
down into amino acids. The fats basically remain as fats. Consider each
of these three nutrients in the absorptive phase: 1. Glucose: As we
start absorbing the nutrients, the level of glucose in the blood rises.
This rise is detected by cells in the brain, which causes the activity
of the sympathetic nervous system to decrease and the activity of the
parasympathetic nervous system to increase. This change tells the
pancreas to stop secreting glucagon and to begin secreting insulin. The
insulin permits all the cells of the body to use glucose as a fuel.
Extra glucose is converted into glycogen, which fills the short-term
carbohydrate reservoir. If some glucose is left over, it is converted
into fat and absorbed by fat cells. 2. Amino acids: A small proportion
of the amino acids received from the digestive tract are used as
building blocks to construct proteins and peptides; the rest are
converted to fats and stored in adipose tissue. 3. Fat: Fat is not used
as a fuel at this time. Instead, it is stored in adipose tissue. (Look
again at Figure 12.9.)

The short-term reservoir supplies nutrients to the brain during brief
periods of fasting (between meals). It is located in the liver, where
energy is stored in glycogen molecules until needed.

the level of insulin falls, and the levels of glucagon and the adrenal
catecholamines rise. These events cause liver glycogen to be converted
to glucose and triglycerides to be broken down into glycerol and fatty
acids. In the absence of insulin, only the central nervous system can
use the glucose that is available in the blood; the rest of the body
lives on fatty acids. Glycerol is converted to glucose by the liver, and
the brain metabolizes the glucose.

During the absorptive phase we receive glucose, amino acids, and fats
from the intestines. The blood level of insulin is high, which permits
all cells to metabolize glucose. In addition, the liver and the muscles
convert glucose to glycogen, which replenishes the short-term reservoir.
Excess carbohydrates and amino acids are converted to fats, and fats are
placed into the long-term reservoir in the adipose tissue.

What Starts a Meal?

we tend to eat when our stomach and upper intestine are empty. This
emptiness provides a hunger signal---a message to our brain that
indicates that we should begin to eat. The time it takes for food to
leave our stomach would seem to encourage establishing a pattern of
eating three meals a day. In addition, our ancestors likely found it
most practical to prepare food for a group of people and have everyone
eat at the same time. Although people's modern-day work schedules are
more hectic and diverse, most follow this routine as well. Although an
empty stomach is an important signal, many factors start a meal,
including the sight of a plate of food, the smell of food cooking in the
kitchen, the presence of other people sitting around the table, or the
words "It's time to eat!"

If you were presented with the kind of meal shown in Figure 12.10, what
factors might be involved in your decisions about what to eat, how much
to eat, and when to begin eating? Many different factors are involved in
our eating behavior. The environment, for example, plays an important
role in when we eat, how much we eat, and when we start eating. So do
internal processes. This module will focus on the some of the mechanisms
that compel us to eat, looking at signals from the environment, stomach
and digestive system, and metabolic responses to the need for food.

Environmental Factors LO 12.8

Summarize the signals from the environment that help start a meal.

Gastric Factors

The environment of our ancestors shaped the evolution of our regulatory
mechanisms. In the past, starvation was a much greater threat to
survival than overeating was. In fact, a tendency to overeat in times of
plenty provided a reserve that could be drawn upon if food became scarce
again---which it often did. A feast-or-famine environment favored the
evolution of mechanisms that were quick to detect losses from the
long-term reservoir and provide a strong signal to seek and eat food.
Natural selection for mechanisms that detected weight gain and
suppressed overeating was much less significant. Many signals contribute
to starting a meal. Most people, if they were asked why they eat, would
say that they do so because they get hungry. By that they probably mean
that something happens inside their body that provides a sensation that
makes them want to eat. But if this is true, just what is happening
inside our bodies? The factors that motivate us to eat when food is
readily available are very different from those that motivate us when
food is scarce. When food is plentiful,

LO 12.9

Describe ghrelin's role as a signal to start a meal.

An empty stomach and upper intestine provide an important endocrine
signal to the brain that it is time to start thinking about finding
something to eat. A peptide hormone called ghrelin is released from the
gastrointestinal system (especially the stomach) when individuals are in
the fasting phase and the digestive system is empty (Kojima et al.,
1999). Ghrelin then binds to receptors in the hypothalamus to help
stimulate eating behavior. (See Figure 12.11.)

Figure 12.11 Ghrelin Signals Ghrelin relays signals from the stomach and
digestive tract to the hypothalamus. Hypothalamus

Ingestive Behavior 387

Blood levels of ghrelin increase with fasting and are reduced after a
meal. Blocking the ghrelin signal inhibits eating, and increasing
ghrelin can cause weight gain by increasing food intake and decreasing
the metabolism of fats. Blood levels of ghrelin increase shortly before
each meal, which suggests that this peptide is involved in the
initiation of a meal (Cummings, 2006). Figure 12.12 shows the
relationship between blood levels of ghrelin and food intake during the
course of a day. Ghrelin is a potent stimulator of food intake, and it
even stimulates thoughts about food. Schmid and colleagues (2005) found
that a single intravenous injection of ghrelin enhanced appetite in
typical participants and elicited vivid images of foods that the
participants liked to eat. As we saw in the case at the beginning of
this chapter, one of the symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome is obesity
caused by almost continuous eating. A possible cause of the overeating
is chronic elevation in the blood level of ghrelin---a level that
remains high even after a meal (DelParigi et al., 2002). A randomized
controlled trial reported some benefits of administering a drug called
AZP-531 to individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome. AZP-531 appears to
act by inhibiting the appetite-increasing effects of ghrelin. In their
study, Allas and colleagues (2018) found that patients treated with
AZP-531 reported improved food-related behaviors, including hyperphagia
(overeating). You will read more about obesity interventions that reduce
ghrelin levels later in this chapter. Although ghrelin is an important
short-term hunger signal, it is not the only one. For example, people
with successful gastric bypass surgery have almost negligible levels of
ghrelin in the blood. Although they eat less and lose weight, they
certainly do not stop eating. In addition, mice with a targeted mutation
against the ghrelin gene or the ghrelin receptor have normal food intake
and body weight (Sun, Ahmed, & Smith, 2003; Sun et al., 2004). However,
Zigman and colleagues (2005) found that this mutation

Metabolic Signals LO 12.10 Describe how metabolic signals play a role in
starting a meal. Most of the time, we begin a meal a few hours after the
previous one, so our nutrient reservoirs are seldom in serious need of
replenishment. But if we skip several meals, we get hungrier and
hungrier, presumably because of physiological signals indicating that we
have been withdrawing nutrients from our long-term reservoir. What
happens to the level of nutrients in our body as time passes after a
meal? As you learned earlier in this chapter, during the absorptive
phase of metabolism we live on food that is being absorbed from the
digestive tract. After that we start drawing on our nutrient reservoirs,
the brain lives on glucose, and the rest of the body lives on fatty
acids. Although the metabolic needs of the body's cells are being met,
we are taking fuel out of our long-term reservoir---making withdrawals
rather than deposits. This is the time to start thinking about our next
meal. A fall in blood glucose level (a condition known as hypoglycemia)
is a potent stimulus for hunger. Hypoglycemia can be produced
experimentally by giving an animal a large injection of insulin, which
causes cells in the liver, muscles, and adipose tissue to take up
glucose and store it away. We can also deprive cells of glucose by
injecting an animal with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). This chemical may sound
familiar because it was described in several experiments from previous
chapters that used radioactive 2-DG in conjunction with PET scanners or
autoradiography to study the metabolic rate of different parts of the
brain. When (nonradioactive) 2-DG is given in large doses, it interferes
with glucose metabolism by competing with glucose for access to the
mechanism that transports glucose through the cell membrane and for
access to the enzymes that metabolize glucose. Both hypoglycemia and
2-DG cause glucoprivation and deprive cells of glucose. And
glucoprivation, whatever its cause, stimulates eating. Hunger can also
be produced by causing lipoprivation--- depriving cells of lipids. More
precisely, they are deprived of the ability to metabolize fatty acids
through injection of a drug such as mercaptoacetate.

GLUCOSE AND LIPIDS

What is the nature of the detectors that monitor the level of metabolic
fuels, and where are these detectors located? There appear to be two
sets of detectors: one set located in the brain and the other set
located in the

protected mice from overeating and gaining weight when fed a tasty
high-fat diet that induced obesity in wild-type mice. Alternative
mechanisms can stimulate feeding, which, given the vital importance of
food, is not surprising. In fact, one of the factors that complicates
research on ingestive behavior is the presence of redundant systems.

388 Chapter 12 liver. The detectors in the brain monitor the nutrients
that are available on their side of the blood--brain barrier, and the
detectors in the liver monitor the nutrients that are available to the
rest of the body. Because the brain can use only glucose, its detectors
are sensitive to glucoprivation, and because the rest of the body can
use both glucose and fatty acids, the detectors in the liver are
sensitive to both glucoprivation and lipoprivation. Liver Detectors
Let's review the evidence for glucose and lipid detectors in the liver.
A study by Novin and colleagues (1973) suggested that receptors in the
liver can stimulate glucoprivic hunger. The investigators infused 2-DG
into a vein to the liver. The infusions of 2-DG caused immediate eating.
When researchers cut the vagus nerve, which connects the liver with the
brain, the infusions no longer stimulated eating.

This indicates that brain receives the glucoprivic hunger ­signal from
the liver through the vagus nerve. Lipoprivic hunger appears to be
stimulated by receptors in the liver as well. Ritter and Taylor (1990)
induced lipoprivic hunger and found that cutting the vagus nerve
abolished this hunger. The liver appears to contain receptors that
detect low availability of glucose or fatty acids (glucoprivation or
lipoprivation) and send this information to the brain through the vagus
nerve (Friedman et al., 2005). (See Figure 12.13.) Brain Detectors Now
let's look at some of the evidence that indicates that the brain has its
own nutrient detectors. Because the brain can use only glucose, it would
make sense that these detectors respond to glucoprivation---and, indeed,
they do. Ritter and colleagues (2000) found that injections of

Figure 12.13 Nutrient Receptors for Glucose and Lipids in the Liver
Receptors for glucose and lipids are located in the liver, and convey
signals about glucoprivation and lipoprivation to the brain through the
vagus nerve. These receptors are located outside the blood--brain
barrier. Receptors for glucose are also located in the brain, inside the
blood--brain barrier.

a drug that produces glucoprivation into two regions of the
hindbrain---the dorsomedial and ventrolateral medulla--- induced eating.
The role of these regions in control of food intake and metabolism is
discussed later in this chapter. To summarize: The brain contains
detectors that monitor the availability of glucose (its only fuel)
inside the blood--brain barrier, and the liver contains detectors that
monitor the availability of nutrients (glucose and fatty acids) outside
the blood--brain barrier. It is important to remember that no single set
of receptors is solely responsible for the information the brain uses

to control eating. For example, mice with a knockout of the ghrelin gene
eat almost normally. In addition, Tordoff and colleagues (1982) found
that cutting the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve, which prevents
hunger signals originating in the liver from reaching the brain, had
little effect on an animal's day-to-day eating. Finally, lesions of the
medulla that abolish both glucoprivic and lipoprivic signals do not lead
to long-term disturbances in the control of feeding (Ritter et al.,
1992). Apparently, the control of metabolism and ingestive behavior is
just too important to entrust to one mechanism.

Module Review: What Starts a Meal? Environmental Factors LO 12.8

Summarize the signals from the environment that help start a meal.

The time of day, presence of groups of people, or cues such as the
sensory signals of food can all contribute to initiating a meal.

Gastric Factors LO 12.9

Describe ghrelin's role as a signal to start a meal.

Ghrelin, a peptide hormone released by the stomach when it and the upper
intestine are empty, is a potent stimulator of food intake. Ghrelin
levels are low during the absorptive phase, and increase before a meal.
Gastric bypass surgery reduces ghrelin levels and is associated with
weight loss.

Metabolic Signals LO 12.10 Describe how metabolic signals play a role in
starting a meal. Studies inhibiting glucose and fatty acid metabolism
indicate that low levels of both of these nutrients are

What Stops a Meal? How do people maintain their body weight? What
happens when body weight isn't maintained and individuals lose or gain
large amounts of weight? Regulating body weight requires a balance
between food intake and energy expenditure. If we ingest more calories
than we burn, we will gain weight. Carbohydrates and proteins contain
about 4 kcal/gm, and fats contain about 9 kcal/gm. (The "calorie" you
might see printed on a food label is actually a kilocalorie---1,000
calories---or enough energy to raise the temperature of a liter of water
by 1° Celsius.) Given that the number of obese individuals worldwide has
doubled since 1980, researchers, clinicians, and policy makers are

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 389

involved in hunger. Animals will eat in response to both glucoprivation
and lipoprivation. These signals are normally present only after more
than one meal has been missed. Receptors in the liver detect both
glucoprivation and lipoprivation and transmit this information to the
brain through sensory axons of the vagus nerve. Glucoprivic eating can
also be stimulated by interfering with glucose metabolism in the
medulla, which indicates that the brain contains its own
glucosesensitive detectors.

ingestive behavior. Zoologists approach you about an endangered primate

increase eating behavior for these animals?

interested in learning more about factors related to satiety and those
that contribute to stopping a meal (World Health Organization, 2015).
Assuming that our energy expenditure is constant, we need two mechanisms
to maintain a relatively constant body weight. One mechanism must
increase our motivation to eat if our long-term nutrient reservoir is
becoming depleted, and another must restrain our food intake if we begin
to take in more calories than we need. Unfortunately, the first
mechanism is more effective than the second one. In general, there are
two primary sources of satiety ­signals---the signals that stop a meal:
short- and long-term satiety signals. Short-term satiety signals stop a
single meal. Long-term satiety signals arise in the adipose tissue,
which

contains the long-term nutrient reservoir. These signals do not control
the beginning and end of a particular meal, but they do, in the long
run, control the intake of calories by modulating the sensitivity of
brain mechanisms to the hunger and satiety signals that they receive.
The following module will investigate the influence of a variety of
shortterm and long-term satiety signals. (See Figure 12.14.)

Researchers studying memory presented a midday meal to B. R. each day
for 3 days. Researchers removed B. R.'s plate when he finished the meal.
Following 10- to 30-minute breaks, a second, and then a third meal were
presented. B. R. completed every first and second meal that was offered.
On one day, he began eating a third meal as well. The researchers
concluded that short-term memory must play a role in short-term satiety
(Rozin et al., 1998).

Short-Term Satiety LO 12.11 Describe the function of short-term satiety
signals. In addition to factors arising from the body's fuel needs,
consider the following case study description and reflect on what
additional factors may be involved in short-term satiety: Patient B. R.
was a 59-year-old male with damage to his temporal lobes, including the
hippocampus and amygdala. His short-term memory was impaired, and he had
no memory of the hospital and room that he had lived in for most of a
year.

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 390

In addition to our memories of the meals we eat, short-term satiety
signals come from the immediate effects of eating a particular meal,
which begin long before the food is digested. To search for these
signals, we will follow the pathway traveled by ingested food: the eyes,
nose, and mouth; the stomach; the small intestine; and the liver. Each
of these locations can potentially provide a signal to the brain that
indicates that food has been ingested and is progressing on the way
toward absorption. We will first start with the impact of environmental
factors.

Environmental Factors

Gastric Factors

LO 12.12 Identify examples of environmental factors that contribute to
satiety.

LO 12.14 Explain how the stomach can provide satiety signals.

Because the consequences of starvation are much more serious than the
consequences of overeating, the process of natural selection has given
us strong mechanisms to start eating and weaker ones to stop eating. The
relatively weak inhibitory control of eating is shown by the fact that
many environmental factors can increase meal size. If there were strong
constraints on food intake, then it should be difficult to get a person
to eat more than a normal amount. de Castro and his colleagues (reviewed
by de Castro, 2004) found that people ate a larger meal if the food was
especially tasty, if it was eaten in the company of other people, if the
portions were larger, and if the meal began later than usual in the day.
Demonstrating the effect of environmental factors on eating, Harrar and
Spence ( 2013) manipulated the visual and tactile properties (weight,
size, color, and shape) of plastic cutlery and measured participants'
ratings of taste and liking of identical foods presented on varying
cutlery. The researchers found a range of taste and liking depending on
the characteristics of the cutlery and the food sampled. Taken together,
research suggests that environmental factors (for example, food
presentation or time of day) can be important regulators of short-term
satiety.

The stomach apparently contains receptors that can detect the presence
of nutrients. Davis and Campbell (1973) allowed rats to eat their fill
and then removed food from the rats' stomachs through an implanted tube.
When the rats were permitted to eat again, they ate almost exactly the
same amount of food that had been taken out. This finding suggests that
animals are able to monitor the amount of food in their stomachs.
Deutsch and Gonzalez (1980) confirmed and extended these findings. They
found that when they removed food from the stomach of a rat that had
just eaten all it wanted, the animal would immediately eat just enough
food to replace what had been removed---even if the experimenters
replaced the food with a nonnutritive saline solution. It appears that
the rats did not simply measure the volume of the food in their
stomachs, because they were not fooled by the infusion of a saline
solution. Of course, this study indicates only that the stomach contains
nutrient receptors; it does not prove that there are not detectors in
the intestines too. Do these results extend to humans as well? It
appears likely that they do. Steinert and colleagues (2012) infused a
glucose solution into either the stomach or intestine of healthy
volunteers. Participants reported increased fullness and reduced hunger
when the glucose solution was infused into the stomach, but not the
intestine. As stated earlier, the stomach and digestive tract release
ghrelin. While high levels of ghrelin are present immediately before a
meal, ghrelin levels fall after a meal and provide a gastric factor of
satiety.

Sensory Factors LO 12.13 Identify sensory factors that contribute to
satiety. You can probably think of several examples of sensory factors
that influence your own eating behavior. Sensory factors include
information about the appearance, odor, taste, texture, and temperature
of food. Taste and odor of food can help animals learn about the caloric
contents of different foods. For example, Cecil and colleagues (1998)
found that people became more satiated when they ate a bowl of highfat
soup than when the experimenters infused an equal amount of soup into
their stomachs with a flexible tube. Apparently, the act of tasting and
swallowing the soup contributed to the feeling of fullness caused by the
presence of the soup in the stomach. As you read in Chapter 7, the
chemosenses (taste and smell) interact to play an important role in the
experience of eating. However, age-related reductions in taste and smell
perception can contribute to reduced appetite and weight loss in older
adults. Some interventions aimed at maintaining body weight and
nutritional status in this population involve enhancing the taste and
smell of foods to make them more palatable (Schiffman, 2000).

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 391

Intestinal Factors LO 12.15 Describe how the intestines can provide
satiety signals. The intestines contain nutrient detectors as well.
Studies with rats have shown that afferent axons arising from the
duodenum are sensitive to the presence of glucose, amino acids, and
fatty acids (Ritter et al., 1992). In fact, some of the chemoreceptors
found in the duodenum are also found in the tongue. These axons may
transmit a satiety signal to the brain. Feinle, Grundy, and Read (1997)
had people swallow an inflatable bag attached to the end of a thin,
flexible tube. When the stomach and duodenum were empty, the subjects
reported that they simply felt bloated when the bag was inflated,
filling the stomach. However, when fats or carbohydrates were infused
into the duodenum while the bag was being inflated, the people reported

sensations of fullness like those experienced after eating a meal. This
demonstrates that stomach and intestinal satiety factors can interact.
That's not surprising, given the fact that by the time we finish a
typical meal, our stomachs are full and a small quantity of nutrients
has been received by the duodenum. Researchers have used the term
"brake" to describe how nutrients in the small intestine can produce
satiety and reduce eating behavior through negative feedback. There is
considerable interest in targeting this brake as an intervention to
reduce eating behavior and treat obesity (Maljaars et al., 2008; Shin et
al., 2013). After food reaches the stomach, it is mixed with
hydrochloric acid and pepsin, an enzyme that breaks proteins into their
constituent amino acids. As digestion proceeds, food is gradually
introduced from the stomach into the duodenum. There, the food is mixed
with bile and pancreatic enzymes, which continue the digestive process.
The duodenum controls the rate of stomach emptying by secreting a
peptide hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK is secreted in
response to the presence of fats, which are detected by receptors in the
walls of the duodenum. In addition to stimulating contraction of the
gallbladder, CCK causes the pylorus to constrict and inhibits gastric
contractions, keeping the stomach from giving the duodenum more food.
The blood level of CCK must be related to the amount of nutrients
(particularly fats) that the duodenum receives from the stomach. CCK
could potentially provide a satiety signal to the brain, telling it that
the duodenum was receiving food from the stomach. Many studies have
indeed found that injections of CCK suppress eating (Moran, 2009).
However, mice with a targeted mutation against the gene responsible for
the production of CCK ate normal amounts of food and did not become
obese. Presumably, compensatory mechanisms prevented the animals from
overeating. CCK does not act directly on the brain; instead, it acts on
receptors located in the junction between the stomach and the duodenum
(Moran et al., 1989). South and Ritter (1988) found that the
appetite-suppressing effect of CCK was abolished by the application of
capsaicin to the vagus nerve. Capsaicin, a drug extracted from chile
peppers, destroys sensory axons in the vagus nerve. This finding
indicates that signals from CCK receptors are transmitted to the brain
via the vagus nerve. As we saw earlier in this chapter, secretion of
ghrelin by the stomach provides a signal that increases hunger. Once a
meal begins and food starts to enter the duodenum, the secretion of
ghrelin is suppressed. The suppression of a hunger signal could be
another factor that brings a meal to its end. Investigators have
discovered a chemical produced by cells in the gastrointestinal tract
that appears to serve as

PYY Treatment

an additional satiety signal. This chemical, peptide YY3-36 (PYY), is
released by the small intestine after a meal in amounts proportional to
the calories that were just ingested (Pedersen-Bjergaard et al., 1996).
Only nutrients caused PYY to be secreted; a large drink of water had no
effect. Injections of PYY significantly decrease the size of meals eaten
by members of several species, including rats and both lean and obese
humans (Batterham et al., 2007; Schloegl et al., 2011). In addition,
Stoeckel and colleagues (2008) found that the amount of PYY released
after a meal correlates positively with people's ratings of satiety.
(See Figure 12.15.)

Liver Factors LO 12.16 Explain how the liver provides late-stage satiety
signals. Satiety produced by gastric factors and duodenal factors is
anticipatory; that is, these factors predict that the food in the
digestive system will, when absorbed, eventually restore the system
variables that cause hunger. Not until nutrients are absorbed from the
intestines can they be used to nourish the cells of the body and
replenish the body's nutrient reservoirs. The last stage of satiety
signaling appears to originate in the liver, which is the first organ to
learn that food is finally being received from the intestines. Evidence
that nutrient detectors in the liver play a role in satiety comes from
several sources. For example, Tordoff and Friedman (1988) infused small
amounts of two nutrients, glucose and fructose, into the hepatic

24/11/21 1:44 PM

Ingestive Behavior 393

LO 12.17 Describe how insulin can function as a satiety signal. Recall
that the absorptive phase of metabolism is accompanied by an increased
level of insulin in the blood. Insulin permits organs other than the
brain to metabolize glucose, and it promotes the entry of nutrients into
fat cells, where they are converted into triglycerides. Remember that
cells in the brain do not need insulin to metabolize glucose.
Nevertheless, the brain contains insulin receptors (Unger et al., 1989).
What purpose do these insulin receptors serve? They appear to detect
insulin present in the blood, which tells the brain that the body is
probably in the absorptive phase of metabolism. In addition to its other
roles, insulin may serve as a ­satiety signal (Woods et al., 2006).
Insulin is a peptide and would not normally be admitted to the brain.
However, a transport mechanism delivers it through the blood--brain
barrier, and it reaches neurons in the hypothalamus that are involved in
regulation of hunger and satiety. Infusion of insulin into the third
ventricle inhibits eating and causes a loss of body weight (Woods et
al., 1979). In addition, Brüning and colleagues (2000) prepared a
targeted mutation in mice that prevented the production of insulin
receptors in the brain without affecting their production elsewhere in
the body. The mice became obese, especially when they were fed a tasty,
high-fat diet, which would be expected if one of the satiety factors was
absent.

Adipose Tissue Factors LO 12.18 Contrast the function of satiety signals
from adipose tissue with short-term satiety signals. So far, we have
discussed short-term satiety factors--- those arising from a single
meal. But in most people, body

portal vein. The amounts they used were similar to those that are
produced when a meal is being digested. Both of the infusions "fooled"
the liver; both nutrients reduced the amount of food that the rats ate.
Fructose cannot cross the blood--brain barrier and is metabolized very
poorly by cells in the rest of the body, but it can readily be
metabolized by the liver. Therefore, the signal from this nutrient must
have originated in the liver. These results strongly suggest that when
the liver receives nutrients from the intestines, it sends a signal to
the brain that produces satiety. More accurately, the signal continues
the satiety that was already started by signals arising from the stomach
and upper intestine.

weight appears to be regulated over the long term. If an animal is
force-fed so that it becomes heavier than normal, it will reduce its
food intake once it is permitted to choose how much to eat (Wilson et
al., 1990). (See Figure 12.16.) Similar studies have shown that an
animal will adjust its food intake appropriately if it is given a
high-calorie or low-calorie diet. And if an animal is put on a diet that
reduces its body weight, short-term satiety factors become much less
effective (Cabanac & Lafrance, 1991). Signals arising from the long-term
nutrient reservoir may alter the sensitivity of the brain to hunger
signals or short-term satiety signals. What system variable permits the
body weight of most organisms to remain relatively stable? It is likely
that some variable related to body fat is regulated. The basic
difference between obese and nonobese people is the amount of fat stored
in their adipose tissue. Perhaps fat tissue provides a signal to the
brain that indicates how much of it there is. The discovery of a
long-term satiety signal from fat tissue came after years of study with
a strain of genetically obese mice. The ob mouse (as this strain is
called) has a low metabolism, overeats, and becomes obese. It also
develops diabetes in adulthood, just as many obese people do. Studying
ob mice, researchers in several laboratories reported discovering the
cause of the obesity (Campfield et al., 1995; Halaas et al., 1995;
Pelleymounter et al., 1995). A particular gene, called OB, normally
produces a peptide hormone that has been given the name leptin (from the
Greek word leptos, "thin"). Leptin is normally secreted by

24/11/21 1:44 PM

394 Chapter 12 well-nourished fat cells. Because of a genetic mutation,
the fat cells of ob mice are unable to produce leptin. Leptin has
profound effects on metabolism and eating, acting as an antiobesity
hormone. If ob mice are given daily injections of leptin, their
metabolic rate increases, their body temperature rises, they become more
active, and they eat less. As a result, their weight returns to normal.
Figure 12.17 shows a picture of an untreated ob mouse and an ob mouse
that has received injections of leptin. The discovery of leptin has
stimulated much interest among researchers who are seeking ways to treat
human obesity. Because it is a natural hormone, it appeared to provide a
way to help people to lose weight without the use of drugs that have
potentially harmful effects. Unfortunately, as we shall see later in
this chapter, leptin is not a useful treatment for obesity for most
people.

Module Review: What Stops a Meal? Short-Term Satiety LO 12.11 Describe
the function of short-term satiety signals. Short-term satiety signals
control the size of a meal. Short-term satiety signals come from the
immediate effects of eating a particular meal, which begin long before
the food is digested.

Environmental Factors LO 12.12 Identify examples of environmental
factors that contribute to satiety. People eat a larger meal if the food
is especially tasty, if it is eaten in the company of other people, if
the portions are larger, and if the meal begins later than usual in the
day.

Sensory Factors LO 12.13 Identify sensory factors that contribute to
satiety. Sensory factors include information about the appearance, odor,
taste, texture, and temperature of food. Sensory factors related to
satiety include feedback from the nose and mouth about the nutritive
value of the food eaten.

Gastric Factors LO 12.14 Explain how the stomach can provide satiety
signals. Gastric satiety factors are activated by the entry of food into
the stomach. The stomach possesses nutrient detectors that convey
satiety signals. As presented earlier in this chapter,

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 394

the stomach and intestines also secrete ghrelin, and a fall in ghrelin
provides a satiety signal to the brain.

Intestinal Factors LO 12.15 Describe how the intestines can provide
satiety signals. Intestinal satiety factors are activated by the passage
of food from the stomach into the duodenum. The intestines possess
nutrient detectors that convey satiety signals. Another satiety signal
from the intestine is provided by CCK, which is secreted by the duodenum
when it receives fat-rich food from the stomach. Information about the
secretion of CCK is transmitted to the brain through the afferent axons
of the vagus nerve. PYY, a peptide secreted after a meal by the
intestines, also acts as a satiety signal. As presented earlier in this
chapter, the stomach and intestines also secrete ghrelin, and a fall in
ghrelin provides a satiety signal to the brain.

Liver Factors LO 12.16 Explain how the liver provides late-stage satiety
signals. A satiety signal comes from the liver, which detects ­nutrients
being received from the intestines through the hepatic portal vein.

Insulin LO 12.17 Describe how insulin can function as a satiety signal.
Although a high level of insulin in the blood causes glucoprivic eating
by reducing blood levels of glucose,

moderately high levels, associated with the absorptive phase of

well-nourished adipose tissue that increases an animal's metabolic rate
and decreases food intake.

Thought Question

Unlike short-term satiety signals that regulate the size of a meal,
signals arising from fat tissue affect food intake on a long-term basis,
apparently by modulating the effectiveness of short-term hunger and
satiety signals. Force-feeding facilitates satiety, and starvation
inhibits it. Studies of the ob mouse led to the discovery of leptin, a
peptide hormone secreted by

How are hormones involved in eating regulation? Make a table organizing
information about the role of hormones in short-term and long-term
satiety. First, make a list of all of the hormone signals in this
module. For each hormone, decide if it is likely to be present or absent
when a typical person is in the absorptive or fasting phase. Make a
column for "absorptive phase" and another column for "fasting phase."
For each hormone, indicate if it is present (+) or absent (-) in each
phase. After making your table, do you think more hormone signals are
involved in starting or stopping a meal? Why might that be?

Brain Mechanisms

Figure 12.18 Decerebration

LO 12.18 Contrast the function of satiety signals from adipose tissue
with short-term satiety signals.

Although many hunger and satiety signals originate in the digestive
system and in the body's nutrient reservoirs, the target of these
signals is the brain. This module explores some of the research on the
brain mechanisms that control food intake and metabolism.

The operation disconnects the forebrain from the hindbrain so that the
muscles involved in ingestive behavior are controlled solely by
hindbrain mechanisms. Decerebration is accomplished by transecting the
brain stem.

Brain Stem LO 12.19 Identify the functions of the brain stem involved in
eating regulation. Ingestive behaviors are phylogenetically ancient. All
our ancestors ate and drank or died prematurely of dehydration or
starvation. Therefore, we should expect that the basic ingestive
behaviors of chewing and swallowing are programmed by phylogenetically
ancient brain circuits. Indeed, studies have shown that these behaviors
can be performed by decerebrate rats, whose brains were transected
between the diencephalon and the midbrain (Flynn & Grill, 1983; Grill &
Kaplan, 1990; Norgren & Grill, 1982). Decerebration disconnects the
motor neurons of the brain stem and spinal cord from the neural circuits
of the cerebral hemispheres (such as the cerebral cortex and basal
ganglia) that normally control them. The only behaviors that decerebrate
animals can display are those that are directly controlled by neural
circuits located within the brain stem. (See Figure 12.18.) Decerebrate
rats cannot approach and eat food. The experimenters must place food, in
liquid form, into their mouths. Decerebrate rats can distinguish between
different tastes (they drink and swallow sweet or slightly salty liquids
and spit out bitter ones). They even respond to hunger and satiety
signals. They drink more sucrose after 24 hours of food deprivation, and
they drink less of it if

some sucrose is first injected directly into their stomachs. They also
eat in response to glucoprivation. Research indicates that the brain
stem contains neural circuits that can detect hunger and satiety signals
and control at least some aspects of food intake (Flynn & Grill, 1983;
Grill & Kaplan, 1990; Norgren & Grill, 1982). The area postrema and the
nucleus of the solitary tract (the AP/NST) are parts of the medulla that
receive taste information from the tongue and a variety of sensory
information from the internal organs, including signals from detectors
in the stomach, duodenum, and liver. In addition, this region contains a
set of detectors that are sensitive to the brain's own fuel: glucose.
All this information

24/11/21 1:45 PM

396 Chapter 12 is transmitted to regions of the forebrain that are more
directly involved in control of eating and metabolism. Events that
produce hunger increase the activity of neurons in the AP/NST. In
addition, lesions of this region abolish both glucoprivic and lipoprivic
feeding (Ritter, Dinh, & Friedman, 1994; Ritter & Taylor, 1990).

Hypothalamus LO 12.20 Identify functions of the hypothalamus involved in
eating regulation. Two regions of the hypothalamus are critical to
regulating ingestive behavior. The lateral hypothalamus regulates
hunger, while the ventromedial hypothalamus regulates satiety. (See
Figure 12.19). Stimulating the lateral hypothalamus produces eating
behavior, while lesioning it abolishes this behavior (Anand & Brobeck,
1951; Teitelbaum & Stellar, 1954). Conversely, lesioning the
ventromedial hypothalamus produced overeating, while electrical
stimulation suppressed eating (Hetherington & Ranson, 1942). ROLE IN
HUNGER The peptides, melanin-­concentrating hormone (MCH) and orexin
(also known as hypocretin), are produced by neurons in the lateral
hypothalamus.

These neuropeptides stimulate hunger and decrease metabolic rate to help
increase and preserve the body's energy stores (Arora & Anubhuti, 2006).
MCH and orexin are orexigens, "appetite-inducing chemicals." Injecting
either of these peptides into the lateral ventricles or various regions
of the brain induce eating. If rats are deprived of food, MCH and orexin
production in the lateral hypothalamus increases (Dube, Kalra, & Kalra,
1999; Qu et al., 1996; Sakurai et al., 1998). MCH appears to play a more
important role in stimulating feeding. Mice with a targeted mutation
against the MCH gene or those that receive injections of an MCH receptor
antagonist eat less than wild-type mice and are consequently underweight
(Shimada et al., 1998). In addition, genetically engineered mice with
increased production of MCH in the hypothalamus overeat and gain weight
(Ludwig et al., 2001). Besides playing a role in the regulation of sleep
cycles (as we saw in Chapter 9), orexin may also play a role in the
relationship between eating and sleep. Mieda and colleagues (2004)
studied mice with a targeted mutation against the orexin gene. Healthy
mice that are fed one meal at the same time each day show increased
locomotor activity shortly before mealtime. They also show increased
activation of

orexin-secreting neurons at this time. Presumably, in the wild this
anticipatory activity would manifest itself in a hunger-induced search
for food. Mieda and his colleagues found that mice with the orexin
knockout adjusted their intake so that they received a sufficient amount
of food during the single meal, but they did not show increased
wakefulness or anticipatory activity just before mealtime. Yamanaka and
colleagues (2003) suggest that the decreased activity seen in
orexin-secreting neurons after feeding may contribute to the sleepiness
that is often felt after a meal. The axons of MCH and orexin neurons
travel to a variety of brain structures that are known to be involved in
motivation and movement, including the neocortex, periaqueductal gray
matter, reticular formation, thalamus, and locus coeruleus. These
neurons also have connections with neurons in the spinal cord that
control the autonomic nervous system, which explains how they can affect
the body's metabolic rate (Nambu et al., 1999; Sawchenko, 1998). These
connections are shown in Figure 12.20. Neuropeptide Y As we saw earlier,
hunger signals caused by an empty stomach or by glucoprivation or
lipoprivation arise from detectors in the abdominal cavity and brain
stem. How do these signals activate the MCH and orexin neurons of the
lateral hypothalamus? Part of the pathway involves a system of neurons
that secrete a neurotransmitter called neuropeptide Y (NPY), an
extremely potent stimulator of food intake (Clark et al., 1984).
Infusion of NPY into the hypothalamus produces ravenous, almost frantic
eating. Rats that receive an infusion of this peptide into the

brain will work very hard, pressing a lever many times for each morsel
of food; they will eat food made bitter with quinine; and they will
continue to drink milk even when doing so means that they receive an
electric shock to their tongue (Flood & Morley, 1991; Jewett et al.,
1992). Yang and colleagues (2009) found that a genetic manipulation that
increased the production of NPY in the hypothalamus increased food
intake in rats. In contrast, a manipulation that decreased its
production reduced eating, obesity, and diabetes in members of a strain
of rats that had been selectively bred to overeat and become obese. The
cell bodies of most of the neurons that secrete NPY are found in the
arcuate nucleus, located in the hypothalamus at the base of the third
ventricle. Neurons that secrete NPY are affected by hunger and satiety
signals. Sahu and colleagues 1988) found that hypothalamic levels of NPY
are increased by food deprivation and reduced by eating. In addition,
Myers and colleagues (1995) found that hypothalamic injections of a drug
that blocks neuropeptide Y receptors suppress eating caused by food
deprivation. Li and Ritter (2004) found that glucoprivation increased
the production of NPY in some neurons. As we saw earlier, ghrelin,
released by the stomach, provides a potent hunger signal to the brain.
Shuto and colleagues (2002) found that rats with a targeted mutation
that prevents ghrelin receptors from being produced in the hypothalamus
ate less and gained weight more slowly than normal rats did. Evidence
indicates that ghrelin exerts its effects on appetite and metabolism by
stimulating receptors located on NPY neurons (Nakazato et al., 2001;

398 Chapter 12 Van den Top et al., 2004; Willesen et al., 1999). Two
important hunger signals---glucoprivation and ghrelin---activate the
orexigenic NPY neurons. Dopamine A study by Abizaid and colleagues
(2006) found that ghrelin also activates neurons in the mesolimbic
motivation and reinforcement system. Dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) contain ghrelin receptors, and the
investigators found that intraperitoneal injections of ghrelin or
infusion of ghrelin directly into the VTA elicited eating in rats and
mice. The administration of ghrelin also increased the activity of DA
neurons and triggered the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens,
the major target of VTA dopaminergic neurons. AGRP NPY neurons of the
arcuate nucleus send a projection directly to MCH and orexin neurons in
the lateral hypothalamus (Broberger et al., 1998; Elias et al., 1998b).
These connections appear to be primarily responsible for the feeding
elicited by activation of NPY neurons. In addition, NPY neurons send a
projection of axons to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), a region of
the hypothalamus where infusions of NPY affect metabolic functions,
including the secretion of insulin (Bai et al., 1985). The terminals of
hypothalamic NPY neurons release another orexigenic peptide in addition
to neuropeptide Y: agouti-related protein (AGRP) (Hahn et al., 1998).
The two hormones appear to act together. AGRP, like NPY, is a potent and
extremely long-lasting orexigen. Infusion of a very small amount of this
peptide into the third ventricle of rats produces an increase in food
intake that can last for 6 days (Lu et al., 2001). Endocannabinoids
Finally, there is one other category of orexigenic compounds to mention
in this module: the endocannabinoids. (See Bellocchio, 2010, and De
Marzo and Matias, 2005, for reviews of the evidence cited in this
paragraph.) One of the effects of the THC contained in marijuana is an
increase in appetite---especially for highly palatable foods. The
endocannabinoids, whose actions are mimicked by THC, stimulate eating,
apparently by increasing the release of MCH and orexin. (As you will
recall from ­Chapter 4, cannabinoid receptors are found on terminal
buttons, where they regulate the release of other neurotransmitters.)
Levels of endocannabinoids are highest during fasting and lowest during
feeding. A genetic mutation that disrupts the production of the enzyme
that destroys the endocannabinoids after they have been released causes
weight gain and obesity. Cannabinoid agonists have been used to increase
the appetite of cancer patients, and until adverse side effects were
discovered, cannabinoid antagonists were used as an aid to weight
reduction. (You will read more about this use later in this chapter, in
the module on obesity.)

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 398

In summary, activity of MCH and orexin neurons of the lateral
hypothalamus increases food intake and decreases metabolic rate. These
neurons are activated by NPY/AGRP-secreting neurons of the arcuate
nucleus, which are sensitive to ghrelin and which receive excitatory
input from NPY neurons in the medulla that are sensitive to
glucoprivation. The NPY/AGRP neurons of the arcuate nucleus also project
to the paraventricular nucleus, which plays a role in control of insulin
secretion and metabolism. The endocannabinoids stimulate appetite by
increasing the release of MCH and orexin. (See Figure 12.21.) ROLE IN
SATIETY The ventromedial hypothalamus is an

important satiety regulator. Here, satiety signals converge to inhibit
eating behavior. Several hormones, the anorexigens or
appetite-suppressing peptides, function as signals for satiety with
effects in the ventromedial hypothalamus. Leptin As we saw earlier in
this chapter, leptin, a hormone secreted by adipose tissue, suppresses
eating and raises the animal's metabolic rate. The interactions of this
long-term satiety signal with neural circuits involved in hunger are

now being discovered. Leptin produces its behavioral and metabolic
effects by binding with receptors in the brain---in particular, on
neurons that secrete the orexigenic peptides NPY and AGRP. Activation of
leptin receptors on NPY/AGRPsecreting neurons in the arcuate nucleus has
an inhibitory effect on neurons secreting NPY and AGRP (Glaum ­et al.,
1996; Jobst et al., 2004). Because NPY/AGRP neurons normally activate
orexin and MCH neurons, the presence of leptin in the arcuate nucleus
decreases the release of these orexigens. Leptin appears to suppress
animals' sensitivity to both olfactory and gustatory stimuli associated
with food. Getchell and colleagues (2006) found that ob mice, which lack
the leptin gene, found buried food much faster than normal mice did. An
injection of leptin into the mutant mice increased their time to find
food. Kawai and colleagues (2000) found that leptin decreased the
sensitivity of gustatory sweet receptors to the taste of sucrose and
saccharine. CART The arcuate nucleus contains another system of neurons
that secrete two peptide anorexigens. Douglass and colleagues (1995)
discovered the first of these peptides, which is now called CART (for
cocaineand amphetamine-regulated transcript). When cocaine or
amphetamine is administered to an animal, levels of this peptide
increase, which may have something to do with the fact that these drugs
suppress appetite.

CART neurons appear to play an important role in satiety. If animals are
deprived of food, levels of CART decrease. Injection of CART into the
cerebral ventricles inhibits feeding, including the feeding stimulated
by NPY. Infusion of a CART antibody, which destroys molecules of CART,
increases feeding (Kristensen et al., 1998). Activity of CART neurons
appears to suppress eating by inhibiting MCH and orexin neurons and to
increase metabolic rate through connections of these neurons with
neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. CART neurons contain leptin
receptors that have an excitatory effect; thus, activation of
CART-secreting neurons appears to be at least partly responsible for the
satiating effect of leptin (Elias et al., 1998a). a-MSH A second
anorexigen, A-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (A-MSH), is also released
by CART neurons. This peptide is an agonist of the melanocortin 4
receptor (MC4R); it binds with the receptor and inhibits feeding. You
will recall that NPY neurons also release AGRP, which stimulates eating.
Both a-MSH and AGRP bind with the MC4R. However, whereas AGRP binds with
MC4 receptors and causes feeding (as we saw in the previous submodule),
a-MSH binds with MC4 receptors and inhibits eating. (See Figure 12.22.)
In summary, leptin appears to exert at least some of its satiating
effects by binding with leptin receptors on neurons in the arcuate
nucleus. Leptin inhibits

mechanisms involving endocrine signals from stomach, intestines,
pancreas, and adipose tissue, as well as peptides released from the
hypothalamus. Leptin and insulin inhibit the orexigenic NPY/AGRP neurons
(purple) and stimulate the anorexigenic melanocortin neurons (green),
resulting in a reduction of food intake. Ghrelin or PYY activate or

responses, respectively. This figure also includes an additional
receptor subtype (MC3R) involved in appetite regulation. Source: Taken

400 Chapter 12 NPY/AGRP neurons, which suppresses the feeding that these
peptides stimulate and prevents the decrease in metabolic rate that they
provoke. Leptin activates CART/a-MSH neurons, which then inhibit MCH and
orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and prevent their stimulatory
effect on appetite. PYY, released by the gastrointestinal tract just
after a meal, inhibits orexigenic NPY/AGRP neurons. (See Figure 12.23.)
Appetite for food is controlled by a balance between orexigenic and
anorexigenic factors. We saw that ghrelin activates NPY/AGRP neurons,
which directly increases appetite. Ghrelin also inhibits CART/a-MSH
neurons, which decreases the anorexic effect of these two peptides
(Cowley et al., 2003). Another appetite-stimulating peptide, orexin,
also inhibits CART/a-MSH neurons (Ma et al., 2007). Thus, two important
orexigenic peptides inhibit the activity of anorexigenic peptides. This
module introduced several neuropeptides and peripheral peptides
(produced outside the brain) that play a role in eating regulation and
metabolism. Table 12.2 summarizes information about these compounds.

Module Review: Brain Mechanisms Brain Stem LO 12.19 Identify the
functions of the brain stem involved in eating regulation. The brain
stem contains neural circuits that are able to control acceptance or
rejection of sweet or bitter foods and can even be modulated by
satiation or physiological hunger signals, such as a decrease in glucose
metabolism or the presence of food in the digestive system. The area
postrema and nucleus of the solitary tract (AP/NST) receive signals from
the tongue, stomach, small intestine, and liver and send the information
on to many regions of the forebrain. These signals interact and help to
control food intake. Lesions of the AP/NST disrupt both glucoprivic and
lipoprivic eating.

Hypothalamus LO 12.20 Identify functions of the hypothalamus involved in
eating regulation. The lateral hypothalamus is involved in initiating
eating, and the ventromedial hypothalamus is involved in regulating
satiety. The lateral hypothalamus contains two sets of neurons whose
activity increases eating and decreases metabolic rate. These neurons
secrete the peptides orexin and MCH (melanin-concentrating hormone).
Food deprivation increases the level of these peptides, and mice with a
targeted mutation against MCH undereat. Secretion of orexin also keeps
animals from sleeping through the time for a meal if food is available
only intermittently. The axons of these neurons project to regions of
the brain involved in motivation, movement, and metabolism. The release
of neuropeptide Y in the lateral hypothalamus induces ravenous eating,
an effect that is produced by excitatory connections of NPY-secreting
neurons with the orexin and MCH neurons. NPY neurons in the arcuate
nucleus of the hypothalamus receive input from glucose-sensitive neurons
in the medulla. NPY neurons are the primary target of ghrelin in the
hypothalamus.

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 401

Ghrelin also activates the mesolimbic reinforcement system by
stimulating dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area, which
increases the release of DA in the nucleus accumbens. When NPY is
infused in the paraventricular nucleus, it decreases metabolic rate.
Levels of NPY increase when an animal is deprived of food and fall again
when the animal eats. Blocking NPY receptors suppresses eating. NPY
neurons also release a peptide called AGRP. This peptide serves as an
antagonist at MC4 receptors and, like NPY, stimulates eating.
Endocannabinoids also stimulate eating, apparently by increasing the
release of MCH and orexin. Leptin desensitizes the brain to hunger
signals. It binds with receptors in the arcuate nucleus of the
hypothalamus, where it inhibits NPY-secreting neurons, increasing
metabolic rate and suppressing eating. The arcuate nucleus also contains
neurons that secrete CART, a peptide that suppresses eating. These
neurons, which are activated by leptin, have inhibitory connections with
MCH and orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. CART neurons also
secrete a peptide called a-MSH, which serves as an agonist at MC4
receptors and inhibits eating. Ghrelin, which activates NPY/AGRP neurons
and stimulates hunger, also inhibits CART/a-MSH neurons and suppresses
the satiating effect of the peptides secreted by these neurons. The
anorexigenic peptide, PYY, which is released by the gastrointestinal
system, suppresses the release of NPY and AGRP.

Obesity

Table 12.3 BMI Categories

Obesity is increasing in both developed and developing countries as
household incomes rise. As of 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults (age 18
and over) were overweight, with 650 million of those adults considered
obese. These raw numbers equate to 39 percent of the world's adult
population being overweight and 13 percent qualifying as obese. And the
issue isn't restricted to adults. It's a serious problem among children
as well, with approximately 380 million children and adolescents
considered overweight or obese (WHO 2018). The known health risks of
obesity include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, arthritis, and
some forms of cancer. Until recently type II diabetes was rarely seen in
people before the age of 40. However, because of the increased incidence
of obesity, this disorder is becoming more common, even among children.
One way of assessing body weight and health risks associated with being
under or overweight is to calculate a body mass index (BMI) score. The
formula to calculate a BMI score is: weight (kg)/\[height (m)\]2 or
weight (lb.)/ \[height (in.)\]2 : 703. BMI scores are often listed in
four basic categories, listed in Table 12.3. The following case presents
one approach to weight loss in obesity. A. J. was 17 years-old with a
body mass index score of 53. She had been involved in an intensive
weight-loss program for several years and received nutritional
information, regular physical exercise, and support from a counselor. A.
J. decided to pursue gastric surgery to reduce her body weight and
improve her health. A. J. underwent a sleeve gastrectomy. This procedure
removes the majority of the stomach pouch, leaving a "sleeve" that is
much smaller than the original stomach. Six months after the surgery,
she had lost 36.5 kg (approximately 80 lb.). Twelve months after surgery
she lost an additional 3.7 kg (8 lb.), and after 24 months, an
additional 11.4 kg (25 lb.).

Altogether her body mass index was reduced to 35, along with a dramatic
reduction in the volume of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (see
Figure 12.24; Blüher et al., 2013). This weight loss had important
health implications for A. J. Following surgery, previously elevated
measures of liver enzymes (indicative of poor liver function) and
insulin resistance (a predictor of developing type II diabetes) returned
to within normal ranges.

The case study of A. J. highlights the current challenges we face in
overcoming obesity. Effectively treating obesity is difficult, despite
the availability of many different interventions. For some individuals,
strict regulation of diet and a rigorous exercise program is effective,
but often it is not. For other individuals, gastric surgery (such as A.
J.'s sleeve gastrectomy, or the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass that you will
read about later in the chapter) is an effective treatment, but these
surgeries are not guaranteed to work either. The challenges presented by
obesity are complex, and we will look more closely at the factors that
lead to obesity and that also might prove effective in combating it.
Gastric surgical procedures, for example, don't just change the amount
of food consumed, they also impact hunger and satiety signals in the
hypothalamus. Patients have reported reduced feelings of hunger, fewer
food cravings (Rieber et al., 2013), and reduced ghrelin and leptin
levels (Yousseif et al., 2014) following sleeve gastrectomy.

Ingestive Behavior 403

Possible Causes LO 12.21 Compare the roles of environment, physical
activity, and genetics in obesity. What causes obesity? Genetic
differences---and their effects on development of the endocrine system
and brain mechanisms that control food intake and metabolism---appear to
be responsible for the majority of cases of extreme obesity. But, as we
just saw, obesity rates have been rising dramatically over recent
decades. Rapid changes in the gene pool are unlikely to account for the
majority of this overall increase in weight gain throughout the world's
population. Environmental changes (which occur more quickly than genetic
changes in a population) that influence people's behavior are a
significant contributing cause. Body weight is the result of the
difference between two factors: calories consumed and energy expended.
If we consume more calories than we expend as heat and work, we gain
weight. If we expend more than we consume, we lose weight. In many
societies, inexpensive, convenient, good-tasting, high-calorie food is
readily available, which promotes an increase in intake. Fast-food
restaurants are close at hand, parking is convenient (or even
unnecessary at restaurants with drivethru windows), and portion sizes
have increased. People eat out more often than they used to, and often
do so at inexpensive fast-food restaurants. Many prepared foods contain
high-fructose corn syrup (Bray et al., 2004). Fructose, unlike glucose,
does not stimulate insulin secretion or enhance leptin production, so
this form of sugar is less likely to activate the brain's satiety
mechanisms (Teff et al., 2004). Different environments can also
influence food intake. For example, the transition to college life is
often associated with changes in eating and physical activity patterns.
Many students are familiar with the idea of the "freshman 5 (or
15)"---gaining 5 pounds (or more) during the first year of college. This
phenomenon was partially confirmed in a sample of Canadian college
students. Seventy percent of the students in the study gained weight
during their 4 years in college, averaging gains of 5.3 ; 4.7 kg (11.7 ;
9.1 lb.). While this weight gain was consistent with expected growth for
males and females from 18 to 20 years of age, it is important to note
that BMI and percentage body fat also increased in this group.
Furthermore, the percent of obese individuals in the sample increased
from 18 percent at the beginning of the 4-year study to 31 percent at
the end (Gropper et al., 2012). A study in a sample of American college
students revealed that female students gained 1.8 ; 2.9 kg (4.0 ; 6.3
lb.) while male students gained 1.6 ; 3.9 kg (3.5 ; 8.5 lb.). Both
groups experienced significantly increased BMI. The significant weight
gains in this study all occurred within the first 4 months of college
(HolmDenoma et al., 2008).

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 403

In a longitudinal study of college students across seven semesters,
Small and colleagues (2013) found that students reduced their intake of
fruits and vegetables and the number of days that they engaged in
vigorous physical activity from their first to their fourth year of
college. Students living off campus were the least likely to consume
fruits and vegetables and to engage in vigorous exercise. In contrast,
students consumed fewer sugar-sweetened beverages over time. On a
broader scale, some parts of the U.S. are considered food deserts, or
areas where fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other staples of
a healthy diet are not readily available, and there may be few, if any,
grocery stores or markets. The absence of healthy food options in these
areas can contribute to reliance upon cheap, highly processed foods from
convenience stores or fast-food chains, adding to a host of health
problems, including rising obesity rates (Walker et al., 2010). Another
modern trend contributing to the obesity epidemic involves changes in
people's expenditure of energy. The proportion of people employed in
jobs that require a high level of physical activity has decreased
considerably, which means that on the average we need less food than
previous generations did. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors probably
consumed about 3,000 kcal per day and expended about 1,000 kcal in their
everyday activities. People with sedentary occupations in today's
industrialized societies consume a little less than their
ancestors---about 2,400 kcal---but they use only about 300 kcal in
physical activity (Booth & Neufer, 2005). We expend energy in two basic
ways: through physical activity and through the production of heat. Not
all physical activity can be categorized as "exercise." A study by
Levine and colleagues (1999) fed nonobese people a diet for 8 weeks that
contained 1,000 calories more than they needed to sustain their weight.
Approximately 39 percent of the calories were converted into fat tissue,
and approximately 26 percent went into lean tissue, increased resting
metabolic rate, and the energy required to digest the extra food. The
rest, approximately 33 percent, went into an increase in involuntary
activity: muscle tone, p ­ostural changes, and fidgeting. Levine and his
colleagues referred to this phenomenon as "nonexercise activity
t­hermogenesis," or NEAT. The amount of fat tissue that a person gained
was inversely related to their level of NEAT. Levine and colleagues
(2005) measured NEAT levels in a group of people with sedentary
lifestyles that included both lean and moderately obese individuals. The
investigators found that the people who were overweight remained seated
2.5 hours per day more than the lean people. More recent work by Levine
and colleagues has begun to include recommendations for increasing NEAT
to promote physical health and better understand the neural and
physiological basis of NEAT behaviors---many of which overlap with the
brain

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FACTORS

24/11/21 1:45 PM

404 Chapter 12 mechanisms of eating regulation described in this chapter
(Villablanca et al., 2015). Recently, some researchers have suggested
that work stations and environments can be redesigned to increase NEAT
by facilitating standing or walking on a treadmill rather than sitting
at a desk. In fact, a 1-year trial in an office that replaced its
traditional chair-based desks with treadmill desks revealed that
employees engaged in more NEAT, lost weight, and reduced their waist
circumference (Keopp et al., 2013). A review of 23 sitting, standing,
and treadmill desk use studies suggested some physiological benefits of
treadmill desks; however, significant gaps in this area of research make
it challenging to make recommendations (MacEwen et al., 2015). GENETIC
FACTORS Differences in body weight--- perhaps reflecting physiological
differences in metabolism, activity levels (including NEAT), or
appetite---have a strong hereditary basis. Twin studies suggest that
between 40 percent and 70 percent of the variability in body fat is due
to genetic differences. Twin studies have also found strong genetic
effects on the amount of weight that people gain or lose when they are
placed on high- or low-calorie diets (Bouchard et al., 1990; Hainer et
al., 2001). Heredity appears to affect people's metabolic efficiency.
However, until recently, variations in only two genes were found to
cause obesity in humans: the gene for the MC4 receptor and the FTO gene
(fat mass and obesity related gene), which codes for an enzyme that acts
in hypothalamic regions related to energy balance, such as the PVN, and
the arcuate nucleus (Olszewski et al., 2009; Willer et al., 2009). A
massive study with 145 authors (Willer et al., 2009) discovered six new
genetic loci that are associated with BMI. However, these genes are very
rare, so none of them can account for the prevalence of obesity in the
general population. The high level of heritability of obesity must be
explained, then, as the additive effects of a large number of genes,
each of which has a small individual effect on BMI. Just as cars differ
in their fuel efficiency, so do living organisms, and hereditary factors
can affect the level of efficiency. People differ in this form of
efficiency. Those with an efficient metabolism have calories left over
to deposit in the long-term nutrient reservoir, and these calories
accumulate in the form of increased adipose tissue. Researchers have
referred to this condition as a "thrifty phenotype." In contrast, people
with an inefficient metabolism (a "spendthrift phenotype") can eat large
meals without gaining much weight. A fuel-efficient automobile is
desirable, but a fuel-efficient body runs the risk of becoming
obese---at least in an environment where food is cheap and plentiful.
Why are there genetic differences in metabolic efficiency? As we saw
earlier in this chapter, natural selection for mechanisms that helped
our ancestors to avoid starvation was much stronger than natural
selection for mechanisms that helped them to avoid becoming obese.
Perhaps

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 404

individual differences in metabolic efficiency reflect the nature of the
environment experienced by their ancestors. Perhaps people whose
ancestors lived in regions where food was scarce or subject to periods
of famine are more likely to have inherited efficient metabolisms. This
hypothesis has received support from some epidemiological studies.
Ravussin and colleagues (1994) studied two populations of Indigenous
Pima people. One group lives in the southwestern United States and the
other in northwestern Mexico. Members of the two groups share the same
genetic background, speak the same language, and have common historical
traditions. The two groups separated 700--1,000 years ago and now live
under very different environmental conditions. Many Pima in the
southwestern United States eat a high-fat American diet and weigh an
average of 90 kg (198 lb). In contrast, the lifestyle of the Mexican
Pima remained largely unchanged until relatively recently. These
individuals engaged in subsistence farming and ate a low-fat diet---and
weigh an average of 64 kg (141 lb.). The rate of diabetes in the
American group was more than five times higher. As members of the
Mexican group have begun to have a more modern, sedentary lifestyle and
consume more processed foods, rates of obesity have begun to increase
(Esparza-Romero et al., 2015). These findings have been interpreted to
demonstrate that genes that promote an efficient metabolism are
beneficial in environments in which people expend many calories in daily
life and consume foods that are not calorie-dense but that these same
genes can pose a liability when people live in an environment where
access to physical activity is limited and more diverse, traditional
food options are replaced with high-calorie, low-nutrient items. Leptin
As we saw earlier, study of the ob mouse led to the discovery of leptin,
the hormone secreted by well-nourished adipose tissue. So far,
researchers have found several cases of familial obesity caused by
mutations of genes responsible for production of leptin or the leptin
receptor (Farooqi & O'Rahilly, 2005). Treatment of people who are
leptin-deficient with injections of leptin has dramatic effects on body
weight. (See Figure 12.25.) Unfortunately, leptin has no effect on
people who lack leptin receptors. In any case, mutations of the genes
for leptin or leptin receptors are very rare, so they do not ­explain the
vast majority of cases of obesity. When leptin was discovered,
researchers hoped that this naturally occurring peptide could be widely
used to treat obesity. In fact, a drug company paid a large sum of money
for the rights to develop this compound. However, it turns out that most
people who are obese already have a high blood level of leptin, and
increasing this level with injections of the peptide has little or no
effect on their food intake. Several investigators have suggested that a
fall in blood levels of leptin should be regarded as a hunger signal.
Starvation decreases the blood level of leptin, which

removes an inhibitory influence on NPY/AGRP neurons and an excitatory
influence on CART/a-MSH neurons. That is, a low level of leptin
increases the release of orexigenic peptides and decreases the release
of anorexigenic peptides. And as Flier (1998) suggests, people with a
thrifty metabolism should show resistance to a high level of leptin,
which would permit weight gain in times of plenty. People with a
spendthrift metabolism should not show leptin resistance and should eat
less as their level of leptin rises.

Treatment LO 12.22 Evaluate the roles of reinforcement, stress, surgery,
pharmacology, and behavioral interventions in treating obesity. Obesity
is difficult to treat. The enormous financial success of diet books and
weight reduction programs attests to the challenges people encounter in
losing weight. Many programs help people to lose weight initially, but
then the weight is quickly regained (Kramer et al., 1989). To better
understand the challenges involved in weight loss, the following
sections will explore the roles of reinforcement, stress, surgery,
pharmacology, and behavioral interventions in treating obesity. Evidence
suggests that the physiological mechanisms that make it difficult for
people to reduce their caloric intake are related to the mechanisms that
make it difficult for people to stop taking drugs of abuse. Overeating
shares many attributes with compulsive behaviors. For example, although
some overweight people who participate in treatment programs succeed in
eating less and losing weight, many return to the former behaviors and
regain the weight they lost. Similarly, people who succeed in stopping
their use of a drug often ROLE OF REINFORCEMENT AND STRESS

(b) 

return to their former behavior and begin using the drug again. In both
cases, stress and anxiety can cause reinstatement of the eating or drug
taking, apparently by means of similar brain mechanisms (Nair et al.,
2009). Both dopamine, which plays an important role in reinforcement,
and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), which plays an important
role in stress, are involved in relapse of food- and drug-seeking
behavior. Cottone and colleagues (2009) found that rats that had become
accustomed to a tasty, high-calorie diet showed signs of withdrawal
symptoms, accompanied by increased CRH secretion and increased
activation of the central nucleus of the amygdala when their access to
the diet was curtailed. In fact, in some ways, changing behaviors
associated with a "food addiction" is more difficult than changing
behaviors associated with substance abuse. It is possible to stop taking
a drug altogether and stay away from people and places associated with
obtaining and abusing the drug, but it is not possible to completely
stop eating. The extraordinary difficulty in reducing caloric intake for
a sustained period of time (often a lifetime) has led to the development
of many interventions. The next sections will describe some surgical,
pharmacological, and behavioral methods that have been devised to reduce
eating behavior to lose weight. SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS Surgeons have
become involved in trying to help people who are obese lose weight. The
procedures they have developed (called bariatric surgery) are designed
to reduce the amount of food that can be eaten during a meal or to
interfere with absorption of calories from the intestines. Bariatric
surgery has been aimed at the stomach, the small intestine, or both. One
form of bariatric surgery is a special form of gastric bypass called the
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or RYGB.

24/11/21 1:45 PM

406 Chapter 12 Similar to sleeve gastrectomy (described in A. J.'s case
at the beginning of this module), this procedure produces a small pouch
in the upper end of the stomach. However, in this procedure, the stomach
pouch is attached to a lower portion of the intestine. The effect is to
produce a small stomach whose contents enter the jejunum (second portion
of the small intestine), bypassing the duodenum (first portion of the
small intestine). Digestive enzymes that are secreted into the duodenum
pass through the upper intestine and meet up with the meal that has just
been received from the stomach pouch. (See Figure 12.26.) The RYGB
procedure works well, although it often causes an iron and vitamin B12
deficiency, which may be treated by increased intake of these
substances. In the United States alone, approximately 200,000 bariatric
surgeries are performed each year. Brolin (2002) reported that the
average postsurgical loss of excessive weight of obese patients was
about 35 percent of their initial weight. Even patients who sustained
smaller weight losses showed improved health, including reductions in
hypertension and diabetes. A metaanalysis of 147 studies by Maggard and
colleagues (2005) reported an average weight loss of 43.5 kg
(approximately 95 lb.) 1 year after RYGB surgery and 41.5 kg after 3
years. And although the biological response to starvation is very
strong, RYGB surgery does not induce these changes. Instead, after
surgery people report that they feel less hungry and their level of
exercise increases (Berthoud et al., 2011). Similar to the sleeve
gastrectomy, one important reason for the success of the RYGB procedure
appears to be that it disrupts the secretion of ghrelin. The procedure
also increases blood levels of PYY (Chan et al., 2006; Reinehr et al.,
2007).

Both of these changes would be expected to decrease food intake: A
decrease in ghrelin should reduce hunger, and an increase in PYY should
increase satiety. A plausible explanation for the decreased secretion of
ghrelin could be disruption of communication between the upper intestine
and the stomach; as you will recall, although ghrelin is secreted by the
stomach, the upper intestine controls this secretion. Presumably,
because the surgery decreases the speed at which food moves through the
small intestine, more PYY is secreted. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION
Another type of

intervention for obesity---drug treatment---is the subject of active
research programs by the pharmaceutical industry. Possible ways in which
drugs could help people lose weight are to suppress appetite and reduce
the amount of food they eat, or to prevent some of the food they eat
from being digested. Suppress Appetite Some serotonergic agonists
suppress eating. However, a drug used for this purpose, fenfluramine,
was found to have dangerous side effects, including pulmonary
hypertension and damage to the valves of the heart, so the drug was
withdrawn from the market in the United States (Blundell & Halford,
1998). Fenfluramine acts by stimulating the release of 5-HT. Another
drug, sibutramine, has similar effects on eating, but a study of people
who were taking the drug found increased incidence of heart attacks and
strokes, so this drug, too, was withdrawn from the market (Li & Cheung,
2011). As we mentioned earlier, the fact that marijuana often elicits a
craving for highly palatable foods led to the discovery that the
endocannabinoids have an orexigenic effect. The drug rimonabant, which
blocks CB1 cannabinoid receptors, was found to suppress appetite,
produce a

significant weight loss, lower blood levels of triglycerides and
insulin, and increase blood levels of HDL ("good" cholesterol), with
apparently minimal adverse side effects (Di Marzo & Matias, 2005).
However, use of rimonabant was subsequently found to be associated with
depressive mood disorders, anxiety, and increased suicide risk, so it is
no ­longer on the market as an antiobesity treatment (Christensen et al.,
2007). As we will see in Chapter 19, rimonabant has also been shown to
help people stop smoking. Although the drug is not approved for this
purpose either, its efficacy suggests that the craving for nicotine,
like the craving for food, involves the activity of endocannabinoids in
the brain. A compound extracted from the roots of a vine may function to
make cells more sensitive to the effects of leptin, and decrease eating
behavior. The compound, named Celastrol, was ineffective in ob mice
without leptin receptors, but produced weight loss in overweight
wildtype mice fed a high-fat diet (Liu et al., 2015). Follow-up research
has identified additional leptin-sensitizing compounds that may provide
additional obesity treatment strategies (Lee et al., 2016). As we have
seen, appetite can be stimulated by activation of NPY, MCH, orexin, and
ghrelin receptors, and it can be suppressed by the activation of leptin,
CCK, CART, and MC4 receptors. Appetite can also be suppressed by
activation of inhibitory presynaptic Y2 autoreceptors by PYY. Most of
these orexigenic and anorexigenic chemicals also affect metabolism:
Orexigenic chemicals tend to decrease metabolic rate, and anorexigenic
chemicals tend to increase it. Do these discoveries hold any promise for
the treatment of obesity? Is there any possibility that researchers will
find drugs that will stimulate or block these receptors, thus decreasing
people's appetite and increasing the rate at which they burn rather than
store their calories? Drug companies certainly hope so, and they are
working hard on developing medications that will do so. Table 12.4 lists
some of the anti-obesity drugs that have been approved---and
withdrawn---so far. Some of these drugs are described in the next
section of this module. Prevent Digestion Another drug, orlistat,
interferes with the absorption of fats by the small intestine. As a
result, about a third of the fat in the person's diet passes through the
digestive system and is excreted with the feces. Unfortunately, as a
result, the drug induces gastrointestinal side effects in 15 percent to
30 percent of users. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study by Hill
and colleagues (1999) found that orlistat helped people to maintain
weight loss they had achieved by participating in a conventional
weight-loss program. People who received the placebo were much more
likely to regain the weight they had lost. Treatment with orlistat also
reduces the incidence of type II diabetes, and has beneficial effects

dopamine and CRF. The opioid system is also involved in reinforcement
(see Chapter 4) and represents another potential drug target for
treating obesity. The drug combination of naltrexone (an opioid
antagonist) and bupropion (a dopamine agonist) produced significant
weight loss among individuals with obesity enrolled in a double-blind,
placebo-controlled study. The treatment also enhanced several markers of
cardiovascular health (Apovian et al., 2013) as well as improved quality
of life (Kolotkin et al 2015). (See Figure 12.27.)

Another form of therapy for obesity---exercise---has significant
benefits. As we mentioned earlier, decreased physical activity is an
important contributor to weight gain. Exercise consumes calories, of
course, but it also appears to have beneficial effects on metabolic
rate. Bunyard and colleagues (1998) found that when middle-aged men
participated in an aerobic exercise program for 6 months, their body fat
decreased and their daily energy requirement increased---by 5 percent
for obese men and by 8 percent for lean men. Gutin and colleagues (1999)
found that an exercise program helped children who were obese to lose
fat and had the additional benefit of increasing bone density. Hill and
colleagues (2003) calculated that an increased energy expenditure

would require a relatively small change in behavior for most
people---about 14 minutes of walking each day. Other behavioral
interventions for weight loss include in-person or online
health-coaching programs, cognitive behavioral therapies, and incentive
programs. The variety of methods---surgical, pharmacological, and
behavioral---that therapists and surgeons have developed to treat
obesity attests to the tenacity of the problem.

The basic difficulty, beyond that caused by having an efficient
metabolism, is that eating is pleasurable and satiety signals are easy
to ignore or override. By learning more about the physiology of hunger
signals, satiety signals, and the reinforcement provided by eating, many
hope that researchers and clinicians will be able to develop safe and
effective interventions that attenuate the signals that encourage us to
eat and strengthen those that encourage us to stop eating.

Module Review: Obesity Possible Causes LO 12.21 Compare the roles of
environment, physical activity, and genetics in obesity. Environmental
factors can affect how many calories are expended through physical
exercise and ingested in calorie-dense foods. In many places,
inexpensive, convenient, good-tasting, high-calorie food is readily
available, which promotes an increase in intake. Reduced physical
activity contributes to obesity, along with less "nonexercise activity
thermogenesis," or NEAT. Interactions between genetic and environmental
factors are illustrated by the example of Pima peoples living in the
United States and Mexico. A high percentage of Pima who live in the
United States and consume a highfat diet become obese and, as a
consequence, develop diabetes. In contrast, Pima living in Mexico, who
engaged

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 408

in subsistence farming and ate a low-fat diet, remained thin, and had a
lower incidence of obesity. Obesity is strongly affected by heredity.
Some people have inherited a thrifty metabolism, which makes it
difficult for them to lose weight. One of the manifestations of a
thrifty metabolism is a low level of nonexercise activity thermogenesis,
or NEAT. Obesity in humans is related to a hereditary absence of leptin
or leptin receptors only in a few families. In general, people who are
obese have very high levels of leptin in their blood. However, they show
resistance to the effects of this peptide, apparently because the
transport of leptin through the blood--brain barrier is reduced. The
most significant simple genetic cause of severe obesity is mutation of
the gene for the MC4 receptor and the FTO gene. The MC4 receptor
responds to the orexigen AGRP and the anorexigen a-MSH, and the FTO gene
codes for an enzyme that acts in hypothalamic

24/11/21 1:45 PM

Ingestive Behavior 409

regions involved in energy balance. In addition, mutations that
inactivate the genes responsible for the production of leptin or leptin
receptors result in obesity.

Treatment LO 12.22 Evaluate the roles of reinforcement, stress, surgery,
pharmacology, and behavioral interventions in treating obesity. Stress
and anxiety can cause reinstatement of eating or drug taking, apparently
by means of similar brain mechanisms. Both dopamine, which plays an
important role in reinforcement, and corticotrophin-releasing hormone
(CRH), which plays an important role in stress, are involved in relapse
in food and drug seeking behaviors. Researchers have evaluated many
behavioral, surgical, and pharmacological treatments for obesity, but no
universally successful program has yet been found. The RYGB procedure, a
special form of gastric bypass operation, is one

Eating Disorders Eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia
nervosa, and binge eating. Each of these disorders include extreme
changes in eating behavior. Individuals with eating disorders are at an
increased risk of mortality, particularly those diagnosed with anorexia
nervosa (Arcelus et al., 2011). As you read the case of N. B. below,
consider the changes to eating behavior that are described, and any
possible biological correlates. N. B. was a 17-year-old who spent much
of her time thinking about food, controlling her weight through dieting,
and comparing nutritional labels. She maintained a low-calorie diet and
reported feeling hungry most of the time. She occasionally binged and
stole food. When she was 14, she began to diet in response to a period
of weight gain. She adopted rigid eating patterns, engaged in compulsive
exercise and sought treatment from a mental health professional. At age
16, she was hospitalized due to extremely low body weight. After being
discharged, N. B. began restricting her food intake again, as well as
stealing food, bingeing, and purging. She was prescribed a drug that was
an antagonist at serotonin and norepinephrine receptors but the
treatment was ineffective. Finally, N. B. began a cognitive behavioral
therapy intervention that reduced the frequency of her bingeing and
restricted eating, and she began to gain weight (Martín-Murcia et al.,
2011).

The case study of N. B. highlights several important aspects of eating
disorders that will be explored in the following module. As you will
read, the prevalence of some eating disorders is higher among females,
and several eating disorders include many of the symptoms that N. B.
displayed: restricted eating, excessive exercise, eating large

form of bariatric surgery. The effectiveness of this operation is
probably due primarily to its suppression of ghrelin secretion and
stimulation of PYY secretion. Two drugs initially appeared to show some
promise in the treatment of obesity. Fenfluramine, a serotonin agonist,
and rimonabant, a cannabinoid antagonist, suppress appetite, but adverse
side effects have prevented their use. At present many pharmaceutical
companies are trying to apply the results of the discoveries of
orexigens and anorexigens described in this chapter to the development
of antiobesity drugs. Another drug, orlistat, prevents the absorption of
calories from fat.

amounts of food in a short period of time (bingeing), and engaging in
compulsive exercise or other behaviors such as vomiting to reduce the
number of calories consumed (purging). Eating disorders are challenging
to treat, and many individuals undergo repeated interventions in an
effort to reduce their symptoms. Many eating disorder interventions have
a low success rate. While the exact causes of eating disorders are
unknown, it is likely that a variety of environmental and genetic
elements are contributing factors. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association (fifth
edition; DSM) groups several related diagnoses together in the category
"Feeding and Eating Disorders." These disorders are characterized by
several distinct criteria, including a persistent pattern of eating
behavior that impairs physical health or psychosocial functioning. The
DSM does not consider obesity a mental illness at this time. Most
people, if they have an eating problem, tend to overeat. However, some
people, especially adolescent women, have the opposite problem: They eat
too little, even to the point of starvation. This disorder is called
anorexia nervosa. Another eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, is
characterized by a loss of control of food intake. People with bulimia
nervosa periodically gorge themselves with food, especially dessert or
snack food, and especially in the afternoon or evening. These binges are
usually followed by selfinduced vomiting or the use of laxatives, along
with feelings of depression and guilt. With this combination of bingeing
and purging, the net nutrient intake (and consequently, the body weight)
of people with bulimia can vary, though a large proportion eat an
overall typical amount of food and

nervosa. A third disorder, binge-eating ­disorder, is characterized by
eating a large quantity of food in a relatively short period of time
(bingeing) and a loss of control over eating behavior. Unlike bulimia
nervosa, binge-eating disorder is not associated with compensatory
purging behavior. A lifetime history of binge-eating disorder is
associated with obesity. The criteria for diagnosis of three important
eating disorders are included in Table 12.5. The incidences of eating
disorders are estimated at 0.5 percent to 2 percent for anorexia
nervosa, 1 percent to 3 percent for bulimia nervosa, and 2 percent to 7
percent for binge-eating disorder. Women are 10 to 20 times more likely
than men to develop anorexia nervosa and approximately 10 times more
likely to develop bulimia nervosa (see Klein & Walsh, 2004). The
lifetime prevalence of binge-eating disorder does not appear to vary
between men and women (Hudson et al., 2007). Eating disorders are
associated with decreases in health-related quality of life, high rates
of hospitalization, and visits to emergency departments. The annual
health care costs for eating disorders ranged from approximately \$1,000
(approximately €880) to \$64,000 (approximately €56,500) per person (Ágh
et al., 2016). The suicide rate in patients with anorexia is higher than
that of the rest of the population (Pompili et al., 2004).

Possible Causes LO 12.23 Compare the roles of brain changes, starvation,
excessive exercise, and genetic factors in eating disorders. The literal
meaning of the word anorexia suggests a loss of appetite, but people
with this disorder are usually interested in---even preoccupied
with---food. They may enjoy preparing meals for others to consume,
collect recipes, and even hoard food that they do not eat. Although
people with anorexia are very interested in food, they express an
intense fear of becoming obese, which continues even if they become
dangerously thin. Many exercise by cycling, running, or almost constant
walking and pacing.

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 410

BRAIN CHANGES Anorexia is associated with loss of gray and white matter
in the brain (Seitz et al., 2016). Some reports demonstrate the presence
of enlarged ventricles and widened sulci in the brains of patients with
anorexia, which indicate shrinkage of brain tissue (Artmann et al.,
1985; Golden et al., 1996; Herholz, 1996; Katzman et al., 2001; Kingston
et al., 1996). Some research suggests that this tissue loss can be
reversed with successful treatment of the eating disorder (Golden et
al., 1996; Seitz et al., 2016). (See Figure 12.28.) STARVATION Many
researchers and clinicians have concluded that anorexia nervosa and
bulimia nervosa are symptoms of an underlying mental disorder. However,
some evidence suggests just the opposite: that the symptoms of eating
disorders are actually symptoms of starvation. A famous study carried
out at the University of Minnesota by Ancel Keys and his colleagues
(Keys et al., 1950) recruited 36 physically and psychologically healthy
young men to observe the effects of semistarvation. For 6 months, the
men ate approximately 50 percent of what they had been eating previously
and, as a result, lost approximately 25 percent of their original body
weight. As the volunteers lost weight, they began displaying disturbing
symptoms, including preoccupation with food and eating, ritualistic
eating, erratic mood, impaired cognitive performance, and physiological
changes such as decreased body temperature. They began hoarding food and
nonfood objects and were unable to explain (even to themselves) why they
bothered to accumulate objects for which they had no use. At first, they
were gregarious, but as time went on, they became withdrawn and
isolated. These men were not diagnosed with eating disorders, yet, once
they began to experience starvation, they displayed many of the symptoms
that are commonly associated with eating disorders. This has been
interpreted as support for the claim that the symptoms of eating
disorders arise from starvation rather than an underlying mental
disorder. The obsessions with food and weight loss and the compulsive
rituals that people with anorexia nervosa develop suggest a possible
linkage with obsessive-compulsive disorder (described in more detail in
Chapter 17). However, the fact that these obsessions and compulsions
were seen in the men of the Minnesota study---none of whom showed these
symptoms previously---suggests that they are effects rather than causes

of the eating disorder. Both anorexia and semistarvation include
symptoms such as mood swings, depression, and insomnia. Even hair loss
is seen in both conditions. Although binge eating is a symptom of
anorexia, eating very slowly is, too. Patients with anorexia tend to
linger over a meal, and so did the volunteers in the Minnesota study.
"Toward the end of starvation some of the men would dawdle for almost
two hours over a meal which previously they would have consumed in a
matter of minutes" (Keys et al., 1950, p. 833). As we saw, excessive
exercising is a prominent symptom of anorexia (Zandian et al., 2007). In
fact, Manley and colleagues (2008) reported that many fitness
instructors recognize that some of their clients may have an eating
disorder and have expressed concern about ethical or liability issues in
permitting such clients to participate in their classes or facilities.
Studies with animals suggest that the increased activity may actually be
a result of the fasting. When rats are allowed access to food for 1 hour
each day, they will spend more and more time running in a wheel if one
is available and will lose weight and eventually die of emaciation
(Smith, 1989). One explanation for the increased activity of rats on a
semistarvation diet is that it reflects an innate tendency to seek food
when it becomes scarce. Normally, hungry rats would extend their
activity by exploring the environment and searching for food, but
because of their confinement the tendency to explore is expressed
through wheel running. The fact that starving rats increase their
activity suggests that the excessive activity of patients with anorexia
may be a symptom of starvation, not a weight-loss strategy. Blood levels
of NPY are elevated in patients with anorexia. Nergårdh and colleagues
(2007) found that infusion

EXCESSIVE EXERCISE

M12_CARL0287_13_GE_C12.indd 411

(b) 

of NPY into the cerebral ventricles further increased the time spent
running in rats on a restricted feeding schedule. Normally, NPY
stimulates eating (as it does in rats with unlimited access to food),
but under conditions of starvation it stimulates wheel-running activity
instead. The likely explanation for this phenomenon is that, if food is
not present, NPY increases the animals' activity level, which would
normally increase the likelihood that they would find food. Increased
levels of NPY may also play a role in the obsession with food that is
often seen in patients with anorexia. GENETIC FACTORS By now, you may be
wondering why anorexia develops in the first place. Even if the symptoms
of anorexia are largely those of starvation, what initiates the behavior
that leads to starvation? The simple answer is that we still do not
know. One possibility is a genetic predisposition for this behavior.
There is good evidence, primarily from twin studies, that hereditary
factors play an important role in the development of anorexia nervosa
(Kortegaard et al., 2001; Russell & Treasure, 1989; Walters & Kendler,
1995). In fact, between 58 percent and 76 percent of the variability in
the occurrence of anorexia nervosa appears to be under control of
genetic factors (Klein & Walsh, 2004). In addition, the incidence of
anorexia nervosa is higher in girls who were born prematurely or who
sustained birth trauma during complicated deliveries (Cnattingius et
al., 1999), which suggests that biological factors independent of
heredity may play a role. Perhaps some young women (and a small number
of young men) go on a diet to bring their body weight closer to what
they perceive as ideal. Once they get set on this course and begin
losing weight, physiological and endocrinological changes bring about
the symptoms

of starvation previously outlined, and the vicious cycle begins. In
fact, at the end of the Minnesota semistarvation study when the
volunteers were permitted to eat normally again, Keys and his colleagues
found that a few volunteers displayed symptoms of anorexia, engaging in
dieting behavior and complaining about the fat in their abdomens and
thighs (Keys et al., 1950). This phenomenon suggests that strongly
restricted access to food may contribute to inducing anorexia in people
(men, in this case) with a predisposition to this disorder. The fact
that anorexia nervosa is seen primarily in young women has prompted both
biological and social explanations. Most psychologists favor the latter,
concluding that the emphasis that most modern industrialized s­ ocieties
places on slimness---especially in women---is responsible for this
disorder. Another possible cause could be the changes in hormones that
accompany puberty. Whatever the cause, young men and women differ in
their response to even a short period of fasting. Södersten and
colleagues (2006) had high school students visit their laboratory at
noon one day, where they were given all the food they wanted to eat for
lunch. Seven days later, they returned to the laboratory again. This
time, they had been fasting since lunch on the previous day. The men ate
more food than they had the first time. However, the women actually ate
less than they had before. (See Figure 12.29.) Apparently, at least
under some circumstances, women may not compensate for a period of food
deprivation by eating more food.

Treatment LO 12.24 List strategies used in eating disorder
interventions. Eating disorders are very difficult to treat
successfully. As illustrated in the case of N. B., many patients undergo

repeated rounds of treatment, including hospitalization. Eating disorder
treatment strategies include a variety of cognitive behavioral
therapies, pharmacological therapies, and some novel alternative
therapies. COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY Cognitive behavioral therapy,
considered by many clinicians to be the most effective approach to
treating eating disorders, has a success rate of less than 50 percent
and a relapse rate of 22 percent during a 1-year treatment period (Pike
et al., 2003). Cognitive behavioral therapy may be more effective than
other psychotherapies in treating symptoms of b ­ ulimia in particular
(Hofmann et al., 2012; Linardon et al., 2017).

Researchers have tried to treat anorexia nervosa with many drugs that
increase appetite in laboratory animals or in people without eating
disorders---for example, antipsychotic medications, drugs that stimulate
adrenergic a2 receptors, l-DOPA, and THC. Unfortunately, these drugs
have been largely unhelpful in treating anorexia nervosa (Mitchell,
1989). The fact that people with anorexia are usually obsessed with food
(and show high levels of neuropeptide Y and ghrelin) suggests that the
disorder is not caused by the absence of hunger. Researchers have had
more success treating bulimia nervosa; several studies suggest that
serotonin agonists such as fluoxetine (an SSRI antidepressant drug) may
aid in the treatment of this disorder (Advokat & Kutlesic, 1995; Kaye et
al., 2001). However, fluoxetine does not help patients with anorexia
(Attia et al., 1998). The drug lisdexamfetamine (LDX) may be useful for
treating binge-eating disorder. LDX is an amphetamine that reduces binge
eating (McElroy et al., 2016) and relapse in binge-eating disorder
(Hudson et al., 2017; for review, see Heo & Duggan, 2017), as well as
changes brain activation associated with palatable food cues (Fleck et
al., 2019).

Ingestive Behavior 413

Bergh, Södersten, and their colleagues (Court et al., 2008; Zandian et
al., 2007) have devised a novel treatment protocol for anorexia. The
patients are taught to eat faster by placing a plate of food on an
electronic scale attached to a computer that displays the time course of
their actual and ideal intake. After the meal, the patients are kept in
a warm room, which reduces their anxiety and their activity level.
Remarkably, this treatment strategy has resulted in a 75 percent success
rate, with a 10 percent relapse rate after treatment and 0 percent
mortality. The remaining 15 percent of patients did not complete the
treatment for various reasons (e.g., lack of insurance coverage; Bergh
et al., 2013). Future research investigating this strategy and
replicating these results could provide strong evidence for this
approach to treating eating disorders. Another line of research has
investigated the efficacy of deep brain stimulation of the cingulate
cortex. One year

ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES

of cingulate stimulation produced improvements in mood, BMI, and neural
circuitry in individuals diagnosed with anorexia nervosa that had not
responded to previous treatment attempts (Lipsman et al., 2017). Other
researchers are investigating the effects of oxytocin administration on
reducing the distress caused by eating in individuals with anorexia
nervosa. Among individuals diagnosed with anorexia nervosa receiving
treatment in a hospital, Russell and colleagues (2018) reported some
reductions in eating disorder symptoms as well as lower baseline
cortisol concentrations in response to a stressful situation (consuming
a high-calorie snack) after 4 weeks of treatment with oxytocin. Eating
disorders are serious conditions; understanding their causes is more
than an academic matter. We can hope that research on the biological and
social control of eating and metabolism and the causes of compulsive
behaviors will help us to understand these disorders.

Module Review: Eating Disorders Possible Causes LO 12.23 Compare the
roles of brain changes, starvation, excessive exercise, and genetic
factors in eating disorders. Eating disorders are associated with
enlarged ventricles and reduced brain volume. Some research suggests
that preoccupation with food and eating, ritualistic eating, erratic
mood, excessive exercising, impaired cognitive performance, and
physiological changes such as decreased body temperature are symptoms of
starvation and not the underlying causes of anorexia. Birth
complications are associated with eating disorders. Twin studies support
a role for heredity in eating disorders.

treatments are low; however, some alternative therapies have shown
higher success rates.

contributing factors. After reading the last module of this chapter,
what do you think is the cause of the sex difference in the incidence of

combination play a significant role?

operation (performed in 1953, when he was 27 years old). His family
moved to a new house after his operation, and he never learned how to
navigate the new neighborhood. He was aware of his condition and said:
Every day is alone in itself, whatever enjoyment I've had, and whatever
sorrow I've had. . . . Right now, I'm wondering. Have I done or said
anything amiss? You see, at this moment everything looks clear to me,
but what happened just before? That's what worries me. It's like waking
from a dream; I just don't remember. (Milner, 1970, p. 37)

416 Chapter 13 H. M. could remember a small amount of verbal information
as long as he was not distracted. Constant rehearsal could keep
information in his immediate memory for a long time. However, rehearsal
did not appear to have any long-term effects. If he was distracted for a
moment, he would completely forget whatever he had been rehearsing. He
could complete repetitive tasks very well. Because he so quickly forgot
what previously happened, he did not easily become bored. On December 2,
2008, H. M., whom we now know as Henry Molaison, died at the age of 82.
Researchers had the privilege of studying H. M. throughout his life.
What they

learned from his experience has been instrumental in enhancing our
understanding of how memories are formed and of the brain regions
involved. H. M.'s contributions to the study of learning and memory
continue today. His brain has been preserved, and researchers continue
to learn from it. (See Figure 13.1.) You'll read more about H. M.'s
ongoing contributions to our understanding of learning and memory later
in the chapter. Experiences change us. Encounters with our environment
alter our behavior by modifying our nervous system. As many
investigators have said, an understanding of the

physiology and memory is the ultimate challenge to neuroscience
research. The brain is complex, and so are learning and remembering.
However, despite the difficulties, the long years of research finally
seem to be paying off. New approaches and new methods have evolved from
old ones, and real progress has been made in understanding the anatomy
and physiology of learning and remembering. In this chapter, we will
explore how we learn and how we remember. The first module begins with
an overview of learning and memory processes. Subsequent modules will
focus on types of learning: stimulus-response, motor, perceptual, and
relational. Then we will consider impairments to learning and memory
before concluding with a look at the role of long-term potentiation in
forming memories.

Overview of Learning and Memory Learning allows us to acquire new
information and refers to the process by which experiences change our
nervous system and our behavior. Long-term changes in the nervous system
following learning are referred to as memories. Memories persist over
time and are formed when something is learned. Experiences shape the way
we perceive, perform, think, plan, and behave. Learning something new
and creating a memory physically changes the structure of the nervous
system, altering neural circuits that participate in perceiving,
performing, thinking, planning, and behaving. Learning, memory, and
their effects on behavior are only possible through plasticity. As you
will read in this chapter, the nervous system demonstrates synaptic
plasticity among existing neurons in learning and forming memories.
You'll learn more about synaptic plasticity in the final module of the
chapter. Exciting new research is also revealing the role of the
creation of new neurons (neurogenesis) in learning and memory. The
information-processing model of memory provides an overall summary of
the basic steps linking learning to memory. In this model, learning
produces changes in the nervous system by encoding the new information
to be learned. The encoding process includes consolidation, which
strengthens changes associated with the initial information that is
learned, helping to make a more permanent change to the nervous system
(i.e., a memory). After being consolidated, the memory is stored and
maintained via these persistent

Storage (memory)

Retrieval (memory)

changes in the nervous system. Finally, retrieval is the process of
accessing and using the information stored in the neural changes that
make up a memory to engage in a behavior. (See Figure 13.2.)

Types of Learning LO 13.1

Compare characteristics of stimulus-response, motor, perceptual, and
relational learning.

Learning can take at least four basic forms: stimulusresponse learning,
motor learning, perceptual learning, and relational learning. We will
introduce each of these four types of learning in this module, and
return to each of them in greater detail in subsequent modules of the
chapter. STIMULUS-RESPONSE LEARNING Stimulus--response learning is the
ability to learn to perform a particular behavior when a particular
stimulus is present. Stimulus-response learning establishes connections
between circuits involved in perception and those involved in movement.
The behavior could be an automatic response such as a defensive reflex,
or it could be a complicated sequence of movements. Stimulus--response
learning includes two major categories of learning that psychologists
have studied extensively: classical conditioning and operant
conditioning. Conditioning is a term that refers to learning from
exposures to stimuli to produce a lasting change in behavior.

Classical Conditioning Classical conditioning is a form of learning in
which an unimportant stimulus acquires the properties of an important
one. It involves an association between two stimuli. A stimulus that
previously had little effect on behavior becomes able to evoke a
reflexive, species-typical behavior. For example, an eyeblink response
can be conditioned to a tone. If we direct a brief puff of air toward an
eye, the eye will automatically blink. The response is called an
unconditioned response (UR) because it occurs without any special
training. The stimulus that produces it (the puff of air) is called an
unconditioned stimulus (US). Now we begin the training. We present a
series of brief tones (auditory stimuli), each followed very quickly
(500 msec later) by a puff of air. After several trials the eye begins
to close in response to the tone, even before the puff of air occurs. We
can measure the eyeblink response using EMG electrodes connected to a
computer. Classical conditioning has occurred; the conditioned stimulus
(CS)---the tone---now elicits the conditioned response (CR)---the
eyeblink. (See Figure 13.3.)

418 Chapter 13

Figure 13.3 Classical Conditioning Example In eyeblink conditioning, a
puff of air (US) causes the eye to blink (UR). The puff of air is paired
with a tone (CS) for several trials. After pairing, the tone alone
elicits a blink (CR). Air jet tube

3 After pairing air puff with

tone, tone alone comes to elicit a blink.

When classical conditioning takes place, what kinds of changes occur in
the brain? Figure 13.4 shows an example of a neural circuit that could
account for this type of learning. To make it simpler, let's assume that
the US (the puff of air) is detected by a single neuron in the
somatosensory system (the green neuron) and that the CS (the tone) is
detected by a single neuron in the auditory system (the purple neuron).
We will also assume that the response---the eyeblink---is controlled by
a single neuron in the motor system. Learning actually involves many
thousands of neurons---sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor n ­
eurons---but the basic principle of synaptic change can be represented
by this simple figure. Let's see how this circuit works. If we present a
tone, at first, the individual makes no reaction because the synapse
connecting the auditory neuron with the neuron in the motor system is
weak. However, if we present a puff of air to the eye, the eye blinks.
This reaction occurs because nature has provided the individual with a
strong synapse between the somatosensory neuron and the motor neuron
that causes a blink. To establish classical conditioning, we first
present the tone and then quickly follow it with a puff of air. After we
repeat these pairs of stimuli several times, the tone produces the blink
all by itself (no puff needed), and the synapse between the auditory
neuron and the motor neuron is strengthened. Donald Hebb (1949) proposed
a rule that might explain how neurons are changed by experience in a way
that would cause changes in behavior. The Hebb rule says that if a
synapse repeatedly becomes active at about the same time that the
postsynaptic neuron fires, changes will take place in the structure or
chemistry of the synapse that will strengthen it. How would the Hebb
rule apply to our circuit? If the tone is presented first, then the weak
auditory synapse becomes active. If the puff is presented immediately
afterward, then the strong somatosensory synapse

M13_CARL0287_13_GE_C13.indd 418

becomes active and makes the motor neuron fire. The act of firing then
strengthens any synapse with the motor neuron that has just been active.
In this example, that is the synapse between the auditory and motor
neurons. After several pairings of the two stimuli and after several
increments of strengthening, the synapse between the auditory and motor
neurons becomes strong enough to cause the motor neuron to fire by
itself. Learning has occurred. (See Figure 13.4.) When Hebb formulated
his rule, he had no way to determine whether it was correct. Now,
finally, enough progress has been made in laboratory techniques that the
strength of individual synapses can be determined, and investigators are
studying the physiological bases of learning. We will see the results of
some of these approaches later in this chapter. Operant Conditioning The
second major class of stimulusresponse learning is operant conditioning
(also called

instrumental conditioning). Operant conditioning is a form of learning
in which a reinforcing or punishing outcome follows a specific behavior
in a specific situation. The reinforcer increases the likelihood of the
behavior occurring again in the future, while the punisher decreases it.
Differences Between Classical and Operant Conditioning Operant
conditioning and classical conditioning differ in important ways: They
involve different types of behavior (involuntary and voluntary) as well
as different types of associations. Table 13.1 summarizes these
differences, and each difference is described in the text that follows.
Classical conditioning involves automatic reflexes that do not have to
be learned. Operant conditioning involves brand-new behaviors that have
been learned. Classical conditioning involves an association between two
stimuli (for example, a tone and a puff of air). Operant conditioning
involves an association between a stimulus and a response (such as a
tone and lever-pressing behavior). One easy way to remember this
difference is that operant conditioning involves operating something in
the environment, such as pressing a lever. There is nothing to "operate"
in classical conditioning; the organism simply engages in a reflexive
behavior. Operant conditioning permits an organism to change its
behavior according to the consequences of that behavior. For example,
when a behavior is followed by favorable

consequences (a reinforcing stimulus), the behavior tends to occur more
frequently; when it is followed by unfavorable consequences (a punishing
stimulus), it tends to occur less frequently. For example, a response
that enables a hungry organism to find food will be reinforced, and a
response that causes pain will be punished. (Psychologists often refer
to these stimuli as reinforcers and punishers.) Reinforcement Let's
consider the process of reinforcement. Reinforcement causes changes in
an individual's nervous system that increase the likelihood that a
specific stimulus will elicit a particular response behavior. For
example, if a teacher enters a new classroom for the first time, they
may not immediately know which switches operate the lights they want to
turn on. They may try pressing several switches (if they are available)
or moving around the room, looking for ways to turn on the lights.
However, if the teacher presses the correct switch and the lights turn
on immediately afterward, the likelihood of the teacher pressing that
switch in the future increases. The process of reinforcement strengthens
a connection between neural circuits involved in perception (the sight
of the switch) and those involved in movement (the act of pressing the
switch). As we will see later in this chapter, the brain contains
reinforcement mechanisms that control this process. Figure 13.5
illustrates how reinforcement helps strengthen the connections between
the perceptual and motor system using the example of a rat pressing a
lever to receive a reinforcing stimulus (food). Test yourself by mapping
the steps of the classroom light switch example onto this model. MOTOR
LEARNING The second major category of learning, motor learning, is
actually a component of stimulusresponse learning. Motor learning is the
establishment of changes (responses) within motor systems following a
stimulus. Motor learning cannot occur without sensory stimulus from the
environment. For example, most skilled

movements involve interactions with objects, such as bicycles, video
game controllers, tennis racquets, knitting needles, and keyboards.
Motor learning differs from other forms of learning primarily in the
degree to which new forms of behavior are learned; the more novel the
behavior, the more the neural circuits in the motor systems of the brain
must be modified. Perceptual learning is the ability to learn to
recognize stimuli that have been perceived before. The primary function
of this type of learning is the ability to identify and categorize
objects and situations. Unless we have learned to recognize something,
we cannot learn how we should behave with respect to it. Each of our
sensory systems is capable of perceptual learning. For example, we can
learn to recognize objects by their visual appearance, the sounds they
make, how they feel, or how they smell. We can recognize people by the
shape of their faces, the movements they make when they walk, or the
sound of their voices. When we hear people talk, we can recognize the
words they are saying and, perhaps, their emotional state. As we shall
see, perceptual learning appears to be accomplished primarily by changes
in the sensory association cortex. That is, learning to recognize
complex visual stimuli involves changes in the visual association
cortex, learning to recognize complex auditory stimuli involves changes
in the auditory association cortex, and so on. A particular learning
situation can involve varying amounts of all three types of learning
that we have described so far: perceptual, stimulus-response, and motor.
For example, if we teach an animal to make a new response whenever we
present a stimulus it has never seen before, the animal must learn to
recognize the stimulus (perceptual learning) and make the response
(motor learning), and a connection must be established between these two
new memories (stimulus-response learning). If we teach the animal to
make a response that it has already learned whenever we present a new
stimulus, only perceptual learning and stimulus-response learning will
take place.

PERCEPTUAL LEARNING

Motor learning

Response

RELATIONAL LEARNING The three forms of learning we have described so far
consist primarily of changes in one sensory system, between one sensory
system and the motor system, or in the motor system. (See Figure 13.6.)
But most learning is usually more complex than that. The fourth form of
learning, relational learning, involves learning the relationships among
individual stimuli. For example, a somewhat more complex form of
perceptual learning involves connections between different areas of the
association cortex. When we hear the sound of a cat meowing in the dark,
we can imagine what a cat looks like and what it would feel like if we
touched its fur. Thus, the neural circuits in the auditory association
cortex that recognize the meow are somehow connected to the appropriate
circuits in the visual association cortex and the somatosensory
association cortex. These interconnections, too, are accomplished as a
result of learning. Perception of spatial location---spatial
learning---also involves learning about the relationships among many
stimuli. For example, consider what we must learn to become familiar
with the contents of a room. First, we must learn to recognize each of
the objects. In addition, we must learn the relative locations of the
objects with respect to each other. As a result, when we find ourselves
in a particular place in the room, our perceptions of these objects and
their locations relative to us tell us exactly where we are. As we will
see in a later module of this chapter, a special system that involves
the hippocampus and associated structures appears to perform
coordinating functions required for many types of learning that go
beyond simple perceptual, stimulus-response, or motor learning.

Types of Memory LO 13.2

Contrast characteristics of sensory, short-term, and long-term memory.

Researchers describe the process of forming memories as occurring in
three general stages: the sensory, short-term, and long-term stages of
memory. (See Figure 13.7.) Information is first processed by sensory
memory. Sensory memory is a brief period of time

(ranging from fractions of a second to a few seconds) during which the
initial sensation of environmental stimuli is initially remembered.
Sensory memory occurs in each of the senses and allows an individual to
retain the experience of the sensation slightly longer than the original
stimulus. Sensory memory is often experienced as a brief period in which
sensory experiences can be remembered as repeating or "echoing." For
example, have you ever had the experience of reading or being completely
involved in a task when someone interrupts you to ask a question or tell
you something? Immediately you say "What?" because you were so involved
in your task that you didn't hear them. Almost as soon as you say the
word "What," you experience an echo of their voice and know the answer
to your own question. This is an example of echoic memory for auditory
sensory memory. SHORT-TERM MEMORY Only a small fraction of information
passes from sensory memory to the second stage of memory formation. The
second stage is short-term memory. If information is meaningful or
salient enough to be passed on from sensory memory, it will move to the
short-term memory stage. This stage is longer than sensory memory, but
still limited to seconds or minutes. The memory capacity of short-term
memory is limited to a few items, such as the digits in a PIN or the
letters in a name. The length of short-term memory can be extended
through rehearsal. For example, you might be able to remember the digits
in a security code longer if you repeat them to yourself until you enter
them. The capacity of short-term memory can be expanded through
techniques such as chunking (grouping pieces of information together,
like the sections of a Social Security number or phone number).

The third and final stage of memory is long-term memory. This stage is
relatively permanent and can last for minutes, hours, days, or decades.
Information that will be retained from short-term memory is consolidated
into long-term memory. The conversion of short-term memories into
long-term memories has been

called consolidation, because the memories are "made solid." (See Figure
13.8.) Not all information from shortterm memory makes it to long-term
memory. Long-term memories can be retrieved throughout a lifetime and
strengthened with increased retrieval. Nondeclarative Memory There are
two major categories of long-term memory: nondeclarative and declarative
memory. Nondeclarative memory, or implicit memory, includes memories
that we are not necessarily conscious of. Nondeclarative memories appear
to operate automatically. They do not seem to require memorization or
include facts or experiences; instead, they control behaviors. For
example, think about when you learned a new skill like riding a bicycle
or driving a car. You did so consciously and developed declarative
memories about your attempts: who helped you learn, where you were, and
how you felt. But you also formed nondeclarative memories; you learned
to ride or drive. You learned to make automatic adjustments with your
hands and body. The acquisition of specific motoric behaviors and skills
is probably the most important form of nondeclarative memory. Driving a
car, turning the pages of a book, playing a musical instrument, dancing,
throwing and catching a ball, sliding a chair backward as we stand
up---all of these skills involve coordination of movements with sensory
information received from the environment and from our own moving body
parts. We do not need to be able to describe these activities in order
to perform them. We may not even be aware of all the movements we make
while we are performing them.

Declarative Memory The other category of memory, declarative memory, or
explicit memory, includes memory of events and facts that we can think
and talk about (Squire et al., 1989). Declarative memories are not
simply verbal memories. For example, think about some event in your
life, such as your last birthday. Think about where you were, when the
event occurred, what other people were present, what happened, and so
on. Although you could describe ("declare") this episode in words, the
memory itself would not be verbal. In fact, it would probably be more
like a video clip running in your head, one whose starting and stopping
points---and fast forwards and rewinds---you could control. (See Table
13.2.) Evidence suggests that declarative memory includes distinct forms
of episodic and semantic memories.

Semantic memory (facts, concepts)

Episodic memories involve context; they include information about when
and under what conditions a particular episode occurred and the order in
which the events in the episode took place. Episodic memories are
specific to a particular time and place because a given episode--- by
definition---occurs only once. Semantic memories involve facts, but they
do not include information about the context in which the facts were
learned. In other words, semantic memories are less specific than
episodic memories. For example, knowing that the sun is a star involves
a less specific memory than being able to remember when, where, and from
whom you learned this fact. Semantic memories can be acquired gradually,
over time. Episodic memories must be learned all at once. (See Figure
13.9.)

Module Review: Overview of Learning and Memory Types of Learning LO 13.1

Compare characteristics of stimulusresponse, motor, perceptual, and
relational learning.

Stimulus-response learning, including classical and operant
conditioning, consists of connections between perceptual and motor
systems. Classical conditioning occurs when a neutral stimulus is
followed by an unconditioned stimulus (US) that naturally elicits an
unconditioned response (UR). After this pairing, the neutral stimulus
becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS); it now elicits the response by
itself, which we refer to as the conditioned response (CR). Operant
conditioning occurs when a response is followed by a reinforcing or
punishing stimulus. Motor learning, although it may primarily involve
changes within neural circuits that control movement, is guided by
sensory stimuli

M13_CARL0287_13_GE_C13.indd 422

and is a form of stimulus-response learning. Perceptual learning
consists primarily of changes in perceptual systems that make it
possible for us to recognize stimuli so that we can respond to them
appropriately. Relational learning, the most complex form of learning,
includes the ability to recognize objects through more than one sensory
modality, to recognize the relative location of objects in the
environment, and to remember the sequence in which events occurred
during particular episodes.

Types of Memory LO 13.2

Contrast characteristics of sensory, shortterm, and long-term memory.

Sensory memory is very brief and involves remembering an initial
sensation. A small fraction of information from sensory memory passes on
to short-term memory,

09/11/2021 11:16

Learning and Memory 423

which lasts seconds or minutes and is limited to a few items. Short-term
memory capacity can be extended with rehearsal or chunking. Long-term
memory is relatively permanent, and memories can be retrieved throughout
a lifetime and strengthened with increased retrieval. Long-term memory
includes declarative and nondeclarative memory.

Thought Question

Stimulus-Response Learning

freezing, increased blood pressure, secretion of adrenal stress
hormones, and avoiding the stimuli associated with the shock. While much
of our understanding of the neural basis of conditioned emotional
responses comes from research with rodent models in the lab, this same
general process can be found in many different applications, such as
electrical fencing for pets or livestock. In these examples, a
classically conditioned emotional response is established by pairing a
neutral stimulus (such as the sight of a fence or flags placed around
the perimeter of an area) with an aversive stimulus (such as a brief
shock or surprising vibration delivered through a collar as an animal
approaches a fence boundary). (See Figure 13.10.) After being processed
by the sensory cortex, information about the CS (for example, the sight
of the fence) reaches the lateral nucleus of the agdala. This nucleus
also receives information about the US (the shock) from the
somatosensory system. These two sources of information converge in the
lateral nucleus, which means that synaptic changes responsible for
learning could take place in this location. A hypothetical neural
circuit is shown in Figure 13.11 to illustrate classical conditioning of
a tone and shock in a rodent model (also see Figure 13.3). The lateral
nucleus of the amygdala contains neurons whose axons project to the
central nucleus. Terminal buttons from neurons that transmit auditory
and somatosensory information to the lateral nucleus form synapses with
dendritic spines on these neurons. When a rodent encounters a painful
shock stimulus, somatosensory input activates strong synapses in the
lateral nucleus. As a result, the neurons in this nucleus begin firing,
which activates

The first module of this chapter introduced four basic types of
learning: stimulus-response, motor, perceptual, and relational learning.
The following modules explore each of these types of learning in greater
detail, including what is known of their neural basis. Within each of
these modules, learning produces memories as the information to be
learned proceeds through sensory, short-term, and finally long-term
memory stages. We begin by exploring the neural structures and systems
that underlie classical and operant conditioning.

Classical Conditioning LO 13.3

Describe the roles of the amygdala, AMPA receptors, and NMDA receptors
in classical conditioning.

Neuroscientists have studied the anatomy and physiology of classical
conditioning using many models, such as the gill withdrawal reflex in
Aplysia (a marine invertebrate) and the eyeblink reflex in the rabbit
(Carew, 1989; Lavond et al., 1993). Here, we will describe the
conditioned emotional response to illustrate the underlying neural
activity responsible for conditioning response. (See Chapter 11 for an
additional example of conditioned emotional response.) ROLE OF THE
AMYGDALA The amygdala is important in classically conditioned emotional
responses. An aversive stimulus such as an electrical shock produces a
variety of behavioral, autonomic, and hormonal responses:

Do you ride a bike or drive a car? What other complex behaviors have you
learned? Choose one and identify the different types of learning and
memory involved in the behavior.

Electric fencing for livestock and pets uses classical conditioning. The
unconditioned stimulus (shock or other aversive stimuli) and response
(avoiding the location of the shock) are conditioned to a previously
neutral stimulus (sight of a fence or flags) to produce the conditioned
response (avoiding the fence or flags).

neurons in the central nucleus, evoking an unlearned (unconditioned)
emotional response. If a tone is paired with the painful stimulus, the
weak synapses in the lateral amygdala are strengthened. The synaptic
changes responsible for this type of learning take place within this
circuit. The evidence from many studies indicates that the changes in
the lateral amygdala responsible for acquisition of a conditioned
emotional response involve a series of synaptic changes called long-term
potentiation (LTP). Long-term potentiation is described in detail in the
final module of this chapter. LTP involves

ROLE OF GLUTAMATE

NMDA receptors and their relationship to increasing the number of AMPA
receptors at the synapse. NMDA and AMPA receptors are described in
Chapter 4. Briefly for now, LTP is accomplished through the activation
of NMDA receptors and the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into
the postsynaptic membrane. These synaptic changes in the glutamate
system serve to increase the EPSP to the postsynaptic cell. For example,
Rumpel and colleagues (2005) paired a tone with a shock and established
a conditioned emotional response. They found that the learning
experience caused additional AMPA receptors to be inserted
postsynaptically and increased EPSPs to dendritic spines of synapses
between lateral amygdala neurons and axons that provide auditory input.
They also found that a procedure that prevented the insertion of AMPA
receptors into the dendritic spines also prevented the conditioned
emotional response. In addition, Migues and colleagues (2010) found that
blocking steps involved in LTP in the lateral amygdala impaired the
establishment of a conditioned emotional response. In fact, the
magnitude of the deficit was directly related to the decrease in
postsynaptic AMPA receptors, and presumably the decrease in EPSPs. The
results of these studies support the conclusion that LTP among glutamate
synapses in the lateral amygdala plays a critical role in the
establishment of conditioned emotional responses. (See Figure 13.12.)
Additional details about synaptic changes associated with LTP will be

Operant Conditioning LO 13.4

Outline the neural mechanisms of operant conditioning.

Operant conditioning is one of the means by which we (and other animals)
learn from interacting with our environment. If, in a particular
situation, we make a response that has favorable outcomes, we will tend
to make the response again. This section first describes the neural
pathways involved in operant conditioning and then discusses the neural
basis of reinforcement. As we saw in the first module of this chapter,
operant conditioning entails the strengthening of connections between
neural circuits that detect a particular stimulus and neural circuits
that produce a particular response. The circuits that are responsible
for operant conditioning begin in various regions of the sensory
association cortex, where perception takes place, and end in the motor
association cortex of the frontal lobe, which controls movements. But
what pathways are responsible for these connections, and where do the
synaptic changes responsible for the learning take place? There are two
major pathways between the sensory association cortex and the motor
association cortex: direct transcortical connections (connections from
one area of the cerebral cortex to another) and connections via the
basal ganglia and thalamus. (A third pathway, involving the cerebellum
and thalamus, also exists, but the role of this pathway in operant
conditioning has until very recently received little attention from
neuroscientists.) The first two pathways appear to be involved in
operant conditioning, but they play different roles. (See Figure 13.13.)
ROLE OF BASAL GANGLIA

Transcortical Pathways In conjunction with the hippocampal formation,
the transcortical connections are involved in the acquisition of
declarative, episodic memories---complex perceptual memories of
sequences of events that we experience or that are described to us. The
transcortical connections are also involved in the acquisition of
complex behaviors that involve deliberation or instruction. For example,
a person learning to drive a car with a manual transmission might say,
"Let's see, push in the clutch, move the shift lever to the left and
then away from me---there, it's in gear---now let the clutch come
up---oh! It died---I should have given it more gas. Let's see, clutch
down, turn the key. . . ." A memorized set of rules (or an instructor
sitting next to us) provides a script for us to follow. Of course, this
process does not have to be audible or even involve actual movements of
the speech muscles; a person can think in words with neural activity
that does not result in overt behavior. At first, performing a behavior
through observation or by following a set of rules is slow and awkward.
And because so many of the brain's resources are involved in recalling
the rules and applying them to our behavior, we cannot respond to other
stimuli in the environment---we must ignore events that might distract
us. But then, with practice, the behavior becomes much more fluid.
Eventually, we perform it without thinking and can easily do other
things at the same time, such as talking with passengers as we drive our
car. Basal Ganglia Pathways Evidence suggests that as learned behaviors
become automatic and routine, they are "transferred" to the basal
ganglia. The process seems to work like this: As we deliberately perform
a complex behavior, the basal ganglia receive information about the
stimuli that are present and the responses we are making. At first the

426 Chapter 13 ganglia are passive "observers" of the situation, but as
the behaviors are repeated again and again, the basal ganglia begin to
learn what to do. Eventually, they take over most of the details of the
process, leaving the transcortical circuits free to do something else.
We need no longer think about what we are doing. Returning to the
example of driving a car with a manual transmission, as the driver
practices, processing is transferred to the basal ganglia, and the
driver no longer needs to deliberately think through each step. Instead,
the driver fluidly and automatically starts the engine, shifts gears,
and drives the car. The caudate nucleus and the putamen (two parts of
the basal ganglia) receive sensory information from all regions of the
cerebral cortex. They also receive information from the frontal lobes
about movements that are planned or are actually in progress. (This
means that the basal ganglia have all the information they need to
monitor the progress of someone learning to drive a car.) The outputs of
the caudate nucleus and the putamen are sent to another part of the
basal ganglia: the globus pallidus (a third part of the basal ganglia).
The outputs of this structure are sent to the frontal cortex: to the
premotor and supplementary motor cortex, where plans for movements are
made; and to the primary motor cortex, where they are executed. (See
Figure 13.14.) The transfer of memories from brain systems involved in
acquisition of behavior sequences to those involved in storage of
automatic procedures can be observed in the basal ganglia. For example,
research with animal models has revealed that the area of the rat brain
that corresponds to the caudate nucleus in humans and other primates is
reciprocally connected with the prefrontal cortex. The area of the

rat brain that corresponds to the primate putamen is reciprocally
connected to sensory and motor regions of the cortex. Yin and colleagues
(2009) and Thorn and colleagues (2010) found that the rat caudate
analogue was involved in early learning of new skills, but that as
practice continued and the behavior became more habitual and automatic,
the putamen analogue began to take over control of the animal's
behavior. Lesions of the basal ganglia disrupt operant conditioning but
do not affect other forms of learning. For example, Fernandez-Ruiz and
colleagues (2001) lesioned portions of the caudate nucleus and putamen
that receive visual information from the ventral stream in monkeys. They
found that the lesions impaired the monkeys' ability to learn to make a
visually guided operant response, but did not affect other forms of
learning. Williams and Eskandar (2006) trained monkeys to move a
joystick in a particular direction (left, right, forward, or backward)
when they saw a particular visual stimulus. Correct responses were
reinforced with a sip of fruit juice. As the monkeys learned the task,
the firing rate of neurons in the caudate nucleus increased. The
activity of caudate neurons was correlated with the animals' rate of
learning. When the investigators further activated the caudate neurons
through electrical stimulation during the reinforcement period, the
monkeys learned a stimulus-response association more quickly. These
results provide further evidence for the role of the basal ganglia in
operant conditioning. REINFORCEMENT Learning provides a means for us to
profit from experience---to make responses that provide favorable
outcomes. When good things happen (that is, when reinforcing stimuli
occur), reinforcement mechanisms in the brain become active, and the
establishment of synaptic changes is facilitated. The discovery of the
existence of such reinforcement mechanisms occurred by accident.

Neural Circuits Involved in Reinforcement In 1954, James Olds, a young
assistant professor, and Peter Milner, a graduate student, attempted to
determine whether electrical stimulation of the reticular formation
would facilitate maze learning in rats. The reticular formation is a
large structure between the brainstem and midbrain that contains many
different nuclei and pathways (see Chapter 3 for review). Olds and
Milner planned to turn on the stimulator briefly each time an animal
reached a choice point in the maze. The researchers applied a brief
electrical current into that region around the reticular formation when
the animals entered one corner of their enclosure. The animals quickly
returned to the location following the stimulation. They returned to the
original corner more and more quickly after each successive stimulation
was applied (Olds, 1973). Realizing that they were on to something big,
Olds and Milner decided to stop their original experiment and study the
phenomenon they had discovered. Subsequent research discovered that
although there are several different

reinforcement mechanisms, the activity of dopaminergic neurons plays a
particularly important role in reinforcement. As we saw in Chapter 4,
the mesolimbic system of dopaminergic neurons begins in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain and projects rostrally to several
forebrain regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and nucleus
accumbens (NAC). (See Figure 13.15.) Neurons in the NAC project to the
ventral part of the basal ganglia, which, as we just saw, are involved
in learning. The mesocortical system also plays a role in reinforcement.
This system also begins in the ventral tegmental area but projects to
the prefrontal cortex, the limbic cortex, and the hippocampus. Because
the stimulation of several regions of the brain is reinforcing, the
mesolimbic system is only one of several reinforcement pathways. In
their study, Olds and Milner had inadvertently activated these pathways
when they stimulated the reticular pathway, causing the animal's
behavior during the stimulation (being in the corner of the enclosure)
to be reinforced, and more likely to occur in the future. Role of
Dopamine in Reinforcement Chapter 5 described a research technique
called microdialysis, which enables an investigator to analyze the
contents of the interstitial fluid within a specific region of the
brain. Researchers using this method have shown that reinforcing
electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle or the ventral
tegmental area or the administration of cocaine or amphetamine causes
the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (Moghaddam & Bunney,
1989; Nakahara et al., 1989; Phillips et al., 1992). The medial
forebrain bundle connects the ventral tegmental

area with the nucleus accumbens. (See Figure 13.16.) Microdialysis
studies have also found that the presence of natural reinforcers, such
as water, food, or a sex partner, stimulates the release of dopamine in
the nucleus accumbens. It appears that the effects of reinforcing brain
stimulation are similar in many ways to those of naturally o ­ ccurring
reinforcers.

428 Chapter 13 Functional-imaging studies have shown that reinforcing
events also activate the human nucleus accumbens. For example, Knutson
and colleagues (2001) found that the nucleus accumbens became more
active (and, presumably, dopamine was being released there) when people
were presented with stimuli that indicated that they would be receiving
money. Like classical conditioning, operant conditioning involves
strengthening synapses among neurons that have just been active.
However, operant conditioning involves three elements: a discriminative
stimulus, a response, and a reinforcing stimulus. How are the neural
manifestations of these three elements combined, and what role does
dopamine play? Let's consider a hungry rat learning to press a lever and
obtain food. As in classical conditioning, one element (the
discriminative stimulus---in this case the sight of the lever) activates
only weak synapses on motor neurons responsible for a movement that
causes a lever press. The second element---the particular circumstance
that happened to induce the animal to press the lever---activates strong
synapses, making the neurons fire. The third element comes into play
only if the response is followed by a reinforcing stimulus. If it is,
the reinforcement mechanism triggers the secretion of a neurotransmitter
or neuromodulator throughout the region in which the synaptic changes
take place. This chemical is the third element; only if it is present
can weak synapses be strengthened. Dopamine serves such a role. Several
studies have shown that long-term potentiation is essential for operant
conditioning and that dopamine is an essential ingredient in
long-lasting long-term potentiation. Knecht and colleagues (2004) taught
people a vocabulary of artificial words. The learning took place
gradually, during five daily sessions. In a double-blind procedure, some
participants were given l-DOPA 90 minutes before each session, and
others were given a placebo. l-DOPA is the precursor for dopamine, so
administration of this drug increases the release of dopamine in the
brain. The participants who received the l-DOPA learned the artificial
vocabulary faster and remembered it better than those who received the
placebo. In that same vein, Tsai and colleagues (2009) used optogenetic
stimulation in mice to specifically activate dopaminergic neurons in the
VTA and found that the stimulation reinforced performance on an operant
task. Functions of the Reinforcement System A reinforcement system must
perform two functions: detect the presence of a reinforcing stimulus
(that is, recognize that something good has just happened) and
strengthen the connections between the neurons that detect the
discriminative stimulus (such as the sight of a lever) and the neurons
that produce the operant response (a lever press). (Refer back to Figure
13.5.) Assuming that this proposed mechanism is correct, several
questions remain: What activates the dopaminergic neurons in the
midbrain, causing their terminal buttons to release dopamine? What role
does the release of dopamine

M13_CARL0287_13_GE_C13.indd 428

play in strengthening synaptic connections? Where do these synaptic
changes take place? Research that suggests some preliminary answers to
these questions is discussed in the rest of this module. Detecting
Reinforcing Stimuli Reinforcement occurs when neural circuits detect a
reinforcing stimulus and cause the activation of dopaminergic neurons in
the ventral tegmental area. Detecting a reinforcing stimulus is not a
simple matter. A stimulus that serves as a reinforcer in one situation
may not in another. For example, the presence of food will reinforce the
behavior of a hungry animal but not that of an animal that has just
eaten. The reinforcement system is not automatically activated when
particular stimuli are present. Its activation also depends on the state
of the animal or the environment the stimuli occur in. Studies by
Schultz and his colleagues, recording the activity of dopaminergic
neurons in the nucleus accumbens, have discovered that the reinforcement
system appears to be activated by unexpected reinforcing stimuli. For
example, Mirenowicz and Schultz (1994, 1996) taught monkeys an operant
task that required them to make a response when they heard an auditory
stimulus. During training, dopaminergic neurons in the VTA responded
rapidly when the reinforcing stimulus (a tasty liquid) was delivered.
However, once the animals learned the task, the VTA neurons became
active when the auditory stimulus was presented but not when the
reinforcing stimulus was delivered. In addition, if a reinforcing
stimulus does not occur when it is expected, the activity of
dopaminergic neurons suddenly decreases (Day et al., 2007). A
f­unctional-imaging study by Berns and colleagues (2001) found similar
results with humans. Figure 13.17 shows that when a small amount of
tasty fruit juice was squirted in people's mouths unpredictably, the
nucleus accumbens was activated, but when the delivery of fruit juice
was predictable, no such activity occurred. Schultz and his colleagues
suggest that activation of the dopaminergic neurons of the VTA
communicates to other circuits in the brain that an event related to a
potentially reinforcing stimulus has just occurred. In other words, the
activity of these neurons sends a signal that there is something to be
learned. If the delivery of the reinforcer is already expected, then
there is nothing that needs to be learned. A functional-imaging study by
Knutson and Adcock (2005) found that anticipation of a reinforcing
stimulus (the opportunity to win some money) increased the activation of
the ventral tegmentum and some of its projection regions (including the
nucleus accumbens) in humans. The investigators found that the
participants were more likely to remember pictures that they had seen
while they were anticipating the chance to win some money. (See Table
13.3.) Role of the Prefrontal Cortex The prefrontal cortex provides an
important input to the ventral tegmental area.

The terminal buttons of the axons connecting these two areas secrete
glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, and the activity of these
synapses makes dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area fire
in a bursting pattern, which greatly increases the amount of dopamine
they secrete in the nucleus accumbens (Gariano & Groves, 1988). The
prefrontal cortex is generally involved in devising strategies, making
plans, evaluating progress made toward goals, and judging the
appropriateness of one's own behavior. Perhaps the prefrontal cortex
turns on the reinforcement mechanism when it determines that the ongoing
behavior is bringing the organism nearer to its goals and that the
present strategy is working.

Module Review: Stimulus-Response Learning Classical Conditioning LO 13.3

Describe the roles of the amygdala, AMPA receptors, and NMDA receptors
in classical conditioning.

When a stimulus (CS) is paired with a shock (US), the two types of
information converge in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. Classical
conditioning changes the response of neurons to the CS in the lateral
nucleus of the amygdala. The mechanism of synaptic plasticity in this
system appears to be NMDA-mediated long-term potentiation. LTP is
accomplished through the activation of NMDA receptors and the subsequent
insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane.
Blocking aspects of LTP in the lateral nucleus prevents establishing
conditioned emotional responses.

Operant Conditioning LO 13.4

neural circuits that produce responses. One of the locations of these
changes appears to be the basal ganglia, especially the changes
responsible for learning of automated and routine behaviors. The basal
ganglia receive sensory information and information about plans for
movement from the neocortex. The mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways
are responsible for reinforcement in operant conditioning. The
prefrontal cortex may be involved in activating the mesolimbic pathway
to achieve goals.

Motor Learning Motor learning typically involves learning a novel
sequence of motor behaviors over repeated trials. The cerebellum,
thalamus, basal ganglia, and motor cortex are involved in motor learning
across many different tasks (Hardwick et al., 2013). Chapter 8 describes
the brain regions involved in the control of voluntary movement in
greater detail, and the following module provides an introduction to the
role of two key areas involved in motor learning: the cortex and basal
ganglia.

Role of the Cortex LO 13.5

List the contributions of various cortical regions to motor learning.

The primary motor cortex is responsible for controlling the movements of
the body and is organized somatotopically. As you read in Chapter 8,
several adjacent areas of the cortex are critical in organizing complex,
learned movements. For example, the supplementary motor area is involved
in performing previously learned, automatic series of behaviors. The
premotor cortex is involved in motor learning and memory that is guided
by sensory information. The ventral premotor cortex is home to mirror
neurons that facilitate motor learning when observing another
individual. Motor learning typically involves a period of fast learning
when the motor movements to be learned show rapid improvement during
initial trials. The memory of this motor behavior is improved in the
period of time following the initial trials when no additional practice
occurs, called between-session learning. This improvement is made
through consolidation and reconsolidation of the memory. Further
improvement in motor learning occurs following sleep. REM and slow-wave
sleep are associated

with enhanced aspects of motor learning in some motor learning tasks and
may promote LTP (Censor et al., 2012).

Role of the Basal Ganglia LO 13.6

Explain the role of the basal ganglia in motor learning.

What brain regions are responsible for the acquisition of nondeclarative
motor memories? As we saw earlier in this chapter, perceptual memories
involve the sensory regions of the cerebral cortex. The basal ganglia
appear to play an essential role in stimulus-response and motor
learning. Several experiments have shown that people with diseases of
the basal ganglia have deficits that can be attributed to difficulty in
learning automatic responses. For example, Owen and colleagues (1992)
found that patients with Parkinson's disease were impaired on learning a
visually cued operant conditioning task, and Willingham and Koroshetz
(1993) found that patients with Huntington's disease failed to learn a
sequence of button presses. Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease
both involve degeneration of the basal ganglia and are described in
detail in Chapter 15. Table 13.4 summarizes examples of motor learning
associated with activity in the motor cortex and basal ganglia.

and input from the premotor area and supplementary motor area help to

is not actively engaged in practicing the motor behavior? Explain the

memory.

Learning and Memory 431

Perceptual Learning Learning enables us to adapt to our environment and
to respond to changes in it. In particular, it provides us with the
ability to perform an appropriate behavior in an appropriate situation.
Situations can be as simple as responding to the sound of a doorbell or
as complex as the social interactions of a group of people. Perceptual
learning involves learning to recognize things. Perceptual learning can
involve learning to recognize entirely new stimuli, or it can involve
learning to recognize changes or variations in familiar stimuli. For
example, if a friend gets a new hairstyle or replaces glasses with
contact lenses, our visual memory of that person changes. We also learn
that particular stimuli are found in particular locations or contexts or
in the presence of other stimuli. We can even learn and remember
particular episodes: sequences of events taking place at a particular
time and place. The more complex forms of perceptual learning will be
discussed in a later module of this chapter, which is devoted to
relational learning. The following module will describe the roles of the
cortex in learning to recognize stimuli and how the memories of those
stimuli are formed.

Role of the Cortex LO 13.7

Explain the roles of cortical regions in perceptual learning.

We will first describe the role of the cortex in learning to recognize
stimuli, then provide evidence of cortical activity in later remembering
stimuli. Finally, the role of the cortex will be discussed in the
context of retaining perceptual information in short-term memory.
LEARNING In mammals with large and complex brains, objects are
recognized visually by circuits of neurons in the extrastriate cortex.
Visual learning can take place very rapidly, and the number of items
that can be remembered is enormous. In fact, Standing (1973) showed
people 10,000 color slides and found that they could recognize most of
the slides weeks later. Other primates are capable of remembering items
that they have seen for just a few seconds, and the experience changes
the responses of neurons in their extrastriate cortex (Rolls, 1995). As
we saw in Chapter 6, the striate cortex receives information from the
lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. After the first level of
analysis in the striate cortex, the information is sent to the
extrastriate cortex. After analyzing particular attributes of the visual
scene, such as form, color, and movement, subregions of the extrastriate
cortex send the results of their analysis to the next level of the
visual association cortex, which is divided into two "streams." The
ventral stream, which is involved with object recognition, continues
ventrally into the inferior temporal cortex. The

M13_CARL0287_13_GE_C13.indd 431

dorsal stream, which is involved with perception of the location of
objects, continues dorsally into the posterior parietal cortex. Most
investigators agree that the ventral stream is involved with the what of
visual perception, and the dorsal stream is involved with the where.
(See Figure 6.14.) Many studies have shown that lesions that damage the
inferior temporal cortex---the end of the ventral stream--- disrupt the
ability to discriminate among visual stimuli. These lesions impair the
ability to perceive (and learn to recognize) particular kinds of visual
information. As we saw in Chapter 6, people with damage to the inferior
temporal cortex may have excellent vision but be unable to recognize
familiar, everyday objects such as scissors, cell phones, or light
bulbs---and faces of friends and relatives. Perceptual learning involves
changes in synaptic connections in the extrastriate cortex that
establish new neural circuits. At a later time, when the same stimulus
is seen again and the same pattern of activity is transmitted to the
cortex, these circuits become active again. This activity constitutes
the recognition of the stimulus--- the readout, or replay, of the visual
memory. For example, Yang and Maunsell (2004) trained monkeys to detect
small differences in visual stimuli whose images were projected onto a
specific region of the retina. After the training was complete, the
monkeys were able to detect differences much smaller than those they
could detect when the training first started. However, they were unable
to detect these differences when the patterns were projected onto other
regions of the retina. Recordings of single neurons in the extrastriate
cortex showed that the response properties of neurons that received
information from the "trained" region of the retina---but not from other
regions---had become sensitive to small differences in the stimuli.
Neural circuits in that region alone had been modified by the training.
(See Figure 13.18.) Let's look at some evidence from studies with humans
that supports the conclusion that activation of neural circuits in the
sensory association cortex constitutes the "replay" of a perceptual
memory. Many years ago, Penfield and Perot (1963) discovered that when
they stimulated the extrastriate and auditory association cortex as
patients were undergoing seizure surgery, the patients reported memories
of images or sounds---for example, images of a familiar street or the
sound of the patient's mother's voice. (You will recall from the opening
case in Chapter 3 that seizure surgery is performed under a local
anesthetic so that the surgeons can test the effects of brain
stimulation on the patients' cognitive functions.) Damage to regions of
the brain involved in visual perception not only impairs the ability to
recognize visual stimuli but also disrupts people's memory of the visual
properties of familiar stimuli. For example, Vandenbulcke and colleagues
(2006) found that Patient J. A., who had sustained

constitutes the "readout" of perceptual memory. Seeing a specific visual

stimulate the same neural activity in the extrastriate cortex.

information can activate very specific regions of extrastriate cortex.
As we saw in Chapter 6, a region of the extrastriate cortex, MT/MST,
plays an essential role in perception of movement. The investigators
presented participants with photographs that implied motion---for
example, an athlete getting ready to throw a ball. They found that
photographs like these, but not photographs of people remaining still,
activated area MT/MST. Even though the photographs did not move, the
participants' memories presumably contained information about movements
they had previously seen. (See Figure 13.19.) A functional-imaging study
by Goldberg and colleagues (2006) asked people questions that involved
visual, auditory, tactile, and gustatory information. The researchers
found that answering the questions activated the regions of association
cortex involved in perception of the relevant sensory information. For
example, questions about flavor activated the gustatory cortex,
questions about tactile information activated the somatosensory cortex,
and questions about visual and auditory information activated the visual
and auditory association cortex.

Retaining Perceptual Information in Short-Term Memory LO 13.8

Contrast the roles of cortical regions in retaining perceptual
information in short-term memory.

So far, all the studies we have mentioned involved recognition of
stimuli, either particular objects or their locations. Often,
recognition is all that is necessary: We see a stimulus and immediately
make the appropriate response. But sometimes the situation demands that
we make the appropriate response after a delay, even after the stimulus
is no longer visible. For example, suppose that we have driven into a
large parking lot, and because we will have to carry a heavy package, we
want to park as near as possible to the entrance of a store located just
in front of us. We look to the left and see a space about 100 feet away.
We then look to the right and see a space about 50 feet away. Mentally
comparing the distances, we turn to the right. Because we could not look
in both directions simultaneously, we had to compare the distance to the
second space with our memory of the distance to first one. In other
words, we had to compare a perception with a short-term memory of
something else we had just perceived. As you read at the beginning of
this chapter, short-term memory is the memory for a stimulus or an event
that lasts for a short period of time---usually just a few seconds.

Learning and Memory 433

As we just saw, learning to recognize a stimulus involves synaptic
changes in the appropriate regions of the sensory association cortex
that establish new circuits of neurons. Recognition of a stimulus occurs
when sensory input activates these established sets of neural circuits.
Short-term memory of a stimulus involves activity of these circuits---or
other circuits that are activated by them---that continues even after
the stimulus disappears. For example, learning to recognize a friend's
face produces changes in synaptic strengths in neural circuits in the
fusiform face region of our visual association cortex, recognizing that
she is present involves activation of the circuits that are established
by these changes, and remembering that she is still in the room even
when we look elsewhere involves continued activity of these circuits (or
other circuits connected to them). The following sections will explore
the contributions of the extrastriate and prefrontal cortex regions in
retaining perceptual information in short-term memory.

activated the fusiform face area and that short-term memories of places
activated the parahippocampal place area. As we saw in Chapter 6,
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the extrastriate cortex
interferes with visual perception. TMS can be used to induce a weak
electrical current in the brain that disrupts neural activity and
interferes with the normal functions of the stimulated region. Oliveri
and colleagues (2001) trained people on a delayed matching-to-sample
task that required them to remember either abstract figures or the
locations of a white square on a video screen. On some trials the
investigators applied TMS to regions of either the ventral stream or the
dorsal stream during the delay interval, after the sample stimuli had
been turned off. They found that, as expected, stimulating the ventral
stream interfered with short-term memory for visual patterns, and
stimulating the dorsal stream interfered with short-term memory for
location.

Functional-­ imaging studies have shown that retention of specific types
of short-term visual memories involves activity of specific regions of
the extrastriate cortex that we encountered in Chapter 6. One region of
the ventral stream, the fusiform face area, is involved in recognition
of faces, and another region, the parahippocampal place area (part of
the ventral stream), is involved in recognition of places. A
functional-imaging study by Ranganath and colleagues (2004) found
evidence that short-term memory for particular faces and places was
associated with neural activity in two different regions of the ventral
stream of the visual association cortex. The investigators trained
people on a delayed matchingto-sample task that required them to
remember particular faces or places for a short period of time. In a
delayed matching-to-sample task, a participant is shown a stimulus (the
sample), and then, after a delay during which the stimulus disappears,
the participant must indicate which of several alternatives matches the
sample. Ranganath and his colleagues found that short-term memories of
faces

ral circuits responsible for learning to recognize particular stimuli
appear to reside in the sensory association cortex, perceptual
short-term memories involve other brain regions as well---especially the
prefrontal cortex. Miyashita (2004) suggests that the role of the
prefrontal cortex in short-term memory is to "manipulate and organize
to-be-remembered information, devise strategies for retrieval, and also
monitor the outcome" of these processes (p. 435). Baier and colleagues
(2010) note that successfully remembering recently presented information
in short-term memory requires two processes: filtering out irrelevant
information and maintaining relevant information. The investigators
presented stroke patients with short-term memory tasks that either
required them to ignore extraneous, irrelevant information or tested
their ability to hold several pieces of information in mind. They found
that patients with damage to the left basal ganglia had difficulty
filtering out irrelevant information, and patients with damage to the
right prefrontal cortex had difficulty retaining more than a few pieces
of information in short-term memory.

Explain the roles of cortical regions in perceptual learning.

Visual recognition occurs in circuits in the dorsal and ventral streams.
Perceptual learning occurs as a result of changes in synaptic
connections within the sensory association cortex. Damage to the
inferior temporal cortex--- the highest level of the ventral
stream---disrupts visual perceptual learning. Functional-imaging studies
with humans have shown that retrieval of memories of pictures,

regions of the sensory association cortex.

activity of specific regions of the extrastriate cortex. Transcranial
magnetic stimulation of various regions of the human extrastriate cortex
disrupts short-term perceptual memories. The prefrontal cortex is also
involved in shortterm memory. This region encodes information pertaining
to the stimulus that must be remembered and is involved in manipulating
and organizing information in short-term memory. Successful retention of
information in short-term memory requires filtering out irrelevant
information, which involves the left basal ganglia, and

Relational Learning So far, this chapter has discussed relatively simple
forms of learning, which can be understood as changes in circuits of
neurons that detect the presence of particular stimuli or as
strengthened connections between neurons that analyze sensory
information and those that produce responses. But most forms of learning
are more complex; most memories of real objects and events are related
to other memories. Seeing a photograph of an old friend may remind you
of the sound of the person's name and of the movements you have to make
to pronounce it. You may also be reminded of things you have done with
your friend---places you have visited, conversations you have had,
experiences you have shared. Each of these memories can contain a series
of events, complete with sights and sounds, that you will be able to
recall in the proper sequence. The neural circuits in the extrastriate
cortex that recognize your friend's face are connected to circuits in
many other parts of the brain, and these circuits are connected to many
others. This module discusses research on the role of the hippocampus
and cortex in relational learning, which includes the establishment and
retrieval of memories of events, episodes, and places.

maintaining relevant information, which involves the right prefrontal
cortex.

Role of the Hippocampus LO 13.9

Describe the role of the hippocampus in relational learning.

The hippocampal formation consists of the dentate gyrus, regions called
the CA fields of the hippocampus, and the subiculum (and its
subregions). (See Figure 13.30a.) The most important input to the
hippocampal formation is the entorhinal cortex; neurons there have axons
that terminate in the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1. The entorhinal cortex
receives its inputs from the amygdala, various regions of the limbic
cortex, and all association regions of the neocortex, either directly or
via two adjacent regions of limbic cortex: the perirhinal cortex and the
parahippocampal cortex. Collectively, these three regions constitute the
limbic cortex of the medial temporal lobe. (See Figure 13.20.)

The outputs of the hippocampal system come primarily from field CA1 and
the subiculum. Most of these outputs are relayed back through the
entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortex to the same regions
of association cortex that provide inputs. The hippocampal formation
also receives input from subcortical regions via the fornix. These
inputs select and modulate the functions of the hippocampal formation.
The fornix carries dopaminergic axons from the ventral tegmental area,
noradrenergic axons from the locus coeruleus, serotonergic axons from
the raphe nuclei, and acetylcholinergic axons from the medial septum.
The fornix also connects the hippocampal formation with the mammillary
bodies, located in the posterior hypothalamus. The most prominent brain
damage seen in cases of Korsakoff's syndrome---and presumably the cause
of the anterograde amnesia, or difficulty learning new information---is
degeneration of the mammillary bodies. (See Figure 13.21.) The symptoms
of Korsakoff's syndrome will be described in greater detail later in
this chapter. CONSOLIDATION OF MEMORIES The hippocampal formation plays
a role in the process through which declarative memories are formed.
Most researchers believe that the process works something like this: The
hippocampus receives information about what is going on from the sensory
and motor association cortexes and from some subcortical regions, such
as the basal ganglia and amygdala. It processes this information and
then, through its efferent connections with these regions, modifies the
memories that are being consolidated there, linking them together in
ways that will permit us to remember the relationships among the
elements of the memories---for example, the order in which events
occurred, the context in which we perceived a particular

item, and so on. Without the hippocampal formation, we would be left
with individual, isolated memories without the linkage that makes it
possible to remember---and think about---episodes and contexts.
Acquisition of both major categories of relational, declarative
memories---episodic and semantic---appears to require the participation
of the hippocampus. Manns and colleagues (2003) found that five patients
with damage limited to the hippocampal formation showed an anterograde
amnesia for semantic as well as episodic information. As we saw earlier
in this chapter, perceptual memories appear to be located in the sensory
association cortex, the regions where the perceptions take place.
Presumably, episodic memories, which consist of an integrated sequence
of perceptual memories, are also located there. What about semantic
memories---memories for factual information? Knowing that the sun is a
star certainly involves memories different from knowing what the sun
looks like. Semantic memories are not simply perceptual memories. A
degenerative neurological disorder known as semantic dementia suggests
that the temporal cortex plays an important role in storing semantic
information. Semantic dementia is caused by degeneration of the
neocortex of the anterolateral temporal lobe (Lambon, Ralph, &
Patterson, 2008). At least in the early stages of the degenerative
process, the hippocampal formation and the rest of the medial temporal
lobe are not affected. Murre and colleagues (2001) describe the case of
patient A. M., born in 1930 and studied by the investigators between
1994 and 1997.

A. M. was an active, intelligent man who had received an undergraduate
degree in engineering and a master's degree in science. He worked for an
internationally renowned company,

09/11/2021 11:16

436 Chapter 13 where he was responsible for managing over 450 employees.
His neurological symptoms began with progressive difficulty in
understanding the speech of others and finding appropriate words of his
own. By the time Murre and his colleagues met A. M., his speech was
fluent and grammatical but contained little meaning. Examiner: Can you
tell me about a time you were in hospital? A. M.: Well one of the best
places was in April last year here (ha ha) and then April, May, June,
July, August, September, and then October, and then April today.
Examiner: Can you remember April last year? A. M.: April last year, that
was the first time, and eh, on the Monday, for example, they were
checking all my whatsit, and that was the first time, when my brain was,
eh, shown, you know, you know that bar of the brain (indicates left),
not the, the other one was okay, but that was lousy, so they did that
and then doing everything like that, like this and probably a bit better
than I am just now (indicates scanning by moving his hands over his
head). (Murre et al., 2001, p. 651) Patient A. M.'s loss of semantic
information had a profound effect on his everyday activities. He seemed
not to understand functions of commonplace objects. For example, he held
a closed umbrella horizontally over his head during a rainstorm and
brought his wife a lawnmower when she had asked for a stepladder. He put
sugar into a glass of wine and put yogurt on a raw defrosting salmon
steak and ate it. He nevertheless showed some surprisingly complex
behaviors. Because he could not be trusted to drive a car, his wife
surreptitiously removed the car keys from his key ring. He noticed their
absence, and rather than complaining to her (presumably, he realized
that would be fruitless), he surreptitiously removed the car keys from
her key ring, went to a locksmith, and had a duplicate set made.
Although his semantic memory was severely damaged, his episodic memory
was surprisingly good. The investigators reported that even when his
dementia had progressed to the point at which he was scoring at chance
levels on a test of semantic information, he answered a phone call that
was meant for his wife, who was out of the house. When she returned
later, he remembered to tell her about the call.

RECONSOLIDATION OF MEMORIES What happens to memories of events as time
goes on? If we learn something new about a particular subject, our
memories pertaining to that subject must somehow be modified. For
example, as you read earlier in this chapter, if a friend gets a new
hairstyle or replaces glasses with contact lenses, your visual memory of
that person will change accordingly. And if you learn more about
something---for example, the layout of a previously unfamiliar
neighborhood---you will acquire a larger and larger number of
interconnected memories.

M13_CARL0287_13_GE_C13.indd 436

These examples indicate that established memories can be altered or
connected to newer memories. In recent years, researchers have been
investigating a phenomenon known as reconsolidation, which appears to
involve modification of long-term memories. As we will see in Chapter
17, one of the side effects of a procedure known as electroconvulsive
therapy is a period of retrograde amnesia. The procedure, used to treat
cases of severe depression, involves the application of electricity
through electrodes placed on a person's scalp. The current excites so
many neurons in the brain that it produces a seizure. Presumably, the
seizure erases short-term memories present at the time and prevents
consolidation of these memories. Misanin and colleagues (1968) found
that long-term memories, which are normally not affected by seizures,
were vulnerable to disruption by electroconvulsive shock (ECS) if a
reminder of the original learning experience was first presented. The
investigators found that ECS given right after a learning experience
prevented consolidation, but ECS given a day later did not. Apparently,
the ECS given right after training disrupted the brain activity
initiated by the training session and consequently interfered with
consolidation. The ECS given the next day had no effect, because the
memory had already been consolidated. However, if animals in the study
were given a "reminder" stimulus 1 day after training, which presumably
reactivated the memory, an ECS treatment administered immediately
afterward caused amnesia for the task when the animals were tested the
following day. Reactivation of the memory made it susceptible to
disruption. These studies involved stimulus-response learning. More
recent studies have found that long-term, well-­ consolidated relational
memories are also susceptible to disruption. Presumably, the process of
reconsolidation, which involves neural events similar to those
responsible for the original consolidation, makes it possible for
established memories to be altered or attached to new information
(Nader, 2003). Events that interfere with consolidation also interfere
with reconsolidation and can even erase memories or at least make them
inaccessible. For example, Debiec and colleagues (2010) trained rats on
two fear conditioning tasks. They paired two different tones (CSa and
CSb) with shocks delivered to two different parts of the body (USa and
USb). After training, they randomly presented only one of the shocks
(USa or USb) to each animal followed by an infusion of anisomycin (which
blocks protein production) or a placebo into the lateral amygdala.
Protein production is an important step in long-term potentiation and
memory formation. The next day, they tested the animals for retention of
the conditioned responses. They found that the animals did not freeze
when they presented the tone that had been paired with the

Learning and Memory 437

US that had been presented just before the infusion of anisomycin on the
previous day. In other words, presenting one of the shocks "reopened"
the CS-US memory for possible reconsolidation, which made the memory
link fragile. Blocking protein synthesis prevented the memory from going
back to its original state. R O L E O F H I P P O C A M PA L N E U R O G
E N E S I S I N CONSOLIDATION As we saw in Chapter 3, new

neurons can be produced in the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb of the
adult brain. Stem cells located in the subgranular zone of the
hippocampus divide and, in rats, give rise to 5,000--10,000 granule
cells each day, which migrate into the dentate gyrus and extend axons
along the mossy fiber tract. The new neurons form connections with other
neurons in the dentate gyrus and with neurons in field CA3 (Kempermann
et al., 2004; Shors, 2009). (See Figure 13.22.) Morris and colleagues
(1982) developed a task that other researchers have adopted as a
standard test of rodents' spatial abilities. The task requires rats to
find a particular location in space solely by means of visual cues
external to the apparatus. The "maze" consists of a circular pool, 1.3
meters in diameter, filled with a mixture of water and something to
increase the opacity of the water, such as powdered milk. The water
mixture hides the location of a small platform, situated just beneath
the surface of the liquid. Experimenters put the rats into the water and
let them swim until they encountered the hidden platform and climbed
onto it.

They released the rats from a new position on each trial. After a few
trials, the rats learned to swim directly to the hidden platform from
wherever they were released. The Morris water maze requires relational
learning; to navigate around the maze, the animals use information from
the relative locations of stimuli located outside the maze---furniture,
windows, doors, and so on. But the maze can be used for nonrelational,
stimulus-response learning, too. If the animals are always released at
the same place, they learn to head in a particular direction---say,
toward a particular landmark they can see above the wall of the maze
(Eichenbaum et al., 1990). If rats with hippocampal lesions are always
released from the same place, they learn this nonrelational,
­stimulusresponse task about as well as intact rats do. However, if they
are released from a new position on each trial, they swim in what
appears to be an aimless fashion until they finally encounter the
platform. (See Figure 13.23.) Gould and colleagues (1999) trained rats
on two versions of the Morris water maze: one requiring relational
learning and one requiring only stimulus-response learning. Training on
the relational task, which involves the hippocampus, doubled the number
of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus. Training on the
stimulus-response task, which does not involve the hippocampus, had no
effect on neurogenesis. Most newborn neurons die within a few weeks, but
if the animal learns something new, many of the neurons survive.

Evidence suggests that new neurons in the dentate gyrus participate in
learning. Tronel and colleagues (2010) found that maturation of
dendritic trees of newborn neurons and their integration into neural
circuits of the hippocampus were accelerated when animals were trained
on a spatial learning task. They also found that infusion of a drug to
block NMDA receptors (AP5) into the lateral ventricle did not affect the
basal rate of neurogenesis, but it impaired learning and prevented the
normal learninginduced changes in neurogenesis from taking place. These
results suggest that long-term potentiation plays a role in the
incorporation of newborn neurons into circuits that store new memories.
The rate of neurogenesis and the survival of new neurons are responsive
to changes in the organism's environment. In rodents, access to a
running wheel or exposure to an enriched cage environment with toys,
tunnels,

and other objects to explore increases the number of new neurons
generated in the hippocampus and results in enhanced performance on the
Morris water maze task. When animals have access to a running wheel (and
use it), increased LTP is also found in the hippocampus. The number of
new neurons produced in the hippocampus decreases with age, and these
age-related decreases are reduced in rodents in an enriched environment
(Clemenson et al., 2015). Antidepressant drugs increase hippocampal
neurogenesis whereas stress hormones reduce it. Research using
transgenic mice that display increased neurogenesis confirms that
increased neurogenesis reduces anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in
this model (Hill et al., 2015). Although less research has been done on
the role of neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb, some evidence suggests
that neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb is also involved in learning.
Nissant and colleagues (2009) found

09/11/2021 11:16

Learning and Memory 439

that LTP could be induced in newborn olfactory bulb neurons soon after
they arrived in the olfactory bulb, but that this ability declined as
the neurons grew older. Belnoue and colleagues (2011) found that newborn
neurons in the olfactory bulb participated in olfactory learning. We
still do not know why neurogenesis takes place in only two parts of the
brain. If it is useful there, why does it not occur elsewhere in the
brain?

Role of the Cortex LO 13.10 Describe the role of the cortex in semantic
memory. In semantic dementia, semantic information is lost, but episodic
memory for recent events can be spared.

The hippocampal formation and the limbic cortex of the medial temporal
lobe appear to be involved in the consolidation and retrieval of
declarative memories, both episodic and semantic, but the semantic
memories themselves appear to be stored in the neocortex---in
particular, the anterolateral temporal lobe. Pobric and colleagues
(2007) found that TMS of the left anterior temporal lobe, which disrupts
the normal neural activity of this region, produced the symptoms of
semantic dementia. Volunteers who experienced TMS of the left anterior
temporal lobe had difficulty naming pictures of objects and
understanding the meanings of words, but they had no trouble performing
other, non-semantic tasks such as naming six-digit numbers and matching
large numbers according to their approximate size.

Module Review: Relational Learning Role of the Hippocampus LO 13.9

Describe the role of the hippocampus in relational learning.

The hippocampus receives information about what is going on from sensory
and motor association cortexes and from some subcortical regions, such
as the basal ganglia and amygdala. It processes this information and
then, through its efferent connections with these regions, modifies the
memories that are being consolidated there, linking them together in
ways that will permit us to remember the relationships among the
elements of the memories---for example, the order in which events
occurred, the context in which we perceived a particular item, and so
on. Without the hippocampal formation, we would be left with individual,
isolated memories without the linkage that makes it possible to
remember---and think about---episodes and contexts. Similarly,
deactivation of the dorsal hippocampus prevents consolidation if it
occurs 1 day after the animal learns a Morris water maze task but has no
effect if it occurs 30 days later. In contrast, deactivation of regions
of the cerebral cortex disrupts performance if it occurs 30 days after

Amnesia One of the most dramatic and intriguing phenomena caused by
human brain damage is anterograde amnesia, which, at first glance,
appears to be the inability to learn new information. However, when we
examine the phenomenon more carefully, we find that the basic abilities
of perceptual learning, stimulus-response learning, and motor learning
are intact but that complex relational learning is gone.

M13_CARL0287_13_GE_C13.indd 439

training but has no effect if it occurs 1 day after training, suggesting
that these cortical regions are involved in storage of the memory of the
task. The dentate gyrus is one of the two places in the brain where
adult stem cells can divide and give rise to new neurons. These neurons
establish connections with neurons in the hippocampus and appear to
participate in learning. Evidence indicates that these neurons play a
role in the formation of new memories.

Role of the Cortex LO 13.10 Describe the role of the cortex in semantic
memory. Semantic memories appear to be stored in the anterolateral
temporal lobe.

Thought Question How could understanding of the processes of
consolidation and reconsolidation of memories in the hippocampus be used
in a therapeutic setting? Are there situations in which interfering with
consolidation or later reconsolidation of memories could be beneficial?

As we discussed earlier, the term anterograde amnesia refers to
difficulty in learning new information. A person with pure anterograde
amnesia can remember events that occurred in the past, from the time
before the brain damage occurred, but cannot retain information
encountered after the damage. In contrast, retrograde amnesia refers to
the inability to remember events that happened before the brain damage
occurred. (See Figure 13.24.) As we will see, pure anterograde amnesia
is rare; usually, there is also a

retrograde amnesia for events that occurred for a period of time before
the brain damage occurred. In general, however, anterograde amnesia is
relatively more common than retrograde amnesia. In 1889, Sergei
Korsakoff, a Russian physician, first described a severe memory
impairment caused by brain damage, and the disorder was given his name.
The most profound symptom of Korsakoff's syndrome is severe anterograde
amnesia: The patients appear to be unable to form new memories, although
they can still remember old ones. They can converse normally and can
remember events that happened long before their brain damage occurred,
but they cannot remember events that happened afterward. These patients
experience degenerations of the mammillary bodies, which are connected
to the hippocampus via the fornix. As we will see in Chapter 16, the
brain damage that causes Korsakoff's syndrome is usually (but not
always) a result of chronic alcohol abuse. Chapter 16 also includes a
description of another disease characterized by memory loss: Alzheimer's
disease. Similar to Korsakoff's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease involves
anterograde amnesia. Anterograde amnesia can also be caused by damage to
the temporal lobes, where the hippocampus is located. Scoville and
Milner (1957) reported that bilateral removal of the medial temporal
lobe produced a memory impairment in people that was apparently
identical to that seen in Korsakoff's syndrome. H. M., the man described
in the case that opened this chapter, received surgery in an attempt to
treat his severe epilepsy, which could not be controlled even by high
doses of anticonvulsant medication. The epilepsy appears to have been
caused by a head injury he received when he was struck by a bicycle at
age 9 (Corkin et al., 1997). The surgery successfully treated H. M.'s
seizure disorder, but it became apparent that the operation had produced
a serious memory impairment. Further investigation revealed that the
critical site of damage was the hippocampus. Once it was known that
bilateral medial temporal lobectomy (such as H. M.'s surgery) causes
anterograde amnesia, neurosurgeons stopped performing

M13_CARL0287_13_GE_C13.indd 440

this operation and are now careful to operate on only one temporal lobe.
The remainder of this chapter will investigate the role of the
hippocampus in amnesia as well as some aspects of memory that are not
impaired in anterograde amnesia.

Role of the Hippocampus LO 13.11 Compare the role of the hippocampus in
memory consolidation and retrieval. Because of his relatively pure
amnesia, H. M. was ­extensively studied. Milner and her colleagues based
the following conclusions on his pattern of deficits: 1. The hippocampus
is not the location of long-term memories; nor is it necessary for the
retrieval of long-term memories. If it were, H. M. would not have been
able to remember events from early in his life, and he would not have
known how to talk. 2. The hippocampus is not the location of short-term
memories. If it were, H. M. would not be able to carry on a
conversation, because he would not have remembered what the other person
said long enough to think of a reply. 3. The hippocampus is involved in
converting short-term memories into long-term memories. This conclusion
is based on a particular hypothesis of memory function: that our
short-term memory of an event is retained by neural activity and that
long-term memories consist of relatively permanent biochemical or
structural changes in neurons. The conclusion seems a reasonable
explanation for the fact that, when presented with new information, H.
M. seemed to understand it and remember it as long as he thought about
it, but that a permanent record of the information was never made.

As we will see, these three conclusions are too simple. Subsequent
research on patients with anterograde amnesia indicates that the facts
are more complicated---and more interesting---than they first appeared
to be. But to appreciate the significance of the findings of more recent
research, we must understand these three conclusions and remember the
facts that led to them. The idea of consolidation relates to the
original conclusions of Milner and her colleagues. If H. M.'s shortterm
memory were intact and if he could remember events from before his
operation, then the problem must have been that consolidation had not
taken place. Some of the clearest evidence that damage restricted to the
hippocampal formation produces anterograde amnesia,

including deficits in consolidation, came from a case studied by
Zola-Morgan and colleagues (1986). Patient R. B., a 52-year-old man with
a history of heart trouble, sustained a cardiac arrest. Although his
heart was successfully restarted, the period of anoxia caused by the
temporary halt in blood flow resulted in brain damage. The primary
symptom of this brain damage was permanent anterograde amnesia, which
Zola-Morgan and colleagues carefully documented. Five years after the
onset of the amnesia, R. B. died of heart failure. His family gave
permission for histological examination of his brain. The investigators
discovered that a region of the hippocampal formation called field CA1
was primarily affected and the neurons had completely degenerated. (See
Figure 13.30a.) Subsequent studies reported other patients with
anterograde amnesia caused by CA1 damage (Kartsounis et al., 1995;
Rempel-Clower et al., 1996; Victor & Agamanolis, 1990). Why is field CA1
of the hippocampus so sensitive to anoxia? The answer appears to lie in
the fact that this region is especially rich in NMDA receptors. For some
reason, metabolic disturbances of various kinds---including seizures,
anoxia, or hypoglycemia---cause glutamatergic terminal buttons to
release glutamate at abnormally high levels. The effect of this
glutamate release is to stimulate NMDA receptors, which permit the entry
of calcium. Within a few minutes, excessive amounts of intracellular
calcium begin to destroy the neurons. If animals are pretreated with
drugs that block NMDA receptors, a period of anoxia is much less likely
to produce brain damage (Rothman & Olney, 1987). CA1 neurons contain
many NMDA receptors, so long-term potentiation can quickly become
established there. This flexibility undoubtedly contributes to our
ability to learn as quickly as we do. But it also renders these neurons
particularly susceptible to damage by metabolic disturbances. In
addition to information from case studies such as R. B.'s and H. M.'s,
evidence from functional-imaging studies indicates that the hippocampal
formation plays a critical role in consolidation of relational memories
and their transfer into the cerebral cortex. Studies with laboratory
animals support this conclusion. For example, Maviel and colleagues
(2004) trained mice in a Morris water maze and later tested their memory
of the location of the platform. Just before testing the animals'
performance, the investigators temporarily deactivated specific regions
of the animals' brains with intracerebral infusions of lidocaine, a
local anesthetic. If the hippocampus was deactivated 1 day after
training, the mice showed no memory of the task. However, if the
hippocampus was deactivated 30 days after training, their performance
was normal. In contrast, inactivation of several regions of the cerebral
cortex impaired memory retrieval 30 days after training, but

M13_CARL0287_13_GE_C13.indd 441

not 1 day after training. These findings indicate that the hippocampus
is required for newly learned spatial information but not for
information learned 30 days previously. The findings also suggest that
sometime during these 30 days the cerebral cortex takes on a role in
retention of this information. Returning again to the case of H. M.,
remember that his short-term memory was intact and if he could remember
events from before his operation, then the problem must have been that
consolidation did not take place. This supports the role of the
hippocampal formation in memory consolidation---converting short-term
memories to longterm memories. As we saw, anterograde amnesia is usually
accompanied by retrograde amnesia---the inability to remember events
that occurred for a period of time before the brain damage occurred. The
following example illustrates retrieval of early memories by a patient
with a profound anterograde amnesia. RETROGRADE AMNESIA: RETRIEVAL

Patient E. P. made the following response when he was asked to describe
an incident from the period before he attended school. When I was 5
years old, we moved from Oakland to the country. I was very excited and
looked forward to the change. I remember the truck that Dad rented. It
was hardly full because we didn't have much furniture. When it was time
to leave, Mom got in the car and followed behind the truck. I rode in
the truck with Dad. (Reed & Squire, 1998, p. 3951) Patient E. P. is also
able to find his way around the neighborhood where he grew up but is
completely lost in the neighborhood to which he moved after he became
amnesic (Teng & Squire, 1999).

The fact that retrograde amnesia extends back for a limited period of
time suggests that a gradual process controlled by the hippocampal
formation transforms memories into permanent storage. Before this
transformation is complete, the hippocampal formation is required for
the retrieval of these memories. Later, retrieval of these memories can
be accomplished even if the hippocampal formation has been damaged.
Bayley and colleagues (2006) asked people with anterograde amnesia and
healthy volunteers questions about news events that had occurred during
the previous 30 years. They found a diminishing amount of retrograde
amnesia in the patients with brain injuries for earlier and earlier
events. In fact, recall of events more than 15 years old was about as
good as that of control participants. However, memory of recent events
was severely impaired. (See Figure 13.25.) A functional-imaging study by
Smith and Squire (2009) found evidence that supports the differential
role of the hippocampal formation in recent memories and older ones.
They used the test employed by Bayley and colleagues (2006) in order to
evoke the retrieval of memories of various

Figure 13.25 Retrograde Amnesia in Patients with Hippocampal Damage

Hippocampal damage appears to disrupt the gradual storage of long-term
memories. Memories older than approximately 15 years are relatively
intact even in people with retrograde amnesia, which suggests that the
storage process requires between 10 and 15 years to be completed.

ages in a group of people with normal memories. Retrieval of the
youngest memories caused the greatest activation of the hippocampus, and
retrieval of the oldest ones caused the least activation. The opposite
effect was seen in the frontal cortex. These results are consistent with
the suggestion that memories initially stored in the hippocampus are
gradually transferred to the frontal cortex. H. M.'s memory deficit is
striking and dramatic. However, when he and other patients with
anterograde amnesia were studied more carefully, it became apparent that
the amnesia did not represent a total failure in learning ability. When
patients are appropriately trained and tested, we find that they are
capable of three of the four major types of learning described earlier
in this chapter: perceptual learning, stimulus-response learning, and
motor learning.

Stimulus-Response Learning LO 13.12 Describe the stimulus-response
learning ability of patients with hippocampal damage. Investigators
succeeded in demonstrating stimulus-­ response learning by H. M. and
other individuals with amnesia. For example, Woodruff-Pak (1993) found
that H. M. and another patient with anterograde amnesia could acquire a
classically conditioned eyeblink response. H. M. even showed retention
of the task 2 years later: He acquired the response again in one-tenth
the number of trials that were needed previously. Sidman and colleagues
(1968)

successfully trained patient H. M. on an operant conditioning task---a
visual discrimination task in which money was given for correct
responses.

Motor Learning LO 13.13 Describe the motor learning ability of patients
with hippocampal damage. Several studies have demonstrated motor
learning in patients with anterograde amnesia. For example, Reber and
Squire (1998) found that participants with anterograde amnesia could
learn a sequence of button presses in a serial reaction time task. They
sat in front of a computer screen and watched an asterisk
appear---apparently randomly---in one of four locations. Their task was
to press the one of four buttons that corresponded to the location of
the asterisk. As soon as they did so, the asterisk moved to a new
location, and they pressed the corresponding button. (See Figure 13.26.)
Although experimenters did not say so, the sequence of button presses
specified by the moving asterisk was not random. For example, it might
be DBCACBDCBA, a 10item sequence that is repeated continuously. With
practice, participants become faster and faster at this task.
Researchers know their rate increases because they have learned the
sequence, because if the sequence is changed, their performance
decreases. The individuals with amnesia learned this task just as well
as healthy volunteers did. A study by Cavaco and colleagues (2004)
tested patients with amnesia on a variety of tasks modeled on real-world
activities, such as weaving, tracing figures, operating a joystick that
controlled a video display, and pouring water into small jars. Both
patients with amnesia and healthy volunteers did poorly on these tasks
at first, but their performance improved through practice. These results
indicate that patients with anterograde amnesia are capable of a variety
of tasks that require motor learning.

Learning and Memory 443

Perceptual Learning LO 13.14 Describe the perceptual learning ability of
patients with hippocampal damage. How do researchers determine if
patients with amnesia can retain perceptual learning abilities?
Researchers use tasks such as the one in Figure 13.27, which shows two
sample items from a test of the ability to recognize broken drawings;
note how the drawings are successively more complete. Participants are
first shown the least complete set (set I) of each of 20 different
drawings. If they do not recognize a figure (and most people do not
recognize set I), they are shown more complete sets until they identify
it. One hour later, the participants are tested again for retention,
starting with set I. When H. M. was given this test and was retested an
hour later, he showed considerable improvement (Milner, 1970). When he
was retested 4 months later, he still showed this improvement. His
performance was not as good as that of healthy volunteers, but he showed
unmistakable evidence of long-term retention. Individuals with
anterograde amnesia retained perceptual learning and memory in all of
their senses. For example, Johnson and colleagues (1985) found that
patients with anterograde amnesia could learn to recognize a variety of
stimuli, including different faces. The researchers played unfamiliar
melodies from Korean songs to amnesic

patients and found that when they were tested later, the patients
preferred these melodies to ones they had not heard before. The
experimenters also presented photographs of two men along with stories
of their lives: One man was said to be dishonest, mean, and vicious; the
other was said to be nice enough to invite home to dinner. (Half of the
patients heard that one of the men was the bad one, and the other half
heard that the other man was.) Twenty days later, the patients with
amnesia said they liked the picture of the "nice" man better than that
of the "nasty" one.

Relational Learning LO 13.15 Describe the role of the hippocampus in
relational learning. If patients with amnesia can learn tasks like
these, you might ask, why do we say they have amnesia? The answer is
this: Although the patients can learn to perform these tasks, they do
not remember anything about having learned them. They do not remember
the experimenters, the room in which the training took place, the
apparatus that was used, or any events that occurred during the
training. Although H. M. learned to recognize the broken drawings, he
denied that he had ever seen them before. Although the patients with
amnesia in the study by Johnson and colleagues liked some of the Korean
melodies better, they did not recognize that they had heard them before,
nor did they remember having seen the pictures of the two men. Although
H. M. successfully acquired a classically conditioned eyeblink response,
he did not remember the experimenter, the apparatus, or the headband he
wore that held the device that delivered a puff of air to his eye.

The distinction between what people with anterograde amnesia can and
cannot learn is important because it reflects the basic organization of
the learning process. There are at least two major categories of
memories. As you read in the beginning of this chapter, people have
conscious awareness of declarative memories that include details that
can be spoken about or described. People cannot describe their
nondeclarative memories, which can include some stimulus-response and
motor memories. In the experiment by Sidman and colleagues (1968),
although H. M. learned to make the correct response (press a panel with
a picture of a circle on it), he was unable to recall having done so. In
fact, once H. M. had learned the task, the experimenters interrupted
him, had him count (to distract him for a little while), and then asked
him to say what he was supposed to do. He seemed puzzled by the
question; he had absolutely no idea. But when they turned on the stimuli
again, he immediately made the correct response. Although the patients
with amnesia in Reber and Squire's study (1998) learned the sequence of
button

444 Chapter 13 presses, they too had no declarative memory of the
experience; in fact, they thought that the movement of the asterisk was
random. Patient E. P. (who you read about earlier in this chapter)
developed anterograde amnesia when he was stricken with a case of viral
encephalitis that destroyed much of his medial temporal lobe. Bayley and
colleagues (2005) taught E. P. to point to a particular member of each
of a series of eight pairs of objects. He eventually learned to do so,
but he had no declarative memory of which objects were correct. When
asked why he chose a particular object, he said, "It just seems that's
the one. It's here (pointing to head) somehow or another and the hand
goes for it. . . . I can't say memory. I just feel this is the one. . .
. It's just jumping out at me. 'I'm the one. I'm the one.'" (Bayley et
al., 2005, p. 551). E. P. learned a nondeclarative stimulus-response
task without at the same time acquiring any declarative memories about
what he had learned. SPATIAL MEMORY The discovery that hippocampal
lesions produced deficits in spatial memory in humans stimulated
interest in the exact role that this structure plays in the learning
process. To pursue this interest, researchers have studied individuals
with hippocampal damage and developed tasks that require relational
learning. Laboratory animals with hippocampal lesions show memory
deficits on such tasks, just as humans do.

Research with Humans You read that patient H. M. was unable to find his
way around his environment after moving from his pre-amnesia home.
Although spatial information need not be declared (we can demonstrate
our topographical memories by successfully getting from place to place),
people with anterograde amnesia are unable to consolidate information
about the location of rooms, corridors, buildings, roads, and other
important items in their environment. Bilateral medial temporal lobe
lesions produce the most profound impairment in spatial memory, but
significant deficits can be produced by damage that is limited to the
right hemisphere. For example, Luzzi and colleagues (2000) reported the
case of a man with a lesion of the right parahippocampal gyrus who lost
his ability to find his way around a new environment. The only way he
could find his room was by counting doorways from the end of the hall or
by seeing a red napkin that was located on top of his bedside table.
Functional-imaging studies have shown that the right hippocampal
formation becomes active when a person is remembering or performing a
navigational task. For example, Maguire and colleagues (1997) had London
taxi drivers describe the routes they would take in driving from one
location to another. Functional imaging that was performed during their
description of the route showed activation of the right hippocampal
formation. London taxi drivers

M13_CARL0287_13_GE_C13.indd 444

undergo extensive training to learn how to navigate efficiently in that
city; in fact, this training takes about 2 years, and the drivers
receive their license only after passing a rigorous set of tests. We
would expect that this topographical learning would produce some changes
in various parts of their brains, including their hippocampal formation.
In fact, Maguire and colleagues (2000) found that the volume of the
posterior hippocampus of London taxi drivers was larger than that of
control participants. Furthermore, the longer an individual taxi driver
had spent in this occupation, the larger was the volume of the right
posterior hippocampus. In a follow-up study, Maguire and colleagues
(2006) used a virtual-reality driving simulator to assess the
navigational ability of patient T. T., who had sustained bilateral
hippocampal damage due to encephalitis later in life. Prior to his
illness, he had been a London cab driver for nearly 40 years. Despite
hippocampal damage, T. T. was able to navigate main city streets using
memory that had been consolidated decades before his hippocampal damage
occurred. His ability to navigate side streets and non-main routes,
however, was impaired. The researchers concluded that the hippocampus is
required for more detailed levels of spatial navigation (Maguire et al.,
2006). As we will see later in this chapter, the dorsal hippocampus of
rats (which corresponds to the posterior hippocampus of humans) contains
place cells---neurons that are directly involved in navigation in space.
You will read more about place cells in animal models later in this
module. Iaria and colleagues (2003) trained participants to navigate
through a computerized virtual-reality maze that permitted them to learn
the maze either through distant spatial cues or through a series of
turns. About half of the participants spontaneously used spatial cues,
and the other half spontaneously learned to make a sequence of specific
turns at specific locations. Functional imaging showed that the
hippocampus was activated in participants who followed the spatial
strategy and the caudate nucleus was activated in participants who
followed the response strategy. In addition, a structural MRI study by
Bohbot and colleagues (2007) found that people who tended to follow a
spatial strategy in a virtual maze had a larger-than-average
hippocampus, and people who tended to follow a response strategy had a
larger-thanaverage caudate nucleus. (You will recall that the caudate
nucleus, part of the basal ganglia, plays a role in stimulusresponse
learning.) Figure 13.28 shows the relationship between performance on
test trials that could be performed only by using a response strategy.
As you can see, the larger a person's caudate nucleus is (and the
smaller a person's hippocampus is), the fewer errors that person made.

spatial locations. For example, Luzzi et al (2002) described the case of
a man with hippocampal damage who could not navigate new environments
and counted doorways to find his way. Laboratory animals show similar
problems in navigation in the Morris water maze. Many different types of
studies have confirmed the importance of the hippocampus in spatial
learning. For example, Gagliardo and colleagues (1999) found that
hippocampal lesions disrupted navigation in homing pigeons. The lesions
did not disrupt the birds' ability to use the position of the sun at a
particular time of day as a compass pointing toward their home roost.
Instead, the lesions disrupted their ability to keep track of where they
were when they got near the end of their flight---at a time when the
birds begin to use familiar landmarks to determine where they are. In a
review of the literature, Sherry and colleagues (1992) reported that the
hippocampal formation of species of birds and rodents that normally
store seeds in hidden caches and later retrieve them (and that have
excellent memories for spatial locations) is larger than that of animals
without this ability. In fact, Roth and Pravosudov (2009) found that
individual caching birds that needed to store more seeds to survive the
winter in harsher environments had correspondingly larger hippocampal
regions. O'Keefe and Dostrovsky (1971) initially recorded the activity
of individual pyramidal cells in the hippocampus as an animal moved
around the environment. The experimenters found that some neurons fired
at a high rate only when the rat was in a particular location. Different
neurons had different spatial receptive fields; that is, they responded
when the animals were in different locations. A particular neuron might
fire 20 times per second when the animal was in a particular location
but only a few times per hour when the animal was located elsewhere. The
fact that neurons in the hippocampal formation have spatial receptive
fields does not mean that each neuron encodes a particular location.

is undoubtedly represented by particular patterns of activity in
circuits of large numbers of neurons within the hippocampal formation.
In rodents most hippocampal place cells are found in the dorsal
hippocampus, which corresponds to the posterior hippocampus in humans
(Best et al., 2001). The hippocampus appears to receive its spatial
information from the parietal lobes by means of the entorhinal cortex.
Sato and colleagues (2006) found that neurons in the medial parietal
cortex of monkeys showed activity associated with specific movements at
specific locations as the animals navigated a virtual environment with a
joystick. (Yes, monkeys, too, can learn to play computer games.) When
the investigators suppressed activity in the parietal cortex by infusing
muscimol (a GABA A receptor agonist), the animals became lost. Quirk and
colleagues (1992) found that neurons in the entorhinal cortex have
spatial receptive fields, although these fields are not nearly as
clear-cut as those of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Damage to the
entorhinal cortex disrupts the spatial receptive fields of place cells
in the hippocampus and impairs the animals' ability to navigate in
spatial tasks (Miller & Best, 1980). Since the discovery of place cells,
researchers have found that the hippocampal region also contains grid
cells, head direction cells, and border cells, all found in the
entorhinal cortex. Grid cells show an evenly spaced, ­crystal-like
coverage of the entire environment in which the animal is located
(Derdikman & Moser, 2010). Border cells fire when the animal is near one
or more boundaries of the environment, such as the walls of a box. Head
direction cells simply fire when the animal's head is facing a
particular direction with respect to the distant cues in a particular
environment. As the animal turns, different cells will fire according to
the direction in which the animal is looking. These cells do not reflect
the animal's location in the environment, only the direction of its
head. The information provided by all of these cells reflects the
animal's location and head direction, and this information

09/11/2021 11:16

446 Chapter 13 is available to other regions of the brain. In fact, the
information is available to investigators who implant multiarray
microelectrodes in an animal's brain. Once a computer has correlated the
activity of these cells with an animal's location as it explores an
environment, it can use the activity of the neurons to draw a plot
showing the animal's movements. The activity of circuits of hippocampal
place cells provides information about more than space. Wood and
colleagues (2000) trained rats on a spatial alternation task in a
T-maze. The task required the rats to enter the left and the right arms
on alternate trials; when they did so, they received a piece of food in
goal boxes located at the ends of the arms of the T. Corridors
connecting the goal boxes led back to the stem of the T-maze, where the
next trial began. (See Figure 13.29.) Wood and colleagues recorded from
neurons in CA1 of the hippocampus using multielectrode implants and, as
expected, found that different cells fired when the rat was in different
parts of the maze. However, two-thirds of the neurons fired
differentially in the stem of the T on left-turn and right-turn trials.
In other words, the cells not only encoded the rat's location in the
maze but also signaled whether the rat was going to turn right or turn
left after it got to the choice point. The activity of CA1 neurons
encodes both the current location and the intended destination.

to turn right and turn left at the end of the stem of the T-maze on

trials during which the animals turned left or right. Source: Adapted

respond when the animal is in a particular location, which implies that
the hippocampus contains neural networks that keep track of the
relationships among stimuli in the environment that define the animal's
location. Neurons in the hippocampal formation reflect where an animal
"thinks" it is. Topographical information reaches field CA1 of the
hippocampus from the parietal lobe by means of the entorhinal cortex.
Place cells encode more than space; they can include information about
the response that the animal will perform next. Besides place cells, the
hippocampal region also contains

Long-Term Potentiation In this final module, we will investigate the
synaptic changes that underlie simple forms of learning. Long-term
potentiation involves the glutamatergic NMDA and AMPA receptors, as well
as pre- and postsynaptic changes in the synapses of hippocampal cells
(and cells in other regions as well). Recent years have seen an
explosion of research on this topic, largely stimulated by the
development of methods that permit researchers to observe structural and
biochemical changes in microscopically small structures: the presynaptic
and postsynaptic components of synapses.

Induction of Long-Term Potentiation LO 13.16 Identify the events
required for LTP to occur. Electrical stimulation of circuits within the
hippocampal formation can lead to long-term synaptic changes that seem
to be among those responsible for learning. Lømo (1966) discovered that
intense electrical stimulation of axons leading from the entorhinal
cortex to the dentate gyrus increased (or strengthened) the magnitude of
excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the postsynaptic neurons; this
increase has come to be called long-term potentiation (LTP) (Bliss &
Lømo, 1973). (The word potentiate means "to strengthen, to make more
potent.") The primary input to the hippocampal formation comes from the
entorhinal cortex. The axons of neurons in the entorhinal cortex pass
through the perforant path and form synapses with the granule cells of
the dentate gyrus. To study this pathway experimentally, a stimulating
electrode is placed in the perforant path, and a recording electrode is
placed in the dentate gyrus, near the granule cells. (See Figure
13.30a.) First, let's review some anatomy. The hippocampal formation is
a specialized region of the limbic cortex located in the temporal lobe.
Because the hippocampal formation

spatial perception and memory.

is folded in one dimension and then curved in another, it has a complex,
three-dimensional shape. Therefore, it is difficult to show what it
looks like with a diagram on a two-dimensional sheet of paper.
Fortunately, the structure of the hippocampal formation is orderly, and
a slice taken anywhere perpendicular to its curving long axis contains
the same set of circuits. Figure 13.30a shows a slice of the hippocampal
formation, illustrating a typical procedure for producing longterm
potentiation. The primary input to the hippocampal formation comes from
the entorhinal cortex. The axons of neurons in the entorhinal cortex
pass through the perforant path and form synapses with the granule cells
of the dentate gyrus. A stimulating electrode is placed in the perforant
path, and a recording electrode is placed in the dentate gyrus, near the
granule cells. First, a single pulse of electrical stimulation is
delivered to the perforant path, and then the resulting population EPSP
is recorded in the dentate gyrus. The population EPSP is an
extracellular measurement of the EPSPs produced by the synapses of the
perforant path axons with the dentate granule cells. The size of the
first population EPSP indicates the strength of the synaptic connections
before long-term potentiation has taken place. Long-term potentiation
can be induced by stimulating the axons in the perforant path with a
burst of approximately 100 pulses of electrical stimulation, delivered
within a few seconds. Evidence that long-term potentiation has occurred
is obtained by then periodically delivering single pulses to the
perforant path and recording the response in the dentate gyrus. If the
response is greater than it was before the burst of pulses was
delivered, long-term potentiation has occurred. (See Figure 13.30b.) A
series of pulses delivered at a high rate all in one burst (i.e., 100 Hz
stimulation) will produce LTP, but the same number of pulses given at a
slow rate will not. A rapid rate of stimulatin causes the EPSPs to
summate, because

each successive EPSP occurs before the previous one has dissipated. This
means that rapid stimulation depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane much
more than slow stimulation does. (See Figure 13.31.)

Role of NMDA Receptors LO 13.17 Compare the relationship between NMDA
and AMPA receptors in LTP. Several experiments have shown that synaptic
strengthening occurs when molecules of the neurotransmitter bind with
postsynaptic receptors located in a dendritic spine that is already
depolarized. Kelso and colleagues (1986) found that if they used a
microelectrode to artificially depolarize a neuron in field CA1 and then
stimulated the axons that formed synapses with this neuron, the synapses
became stronger. However, if the stimulation of the synapses

M13_CARL0287_13_GE_C13.indd 448

and the depolarization of the neuron occurred at different times, no
effect was seen; therefore, the two events had to occur together. (See
Figure 13.32.) The results of these experiments indicate that LTP
requires two events: activation of synapses and depolarization of the
postsynaptic neuron. The explanation for this phenomenon, at least in
many parts of the brain, lies in the characteristics of a very special
type of glutamate receptor: the NMDA receptor. The NMDA receptor has
some unusual properties. It is found in the hippocampal formation,
especially in field CA1. It gets its name from a drug that specifically
activates it: N-methyl-d-aspartate. The NMDA receptor controls a calcium
ion channel. This channel is normally blocked by a magnesium ion (Mg2+),
which prevents calcium ions from entering the cell even when the
receptor is stimulated by glutamate. But if the postsynaptic membrane is
depolarized, the Mg2+ is ejected from the ion channel, and

the channel is free to admit Ca2+ ions. Calcium ions enter the cells
through the channels controlled by NMDA receptors only when glutamate is
present and when the postsynaptic membrane is depolarized. This means
that the ion channel controlled by the NMDA receptor is a
neurotransmitter- and voltage-dependent ion channel. (See Figures 13.12
and 13.33.) Cell biologists have discovered that the calcium ion is used
by many cells as a second messenger that activates various enzymes and
triggers biochemical processes. The entry of calcium ions through the
ion channels controlled by NMDA receptors is an essential step in
long-term potentiation

(Lynch et al., 1984). AP5 (2-amino-5-­phosphonopentanoate), a drug that
blocks NMDA receptors, prevents calcium ions from entering the dendritic
spines and blocks the establishment of LTP (Brown et al., 1989). These
results indicate that the activation of NMDA receptors is necessary for
the first step in the process of events that establishes LTP: the entry
of calcium ions into dendritic spines.

450 Chapter 13 In Chapter 2 you learned that only axons are capable of
producing action potentials. Actually, they can also occur in dendrites
of some types of pyramidal cells, including those in field CA1 of the
hippocampal formation. The threshold of excitation for dendritic spikes
(as these action potentials are called) is rather high. As far as we
know, they occur only when an action potential is triggered in the axon
of the pyramidal cell. The backwash of depolarization across the cell
body triggers a dendritic spike, which is propagated up the trunk of the
dendrite. This means that whenever the axon of a pyramidal cell fires,
all of its dendritic spines become depolarized for a brief time. If
dendritic spikes are blocked by the administration of a toxin
(tetrodotoxin), LTP does not occur (Magee & Johnston, 1997). If weak
synapses are active by themselves, nothing happens because the membrane
of the dendritic spine does not depolarize sufficiently for the calcium
channels controlled by the NMDA receptors to open. (Remember that, for
these channels to open, the postsynaptic membrane must first depolarize
and displace the magnesium ions that normally block them.) However, if
the activity of strong synapses located elsewhere on the postsynaptic
cell has caused the cell to fire, then a dendritic spike will depolarize
the postsynaptic membrane enough to eject the magnesium ions from the
calcium channels of the NMDA receptors in the

dendritic spines. If some weak synapses become active right then,
calcium will enter the dendritic spines and cause the synapses to become
strengthened. The special properties of NMDA receptors allow LTP to
occur. (See Figure 13.34.)

Role of AMPA Receptors LO 13.18 Describe how AMPA receptors contribute
to LTP. What is responsible for the increases in synaptic strength that
occur during long-term potentiation? Dendritic spines on CA1 pyramidal
cells contain two types of glutamate receptors: NMDA receptors and AMPA
receptors. Research indicates that strengthening of an individual
synapse is accomplished by insertion of additional AMPA receptors into
the postsynaptic membrane of the dendritic spine (Shi et al., 1999).
AMPA receptors control sodium channels. When AMPA receptors are
activated by glutamate, they produce EPSPs in the membrane of the
dendritic spine. Therefore, with more AMPA receptors present, the
release of glutamate by the presynaptic terminal button causes a larger
excitatory postsynaptic potential. In other words, the synapse becomes
stronger. Where do these new AMPA receptors come from? Makino and
Malinow (2009) used a two-photon laser scanning microscope to watch the
movement of AMPA receptors in dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in
hippocampal slices. They found that the establishment of

Figure 13.34 Associative Long-Term Potentiation If the activity of
strong synapses is sufficient to trigger an action potential in the
neuron, the dendritic spike will depolarize the membrane of dendritic
spines, priming NMDA receptors so that any weak synapses active at that
time will become strengthened. Action potential reaches terminal button

LTP first caused movement of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic
membranes of dendritic spines from adjacent nonsynaptic regions of the
dendrites. Several minutes later, AMPA receptors were carried from the
interior of the cell to the dendritic shaft, where they replaced the
AMPA receptors that had been inserted in the postsynaptic membrane of
the spines. (See Figure 13.35.) How does the entry of calcium ions into
the dendritic spine cause AMPA receptors to move into the postsynaptic
membrane? This process appears to begin with the

activation of several enzymes, including CAM-KII (type II
calcium-calmodulin kinase), an enzyme found in dendritic spines. CAM-KII
is a calcium-dependent enzyme, which is inactive until a calcium ion
binds with it and activates it. Many studies have shown that CAM-KII
plays a critical role in long-term potentiation. For example, Silva and
colleagues (1992) found that LTP could not be established in mouse
hippocampal tissue with a targeted mutation that prevented the
production of CAM-KII. Shen and Meyer (1999) found that after LTP was
established in hippocampal neurons, CAM-KII molecules accumulated in the
postsynaptic densities of dendritic spines. Lledo and colleagues (1995)
found that injection of activated CAM-KII directly into CA1 pyramidal
cells strengthened synaptic transmission in those cells.

Two other changes that accompany LTP are alteration of synaptic
structure and production of new proteins.

Entry of Ca ions activates enzymes, initiates LTP

(a) 

POSTSYNAPTIC CHANGES Many studies have found that the establishment of
LTP also includes changes in the size and shape of dendritic spines. For
example, Bourne and Harris (2007) suggest that LTP causes the
enlargement of thin spines into fatter, mushroom-shaped spines. Nägerl
and colleagues (2007) found that the establishment of LTP even causes
the growth of new dendritic spines. After about 15 to 19 hours, the new
spines formed synaptic connections with terminals of nearby axons. (See
Figure 13.36.)

Researchers believe that LTP may also involve presynaptic changes in
existing synapses, such as an increase in the amount of glutamate that
is released by the terminal button. After all, alterations in synapses
presumably require coordinated changes in both presynaptic and
postsynaptic elements. But how could a process that begins
postsynaptically, in the dendritic spines, cause presynaptic changes? A
possible answer comes from the discovery that a gas neurotransmitter,
nitric oxide, can communicate retrograde messages from one cell to
another. As we saw in Chapter 4, nitric oxide (NO) is a soluble gas
produced from the amino acid arginine by the activity of an enzyme known
as nitric oxide synthase. Once produced, NO lasts only a short time
before it is destroyed. If NO were produced in dendritic spines in the
hippocampal formation, it could diffuse only as far as the nearby
terminal buttons, where it might produce changes related to the
induction of LTP. Several experiments suggest that NO is important in
the formation of LTP. Endoh and colleagues (1994) found that a
calcium-activated NO synthase is found in several regions of the brain,
including the dentate gyrus and fields CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus.
Although there is good evidence that NO is one of

the signals the dendritic spine uses to communicate with the terminal
button, most investigators believe that postsynaptic changes play a more
important role in the establishment of LTP. There must be other signals
as well. For several years after its discovery, researchers believed
that LTP involved a single process. Since then it has become clear that
LTP consists of several stages. Early LTP (E-LTP) involves the process
we have been describing so far: membrane depolarization, release of
glutamate, activation of NMDA receptors, entry of calcium ions,
activation of enzymes such as CAM-KII, and movement of AMPA receptors
into the postsynaptic membrane. Long-lasting LTP---that is, LTP that
lasts more than a few hours---requires protein synthesis. Frey and
colleagues (1988) found that drugs that block protein synthesis also
prevent the establishment of L-LTP in field CA1. If the drug was
administered before, during, or immediately after a prolonged burst of
stimulation was delivered, E-LTP occurred, but it disappeared a few
hours later. However, if the drug was administered one hour after the
synapses had been stimulated, the LTP persisted. Apparently, the protein
synthesis is not necessary for the establishment of E-LTP, but it is
required for establishing the later phase of long-lasting LTP, which
normally occurs within an hour of the establishment of E-LTP. What
protein (or proteins) might be required for the establishment of L-LTP?
For several years, investigators have realized that a special enzyme,
PKMz, plays a role in this process. (That strange symbol is a lower-case
Greek letter zeta. It is printed here so that you can recognize it if
you come across journal articles that use it, but we will call the
enzyme PKMzeta from now on.) Research has begun to clarify the exact
nature of this role. Take a deep breath---this is a rather long story.
Each step is not very complicated, but there are many of them (Yao et
al., 2008; Migues et al., 2010; Sacktor, 2010; Westmark, 2011). The gene
responsible for the production of PKM-zeta is constantly active,
transcribing the DNA of the gene into messenger RNA, which is
transported to the

PROTEIN SYNTHESIS

vicinity of the dendritic spines. An enzyme called Pin1 inhibits
translation of PKM-zeta mRNA into the PKM-zeta protein. Because
messenger RNA has only a limited life, only a limited amount of this
mRNA accumulates. (See Figure 13.37a.) Now, let's suppose that the
conditions for LTP are met: The dendritic spine is depolarized, and
glutamate is released by the terminal button. The NMDA receptors open
and calcium ions enter the dendritic spine. As we just saw, the entry of
calcium ions activates several enzymes, including CAM-KII. The activated
enzymes bind with Pin1 and deactivate it, which permits the synthesis of
PKM-zeta to take place. PKM-zeta, acting on a trafficking protein called
NSF, moves AMPA receptors laterally from the dendritic shaft into the
postsynaptic membrane of the dendritic spine. The addition of AMPA
receptors produces the first stage, E-LTP. (See Figure 13.37b.) PKM-zeta
has several effects besides stimulating the transport of AMPA receptors
into the postsynaptic membrane. It also starts a positive feedback loop.
It binds with Pin1 and deactivates it, which guarantees that its own
synthesis will continue. CAM-KII and the other enzymes, which initially
deactivated Pin1 and enabled the process of E-LTP to take place, are no
longer needed. The self-sustaining synthesis of PKM-zeta makes long-term
LTP possible. (See Figure 13.33c.) To recap: E-LTP involves (1) entry of
calcium ions, (2) activation of CAM-KII and other calcium-activated
enzymes, (3) deactivation of Pin1, (4) synthesis of PKM-zeta from its
mRNA, (5) with the cooperation of NSF, movement of AMPA receptors into
the postsynaptic membrane. Conversion of E-LTP to L-LTP takes place
through another effect of PKM-zeta: continued suppression of Pin1,
permitting synthesis of new PKM-zeta molecules as the old ones
eventually break apart. Remember, the gene for PKM-zeta is always
active, pumping out mRNA in the nucleus of the cell. (Have another look
at Figure 13.37.) Why have we spent so much space talking about the role
of PKM-zeta? For many years, neuroscientists have tried to understand
what mechanisms in our brain make it possible for our memories of
long-lived animals such as ourselves to last so long---up to many
decades. It is now

clear that L-LTP is the basis for some very important forms of memory,
which means that we must understand what makes L-LTP last for so long.
PKM-zeta is both necessary and sufficient for L-LTP. Infusion of
PKM-zeta into CA1 pyramidal cells produces LTP even without stimulation
of NMDA receptors or the entry of calcium ions, and infusion of ZIP, a
drug that blocks PKM-zeta, abolishes both L-LTP and some (but not all)
forms of long-term memories in many parts of the brain (Sacktor, 2011).
Low-frequency stimulation of the synaptic inputs to a cell can decrease
rather than increase their strength. This phenomenon, known as long-term
depression (LTD), also plays a role in learning. Apparently, neural
circuits that contain memories are established by strengthening some
synapses and weakening others. Dudek and Bear (1992) stimulated Schaffer
collateral inputs to CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices with 900 pulses
of electrical current, delivered at rates ranging from 1 to 50 Hz. They
found that frequencies above 10 Hz caused long-term potentiation,
whereas those below 10 Hz caused long-term depression. Both of these
effects were blocked by application of AP5, the NMDA receptor blocker.
This means that both effects require the activation of NMDA receptors.
(See Figure 13.38.) Several studies have demonstrated associative
longterm depression, which is produced when synaptic inputs are
activated at the same time that the postsynaptic membrane is either
weakly depolarized or hyperpolarized (Debanne, Gähwiler, & Thompson,
1994; Thiels et al., 1996). As we have seen, the most commonly studied
form of longterm potentiation involves an increase in the number of AMPA
receptors in the postsynaptic membrane of dendritic

spines. Long-term depression appears to involve the opposite: a decrease
in the number of AMPA receptors in these spines (Carroll et al., 1999).
And just as AMPA receptors are inserted into dendritic spines during
LTP, they are removed from the spines in vesicles during LTD (Lüscher et
al., 1999). In field CA1, long-term depression, like long-term
potentiation, involves the activation of NMDA receptors, and its
establishment is disrupted by AP5. How can activation of the same
receptor produce opposite effects? An answer was suggested by Lisman
(1989), who noted that sustained, low-frequency stimulation of synapses

454 Chapter 13 in this region that produces LTD would cause a modest but
prolonged increase in intracellular Ca2+, whereas the intense,
high-frequency stimulation that produces LTP would cause a much greater
increase in Ca2+. Perhaps small and large increases in intracellular
calcium ions trigger different mechanisms. Evidence in favor of this
hypothesis was obtained by a study by Liu and colleagues (2004). NMDA
receptors come in at least two forms. One form contains one type of
subunit, and the other contains a different type of subunit. Liu and his
colleagues found that LTP was prevented by a drug that blocked one type
of NMDA receptor and that LTD was prevented by a drug that blocked the
other type of NMDA receptor. Receptors that produce LTP permit an influx
of large amounts of Ca2+ if they are stimulated repeatedly in a short
amount of time. In contrast, receptors that produce LTD permit less
calcium to enter the cell, but if they are stimulated slowly over a long
period of time, they permit the buildup of a modest but prolonged
increase in intracellular calcium.

OTHER FORMS OF LONG-TERM POTENTIATION

Long-term potentiation was discovered in the hippocampal formation and
has been studied more in this region than in others, but it also occurs
in many other regions of the brain. In some but not all of these
regions, LTP is initiated by stimulation of NMDA receptors. For example,
in the hippocampal formation, NMDA receptors are present in highest
concentrations in field CA1 and in the dentate gyrus. However, very few
NMDA receptors are found in the region of field CA3 that receives mossy
fiber input from the dentate gyrus (Monaghan & Cotman, 1985).
High-frequency stimulation of the mossy fibers produces LTP that
gradually decays over a period of several hours (Staubli, Larson, &
Lynch, 1990). AP5, the drug that blocks NMDA receptors and prevents the
establishment of LTP in CA1 neurons, has no effect on LTP in field CA3.
In addition, long-term potentiation in field CA3 appears to involve only
presynaptic changes; no alterations are seen in the structure of
dendritic spines after LTP has taken place (Reid et al., 2004).

Role of AMPA Receptors

LO 13.16 Identify the events required for LTP

LO 13.18 Describe how AMPA receptors contribute

to occur. A circuit of neurons passes from the entorhinal cortex through
the hippocampal formation. High-frequency stimulation of the axons in
this circuit strengthens synapses; it leads to an increase in the size
of the EPSPs in the dendritic spines of the postsynaptic neurons. The
only requirement for LTP is that the postsynaptic membrane be
depolarized at the same time that the synapses are active. The perforant
pathway must be depolarized either by exposure to stimuli in the
environment or by delivery of a burst of pulses.

Role of NMDA Receptors LO 13.17 Compare the relationship between NMDA
and AMPA receptors in LTP. NMDA and AMPA receptors are present on the
postsynaptic membrane and are required to establish LTP. NMDA and AMPA
receptors are both ionotropic receptors that respond to glutamate and
are found in the hippocampus. NMDA receptors are blocked by an ion of
magnesium at rest, and require depolarization to remove the Mg2+ ion.
AMPA receptors contribute this local depolarization to facilitate
removal of the Mg 2+ ion. Once open, NMDA receptors allow Ca2+ ions to
enter the cell, triggering intracellular events responsible for LTP and
the recruitment of additional AMPA receptors to the terminal membrane.

M13_CARL0287_13_GE_C13.indd 454

to LTP. AMPA receptors are ionotropic receptors present on the
postsynaptic membrane and help to depolarize the cell by controlling a
sodium ion channel. AMPA receptors are also required for LTP. When
glutamate binds to the AMPA receptor, the resulting depolarization
removes the Mg2+ ion from the NMDA receptors, allowing Ca2+ to enter the
cell. A result of calcium signaling is the insertion of additional AMPA
receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, strengthening the depolarization
of the membrane. This enhanced depolarization is responsible for
strengthening the synapses involved in LTP.

Role of Synaptic Changes LO 13.19 List the synaptic changes that
accompany LTP. LTP may involve presynaptic changes in existing synapses,
such as an increase in the amount of glutamate that is released by the
terminal button. Presynaptic changes may be signaled from the
postsynaptic cell via retrograde messengers. The establishment of LTP
includes changes in the size and shape of postsynaptic dendritic spines
into fatter, mushroom-shaped spines. Establishing LTP can cause the
growth of new dendritic spines. Long-­lasting LTP requires protein
synthesis. The gene that codes for the production of the enzyme PKM-zeta
is constantly produced in the nucleus and transported to dendritic
spines, where its translation is blocked by the action of another
enzyme, Pin1.

Learning and Memory 455

Thought Question Have you heard of clicker training? It's a form of
training that pairs a unique sound (a "click" from a small noise maker)
with a treat or other positive reinforcer and is used to train animals.
After several pairings with food,

eventually the "click" itself becomes reinforcing, and it can be used to
reinforce the behavior that precedes the click. Explain what has
happened in the hippocampus of the animal to induce LTP in the circuits
associating the reinforcer with a behavior. Describe the steps of LTP
and explain how the brain is changed in this form of learning.

Vladimir Ulyanov, who was best known as Lenin, was one of the most
active leaders of the October Revolution in Russia in 1917, and the
first head of Soviet state until his death at the age of just 53. When
he was 52, he had several transient strokes which ­resulted in sensory as
well as motor deficits in the right side of his body and affected his
ability to speak. Professor Kramer, his neurologist, wrote that Lenin
"tried to say something but only emitted incomprehensive sounds" and
"appeared to be completely conscious but was suffering from complete
motor aphasia," meaning his expressive oral language abilities were
highly impaired. Some reports describe that at that time Lenin was
answering all questions or requests by saying "vot-vot," which could be
translated as "well, well, well," regardless of the context. Mrs
Krupskaya, Lenin's wife, introduced daily exercises for him,

The case of R. F. illustrates several intriguing aspects of language
processing in the brain. Her ability to perceive words and their
spelling, but not sound out words or recognize them as specific words,
reveals that different pathways and brain structures are responsible for
the various components of speech production and comprehension, including
reading and writing. Language and communication are important aspects of
human social behavior. Our cultural evolution has been possible because
we can communicate with others to share and record ideas. Language
enables our discoveries to be cumulative. Knowledge gained by one
generation can be passed on to the next. The basic function of language
is seen in its effects on other people. When we communicate with
someone, we almost always expect our message to induce the person to
engage in some sort of behavior. Sometimes, the

cards with the letters of the alphabet. Sometime later, his condition
improved and he was able to pronounce some words such as "revolution,"
"people," and "congress." As the letter cards exercises were successful,
it indicated that his understanding of words was somewhat spared, and it
was mostly his oral expression that had been severely damaged. Shortly
afterwards, Lenin suffered subsequent strokes and his language
impairment progressed rendering him unable to ­understand the meanings of
words, resulting in complete aphasia that ended his career as a
politician. His condition further deteriorated due to recurrent strokes
and, eventually, he passed away a year later. Source: Teive H.A.G.,

behavior is advantageous, as when we ask for an object or for help in
performing a task. At other times we are asking for a social exchange:
some attention and perhaps some conversation. Although many people use
speech as a form of language to communicate, keep in mind that language
encompasses written, symbolic, and gestural forms of communication as
well. While many examples in this chapter come from research on speech,
research is expanding to help us better understand the brain's
involvement in different forms of communication. To begin to understand
human communication, this chapter is organized with an introduction to
the fundamental brain mechanisms of language production and
comprehension, which will allow us to better understand the subsequent
modules on disorders of language production and comprehension, and
reading and writing.

Language Production and Comprehension: Brain Mechanisms Much of our
understanding about the brain mechanisms of language comes from
observing the effects of brain injuries on people's verbal behavior. One
category of language disorders that has been studied extensively is
aphasia. Aphasia is a disturbance in the comprehension or production of
language, caused by brain damage. Not all language disturbances are
aphasias. To receive a diagnosis of aphasia, a patient must have
difficulty comprehending, repeating, or producing meaningful language,
and this difficulty must not be caused by sensory or motor deficits or
by lack of motivation. For example, the inability to speak caused by
deafness or paralysis of the speech muscles is not considered to be
aphasia. In addition, the deficit must be relatively isolated. This
means that the individual must appear to be aware of what is happening
in their environment and to recognize that others are attempting to
communicate. Two examples of specific aphasias that are discussed in
this chapter are Broca's and Wernicke's aphasias. Broca's aphasia is an
expressive aphasia resulting from damage to Broca's area in the left
frontal lobe. Individuals with Broca's aphasia have difficulty producing
language, through either verbal communication or sign languages such as
American Sign Language (ASL). Wernicke's aphasia is a receptive aphasia
caused by damage to Wernicke's area in the left temporal gyrus. (Look
ahead to Figure 14.2.) This aphasia results in speech comprehension
deficits. In individuals who primarily communicate using ASL, damage to
this area results in deficits in comprehending signs (Campbell et al.,
2007). Other information about the brain mechanisms of language comes
from studies using functional-imaging techniques to assess language
processes in healthy volunteers. In general, these studies have
confirmed or complemented what we have learned by studying patients with
brain damage.

the brain, whether people are left-handed or right-handed. In
approximately 90 percent of the total population, the left hemisphere is
dominant for speech and language functions. Using an imaging procedure
to measure changes in cerebral blood flow while people performed a
verbal task, Knecht and colleagues (2000) assessed the relationship
between handedness and lateralization of speech mechanisms in people
without any known brain damage. They found that right hemisphere speech
dominance was seen in only 4 percent of right-handed people, in 15
percent of ambidextrous people, and in 27 percent of left-handed people.
This pattern has been replicated in additional studies (Nenert et al.,
2017). Using a similar verbal task in a sample of children and adults,
Szaflarski and colleagues (2006) demonstrated that language
lateralization corresponded with age, with the strongest indications of
left hemisphere lateralization occurring in early adulthood. The degree
of lateralization then appeared to decrease into older adulthood;
however, age-related declines in lateralization of language have not
been found in all studies (Nenert et al., 2017). Figure 14.1 shows
combined representations of left hemisphere activation among children
and adults during the verbal task in the study by Szaflarski and
colleagues (2006). The images in the figure are reversed, with the left
hemisphere on the right side of the image. Although the circuits that
are primarily involved in language comprehension and production are
typically located in one hemisphere (usually the left hemisphere), the
opposite hemisphere also plays a role in speech and language. When we
hear and understand words and when we talk about or think about our own
perceptions or memories, we are using neural circuits in addition to

Figure 14.1 Left Hemisphere Activation in a Verb Generation Task The
left hemisphere was selectively activated when right-handed children and
adults were asked to think of verbs that were associated with nouns they
heard during the study (for example, chair, spoon). The images in the
figure represent combined activity from all participants in the study.

LO 14.1 Contrast language-related functions of the left and right
hemispheres. The results of imaging and lesion studies have helped to
identify unique brain regions involved in language-related functions. In
the case of language, brain regions are distinguished based on function
rather than on neuroanatomical differences. Language is largely a
lateralized function. Most language disturbances occur after damage to
the left side of

those directly involved in speech. For example, damage to the right
hemisphere makes it difficult for a person to read maps, perceive
spatial relations, and recognize complex geometrical forms. People with
such damage also have trouble talking about things like maps and complex
geometrical forms or understanding what other people have to say about
them. The right hemisphere also appears to be involved in organizing a
narrative----selecting and assembling the elements of what we want to
say (Gardner et al., 1983). As we saw in Chapter 11, the right
hemisphere is involved in expressing and recognizing emotion in the tone
of voice. It is also involved in control of prosody---the rhythm and
stress found in speech. Therefore, both hemispheres of the brain
contribute to our language abilities. The importance of lateralization
is also revealed through studies of patients who have undergone a
surgical procedure known as the split-brain operation. This procedure
involves surgically severing the corpus callosum, largely isolating each
cerebral hemisphere. The split-brain surgical operation is sometimes
used to treat very severe seizure disorders, when neurons in one side of
the brain become uncontrollably overactive, and the overactivity is
transmitted to the other side of the brain by the corpus callosum. After
the split-brain operation is performed, the two disconnected hemispheres
operate independently; their sensory mechanisms, memories, and motor
systems can no longer exchange information. Something that patients may
notice after the operation is that their left hand seems to have a "mind
of its own." For example, patients may find themselves putting down a
book held in the left hand, even if they have been reading it with great
interest. This conflict occurs because the right hemisphere, which
controls the left hand, cannot read and therefore finds holding the book
boring. At other times patients may surprise

themselves by making gestures (with the left hand) when they had not
intended to. A psychologist once reported that a man with a split brain
attempted to hit his wife with one hand and protect her with the other.
You might think that disconnecting the brain hemispheres would be
devastating, but the effects of the splitbrain operation are not
immediately obvious to the casual observer. This is because in many
circumstances, stimuli are conveyed to both hemispheres simultaneously.
For example, looking directly a picture of an apple using both eyes, the
visual stimulus is conveyed through both the right and left visual
fields and the left hemisphere is able to correctly answer "apple" when
the person is asked to identify the picture. Only one hemisphere---as
you just read, in most people, the left---controls language production
and comprehension. If the information does not reach the left
hemisphere, then the person cannot communicate about it. The right
hemisphere of a person with a split brain appears able to understand
instructions reasonably well, but it is incapable of producing language;
therefore, any stimuli that reach the right hemisphere cannot be
communicated, or at least not through language. For example, if the
picture of an apple is shown only to the left visual field and conveyed
only to the right hemisphere, without a language-processing center in
the right hemisphere, the person cannot verbally identify the image (or
use a nonverbal sign or gesture to identify it). In fact, the person
will not even report being aware that the stimulus was seen. However, if
the person is allowed to select a matching item from a list or draw a
picture of the stimulus with their left hand, they will correctly
identify an apple. If you then ask the person why they selected or drew
the apple, they will not have a conscious reason for selecting it
(consciousness in this sense requires the use of language).

Figure 14.2 Testing the Effects of the Split-Brain Operation Experiments
with split-brain patients have helped to illuminate the lateralized
nature of brain function. Split-brain patients have undergone surgery to
cut the corpus callosum, the main bundle of neuronal fibres connecting
the two sides of the brain.

Input from the left field of view is processed by the right hemisphere
and vice versa.

460 Chapter 14 The effects of cutting the corpus callosum reinforce the
conclusion that we become conscious of something only if information
about it is able to reach the parts of the brain responsible for
language in the left hemisphere. If the information does not reach these
parts of the brain, then that information does not reach consciousness.
We still know very little about the physiology of consciousness, but
studies of people who have undergone the splitbrain operation are
beginning to provide us with some useful insights.

Language Production and Comprehension in the Brain LO 14.2 Identify
brain regions involved in language production and comprehension. As you
read, independent, but interacting, brain regions are involved in
language production and comprehension. The following section summarizes
the roles of several key language regions in the brain. Language
production requires multiple factors. For example, being able to produce
meaningful language requires several abilities. First, the person must
have something to communicate about. Let us consider what this means. To
use speech as a form of communication, we can talk about something that
is currently happening or something that happened in the past. When we
talk about something that is happening, we are talking about our
perceptions: things we are seeing, hearing,

LANGUAGE PRODUCTION

feeling, smelling, and so on. When we talk about something that happened
in the past, we are talking about our memories. Both perceptions of
current events and memories of events that occurred in the past involve
brain mechanisms in the posterior part of the cerebral hemispheres (the
occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes). Along with some parts of the
prefrontal cortex, these regions are largely responsible for our having
something to say and our ability to tell a story about it (D'Argembeau,
2013; Levine, 2004; Mar, 2004). We can also talk about something that
did not happen and use our imagination to make up a story (or to tell a
lie). We know very little about the neural mechanisms that are
responsible for imagination, but it seems likely that they involve the
mechanisms responsible for perceptions and memories because when we make
up a story, we usually base it on knowledge that we originally acquired
through perception and have retained in our memory. Regardless of
whether we are communicating about something that happened, or something
we imagined, converting our thoughts into language requires several
important brain regions. The brain mechanisms involved in recognizing
words and comprehending their meaning work a little like a dictionary.
(See Figure 14.3.) Dictionaries contain entries (the words) and
definitions (the meanings of the words). In the brain, we have at least
two types of entries: auditory and visual. That is, we can look up a
word according to how it sounds or how it looks (in writing). Let's
consider one type of entry: The sound of

a word. When we hear a familiar word, how do we understand its meaning?
First, we must recognize the sequence of sounds that constitute the
word: We find the auditory entry for the word in our "dictionary." These
entries are stored in Wernicke's area in the auditory association cortex
of the left temporal lobe. As you have already read, Wernicke's area is
required for comprehension and production of meaningful language. It is
possible to produce speech when Wernicke's area has been damaged, but
the speech often does not make sense to the listener. Next, memories
associated with the word are activated. Wernicke's area is connected
through the posterior language area to neural circuits that contain
these memories. Language conveys more than simple words denoting objects
or actions. It also conveys abstract concepts, some of them quite
subtle. Studies of patients with brain damage (Brownell et al., 1983,
1990; Lundgren & Brownell, 2016) suggest that comprehension of the more
subtle, figurative aspects of language involves the right hemisphere in
particular---for example, understanding the meaning behind metaphors,
proverbs such as "People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw
stones," or moral stories. Functional-imaging studies confirm these
observations (Yang, 2014). Nichelli and colleagues (1995) found that
judging the moral of Aesop's fables (in contrast to judging more
superficial aspects of the stories) also activated regions of the right
hemisphere. Sotillo and colleagues (2005) found that a task that
required comprehension of metaphors such as "green lung of the city" (a
park) activated the right superior temporal cortex. (See Figure 14.4.)
Pobric and colleagues (2008) found that temporarily disrupting the right
superior temporal cortex by using TMS impaired people's ability to
understand

novel metaphors, such as a "conscience storm." The use of TMS had no
effect on the participants' ability to understand conventional
metaphors, such as "sweet voice," that they had already heard, or
literal expressions such as "snow storm."

Bilingualism LO 14.3 Compare common and language-specific brain regions
for bilingual language processing. The majority of people in the world
are bilingual or multilingual. Are the brains of people who are
bilingual different from those of people who are monolingual? What brain
structures are involved in communicating in second (or third, or fourth,
or fifth) languages? Bilingual patients with lesions sometimes display
aphasia symptoms in one language and not another, or specific deficits
affecting (for example) speech in one language and writing in another.
This led early researchers to conclude that different languages were
processed by different brain structures. Imaging techniques such as fMRI
and PET allow researchers to more closely examine the brain regions
involved in communication by bilingual (or multilingual) individuals.
The accumulation of research from these studies revealed that
communication in different languages involves some common regions and
some language-specific regions, or language specific-patterns of
activation in the brain (Xu et al., 2017). Giussani and colleagues
(2007) reviewed seven different electrostimulation studies of the cortex
in bi- and multilingual patients. The patients in each of these studies
were undergoing brain surgery, usually to remove lesions or tumors, and
microelectrodes were used to stimulate brain regions to assess their
language function prior to surgery. The patients completed tasks such as
naming objects or reading in their primary and secondary languages while
the stimulation occurred. If the patient's performance on the task was
altered or interrupted during stimulation, then a function in that
language was assigned to the brain area. This process allowed the
neurosurgeon to map the language functions of the brain, avoiding damage
to these regions as the lesion or tumor was removed. The
electrostimulation studies found both common and language-specific
regions. Common and language-specific areas were found in the frontal
and posterior temporal/parietal cortexes. In addition, language-specific
areas were found in some subcortical structures. An example of
language-specific and common language areas in a bilingual
English-French speaking patient is included in Figure 14.5. Additional
networks of cortical and subcortical brain regions are involved in the
cognitive processes required to keep different languages separate, and
use the correct language in certain situations (Calabria et al., 2018;
Cargnelutti et al., 2019).

In other research investigating the neural basis of bilingualism,
Mechelli and colleagues (2004) found that the structure of the cortex
was changed by learning a second language. The researchers assessed the
density of grey matter and found increased density in the left parietal
cortex of bilingual compared to monolingual individuals. The change in
density was greater among people who learned a second language early in
life (before the age of 5) and those who were most proficient in their
second language. Kuhl and her colleagues (2016) measured changes in the
brains of adults who learned a second language (English) in adulthood.
The researchers found that speaking experiences affected white matter in
regions associated with speech comprehension, while listening experience
affected white matter in regions associated with production. (See Figure
14.6.) These findings may seem counterintuitive, however, in children
learning their first language, listening to speech activates regions
involved in motor production, too.

a regular rhythm and cadence. A speaker can give some words stress (for
example, pronounce them louder), and vary the pitch of their voice to
indicate phrasing and to

Figure 14.6 White Matter Changes in the Bilingual Brain Diffusion tensor
imaging shows differences in white matter structure associated with
speaking (red) and listening (yellow) experience in a second language
among bilingual adults compared to monolingual adults.

Prosody LO 14.4 Identify brain structures and functions involved in
prosody. When we speak, we do not merely utter words. Speech (and other
forms of communication such as signing) has

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 462

24/11/21 1:51 PM

Human Communication 463

distinguish between assertions and questions. In addition, a speaker
shares information about their emotional state through the rhythm,
emphasis, and tone of their speech. These rhythmic, emphatic, and
melodic aspects of speech are referred to as prosody. The importance of
these aspects of communication is illustrated by our use of punctuation
symbols to indicate some elements of prosody when we write. For example,
a comma indicates a short pause; a period indicates a longer one with an
accompanying fall in the pitch of the voice; a question mark indicates a
pause and a rise in the pitch of the voice; and an exclamation mark
indicates that the words are articulated with special emphasis. The
prosody of people with Wernicke's aphasias caused by lesions to
posterior brain structures is normal. For example, their speech is
rhythmic, with pauses after phrases and sentences, and has a melodic
line. Even when the speech of a person with severe Wernicke's aphasia
makes no sense, prosody is unaffected. In contrast, the anterior lesions
that produce Broca's aphasia destroy grammar, and they also severely
disrupt prosody. In patients with Broca's aphasia, articulation is
labored and words are uttered slowly so that there is little opportunity
for the patient to demonstrate any rhythmic elements. There is little
variation in stress or pitch because prosodic variation usually goes
along with the syntactic structure of a phrase or sentence, which is
impaired in Broca's aphasia. Although prosodic disruption can occur in
aphasia, studies of healthy individuals and patients with right
hemisphere brain lesions have also shown that the right hemisphere of
the brain plays an important role in prosody. For example, Weintraub and
colleagues (1981) presented participants with two written sentences and
asked a question about them. They presented the following pair of
sentences: The man walked to the grocery store. The woman rode to the
shoe store. The participants were instructed to answer questions by
reading one of the sentences. Try this one yourself. Read the question
below and then read aloud the sentence (above) that answers it. Who
walked to the grocery store, the man or the woman? The question asserts
that someone walked to the grocery store but asks who that person was.
When answering a question like this, people normally stress the
requested item of information; in this case they say, "The man walked to
the grocery store." However, Weintraub and her colleagues found that
although patients with right hemisphere brain damage chose the correct
sentence, they either failed to stress a word or stressed the wrong one.
This indicates that the right hemisphere plays a role in production of
prosody.

you can see in Figure 14.7, the meaningful components of speech
primarily activated the left hemisphere (blue and green regions),
whereas the prosodic components primarily activated the right hemisphere
(orange and yellow regions).

Voice Recognition LO 14.5 Identify the brain regions involved in
recognizing voices. Recognizing the voice of a speaker can convey
information completely independent of the meaning of the words: the
identity of the speaker, possibly their gender or overall health, and
hints about their age. People learn at an early age to recognize the
voices of particular individuals. Even newborn infants can recognize the
voices of their parents, which they apparently learned while they were
still in their mother's uterus (Beauchemin et al., 2011; Ockleford et
al. 1988). Some people with localized brain damage have great difficulty
recognizing voices---a disorder known as phonagnosia. Most cases of
phonagnosia are caused by brain damage. Recognition of a particular
voice is independent of the recognition of words and their meanings:
Some people have lost the ability to understand words but can still
recognize voices, while others display the opposite deficits (Belin et
al., 2004). So far, all

24/11/21 1:51 PM

464 Chapter 14 cases of acquired phonagnosia (phonagnosia caused by
brain damage) show damage in the right hemisphere, usually in the
parietal lobe or the anterior superior temporal cortex.
Functional-imaging studies have implicated the right anterior superior
temporal cortex in voice recognition. For example, von Kriegstein and
colleagues (2003) found that this region was activated by a task that
required participants to recognize particular voices but not particular
words. The first recorded case of developmental phonagnosia (that is,
phonagnosia not caused by brain damage) was reported by Garrido and
colleagues (2009):

K. H., a 60-year-old management consultant, has had, all her life, great
difficulty recognizing people by their voices. K. H. read an article in
a popular scientific magazine that described prosopagnosia, the
difficulty---or even inability---to recognize people's faces. She
realized that her disorder could be an auditory form of this disorder.
Testing showed that her intelligence was above average and that she
received normal or above normal scores on a variety of perceptual tasks,
including face recognition, speech perception, recognition of
environmental sounds, and perception of music. Structural MRI showed no
evidence of brain abnormalities, but there certainly must be some subtle
differences in brain organization to account for her disability.

and production located in the left hemisphere for the majority of
people. The right hemisphere plays a role in processing emotional
content, rhythm, and stress of language.

Language Production and Comprehension in the Brain LO 14.2

Identify brain regions involved in language production and
comprehension.

The occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes are involved in perceiving
real or imaginary events and memories that an individual may communicate
about. Broca's area, in the left frontal lobe just rostral to the region
of the primary motor cortex that controls the muscles of speech, is
involved with language production. Language comprehension involves
recognizing a word using Wernicke's area in the left hemisphere.
Language comprehension also requires understanding the meanings of
words. Comprehension of the figurative aspects of language involves the
right hemisphere.

Bilingualism LO 14.3

Compare common and language-specific brain regions for bilingual
language processing.

Bilingual individuals likely possess some brain regions devoted to
specific languages as well as areas that are common to both languages
used. These brain regions can be identified using imaging techniques
such as PET and

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 464

fMRI, or by direct electrostimulation. Research in bilingual patients
revealed common and language-specific areas in the frontal and posterior
temporal/parietal cortexes. Language-specific areas were found in some
subcortical structures.

Prosody LO 14.4

Identify brain structures and functions involved in prosody.

Prosody involves changes in intonation, rhythm, and stress that add
meaning to language. Although Broca's aphasia (caused by left hemisphere
damage) produces deficits in prosody, other neural mechanisms that
control prosodic elements appear to be located in the right hemisphere.

Voice Recognition LO 14.5

Identify the brain regions involved in recognizing voices.

Voice recognition occurs early in development. Phonagnosia is a
difficulty recognizing voices and is typically caused by damage to the
right parietal or temporal cortex.

Thought Question In a survey of 717 people, Seidman and colleagues
(2013) found that when using a cell phone most righthanded people used
their right ear to converse. Similarly, most left-handed people used
their left ear. Although the survey only investigated correlational
data, what are some plausible brain-based hypotheses for this behavior
that the researchers could test next? Propose possible explanations and
research strategies to better address this topic.

Disorders of Language Production and Comprehension

Figure 14.8 Assessment of Aphasia The drawing of the kitchen story is
part of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Test.

Much of our understanding of the brain mechanisms of language has come
from the study of disorders. Language disorders affect both production
and comprehension, revealing different, but often overlapping, pathways
and structures. The following module includes a description of Broca's
and Wernicke's aphasias, as well as conduction aphasia, aphasia in
people who are deaf, and stuttering.

Disorders of Language Production: Broca's Aphasia LO 14.6 Describe the
symptoms and biological basis of Broca's aphasia. As you've already
read, damage to the frontal lobe produces Broca's aphasia, a disorder
characterized by slow, laborious, and nonfluent speech. Although they
often mispronounce words, the words patients produce are usually
meaningful. The posterior part of the cerebral hemispheres has something
to communicate, but the damage to the frontal lobe makes it difficult
for the patients to express these thoughts. People with Broca's aphasia
comprehend language better than they are able to produce it. People with
Broca's aphasia find it easier to say some types of words than others.
They have great difficulty saying small words with grammatical meaning,
such as a, the, some, in, or about. These words are called function
words, because they have important grammatical functions. People with
Broca's aphasia use almost entirely content words. Content words convey
meaning, and include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, such as
apple, house, throw, or heavy. Here is a sample of speech from a man
with Broca's aphasia, who is trying to describe the scene shown in
Figure 14.8. As you will see, his words are meaningful, but what he says
is not grammatical. The dots indicate long pauses: kid . . . . kk . . .
can . . . candy . . . cookie . . . candy . . . well I don't know but
it's writ . . . easy does it . . . slam . . . early . . . fall . . . men

That's all. Girl . . . slipping water . . . water . . . and it hurts . .
. much to do . . . Her . . . clean up . . . Dishes . . . up there . . .
I think that's doing it. (Obler & Gjerlow, 1999, p. 41) Lesions that
produce Broca's aphasia are centered in the vicinity of Broca's area.
However, damage that is

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 465

restricted to only the cortex region of Broca's area does not appear to
produce Broca's aphasia. In Broca's aphasia, the damage extends to
surrounding regions of the frontal lobe and to the underlying
subcortical white matter, which contains bundles of myelinated axons
that convey messages from one brain region to another (Damasio, 1989;
Naeser et al., 1989). In addition, there is evidence that lesions of the
basal ganglia---especially the head of the caudate nucleus---can also
produce a Broca'slike aphasia (Damasio et al., 1984). (See Figure 14.3.)
Watkins and colleagues (2002a, 2002b) studied three generations of a
family, half of whose members are affected by a severe speech and
language disorder caused by the mutation of a single gene found on
chromosome 7. The primary deficit appears to involve the ability to
perform the sequential movements necessary for speech, but the affected
people also have difficulty repeating sounds they hear and forming the
past tense of verbs. The mutation causes abnormal development of the
caudate nucleus and the left inferior frontal cortex, including Broca's
area. What do the neural circuits in and around Broca's area do?
Wernicke (1874) suggested that Broca's area contains motor memories---in
particular, memories of the sequences of muscular movements that are
needed to articulate words. Talking requires some very sophisticated
motor control mechanisms. Talking involves rapid movements of the
tongue, lips, and jaw, and these movements must be coordinated with each
other and with those of the vocal cords. Circuits of neurons somewhere
in the brain will, when properly activated, cause these sequences of
movements to be executed. Because damage to the inferior caudal left
frontal lobe (including Broca's area) disrupts the ability to articulate
words, this region is a likely candidate for the location of these
"programs." The fact that this region is directly connected to the part
of the primary motor cortex that controls the muscles used for speech
certainly supports this conclusion.

24/11/21 1:51 PM

466 Chapter 14 But the speech functions of the left frontal lobe include
more than just programming the movements used to speak. Broca's aphasia
is much more than just a deficit in pronouncing words. In general, three
major speech and language deficits are produced by lesions in and around
Broca's area: agrammatism, anomia, and articulation difficulties.
Although most patients with Broca's aphasia will have all of these
deficits to some degree, their severity can vary considerably from
person to person---presumably because their brain lesions differ in size
and location. AGRAMMATISM Agrammatism refers to a patient's difficulty
using grammatical constructions. This disorder can appear all by itself,
without any difficulty in pronouncing or retrieving words (Nadeau,
1988). As we saw, people with Broca's aphasia rarely use function words.
In addition, they rarely use grammatical markers such as -ed or
auxiliaries such as have (as in I have gone). For some reason, they do
often use -ing, perhaps because this ending converts a verb into a noun,
or because -ing in English is the most common verb ending, and therefore
might be a kind of "default" form of the verb. A study by Saffran and
colleagues (1980) illustrates this difficulty. The following quotations
are from people with agrammatism attempting to describe pictures:

Picture of a boy being hit in the head by a baseball The boy is catch .
. . the boy is hitch . . . the boy is hit the ball. (Saffran et al.,
1980, p. 229) Picture of a girl giving flowers to her teacher Girl . . .
wants to . . . flowers . . . flowers and wants to . . . . The woman . .
. wants to . . . . The girl wants to . . . the flowers and the woman.
(Saffran et al., 1980, p. 234) So far, we have described Broca's aphasia
as a disorder in language production. In ordinary conversation, people
with Broca's aphasia seem to understand everything that is said to them.
They are distressed by their inability to express their thoughts well,
and they often make gestures to supplement their missing speech. The
striking disparity between their speech and their comprehension often
leads people to assume that their comprehension is typical. But it is
not. Schwartz and colleagues (1980) showed people with Broca's aphasia
pairs of pictures in which agents and objects of the action were
reversed: a truck pulling a car and a car pulling a truck. As they
showed each pair of pictures, they read the participant a sentence, for
example, active sentences like The truck pulls the car, or passive
sentences like The car is pulled by the truck. The patients' task was to
point to the appropriate picture, indicating whether they understood the
grammatical construction of the sentence. They performed very poorly on
passive sentences like The car is pulled by the truck, where word order
does not help with interpretation.

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 466

Functional-imaging studies by Opitz and Friederici (2003, 2007) have
shown that Broca's area is activated when people are taught an
artificial grammar, which supports the conclusion that this region is
involved in learning grammatical rules. Sakai and colleagues (2002) had
experimental participants read sentences that were correct,
grammatically incorrect, or semantically incorrect (that is, did not
make sense). While the participants were judging the grammatical or
semantic correctness of the sentences, the investigators applied
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to Broca's area. The parameters
of stimulation were chosen to activate Broca's area, not to disrupt its
functioning. The investigators found that the stimulation facilitated
grammatical judgments but not semantic judgments. This provides more
evidence that Broca's area is crucially involved in processing
grammatical aspects of language. The second major language deficit seen
in Broca's aphasia is anomia. Anomia refers to a wordfinding difficulty;
because all people with aphasias omit words or use inappropriate ones,
anomia is actually a primary symptom of all forms of aphasia. The facial
expressions and frequent use of sounds such as "uh" make it clear that
patients with Broca's aphasia are searching for the correct words.

ANOMIA

ARTICULATION DIFFICULTIES The third major characteristic of Broca's
aphasia is difficulty with articulation. Patients mispronounce words,
often altering the sequence of sounds. For example, lipstick might be
pronounced "likstip." People with Broca's aphasia recognize that their
pronunciation is erroneous, and they usually try to correct it. These
three deficits are seen in various combinations in different patients,
depending on the exact location of the lesion and, to a certain extent,
on their stage of recovery. We can think of these deficits as
constituting a hierarchy. On the lowest, most elementary level is
control of the sequence of movements of the muscles of speech; damage to
this ability leads to articulation difficulties. The next higher level
is selection of the particular "programs" for individual words; damage
to this ability leads to anomia. Finally, the highest level is selection
of grammatical structure, including word order, use of function words,
and word endings; damage to this ability leads to agrammatism. We might
expect that the direct control of articulation would involve the face
area of the primary motor cortex and portions of the basal ganglia,
while the selection of words, word order, and grammatical markers would
involve Broca's area and adjacent regions of the frontal association
cortex. Some studies indicate that different categories of symptoms of
Broca's aphasia do indeed involve different brain regions. Dronkers and
her colleagues

24/11/21 1:51 PM

Human Communication 467

(Baldo et al., 2011; Dronkers, 1996) identified a critical location for
control of speech articulation: the left precentral gyrus of the insula.
The insular cortex is located on the lateral wall of the cerebral
hemisphere behind the anterior temporal lobe. Normally, this region is
hidden and can be seen only when the temporal lobe is dissected away.
(See Figure 14.9.) Dronkers discovered the apparent role of this region
by plotting the lesions of patients with and without apraxia of speech
who had strokes that damaged the same general area of the brain.
(Apraxia of speech is an impairment in the ability to program movements
of the tongue, lips, and throat that are required to produce the proper
sequence of speech sounds.) At least two functional-imaging studies
support Dronkers's conclusion. Kuriki and colleagues (1999) and Wise and
colleagues (1999) found that pronunciation of words caused activation of
the left anterior insula. However, other studies suggest that Broca's
area is also involved in articulation (Hillis et al., 2004; Nestor et
al., 2003). Stewart and colleagues (2001) used TMS to interfere with the
activity of neurons in Broca's area or the adjacent area of primary
motor cortex, which controls the muscles used for speech. The
participants reported that stimulation of the motor cortex made them
feel as though they had lost control of their facial muscles. In
contrast, stimulation of Broca's area made them feel as if they were
unable to "get the word out." Most of us have, at one time or other, had
difficulty getting a word out even though the word was one that we knew
well. This phenomenon has been called the "tip of the tongue
phenomenon," or TOT. Shafto and colleagues (2007) found that people who
often had difficulty thinking of the correct word to say but were sure
that they knew it (that is, often had a TOT experience) showed loss of
gray matter in the left insular cortex. In a study of older adults, fMRI
was used to determine brain regions involved in TOT experiences while
attempting to identify famous faces. Regions of the prefrontal cortex
and insular cortex were activated in TOT (Huijbers et al., 2017). (See
Figure 14.10.)

Disorders of Language Comprehension: Wernicke's Aphasia LO 14.7 Describe
the symptoms and biological basis of Wernicke's aphasia. Speech
comprehension begins in the auditory system, which detects and analyzes
sounds. But recognizing words is one thing; comprehending
them---understanding their meaning---is another. Recognizing a spoken
word is a complex perceptual task that relies on memories of sequences
of sounds. This task appears to be accomplished by neural circuits in
the superior temporal gyrus of the left hemisphere, a region that has
come to be known as Wernicke's area. (Refer back to Figure 14.3.)

468 Chapter 14 As you read, the primary characteristics of Wernicke's
aphasia are poor language comprehension and production of meaningless
speech. Unlike Broca's aphasia, speech in Wernicke's aphasia is fluent
and unlabored. A person with Wernicke's aphasia does not strain to
articulate words and does not appear to be searching for them. The
patient maintains a melodic line, with the voice rising and falling
normally. When you listen to the speech of a person with Wernicke's
aphasia, it appears to be grammatical. That is, the person uses function
words such as the and but and employs complex verb tenses and
subordinate clauses. However, the person uses few content words, and the
words that they string together do not make sense, illustrated by the
following quotation: Examiner: What kind of work did you do before you
came into the hospital? Patient: Never, now mista oyge I wanna tell you
this happened when happened when he rent. His---his kell come down here
and is---he got ren something. It happened. In thesse ropiers were with
him for hi---is friend---like was. And it just happened so I don't know,
he did not bring around anything. And he did not pay it. And he roden
all o these arranjen from the pedis on from iss pescid. In these floors
now and so. He hadn't had em round here. (Kertesz, 1981, p. 73) Because
of the language deficits of people with Wernicke's aphasia, when
assessing their ability to comprehend language, it is important to ask
them to use nonverbal responses. We cannot assume that people with
Wernicke's aphasia do not understand what other people communicate to
them just because they do not give a correct verbal answer. For example,
you could assess a person's ability to understand questions by pointing
to objects on a table in front of them. A person might be asked to
"Point to the one with ink." If the person points to an object other
than the pen, they have not understood the request. When tested this
way, people with severe Wernicke's aphasia do indeed show poor
comprehension. People with Wernicke's aphasia often seem unaware of
their deficit. These individuals do not appear to recognize that their
language is impaired, nor do they recognize that they cannot understand
the language of others. They do not look puzzled when someone tells them
something, even though they cannot understand what they hear. It is
possible that the comprehension deficit prevents them from realizing
that what they say and hear makes no sense. People with Wernicke's
aphasia still follow social conventions, taking turns in conversation
with the examiner, even though they do not understand what the examiner
says and what they say in return makes little sense. They remain
sensitive to the other person's facial expression and tone of voice and
begin talking when the examiner asks a question and pauses

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 468

for an answer. One patient with Wernicke's aphasia made the following
responses when asked to name ten common objects: toothbrush → "stoktery"
cigarette → "cigarette" pen → "tankt" knife → "nike" fork → "fahk"
quarter → "minkt" pen → "spentee" matches → "senktr" key → "seek"

comb → "sahk" He acted confidently and gave no indication that he
recognized that most of his responses were not actual words. The
responses that he made were not new words that he had invented; he was
asked several times to name the objects and gave different responses
each time (except for cigarette, which he always named correctly).
Because the superior temporal gyrus is a region of auditory association
cortex, and because a comprehension deficit is so prominent in
Wernicke's aphasia, this disorder has been characterized as a receptive
aphasia (in contrast to an expressive aphasia like Broca's aphasia, in
which individuals have greater difficulty expressing language, but not
"receiving" or understanding it). Wernicke suggested that the region
that now bears his name is the location of memories of the sequences of
sounds that constitute words. This hypothesis is reasonable. It suggests
that the auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus
recognizes the sounds of words, just as the visual association cortex of
the inferior temporal gyrus recognizes the sight of objects. But why
should damage to an area that is responsible for the ability to
recognize spoken words disrupt people's ability to speak? In fact, it
does not; Wernicke's aphasia, like Broca's aphasia, actually appears to
consist of several deficits. The abilities that are disrupted include
recognition of spoken words, comprehension of the meaning of words, and
the ability to convert thoughts into words. We will consider each of
these abilities in turn. As you read in the introduction to this module,
recognizing a word is not the same as comprehending it. If you hear a
new word several times, you will learn to recognize it; but unless
someone tells you what it means, you will not comprehend it. Recognition
is a perceptual task. Comprehension involves retrieval of additional
(linguistic) information from memory.

DEFICITS IN SPOKEN WORD RECOGNITION

24/11/21 1:51 PM

Human Communication 469

Damage to the left temporal lobe can produce a disorder of auditory word
recognition. This syndrome is called pure word deafness. (See Figure
14.11.) People with pure word deafness are not deaf. They can perceive
and recognize speech, but they cannot understand the words. As one
patient put it, "I can hear you talking, I just can't understand what
you're saying." Another said, "It's as if there were a bypass somewhere,
and my ears were not connected to my voice" (Saffran et al., 1976,
p. 211). These patients can recognize nonspeech sounds such as the
barking of a dog, the sound of a doorbell, and the honking of a horn.
Often, they can recognize the emotion expressed by the intonation of
speech even though they cannot understand what is being said. More
significantly, their own speech is unaffected. They can often understand
what other people are saying by reading their lips. They can also read
and write, and they sometimes ask people to communicate with them in
writing. Pure word deafness is not an inability to comprehend the
meaning of words. If it were, people with this disorder would not be
able to read people's lips or read words written on paper. Their speech
deficit is restricted only to the recognition of spoken words. Even when
specific spoken words are not recognized, individuals with pure word
deafness correctly perceive the qualities of human speech and know that
another person is speaking. Functional-imaging studies show that
perception of speech sounds activates neurons in the auditory
association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus. For example, Scott
and colleagues (2000) identified a region of the

superior temporal lobe of a patient with pure word deafness (arrow).

left anterior superior temporal gyrus that was specifically activated by
intelligible speech, indicating that activity in this region is specific
to the perception of speech sounds, but not particular words. (See
Figure 14.12.) Sharp and colleagues (2004) found that lesions of this
same region produced deficits in language comprehension. What is
involved in the analysis of speech sounds? Just what tasks does the
auditory system have to accomplish? And what are the differences in the
functions of the auditory association cortex of the left and right
hemispheres? Most researchers believe that the left hemisphere is
primarily involved in judging the timing of the components of rapidly
changing complex sounds, whereas the right hemisphere is primarily
involved in judging more slowly changing components, including melody.
Evidence suggests that the most crucial aspect of speech sounds is
timing, not pitch. People recognize words whether they are conveyed by
the lower pitch, for example of a man, or the higher pitch of a woman or
child. In fact, most people can understand speech from which almost all
tonal information has been removed, leaving only some noise modulated by
the rapid stops and starts that characterize human speech sounds.

470 Chapter 14 Two types of brain injury can cause pure word deafness:
disruption of auditory input to the superior temporal cortex or damage
to the superior temporal cortex itself (Poeppel, 2001; Stefanatos et
al., 2005). Either type of damage disturbs the analysis of the sounds of
words and prevents people from recognizing other people's speech. As we
saw in Chapter 8, our brains contain circuits of mirror
neurons---neurons activated when we either perform an action or see the
action performed by someone else. Feedback from these neurons may help
us to understand the intent of the actions of others. Although speech
recognition is an auditory event, research indicates that hearing words
automatically engages brain mechanisms that control speech production,
too. These brain circuits appear to contain mirror neurons that are
activated by the sounds of words. For example, Fridricksson and
colleagues (2008) found that when people watched (but did not hear)
other people making speech movements, the temporal (auditory) and
frontal (motor) cortical language areas were activated. These regions
were not activated when the participants watched people making nonspeech
movements with their mouths. Several researchers have suggested that
feedback from subvocal articulation (very slight movements of the
muscles involved in speech that do not cause obvious movement)
facilitate speech recognition (Pulvermüller & Fadiga, 2010). For
example, a functional-imaging study by Pulvermüller and colleagues
(2006) had participants articulate syllables that contained the
consonants p or t (for example, pa and ta), which involve movements of
the lips or tongue. The participants said the syllables aloud, said them
to themselves silently, and listened to the syllables spoken by someone
else. As Figure 14.13 shows, in

Figure 14.13 Mirror Neurons and Speech Brain activation in the primary
motor cortex that occurred when people said syllables aloud, said
syllables to themselves silently, or heard someone else saying
syllables. The two regions marked with yellow circles are involved in
control of tongue movements (syllables that included the sound of t,
shown in green) and lip movements (syllables that included the sound of
p, shown in red). Source: Pulvermüller, F., Huss, M., Kherif, F., et
al. (2006). Motor cortex maps articulatory features of speech sounds.

all three conditions, regions of the brain involved with lip movements
(green) and tongue movements (red) were activated. Speaking, watching
other people speak, thinking about speaking, and listening to speech
sounds all activate brain regions involved in language, which suggests
that circuits of mirror neurons play a role in speech and language
comprehension. When we speak, or when we make subtle movements of the
muscles involved in speaking, we receive somatosensory feedback from our
tongue and the skin around our mouth. Ito and colleagues (2009) found
that this feedback affects our perception of speech sounds. The
investigators attached two arms of a mechanical device to the skin of
participants, just past the corners of their mouths. The device could be
made to pull the skin upward or downward by the computer controlling the
experiment. The participants listened to computer-generated words that
varied in 10 steps between the sound of head to the sound of had. When
the participants heard intermediate sounds that were neither head nor
had, they were more likely to indicate that they heard head when their
facial skin was stretched upward and had when their facial skin was
stretched downward. (Say head and had to yourself while paying attention
to the movements made by the corners of your mouth. You will feel that
your mouth widens and the corners rise slightly when you say head and
that your mouth opens slightly, pulling the corners down, when you say
had.) So, as the results of these studies indicate, activity of mirror
neurons as well as feedback from speech movements affects speech
perception. Experience with the patient described below suggests that
monitoring of one's own speech plays an important role in producing
accurate and fluent speech.

Dr. D. introduced Mr. S., a patient who had experienced a stroke that
resulted in pure word deafness. "Mr. S., will you tell us how you are
feeling?" asked Dr. D. The patient turned his head at the sound of his
voice and said, "Sorry, I can't understand you." "How are you feeling?"
Dr. D. asked in a loud voice. "Oh, I can hear you all right, I just
can't understand you. Here," said Mr. S., handing Dr. D. a pencil and a
small pad of paper. Dr. D. took the pencil and paper and wrote
something. He handed them back to Mr. S., who looked at it and said,
"Fine. I'm just fine." The conversation continued for several minutes as
different people in the room asked Mr. S. questions by writing them on
paper with Mr. S. answering them verbally. After Mr. S. had left the
room, someone observed that although Mr. S.'s speech was easy to
understand, it seemed a bit strange. "Yes," said a speech therapist, "he
almost sounds like a

person who is deaf and has learned to talk but doesn't get the
pronunciation of the words just right." Dr. D. nodded and played a
recording for us. "This recording was made a few months after his
strokes, 10 years ago." We heard the same voice, but this time all of
the words were pronounced accurately. "Oh," said the speech therapist.
"He has lost the ability to monitor his own speech, and over the years
he has forgotten some of the details of how various words are
pronounced." "Exactly," said Dr. D. "The change has been a gradual one."

DEFICITS IN LANGUAGE COMPREHENSION The other

symptoms of Wernicke's aphasia---failure to comprehend the meaning of
words and inability to express thoughts in meaningful speech---appear to
be produced by damage that extends beyond Wernicke's area into the
region that surrounds the posterior part of the lateral fissure, near
the junction of the temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes. We will
refer to this region as the posterior language area. (See Figure 14.14.)
The posterior language area appears to serve as a place for
interchanging information between the auditory representation of words
and the meanings of these words, stored as memories in the rest of the
sensory association cortex. Damage to the posterior language area alone,
which isolates Wernicke's area from the rest of the posterior language
area, produces a disorder known as transcortical sensory aphasia. (Look
again at Figure 14.14.) The difference between transcortical sensory
aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia is that patients with transcortical
sensory aphasia can repeat what other people say to them; therefore,
they can recognize words. However, they cannot comprehend the meaning of
what they hear and repeat; nor can they

produce meaningful speech of their own. How can these individuals repeat
what they hear without understanding it? Because their posterior
language area is the area that is damaged, and repetition does not
involve this part of the brain. There must be a direct connection
between Wernicke's area and Broca's area that bypasses the posterior
language area. Consider the following case in which a woman's symptoms
following brain injury reveal that circuits devoted to repetition are
distinct from those devoted to comprehension:

A woman sustained extensive brain damage from carbon monoxide produced
by a faulty water heater. She spent several years in the hospital before
she died, without ever saying anything meaningful on her own. She did
not follow verbal commands or otherwise give signs of understanding
them. However, she often repeated what was said to her. For example, if
an examiner said "Please raise your right hand," she would reply,
"Please raise your right hand." Interestingly, she did not imitate
accents different from her own, and if someone made a grammatical error
while saying something to her, she sometimes repeated the sentence
correctly, without the error. She could also recite poems if someone
started them. For example, when an examiner said, "Roses are red,
violets are blue," she continued with "Sugar is sweet and so are you."
She could sing and would do so when someone started singing a song she
knew. She even learned new songs from the radio while in the hospital.
In spite of these impressive abilities, she gave no signs of
understanding anything she heard or said. This disorder, transcortical
sensory aphasia, along with pure word deafness, confirms the conclusion
that recognizing spoken words and comprehending them are different
processes and involve different brain mechanisms (Geschwind et al.,
1968).

the analysis of speech sounds and in turn, the recognition of words.
Damage to the posterior language area does not disrupt people's ability
to recognize words, but it does disrupt their ability to understand
words or to produce meaningful speech of their own. But what, exactly,
do we mean by the word meaning? And what types of brain mechanisms are
involved? The third ability that is disrupted in Wernicke's aphasia is
the ability to convert thoughts and memories into words. Words refer to
objects, actions, or relationships in the world. The meaning of a word
is defined by particular memories associated with it. For example,
knowing the meaning of the word tree means being able to imagine the
physical characteristics of trees: what they look like, what the wind
sounds like blowing through their leaves, what the bark feels like, and
so on. It also means knowing facts about trees: about their roots, buds,
flowers, nuts, wood, and the chlorophyll in their leaves. Action words
such as throw involve memories of seeing someone throwing something and
also involve imagining what it feels like to throw something yourself.
These memories are stored not in the primary speech and language areas
but in other parts of the brain, especially regions of the association
cortex. Different categories of memories may be stored in particular
regions of the brain, but they are somehow tied together, so hearing the
word tree or throw activates all of them. (As we saw in Chapter 13, the
hippocampal formation is involved in this process of tying related
memories together.) As you learned in the sections about Broca's
aphasia, anomia, which is difficulty finding or remembering an
appropriate word, is an important symptom of aphasia. One category of
aphasia consists of almost pure anomia. Speech of patients with anomic
aphasia is fluent and grammatical, and their comprehension is excellent,
but they have difficulty finding the appropriate words. They often
employ circumlocutions (literally, "speaking in a roundabout way") to
get around missing words. Anomic aphasia alone is different from
Wernicke's aphasia. Unlike patients with Wernicke's aphasia, people with
anomic aphasia can understand what others say, and what people with
anomic aphasia say makes sense, even if they often choose alternative
ways to say it. The following quotation is from a patient with anomic
aphasia who was asked to describe the kitchen picture shown earlier, in
Figure 14.8. Her pauses, which are marked with ellipses (three dots),
indicate word-finding difficulties. In some cases, when she could not
find a word, she supplied a definition instead (a form of
circumlocution)

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 472

Examiner: Tell us about that picture.

Anomia has been described as a partial amnesia for words. It can be
produced by lesions in either the anterior or the posterior regions of
the brain, but only posterior lesions produce a fluent anomia. The most
likely location of lesions that produce anomia without the other
symptoms of aphasia, such as comprehension deficits, agrammatism, or
difficulties in articulation, is the left temporal or parietal lobe,
usually sparing Wernicke's area. In the case of the woman described
above, the damage affected the left middle and inferior temporal gyri,
which includes an important region of the visual association cortex.
Wernicke's area was not damaged. The patient described above had more
difficulty finding nouns than other types of words. Other researchers
have reported similar patterns of deficits. For example, Semenza and
Zettin (1989) and Manning and Campbell (1992) described patients who had
difficulty naming objects but not actions. Several studies have found
that anomia for verbs (more correctly called averbia) is caused by
damage to the frontal cortex, in and around Broca's area (Bak et al.,
2001; Damasio & Tranel, 1993; Daniele et al., 1994). The frontal lobes
are devoted to planning, organizing, and executing actions, so they are
involved in the task of remembering the names of actions. Several
functional-imaging studies have confirmed the importance of Broca's area
and the region surrounding it in the production of verbs. For example,
Hauk and colleagues (2004) had participants read verbs that related to
movements of different parts of the body. For example, bite, slap, and
kick involve movements of the face, arm, and leg, respectively. The
investigators found that when the participants read a verb, they saw
activation in the regions of the motor cortex that controlled the
relevant part of the body. (See Figure 14.15.) A similar study by
Buccino and colleagues (2005) found that hearing sentences that involved
hand movements (for example, He turned the key) activated the hand
region of the motor cortex and that hearing sentences that involved foot
movements (for example, He stepped on the grass) activated the foot
region. Presumably, thinking about particular actions activated regions
that control these actions.

In conclusion, Wernicke's aphasia includes several types of symptoms,
including deficits in spoken word recognition, comprehension, and
converting thoughts into words.

Conduction Aphasia LO 14.8 Describe the symptoms and biological basis of
conduction aphasia. As we saw earlier in this module, the fact that
people with transcortical sensory aphasia can repeat what they hear
suggests that there is a direct connection between Wernicke's area and
Broca's area---and there is: the arcuate fasciculus. This bundle of
axons is found in the human brain but is absent or much smaller in the
brains of nonhuman primates (Rilling et al., 2008). The arcuate
fasciculus appears to convey information about the sounds of words but
not their meanings. The best evidence for this conclusion comes from a
syndrome known as conduction aphasia, which is produced by damage to the
inferior parietal lobe that extends into the subcortical white matter
and damages the arcuate fasciculus (Damasio & Damasio, 1980). (See
Figure 14.16.) Conduction aphasia is characterized by meaningful, fluent
speech and relatively good comprehension but very poor repetition. For
example, the spontaneous speech of patient L. B. (observed by Margolin &
Walker, 1981) was excellent; he made very few errors and had no
difficulty naming objects. The following transcript of an interview
reveals that L. B.'s ability to repeat words was limited to real words.
He was unable to repeat nonsense words or novel sounds. Examiner:
bicycle Patient: bicycle Examiner: hippopotamus

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 473

Patient: hippopotamus Examiner: blaynge Patient: I didn't get it.
Examiner: Okay, some of these won't be real words, they'll just be
sounds. Blaynge. Patient: I'm not . . . Examiner: blanch Patient: blanch
Examiner: north Patient: north Examiner: rilld

Patient: Nope, I can't say. You will notice that the patient can repeat
individual words (all nouns, in this case) but cannot repeat nonwords.
He can repeat a meaningful three-word phrase but not three unrelated
words. Sometimes, when a person with conduction aphasia is asked to
repeat a word, they say a word with the same meaning or one that is
related. For example, if the examiner says house, the patient may say
home. If the examiner says chair, the patient may say sit. One patient
made the following response when asked to repeat an entire sentence:
Examiner: The auto's leaking gas tank soiled the roadway. Patient: The
car's tank leaked and made a mess on the street. The symptoms that are
seen in transcortical sensory aphasia and conduction aphasia lead to the
conclusion that there are pathways connecting the speech mechanisms of
the temporal lobe with those of the frontal lobe. The direct pathway

Perceptions and memories

Broca's area (speech production) Perceptions and memories This
connection enables patients with conduction aphasia to express their
thoughts in words

through the arcuate fasciculus simply conveys speech sounds from
Wernicke's area to Broca's area. We use this pathway to repeat
unfamiliar words---for example, when we are learning a new language or a
new word in our own language or when we are trying to repeat a nonword
such as blaynge. The second pathway, between the posterior language area
and Broca's area, is indirect and is based on the meaning of words, not
on the sounds they make. When patients with conduction aphasia hear a
word or a sentence, the meaning of what they hear evokes some sort of
image related to that meaning. (The patient in the second example
presumably imagined the sight of a vehicle leaking fuel onto the
pavement.) They are then able to describe that image, just as they would
put their own thoughts into words. Of course, the words they choose
might not be the same as the ones used by the person who spoke to them.
(See Figure 14.17.) A study by Catani and colleagues (2005) provided the
first anatomical evidence for the existence of the two pathways between
Wernicke's area and Broca's area, presented in Figure 14.18. The
investigators used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to trace the branches
of the arcuate fasciculus in the human brain. DTI-imaging techniques are
described in detail in Chapter 5. The researchers found one deep pathway
that directly connects these two regions and a shallower pathway that
consists of two segments. The anterior segment connects Broca's area
with the inferior parietal cortex, and the posterior segment connects
Wernicke's area with the inferior parietal cortex. Damage to the direct
pathway would be expected to produce conduction aphasia, whereas damage
to the indirect pathway would be expected to spare the ability to repeat
speech but would impair comprehension. The symptoms of conduction
aphasia suggest that the connections between Wernicke's area and Broca's
area

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 474

play an important role in short-term memory of words and speech sounds
that have just been heard. Presumably, rehearsal of such information can
be accomplished by "talking to ourselves" inside our head without
actually having to say anything aloud. Imagining ourselves saying the
word activates the region of Broca's area, whereas imagining that we are
hearing it activates the auditory association area of the temporal lobe.
These two regions, connected by means of the arcuate fasciculus (which
contains axons traveling in both directions), circulate information back
and forth, keeping the short-term memory alive. Baddeley (1993) refers
to this circuit as the phonological loop. Aziz-Zadeh and colleagues
(2005) obtained evidence

that we do use Broca's area when we talk to ourselves. The investigators
applied TMS to Broca's area while people were silently counting the
number of syllables in words presented on a screen. The investigators
used stimulation parameters that disrupted overt (actual) speech. They
found that it disrupted covert (non-verbalized) speech as well; the
participants took longer to count the syllables when the TMS was on. The
picture we have drawn so far suggests that comprehension of speech
includes a flow of information from Wernicke's area to the posterior
language area to various regions of the sensory and motor association
cortexes, which contain memories that provide meanings to words.
Production of spontaneous speech involves the flow of information
concerning perceptions and memories from the sensory and motor
association cortexes to the posterior language area to Broca's area.
This model is an oversimplification, but it is a useful starting point
in conceptualizing basic mental processes. Thinking in words probably
involves two-way communication between the speech areas and surrounding
association cortex (and regions such as the hippocampus and medial
temporal lobe).

Aphasia in People Who Are Deaf LO 14.9 Describe the symptoms and
biological basis of aphasia in people who are deaf. So far, our
discussion has been limited to brain mechanisms of spoken and written
language. But communication among many people, such as those who are
deaf or hard of hearing, involves another form: sign language. Sign
language is expressed manually, by movements of the hands. Sign language
is not English; nor is it French, Spanish, or Chinese. The most common
sign language in North America is ASL---American Sign Language. ASL
includes signs for nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and all the other
parts of speech contained in oral languages. People can converse rapidly
and efficiently by means of sign language, can tell jokes, and can make
puns based on the similarity between signs. People who communicate using
ASL also use their language ability to think in words. Some researchers
believe that in the history of our species, sign language preceded
spoken language---that our ancestors began using gestures to communicate
before they switched to speech. As mentioned earlier in this chapter,
mirror neurons become active when we see or perform particular grasping,
holding, or manipulating movements. Some of these neurons are found in
Broca's area. Presumably, these neurons play an important role in
learning to mimic other people's hand movements. Indeed, they might have
been involved in the development of hand gestures used for communication
in our ancestors, and they

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 475

undoubtedly are used by people when they communicate by sign language. A
functional-imaging study by Iacoboni and colleagues (1999) found that
Broca's area was activated when people observed and imitated finger
movements. (See Figure 14.19.) Several studies have found a linkage
between speech and hand movements, which supports the suggestion that
the spoken language of present-day humans evolved from hand gestures.
For example, Gentilucci (2003) had participants speak the syllables ba
or ga while they were watching him grasp objects of different sizes.
When the experimenter grasped a large object, the participants opened
their mouths more and said the syllable more loudly than when he grasped
a small one. These results suggest that the region of the brain that
controls grasping is also involved in controlling speech movements. The
grammar of ASL is based on its visual, spatial nature. For example, if a
person makes the sign for Jamie in one place and later makes the sign
for Dylan in another place, she can place her hand in the Jamie location
and move it toward the Dylan location while making the sign for love.
She is saying, "Jamie loves Dylan." Signers can also modify the meaning
of signs through

24/11/21 1:51 PM

476 Chapter 14 facial expressions or the speed and vigor with which they
make a sign. Many of the prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs found in
spoken languages do not require specific words in ASL. The fact that
signed languages are based on three-dimensional hand and arm movements
accompanied by facial expressions means that their grammars are very
different from those of spoken languages. Therefore, a word-for-word
translation from a spoken language to a signed language (or vice versa)
is impossible. The fact that the grammar of ASL is spatial suggests that
aphasic disorders in people who use sign language exclusively might be
caused by lesions of the right hemisphere (which is primarily involved
in spatial perception and memory). However, all the cases of people who
are deaf with aphasia for signs that have been reported in the
literature so far have involved lesions of the left hemisphere.
Functional-imaging studies show that tasks that involve language
activate the same regions of the left hemisphere in people who use
spoken language and people who use ASL (MacSweeney et al., 2008a). When
a hearing person is asked to look at a pair of drawings and say whether
the names of the items they show rhyme, functional imaging shows
increased activation in the region of Broca's area because the person
"says" the two words subvocally. The same region is activated in people
who are deaf and those who are not (MacSweeney et al., 2008b). (See
Figure 14.20.)

Hearing

As you read earlier in this chapter, the right hemisphere contributes to
the more subtle, figurative aspects of spoken language. The same is true
for signing. Hickok and colleagues (1999) described the case of two
signers who were deaf and had damage to the right hemisphere. Both
showed problems with discourse using sign language: One had trouble
maintaining a coherent topic, and the other had difficulty with subtle
uses of spatial features. A functional-imaging study by Newman and
colleagues (2010) found that when people who are deaf observed sign
language that included the use of narrative devices such as facial
expressions or movements of the head, eyes, and body, the inferior
frontal cortex and superior temporal cortex of the right hemisphere were
activated in addition to the expected language regions of the left
hemisphere.

Stuttering LO 14.10 Describe the biological basis of and treatment
strategies for stuttering. Stuttering is a speech disorder characterized
by frequent pauses, prolongations of sounds, or repetitions of sounds,
syllables, or words that disrupt the normal flow of speech. Stuttering,
which appears to be influenced by genetic factors, affects approximately
1 percent of the population and is three times more prevalent in men
than in women (Brown et al., 2005; Fisher, 2010). Stuttering rarely
occurs when a person says a single word or is asked to read a list of
words. It most often occurs at the beginning of a sentence, especially
if the planned sentence is long or grammatically complex. This fact
suggests that stuttering is a disorder of coordinating the motor
sequences needed to produce fluent speech (Watkins et al., 2008, p. 50).
Stuttering is not a result of abnormalities in the neural circuits that
contain the motor programs for speech. For example, stuttering is
reduced or eliminated when a person reads aloud with another speaker,
sings, or reads in cadence with a rhythmic stimulus. The problem appears
to lie more in the neural mechanisms that are involved in planning and
initiation of speech. A meta-analysis of functionalimaging studies by
Brown and colleagues (2005) found that people who stutter tend to show
(relative to fluent speakers) excessive activation of Broca's area and
the insula (regions involved in articulation), the supplementary motor
area, and the vermis of the cerebellum, as well as an absence of
activation in auditory regions of the temporal lobe. Figure 14.21
compares regional brain activity of fluent speakers and people who
stutter. Areas shaded in orange indicate regions that are more highly
activated

in the brains of people who stutter; areas shaded in blue indicate
regions that are more highly activated in the brains of fluent speakers.
(The only region in the latter category is in the temporal lobe.) The
authors suggest that the problem may be caused by faulty auditory
feedback from sounds of the person's own speech, shown by the lack of
activity in the temporal lobe. They note that a magnetoencephalographic
study by Salmelin and colleagues (2000) found disruptions in the normal
timing of activation of brain regions involved in speech production in
people who stuttered. Evidence in support of this suggestion includes
the fact that delayed auditory feedback interferes with the speech of
most fluent speakers but actually facilitates the speech of many people
who stutter (Foundas et al., 2004). Delayed auditory feedback is a
procedure in which a person wearing headphones tries to speak normally
while hearing his or her own voice, which has been electronically
delayed, usually by 50--200 msec. (Portable devices are commercially
available that include a microphone, headphones, and an electronic
apparatus that provides the delay.) If there were simply a problem with
the control of articulation in people who stutter, delayed auditory
feedback would not be expected to have any effect on their fluency.
Neumann and colleagues (2005) provide further evidence that the
apparently abnormal auditory feedback in people who stutter is reflected
in decreased activation of their temporal cortex. The authors used
functional MRI (fMRI) to measure the regional brain activation of people
who stutter reading sentences aloud during two sessions, one before and
one after a successful 12-week course of fluency-shaping therapy. Figure
14.22 shows that, after the therapy, the activation of the temporal
lobe---a region that Brown and colleagues (2005) found to show decreased
activation in stuttering---was increased. Watkins and colleagues (2008)
used diffusion tensor imaging and found decreases in the white matter
beneath

the ventral premotor cortex of people who stuttered. They suggested that
the axons in this white matter connect the ventral premotor cortex with
regions of the superior temporal cortex and inferior parietal cortex
that are involved in integrating the planning of speech with auditory
feedback from one's own voice. Kemerdere and colleagues (2016) reported
that temporarily inhibiting white matter tracts projecting to the left
SMA also produced stuttering. (See Figure 14.23.) Changes in the tracts
connecting multiple brain regions may contribute to the experience of
stuttering.

Module Review: Disorders of Language Production and Comprehension
Disorders of Language Production: Broca's Aphasia LO 14.6

Describe the symptoms and biological basis of Broca's aphasia.

Broca's aphasia is characterized by slow, laborious, and nonfluent
speech due to damage to Broca's area in the frontal lobe. This aphasia
is typically caused by brain damage that extends beyond Broca's region
into subcortical white matter. Similar aphasia symptoms are produced by
damage to the caudate nucleus. Broca's aphasia includes symptoms of
agrammatism (difficulty using grammatical constructions), anomia
(word-finding difficulty), and articulation difficulties. Research on
agrammatism reveals that this characteristic of Broca's aphasia is the
result of

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 478

damage to Broca's area. Articulation difficulties are related to damage
to the left precentral gyrus of the insula.

Disorders of Language Comprehension: Wernicke's Aphasia LO 14.7

Describe the symptoms and biological basis of Wernicke's aphasia.

Wernicke's aphasia, caused by damage to Wernicke's area and the
posterior language area, consists of poor language comprehension, poor
repetition, and production of fluent, meaningless speech. The region
just adjacent to Wernicke's area, the posterior language area, is
necessary for language comprehension and the translation of thoughts
into words. Presumably, Wernicke's area contains memories of the

24/11/21 1:51 PM

Human Communication 479

sounds of words, each of which is connected through the posterior
language area with circuits that contain memories about the properties
of the things the words denote and with circuits that are responsible
for pronouncing the words. Damage restricted to Wernicke's area causes
pure word deafness while damage to the posterior speech area causes
transcortical sensory aphasia. The symptoms of Wernicke's aphasia
consist of those of transcortical sensory aphasia plus those of pure
word deafness.

strategies for stuttering.

The arcuate fasciculus connects Wernicke's and Broca's areas. Damage to
the arcuate fasciculus produces conduction aphasia. Conduction aphasia
is characterized by meaningful, fluent speech and relatively good
comprehension but very poor repetition. A parallel pathway, consisting
of an anterior and a posterior bundle that connect in the inferior
parietal cortex, may be responsible for the ability of people with pure
conduction aphasia to understand and paraphrase what they hear.

Stuttering appears to be caused by abnormalities in neural circuits that
are involved in feedback, planning, and initiating speech, not in the
circuits that contain the motor programs for articulation. Functional
imaging indicates deficient auditory feedback produced by the person's
own voice. People who stutter show excessive activation of Broca's area
and the insula, supplementary motor area, and vermis of the cerebellum,
as well as an absence of activation in auditory regions of the temporal
lobe. Delayed auditory feedback, which impairs the speech of most
speakers who are fluent, often facilitates the speech of people who
stutter.

Disorders of Reading and Writing Reading and writing are closely related
to listening and speaking or signing. Oral and written language
abilities have many brain mechanisms in common. This module discusses
the neural bases of reading and writing disorders. The reading and
writing skills of people with aphasia almost always reflect their
expression and comprehension abilities. For example, patients with
Wernicke's aphasia have as much difficulty reading and writing as they
do speaking and understanding language. Patients with Broca's aphasia
comprehend what they read about as well as they understand spoken
language, but their reading aloud is poor. If a patient's speech is
agrammatical, so is their writing. If they have difficulty comprehending
grammar when listening to speech, they also have difficulty when
reading. Patients with conduction aphasia generally have some difficulty
reading. When they read aloud, they often make semantic paraphasias
(saying synonyms or related words for some of the words they read), just
as they do when attempting to repeat what they hear. Depending on the
location of the lesion,

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 479

some patients with transcortical sensory aphasia may read aloud
accurately but fail to comprehend what they read.

Pure Alexia LO 14.11

Identify the symptoms and biological basis of pure alexia.

Dejerine (1892) described a remarkable syndrome, which we now call pure
alexia, or sometimes pure word blindness or alexia without agraphia. His
patient had a lesion in the visual cortex of the left occipital lobe and
the posterior This case involves a man with pure alexia who discovered
his ability to write in an interesting way. A few months after he
sustained a head injury that caused his brain damage, he and his wife
were watching a service person repair their washing machine. The patient
wanted to say something privately to his wife, so he picked up a pad of
paper and jotted a note. As he was handing it to her, they suddenly
realized with amazement that although he could not read, he was able to
write! His wife brought the note to their neurologist, who asked the
patient to read it. Although he remembered the general content of the
message, he could not read the words he had written.

end of the corpus callosum. The patient could still write, although he
had lost the ability to read. In fact, if he was shown some of his own
writing, he could not read it. The case below illustrates the unique
nature of pure alexia. Although patients with pure alexia cannot read,
they can recognize words that are spelled aloud to them. This indicates
they have not lost their memories of the spellings of words. Pure alexia
is a perceptual disorder. It is similar to pure word deafness, except
that the patient has difficulty with visual input, not auditory input.
The disorder is caused by lesions that prevent visual information from
reaching the visual association cortex of the left hemisphere (Damasio &
Damasio, 1983, 1986; Molko et al., 2002). Figure 14.24 explains why
Dejerine's original patient could not read. The left side of the diagram
shows the pathway that visual information would take if a person had
damage only to the left primary visual cortex. In this case, the
person's right visual field would be blind; they would see nothing to
the right of the fixation point. But people with this disorder can read.
Their only problem is that they must look to the right of each word so
that they can see all of it, which means that they read somewhat more
slowly than someone with full vision. (See Figure 14.24a.)

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 480

(b) 

Let's trace the flow of visual information for a person with this brain
damage that enables that person to read words aloud. Information from
the left side of the visual field is transmitted to the right striate
cortex (primary visual cortex) and then to regions of right visual
association cortex. From there the information crosses the posterior
corpus callosum and is transmitted to a region of the left visual
association cortex known as the visual word-form area (VWFA), where it
is analyzed further. The information is then transmitted to speech
mechanisms located in the left frontal lobe, and the person can read the
words aloud. (Look again at Figure 14.24a.) The right side of the
diagram shows Dejerine's patient. Notice how the additional lesion of
the corpus callosum prevents visual information concerning written text
from reaching the VWFA in the left hemisphere. Because this brain region
is essential for the ability to recognize words, the patient cannot
read. (See Figure 14.24b.) Mao-Draayer and Panitch (2004) reported the
case of a man with multiple sclerosis who displayed the symptoms of pure
alexia after sustaining a lesion that damaged both the subcortical white
matter of the left occipital lobe and the posterior corpus callosum. As
you can see in Figure 14.25, the lesions are in the locations that
Dejerine predicted would cause this syndrome, except that the

white matter that serves the left primary visual cortex is damaged, not
the cortex itself. The diagrams shown in Figure 14.25 illustrate only
the pathway involved in seeing a word and pronouncing it, and they
ignore neural structures that would be involved in understanding its
meaning. As we will see later in this chapter, evidence from patients
with brain lesions indicates that seeing and pronouncing words can take
place independently of understanding them. Although the diagrams are
simplified, they are not unreasonable, given what we know about the
neural components of the reading process. Writing is not the only form
of visible language; people can also communicate by means of sign.
Hickok and colleagues (1996) reported on a case of "sign blindness"
caused by damage similar to that which causes pure alexia. The patient,
a right-handed woman who was deaf, sustained a stroke that damaged her
left occipital lobe and the posterior corpus callosum. The lesion did
not impair her ability to sign in coherent sentences, but she could no
longer understand other people's sign language, and she lost her ability
to read. She had some ability to comprehend single signs (corresponding
to single words), but she could not comprehend signed sentences.

Toward an Understanding of Reading LO 14.12

Describe the biological basis of acquired and developmental dyslexia.

Reading involves at least two different processes: direct recognition of
the word as a whole and sounding it out letter by letter. When we see a
familiar word, we normally

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 481

Saying word aloud

recognize it and pronounce it---a process known as wholeword reading.
(With very long words we might instead perceive segments of several
letters each.) The second method, which we use for unfamiliar words,
requires recognition of individual letters and knowledge of the sounds
they make. This process is known as phonetic reading. Evidence for our
ability to sound out words is easy to obtain. In fact, you can prove to
yourself that phonetic reading exists by trying to read the following
words: glab trisk chint These are not really words, but most readers are
able to pronounce them. Readers don't recognize them, because they have
probably never seen them before. Instead, readers use what they know
about the sounds that are represented by particular letters (or small
groups of letters, such as ch) to figure out how to pronounce the words.
Figure 14.26 illustrates some elements of the reading processes. The
diagram is an oversimplification of a very complex process, but it helps
to organize some of the facts that investigators have obtained. It
considers only reading and pronouncing single words, not understanding
the meaning of text. When we see a familiar word, we normally recognize
it as a whole and pronounce it. If we see an unfamiliar word or a
pronounceable nonword, we must try to read it phonetically. The best
evidence that people can read words without sounding them out, using the
whole-word method, comes from studies of patients with acquired
dyslexias. Dyslexia means "faulty reading." Acquired dyslexias are those
caused by damage to the brains of people who already know how to read.
In contrast, developmental dyslexias refer to reading difficulties that
become apparent when

24/11/21 1:52 PM

482 Chapter 14 children are learning to read. Researchers have reported
several types of acquired dyslexias. Three of them will be described
here: surface dyslexia, direct dyslexia, and phonological dyslexia.
Developmental dyslexias, which appear to involve anomalies in brain
circuitry, are discussed in a later section. Surface dyslexia is a
deficit in whole-word reading. The term surface reflects the fact that
people with this disorder make errors related to the visual appearance
of the words and to pronunciation rules, not to the meaning of the
words, which is metaphorically "deeper" than the appearance. Because
patients with surface dyslexia have difficulty recognizing words as a
whole, they must sound them out. They can easily read words with regular
spelling, such as hand, table, or chin. However, they have difficulty
reading words with irregular spelling, such as sew, pint, and yacht. In
fact, they may read these words as sue, pinnt, and yatchet. They have no
difficulty reading pronounceable nonwords, such as glab, trisk, and
chint. Because people with surface dyslexia cannot recognize whole words
by their appearance, they must, in effect, listen to their own
pronunciation to understand what they are reading. If they read the word
pint and pronounce it pinnt, they will say that it is not an English
word (which it is not, pronounced that way). If the word is one member
of a homophone, it will be impossible for them to understand it unless
it is read in the context of a sentence. For example, if you hear the
single word "pair" without additional information, you cannot know
whether the speaker is referring to pair, pear, or pare. (See Figure
14.27.) SURFACE DYSLEXIA

DIRECT DYSLEXIA As you read earlier in this chapter, recognizing a
spoken word is different from understanding

it. For example, patients with transcortical sensory aphasia can repeat
what is said to them even though they show no signs of understanding
what they hear or say. The same is true for reading. Direct dyslexia
resembles transcortical sensory aphasia, except that the words in
question are written, not spoken (Gerhand, 2001; Lytton & Brust, 1989;
Schwartz et al., 1979). Patients with direct dyslexia are able to read
aloud even though they cannot understand the words they are saying.
After sustaining a stroke that damaged his left frontal and temporal
lobes, Lytton and Brust's (1989) patient lost the ability to communicate
verbally; his speech was meaningless, and he was unable to comprehend
what other people said to him. However, he could read words with which
he was already familiar. He could not read pronounceable nonwords;
therefore, he had lost the ability to read phonetically. His
comprehension deficit seemed complete; when the investigators presented
him with a word and several pictures, one of which corresponded to the
word, he read the word correctly but had no idea what picture went with
it. Gerhand's (2001) patient showed a similar pattern of deficits except
that she was able to read phonetically. She could sound out
pronounceable nonwords. These findings indicate that the brain regions
responsible for phonetic reading and whole-word reading are each
directly connected with brain regions responsible for speech.
PHONOLOGICAL DYSLEXIA The symptoms of phonological dyslexia are opposite
those of surface dyslexia. People with this disorder can read by the
whole-word method but cannot sound words out. These individuals can read
words that they are already familiar with but have great difficulty
figuring out how to read unfamiliar words or pronounceable nonwords
(Beauvois & Dérouesné, 1979; Dérouesné & Beauvois, 1979). People with
phonological dyslexia may be excellent readers if they had already
acquired a good reading vocabulary before their brain damage occurred.
Phonological dyslexia provides further evidence that whole-word reading
and phonological reading involve different brain mechanisms.
Phonological reading, which is the only way we can read nonwords or
words we have not yet learned, entails some sort of letter-to-sound
decoding. Phonological reading of English requires more than decoding of
the sounds produced by single letters, because, for example, some sounds
are transcribed as two-letter sequences (such as th or sh) and the
addition of the letter e to the end of a word lengthens an internal
vowel (can becomes cane). (See Figure 14.28.) The Japanese language
provides a particularly interesting distinction between phonetic and
whole-word reading. The Japanese language makes use of two kinds of
written symbols. Kanji symbols are pictographs, adopted from the Chinese
language (although they are pronounced

as Japanese words). Kanji represent concepts by means of visual symbols
but do not provide a guide to their pronunciation. Reading words
expressed in kanji symbols is analogous, then, to whole-word reading.
Kana symbols are phonetic representations of syllables and they encode
acoustical information. These symbols are used primarily to represent
foreign words or Japanese words that the average reader would be
unlikely to recognize if they were represented by their kanji symbols.
Reading words expressed in kana symbols is phonetic. (See Figure 14.29.)
Studies of people with localized brain damage that read both kana and
kanji, have shown that reading kana and kanji symbols involves different
brain mechanisms (Iwata, 1984; Sakurai et al., 2001; Sakurai et al.,
1994). Difficulty reading kanji symbols is a form of surface dyslexia,
whereas difficulty reading kana symbols is a form of phonological
dyslexia. What regions are involved in these two kinds of reading?
Evidence from lesion and functional-imaging studies with readers of
English, Chinese, and Japanese suggest that the process of whole-word
reading follows the ventral stream of the visual system to a region, the
fusiform gyrus, located on the base of the temporal lobe. For example,
functional-imaging studies by Liu and colleagues (2008) and Thuy and
colleagues (2004) found that reading kanji words or Chinese characters
(whole-word reading) activated the left fusiform gyrus, a region of the
cerebral cortex located at the base of the temporal lobe. This region
has come to be known as the visual word-form area or VWFA (Dehaene,
2009). Part of the fusiform gyrus is also involved in the perception of
faces and other shapes that require expertise to distinguish---and,
recognizing whole words or kanji symbols requires expertise. The
location of the neural circuitry responsible for phonological reading is
less certain. Many investigators

believe that it involves the region of the cerebral cortex that
surrounds the junction of the inferior parietal lobe and the superior
temporal lobe (the temporoparietal cortex) and then follows a fiber
bundle from this region to the inferior frontal cortex, which includes
Broca's area (Jobard et al., 2003; Sakurai et al., 2000; Tan et al.,
2005; Thuy et al., 2004). However, damage restricted to the cortex of
the VWFA---without damage to underlying white matter---produces pure
alexia (Beversdorf et al., 1997). Although phonological reading may
involve the temporoparietal cortex, the VWFA appears to play an
essential role in both forms of reading. The fact that phonological
reading involves Broca's area suggests that it may actually involve
articulation---that we sound out words not so much by "hearing" them in
our heads as by feeling ourselves pronounce them silently to ourselves.
(As you read earlier in this chapter, feedback from the inferior frontal
cortex plays a role in perception of spoken words.) Once words have been
identified---by either means---their meaning must be accessed, which
means that the two pathways converge on regions of the brain involved in
recognition of word meaning, grammatical structure, and semantics. (See
Figure 14.30 and Table 14.2.)

The neural circuits involved in written and auditory information must
also eventually converge, because both must have access to the same
linguistic and semantic information that identify words and their
meaning. An interesting study by Marinkovic and colleagues (2003) used
magnetoencephalography to trace regional brain activation as people
heard or read individual words. The study showed that neural activation
responsible for the analysis of a spoken word began in the auditory
cortex of the temporal lobe and spread to the auditory association
cortex on the superior temporal lobe (including Wernicke's area) and
then to the inferior frontal cortex (including Broca's area). The neural
activation responsible for the analysis of a printed word began in the
visual cortex and spread to the base of the temporal lobe (including the
VWFA in the fusiform gyrus) and then to the inferior frontal cortex. The
temporoparietal cortex received little activation, presumably because
the participants were fluent readers who did not need to sound out the
common words they were asked to read. Let's consider the role of the
VWFA. Some parts of the visual association cortex must be involved in
perceiving written words. You will recall from Chapter 6 that visual
agnosia is a perceptual deficit in which people with bilateral damage to
the visual association cortex cannot

VISUAL WORD-FORM AREA

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 484

recognize objects by sight. However, people with visual agnosia can
still read, which means that the perceptual analysis of objects and
words involves at least some different brain mechanisms. This fact is
both interesting and puzzling. Certainly, the ability to read cannot
have shaped the evolution of the human brain, because the invention of
writing is only a few thousand years old, and, until very recently, the
vast majority of the world's population did not read or write. This
indicates that reading and object recognition use brain mechanisms that
undoubtedly existed long before the invention of writing. However, just
as experience seeing faces affects the development of the fusiform face
area in the right hemisphere, experience learning to read words affects
the development of the neural circuitry in the visual word-form
area---which, probably not coincidentally, is found in the fusiform
cortex of the left hemisphere. A functional-imaging study by Brem and
colleagues (2010) scanned the brains of young children who had not yet
learned to read. Initially, the sight of printed words activated the
ventral posterior occipitotemporal region bilaterally. After 3--4 hours
of teaching the associations of written letters and their sounds, the
sight of words activated the left hemisphere. Learning to read affects
the connections of the neural system involved in recognizing letters and
words. The fusiform face area has the ability to quickly recognize
unique configurations of people's eyes, noses, lips, and other features
of their faces even when the features of two people's faces are very
similar. For example, relatives and close friends of identical twins can
see at a glance which twin they are looking at. Similarly, our VWFA can
recognize a word even if it closely resembles another one. (See Figure
14.31.) It can also quickly recognize words written in different
typestyles, fonts, or CASES. This means that the VWFA can recognize
whole words with different shapes; for example, chair and CHAIR do not
look the same. It takes an experienced reader the same amount of time to
read equally familiar three-letter words and six-letter words (Nazir et
al., 1998), which means that the whole-word reading process does not
have to identify the letters one at a time, just as the face-recognition
process in the right fusiform cortex does not have to identify each
feature of a face individually before the face is recognized. Instead,
we recognize several letters and their locations relative to each other.
The VWFA is critical in recognizing whole words in whole-word reading,
but that may not be its only function. Vogel and colleagues (2014)
suggest that the VWFA is potentially important in many different
processing tasks, not just reading. Damage to the VWFA produces surface
dyslexia and impaired whole-word reading. A study by Gaillard et al.
(2006) combined fMRI and lesion evidence from a single participant and
suggested that the left fusiform cortex does, indeed, contain this
region. A patient with a severe seizure disorder became a candidate for
surgery to remove the seizure focus. Before the surgery was performed,

viewed printed words and pictures of faces, houses, and tools while his
brain was being scanned. He knew that the seizure focus was located in a
region that played a critical role in reading, but his symptoms were so
severe that he elected to undergo the surgery. As expected, the surgery
produced a deficit in whole-word reading. A combination of structural
and functional imaging revealed that the lesion---a very small one---was
located in the fusiform gyrus, the location of the VWFA. PLASTICITY IN
THE VISUAL WORD FORM AREA

What did the region of the visual association cortex that we now know as
the VWFA do before people invented written language? What does it do in
people who do not read or write? As Dehaene and colleagues (2010) note:
Cultural inventions such as reading and mathematics are too recent to
have influenced the human genome. Therefore, they must be acquired
through the recycling of neuronal networks evolved for other purposes,
but whose initial properties are sufficiently similar to the target
function and which possess enough plasticity, particularly during
childhood, for their functionality to be partially converted to this
novel task. (p. 1837) The ability to co-opt brain regions for new
purposes allows humans across many different cultures, with many
different languages and writing systems, to learn to read and write
fluently. Fluency and literacy can develop very quickly in some cases,
further supporting the idea that the relevant neural pathways are
present prior to development of a new language. For example, consider
that at least two written languages were invented by specific
individuals. Hangul, the written form of the Korean language, was
invented by King Sejong (and his scholars) in the fourteenth century.
The characters of the Hangul alphabet are designed to look like the
shapes the mouth makes when they are pronounced. In the early nineteenth
century, Sequoyah, a Cherokee living in what is now the state of North
Carolina, spent 12 years developing a written version of his language.
He analyzed the sounds of his language

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 485

and selected 85 symbols---from English and Greek letters and some
additional symbols that he invented. He was not familiar with the sounds
that English and Greek letters represented, so the sounds he assigned to
them bore no relationship to those of the languages they came from.
Within a few months of the introduction of Sequoyah's alphabet,
thousands of people learned to read and write the Cherokee language.
Szwed and colleagues (2009) note that the most important cues to object
recognition (which is the primary task of the visual system) are those
that remain relatively constant even when we view objects from different
angles. The most reliable of these cues are the ways that lines meet at
vertices, forming junctions with particular shapes, such as L, T, and X.
Szwed and his colleagues presented incomplete drawings of objects and
letters that were missing their vertices (junctions or corners where
lines meet) or they presented drawing of objects and letters that were
missing portions of the midsegments (lines between these junctions).
Figure 14.32a shows a drawing and a word with the vertices missing. Can
you figure out what they are? What about in Figure 14.32b? Generally,
people identify these items more quickly in the second drawing that has
the junctions present. Changizi and colleagues (2006) analyzed the
configurations of letters and symbols used in a large number of former
and present writing systems from all over the world. They found that
these characters seem to have been chosen by the cultures that invented
them to match those found in objects in nature's scenes---and they all
involve junctions of lines. Early forms of writing used actual pictures,
but the pictures became simplified and eventually turned into simple
lines or intersecting lines and curves. Even complex symbols such as
Chinese characters consist of intersecting brush strokes. Figure 14.33
shows a few of the ways that different types of intersections of two
line segments can be transformed into letters found in various writing
systems. Presumably, the region of the brain that becomes the VWFA
through the process of learning to read originally evolved to recognize
objects by learning the configuration of lines (straight and curved) and
their junctions. Our ancestors invented forms of writing that use
symbols that are distinguished by these characteristics, and a portion
of the fusiform gyrus became "recycled" (as Dehaene and colleagues
phrased it) into the VWFA. Some children have great difficulty learning
to read and never become fluent readers, even though they are
intelligent. Specific language learning disorders, called developmental
dyslexias, tend to occur in families, a finding that suggests a genetic
(and hence biological) component. The concordance rate of developmental
dyslexia in monozygotic twins ranges from 84 percent to 100 percent, and
in dizygotic twins it ranges

from 20 percent to 35 percent (Démonet et al., 2004). Linkage and
association studies suggest that the chromosomes 3, 6, and 15 may
contain genes responsible for different components of this disorder
(Kang & Drayna, 2011). As we saw earlier, the fact that written language
is a recent invention means that natural selection is unlikely to have
given us brain mechanisms whose only role is to interpret written
language. Therefore, we should not expect that developmental dyslexia
involves only deficits in reading.

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 486

Indeed, researchers have found a variety of language deficits associated
with dyslexia that do not directly involve reading. One common deficit
is deficient phonological awareness. That is, people with developmental
dyslexia have difficulty blending or rearranging the sounds of words
that they hear (Eden & Zeffiro, 1998). For example, they have difficulty
recognizing that if we remove the first sound from "cat," we are left
with the word "at." They also have difficulty distinguishing the order
of sequences of sounds (Helenius et al., 1999). Problems such as these
might be expected to impair the ability to read phonetically. Children
with developmental dyslexia also tend to have difficulty in writing:
They make spelling errors, show poor spatial arrangements of letters,
and omit letters, and their writing tends to have weak grammatical
development (Habib, 2000). Developmental dyslexia is a heterogeneous and
complex trait, and it likely has more than one cause. However, most
studies that have closely examined the nature of the impairments seen in
people with developmental dyslexia have found phonological impairments
to be most common. For example, a study of 16 people with developmental
dyslexia by Ramus and colleagues (2003) found that all of the
participants had phonological deficits. Ten of the people also had
auditory deficits, four also had a motor deficit, and two also had a
visual deficit. These deficits---especially auditory
deficits---aggravated the people's difficulty in reading but did not
appear to be primarily responsible for the difficulty. Five of the
people had only phonological deficits, and these deficits were
sufficient to interfere with their ability to read. Some evidence has
been obtained from functionalimaging studies that suggests that the
brains of people with developmental dyslexia process written information

24/11/21 1:52 PM

Human Communication 487

differently than do the brains of proficient readers. For example,
Shaywitz and colleagues (2002) had 70 children with dyslexia and 74
children without dyslexia read words and pronounceable nonwords. The
researchers found significantly different patterns of brain activation
in the two groups. A child's reading skill was positively correlated
with activation of the left VWFA. Hoeft and colleagues (2007) found that
people with dyslexia showed decreased activation in the left
temporoparietal cortex (dorsal to the region identified by Shaywitz and
colleagues) and in the VWFA. They also saw hyperactivation of the left
inferior frontal cortex, including Broca's area. Presumably, the
activation of Broca's area reflected an effort to decode the phonology
of the incomplete information being received from the poorly functioning
regions of the more posterior brain regions involved in reading. Most
languages---including English---contain many irregular words. For
example, consider cough, rough, bough, and through. Because there is no
phonetic rule that describes how these words are to be pronounced,
readers of English are obliged to memorize them. In fact, the 40 sounds
that distinguish English words can be spelled in up to 1,120 different
ways. In contrast, Italian is much more regular; this language contains
25 different sounds that can be spelled in only 33 combinations of
letters (Helmuth, 2001). Paulesu and colleagues (2001) found that
developmental dyslexia is rare among people who speak Italian and is
much more common among speakers of English and French (another language
with many irregular words). Paulesu and his colleagues identified
college students with a history of dyslexia from Italy, France, and
Great Britain. The Italian students with dyslexia were much harder to
find, and their disorders were much less severe than those of their
English-speaking and French-speaking counterparts. However, functional
imaging revealed that when all three groups were asked to read, their
scans all showed the same pattern of activation: a decrease in the
activity of the left occipitotemporal cortex---the same general region
that Shaywitz and colleagues (2002) identified. Paulesu and colleagues
(2001) concluded that the brain anomalies that cause dyslexia are
similar in the three countries they studied but that the regularity of
Italian spelling made it much easier for people likely to develop
dyslexia in Italy to learn to read. By the way, other "dyslexiafriendly"
languages, such as Spanish, Finnish, Czech, and Japanese, might actually
help reduce the effects of dyslexia. For example, one study cites the
case of an Australian boy who lived in Japan and learned to read
Japanese, but he experienced dyslexia in English (Recer, 2001). If the
spelling of words in the English language were regularized (for example,
frend instead of friend, frate instead of freight, koff instead of
cough), the impact of dyslexia might be substantially reduced.

Toward an Understanding of Writing LO 14.13

Explain the biological basis of phonological and orthographic
dysgraphia.

Writing depends on knowledge of the words that are to be written, along
with the proper grammatical structure of the sentences they are to form.
If an individual is unable to express themselves by speech, there is
likely to be a writing disturbance (dysgraphia) as well. In addition,
most cases of dyslexia are accompanied by dysgraphia. One type of
writing disorder involves difficulties in motor control---in directing
the movements of a pen or pencil to form letters and words.
Investigators have reported surprisingly specific types of writing
disorders that fall into this category. For example, some patients can
write numbers but not letters, some can write uppercase letters but not
lowercase letters, some can write consonants but not vowels, some can
write in cursive but cannot print uppercase letters, and others can
write letters normally but have difficulty placing them in an orderly
fashion on the page (Alexander et al., 1992; Cubelli, 1991; Margolin &
Goodman-Schulman, 1992; Silveri, 1996). Many regions of the brain are
involved in writing. For example, damage that produces various forms of
aphasia will produce impairments in writing that are similar to those
seen in speech. Organization of the motor aspects of writing involves
the dorsal parietal lobe and the premotor cortex. These regions (and the
primary motor cortex, of course) become activated when people engage in
writing, and damage to these regions impairs writing (Katanoda et al.,
2001; Menon & Desmond, 2001; Otsuki et al., 1999). A functionalimaging
study by Rijntjes and colleagues (1999) had people sign their names with
either their index finger or their big toe. In both cases, doing so
activated the premotor cortex that controlled movements of the hand.
This finding suggests that when we learn to make a complex series of
movements, the relevant information is stored in regions of the motor
association cortex that control the part of the body that is being used
but that this information can be used to control similar movements in
other parts of the body. Longcamp and colleagues (2005) found that
simply looking at alphabetical characters activated the premotor cortex,
on the left side in right-handed people and on the right side in
left-handed people. (See Figure 14.34.) A more basic type of writing
disorder involves problems in the ability to spell words, as opposed to
problems with making accurate movements of the fingers. Like reading,
which involves phonetic and whole-word processes, writing (or, more
specifically, spelling) involves more than one method. The first method
is related to audition. When children acquire language skills, they
first learn to recognize the sounds of words, then learn to say

them, then learn to read, and then learn to write. Reading and writing
depend heavily on the skills that are learned earlier. For example, to
write most words, we must be able to "sound them out in our heads," that
is, to hear them and to articulate them subvocally. If you want to
demonstrate this to yourself, try to write a long word such as
antidisestablishmentarianism from memory and see whether you can do it
without saying the word to yourself. If you recite a poem or sing a song
to yourself (even subvocally) at the same time, you will see that the
writing comes to a halt. A second method of writing involves
transcribing an image of what a particular word looks like---copying a
visual mental image. Have you ever looked off into the distance to
picture a word so that you could remember how to spell it? Some people
may not use phonological spelling and have to write some words down to
see whether they look correct. This method involves visual memories, not
acoustical ones.

VISION IN WRITING

A third method of writing involves memorization of letter sequences. We
learn these sequences the way we learn poems or the lyrics to a song.
For example, many Americans learned to spell Mississippi with a singsong
chant that goes like this: M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i, emphasizing the
boldfaced letters. (Similarly, many speakers of English say the alphabet
with

MEMORIZATION IN WRITING

M14_CARL0287_13_GE_C14.indd 488

the rhythm of a children's song that is commonly used to teach it.) This
method involves memorizing sequences of letter names, not translating
sounds into the corresponding letters. Finally, the fourth method of
writing involves motor memories. We memorize motor sequences for writing
or typing very familiar words, such as our own names. Otsuki and
colleagues (2002) reported the case of a man who lost the ability to
type after a stroke that damaged the ventral left frontal lobe. His
ability to speak and understand speech, his ability to read, and his
ability to write on a physical surface were not affected, and he showed
no other obvious motor impairments besides his dystypia, as the
investigators named it. This case and others suggest that some regions
of the left cortex are uniquely involved in the motor memory for typing
(Cook et al., 2013; Higashiyama et al., 2015; Ryu et al., 2012). A
second case involving stroke affecting the junction between the left
parietal and occipital lobes resulted in symptoms of not only dystypia,
but also dystextia, deficits in motor memory for texting on a cell phone
(Thomas & Mestre, 2017). Writing normally involves holding a stylus (for
example, a pen or pencil) and moving its point across a screen, piece of
paper, or other surface. But we can also create visual records by typing
with a keyboard. The first three methods of writing (sounding out the
letters of a word, visualizing it, or reciting a memorized sequence of
letters) apply as well to typing as they do to writing. However, the
movements that we make with our hands and fingers are different when we
write or type. Skilled typists learn automatic sequences of movements
that produce frequently used words, but these are different from the
movements we would make when we write these words.

MOTOR MEMORY IN WRITING

Neurological evidence supports at least the first three of these methods
of writing. Brain damage can impair the first of these methods: phonetic
writing. This deficit is called phonological dysgraphia (Shallice,
1981). (Dysgraphia refers to a writing deficit, just as dyslexia refers
to a reading deficit.) People with this disorder are unable to sound out
words and write them phonetically. They cannot write unfamiliar words or
pronounceable nonwords, such as the ones presented in the module on
reading. They can, however, visually imagine familiar words and then
write them. Phonological dysgraphia appears to be caused by damage to
regions of the brain involved in phonological processing and
articulation. Damage to Broca's area, the ventral precentral gyrus, and
the insula cause this disorder, and phonological spelling tasks activate
these regions (Henry et al., 2007; Omura et al., 2004). Orthographic
dysgraphia is just the opposite of phonological dysgraphia: It is a
disorder of visually based

NEURAL BASIS OF WRITING

24/11/21 1:52 PM

Human Communication 489

writing. People with orthographic dysgraphia can only sound words out.
They can spell regular words such as care or tree, and they can write
pronounceable nonsense words. However, they have difficulty spelling
irregular words such as half or busy (Beauvois & Dérouesné, 1981); they
may write haff or bizzy. Orthographic dysgraphia (impaired phonological
writing), like surface dyslexia, is caused by damage to the VWFA on the
base of the temporal lobe (Henry et al., 2007). Both lesion and
functional-imaging studies implicate the posterior inferior temporal
cortex in writing of irregularly spelled English words or kanji symbols
(Nakamura et al., 2000; Rapcsak & Beeson, 2004). This region appears to
be involved not in the motor aspects of writing but in knowledge of how
irregular words are spelled or what strokes make up a kanji character.
The third method of spelling depends on a person's having memorized
sequences of letters that spell particular words. Cipolotti and
Warrington (1996) reported the case of a patient who lacked this
ability. The patient sustained a left hemisphere stroke that severely
disrupted his ability to spell words orally and impaired his ability to
recognize words that the examiners would spell aloud. Presumably,

his ability to spell written words depended on the first two methods of
writing: auditory and visual. The examiners noted that when they spelled
out words to him, he would make writing movements with his hand on top
of his knee. When they asked him to clasp his hands together so that he
could not make these writing movements, his ability to recognize
four-letter words being spelled aloud dropped from 66 percent to 14
percent. It appears that he was using feedback from hand movements to
recognize the words he was "writing" on his knee. As we saw in the
module on reading, some patients (those with direct dyslexia) can read
aloud without being able to understand what they are reading. Similarly,
some patients can write words that are dictated to them even though they
cannot understand these words (Lesser, 1989; Roeltgen et al., 1986).
They cannot communicate by means of writing, because they cannot
translate their thoughts into words. Some of these patients can even
spell pronounceable nonwords, which indicates that their ability to
spell phonetically is intact. Roeltgen and colleagues (1986) referred to
this disorder as semantic agraphia, but perhaps the term direct
dysgraphia would be more appropriate because of the parallel with direct
dyslexia. (See Table 14.3.)

and developmental dyslexia. Acquired dyslexias can fall into one of
several categories (surface, direct, phonological), and the study of
these disorders has provided information about brain mechanisms involved
in reading. Analysis of written words begins in the left posterior
inferior temporal cortex. Phonological information is then analyzed by
the temporoparietal

24/11/21 1:52 PM

490 Chapter 14 cortex and Broca's area, whereas word-form information is
analyzed by the visual word-form area, located in the fusiform cortex.
Surface dyslexia is a loss of whole-word reading ability. Phonological
dyslexia is loss of the ability to read phonetically. Reading of kana
(phonetic) and kanji (pictographic) symbols by Japanese people is
equivalent to phonetic and whole-word reading, and damage to different
parts of the brain interferes with these two forms of reading. Direct
dyslexia is analogous to transcortical sensory aphasia; the patients can
read words aloud but cannot understand what they are reading. Some can
read both real words and pronounceable nonwords, so both phonetic and
whole-word reading can be preserved. Developmental dyslexia is a
hereditary condition that may involve abnormal development of parts of
the brain that play a role in language. Most people with developmental
dyslexia have difficulty with phonological processing--- of spoken words
as well as written ones. Functional-imaging studies report decreased
activation of a region of the left ­occipitotemporal and temporoparietal
cortexes and hyperactivation of Broca's area may be involved in
developmental dyslexia. Children who learn to read languages that have
writing with regular correspondence between spelling and pronunciation
(such as Italian) are much less likely to ­develop dyslexia than are
those who learn to read languages with irregular spelling (such as
English or French).

Toward an Understanding of Writing LO 14.13 Explain the biological basis
of phonological and orthographic dysgraphia. Brain damage can disrupt
writing ability by impairing people's ability to form letters---or even
specific

types of letters, such as uppercase or lowercase letters or vowels. The
dorsal parietal cortex appears to be the most critical region for
knowledge of the movements that produce letters. Other deficits involve
the ability to spell words. We normally use at least four different
strategies to spell words: phonetic (sounding the word out), visual
(remembering how it looks on paper), sequential (recalling memorized
sequences of letters), and motor (recalling memorized hand movements in
writing very familiar words). Two types of dysgraphia--- phonological
and orthographic---represent difficulties in implementing phonetic and
visual strategies, respectively. The existence of these two disorders
indicates that several different brain mechanisms are involved in the
process of writing. Dystypia and dystextia involve specific deficits in
the motor ability to type or text without other reading or writing
disorders. In addition, some patients have a deficit parallel to direct
dyslexia: They can write words they can no longer understand.

Thought Question A 6-year-old boy from your neighborhood struggles with

understanding of how the brain processes reading, suggest what types of
instruction would be valuable for your neighbor to overcome his
condition.

Stephen Wiltshire is an eminent artist. He is famous for his ­meticulous,
perfectly scaled, and incredibly precise lifelike drawings of cities'
skylines. He can draw any megapolis such as ­London, Moscow, Paris,
Venice, or Amsterdam. A ­ stonishingly, he draws his panoramas entirely
from memory. A brief helicopter tour is enough for Stephen to memorize
any urban vista. When he is drawing, he puts his headphones on and then
his pencil glides over the canvas while he uses the finger of his other
hand for perspective. Quickly the image of a city panorama emerges as if
by magic. Stephen started drawing when he was only five years old. At
that age, drawing was the only way for him to communicate to other
people until he learnt to speak fully at the age of nine. This is

The Developing Nervous System 493

An Overview of Brain Development LO 15.1

Summarize the process of human brain development from ectoderm plate, to
neural tube, to three interconnected chambers.

The central nervous system (CNS) begins early in embryonic life as a
hollow tube and maintains this basic shape even after it is fully
developed. During development, parts of the tube elongate, pockets and
folds form, and the tissue around the tube thickens until the brain
reaches its final form. Development of the human nervous system begins
around the 18th day after conception. Part of the ectoderm (outer layer)
of the back of the embryo thickens and forms a plate. The edges of this
plate form ridges that curl toward each other along a longitudinal line,
running in a rostral-- caudal direction. By the 21st day these ridges
touch each other and fuse together, forming a tube---the neural tube---
which gives rise to the brain and spinal cord. The top part of the
ridges break away from the neural tube and become the ganglia of the
autonomic nervous system, described later in this chapter. (See Figure
15.1.) By the 28th day of development the neural tube is closed, and its
rostral end has developed three interconnected chambers. These chambers
become ventricles, and the tissue that surrounds them becomes the three
major parts of the brain: the forebrain, the midbrain, and the
hindbrain. (See Figures 15.2a and 15.2c.) As development progresses, the
rostral chamber (the forebrain) divides into three separate parts, which
become the two lateral ventricles and the third ventricle. The region
around the lateral ventricles becomes the telencephalon ("end brain"),
and the region around the third ventricle becomes the diencephalon
("interbrain"). (See Figures 15.2b and 15.2d.) In its final form, the
chamber inside the midbrain ­(mesencephalon) becomes narrow, forming the
cerebral aqueduct, and two structures develop in the hindbrain: the
metencephalon ("afterbrain") and the myelencephalon ­("marrowbrain").
(See Figure 15.2e.)

Explain how prenatal development contributes to complex human brains.

Human brain development begins with a thin tube and ends with a
structure weighing approximately 1,400 g (about 3 lb.) and consisting of
billions of cells. Where do these cells come from, and what controls
their growth? Let's consider the development of the cerebral cortex,
about which most is known. The principles described here are similar to
the ones that apply to development of other regions of the brain. (For
details of this process, see Cooper, 2008, and Rakic, 2009.) The

for body size, the cerebral cortex is larger in humans than in any other
species. As we will see later in this book, circuits of neurons in the
cerebral cortex play a vital role in perception, cognition, and control
of movement. Stem cells that line the inside of the neural tube give
rise to the cells of the CNS. The cerebral cortex develops from

the inside out. That is, the first cells to be produced migrate a short
distance and establish the first---and deepest--- layer. The next wave
of newborn cells passes through the first layer and forms the second
one---and so on, until all six layers of the cerebral cortex are laid
down. The last cells to be produced must pass through all the cells born
before them. The stem cells that give rise to the cells of the brain are
known as progenitor cells. (A progenitor is a direct ancestor of a line
of descendants.) During the first phase of development, progenitor cells
in the ventricular zone (VZ), located just outside the wall of the
neural tube, divide, making new progenitor cells and increasing the size
of the ventricular zone. Some progenitor cells migrate a short distance
away from the VZ, where they continue to divide into more progenitor
cells and establish the ­subventricular zone (SVZ). This phase is
referred to as symmetrical division because the division of each
progenitor cell produces two new progenitor cells. This form of division
increases the size of the ventricular and subventricular zones. Then, 7
weeks after conception, progenitor cells receive a signal to begin a
period of asymmetrical division. During this phase, progenitor cells
form two different kinds of cells as they divide: another progenitor
cell and a brain cell. The first brain cells produced through
asymmetrical division are radial glia. The cell bodies of radial glia
remain close to the wall of the neural tube, in the VZ and

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 494

SVZ, but they extend fibers radially outward from the ventricular zone,
like spokes in a wheel. These fibers end in cuplike feet that attach to
the pia mater, located at the outer surface of what becomes the cerebral
cortex. As the cortex becomes thicker, the fibers of the radial glia
grow longer and maintain their connections with the pia mater. (See
Figure 15.3.) The period of asymmetrical division lasts about 3 months.
Because the human cerebral cortex contains about 100 billion neurons,
there are about 1 billion neurons migrating along radial glial fibers on
a given day. The migration path of the earliest neurons is the shortest
and takes about 1 day. The neurons that produce the last, outermost
layer have to pass through five layers of neurons, and their migration
takes about 2 weeks. The end of cortical development occurs when the
progenitor cells receive a chemical signal that causes them to die---a
phenomenon known as apoptosis (literally, a "falling away"). Molecules
of the chemical that conveys this signal bind with receptors that
activate killer genes within the cells. (All cells have these genes, but
only certain cells possess the receptors that respond to the chemical
signals that turn them on.) At this time, radial glia are transformed
into astrocytes. Once neurons have migrated to their final locations,
they begin forming connections with other neurons. They grow dendrites,
which form synaptic connections with the terminal buttons from the axons
of other neurons, and they grow

cortex shows it early in its development. The radially oriented fibers
of glial cells help to guide the migration of newly formed neurons from
the ventricular zone to their final resting place in the cerebral
cortex. Each successive wave of neurons passes neurons that migrated
earlier, so the most recently formed neurons occupy layers closer to the
cortical surface. Source: Adapted from Rakic, P. (1995). A small step

axons of their own. Some neurons extend their dendrites and axons
laterally, connecting adjacent columns of neurons or even establishing
connections with other neurons in distant regions of the brain. The
growth of axons is guided by physical and chemical factors. Once the
growing ends of the axons (the growth cones) reach their targets, they
form numerous branches. Each of these branches finds a vacant place on
the membrane of the appropriate type of postsynaptic cell, grows a
terminal button, and establishes a synaptic c­onnection. Apparently,
different types of cells---or even different parts of a single
cell---secrete different chemicals, which attract ­different types of
axons (Benson et al., 2001). Of course, establishing a synaptic
connection also requires effort on the part of the postsynaptic cell;
this cell must contribute its parts of the synapse, including the
postsynaptic receptors. The chemical signals that the cells exchange to
tell one another to ­establish these connections are just now being
discovered.

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 495

Late

The ventricular zone gives rise to more neurons than are needed. In
fact, these neurons must compete to survive. The axons of approximately
50 percent of these neurons do not find vacant postsynaptic cells of the
right type with which to form synaptic connections, so they die by
apoptosis. This phenomenon (sometimes called "pruning"), too, involves a
chemical signal; when a ­presynaptic neuron establishes synaptic
connections, it receives a signal from the postsynaptic cell that
permits it to survive. The neurons that come too late do not find any
available space and therefore do not receive this lifesustaining signal.
(See Figure 15.4.) This scheme might seem wasteful, but apparently the
evolutionary process found that the safest strategy was to produce too
many neurons and let them fight to establish synaptic connections rather
than trying to produce exactly the right number of each type of neuron.

As we saw in Chapter 1, the human brain contains more neurons than any
other large animal when corrected for body size. Our brain is more than
three times larger than that of a chimpanzee, our closest relative. What
types of genetic changes are required to produce a large complex brain?
The brains of the earliest vertebrates were smaller and less complex
than those of later animals. The evolutionary process brought about
genetic changes that were responsible for the development of more
complex brains, with more parts and more interconnections. An important
factor in the evolution of more complex brains is genetic duplication
(Allman, 1999). As Lewis (1992) noted, most of the genes that a species
possesses perform important functions. If a mutation causes one of these
genes to do something new, the previous function will be lost, and the
animal might not survive. However, geneticists have discovered that
genes can sometimes duplicate themselves, and if these duplications
occur in cells that give rise to ova or sperms, the duplication can be
passed on to the organism's offspring. This means that the offspring
will have one gene to perform the important functions and another one to
"experiment" with. If a mutation of the extra gene occurs, the old gene
is still present and its important function is still performed. Rakic
(1988, 2009) suggests that the size differences in brains between
species could be caused by a very simple process. We just saw that the
size of the ventricular zone increases during symmetrical division of
the progenitor cells located there. The ultimate size of the brain is
determined by the size of the ventricular zone. As Rakic notes, each
symmetrical division doubles the number of progenitor cells and thus
doubles DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEX BRAINS

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 496

the size of the brain. The human brain is 10 times larger than that of a
rhesus macaque monkey. That means that between three and four additional
symmetrical divisions of ­progenitor cells would account for the
difference in the size of these two brains. In fact, the stage of
symmetrical d ­ ivision lasts about 2 days longer in humans, which
provides enough time for three more divisions. The period of
asymmetrical division is longer, too, which accounts for the fact that
the human cortex is 15 percent thicker. Delays in the termination of the
symmetrical and asymmetrical periods of development could be ­responsible
for the increased size of the human brain. A few simple mutations of the
genes that control the ­timing of brain development could be responsible
for these delays. Small mammals such as rodents have brains with a
relatively smooth outer surface, which limits the size of the cerebral
cortex that cover them. Larger brains, especially those of the larger
primates, have convoluted ­surfaces---covered by grooves and bulges.
Convolutions greatly increase the surface area of the cerebral cortex,
which means that the cortex of a convoluted brain contains many more
neurons than that of a smooth brain. The increased number of neurons in
the convoluted human cerebral cortex makes possible the complex
circuitry found in our brains. Two studies appear to have discovered an
important aspect of the process responsible for the development of
convoluted brains. The subventricular zone of convoluted brains is much
thicker than that of smooth brains. In fact, this zone can be divided
into two parts, the inner SVZ and the outer SVZ. (The inner SVZ is
located closer to the wall of the neural tube, and the outer SVZ is
located closer to the surface of the brain.) In relatively
smooth-brained animals such as rodents, all of the cells of the brain
derive from progenitor cells located in the ventricular and
subventricular zones. Because the cell bodies of the radial glia that
develop from the progenitor cells are locked in place, the surface of
the developing cortex remains more or less parallel to the wall of the
neural tube, which means that it will remain smooth. Fietz and
colleagues (2010) and Hansen and colleagues (2010) found that during
development of the human brain, some newborn progenitor cells migrated
into the inner SVZ, positioning themselves between the fibers of the
radial glia whose cell bodies were anchored in place. These unattached
progenitor cells undergo asymmetrical division, sending neurons into the
upper layer of the developing cortex. This source of neurons increases
the numbers of cells in the cerebral cortex, which forces it to bend and
fold into convolutions. The genes that control this process have not yet
been discovered.

Postnatal Brain Development LO 15.3

Provide examples of how genetic change, personal experience, and
neurogenesis can influence postnatal brain development.

Brain development continues after an animal is born. In fact, the human
brain continues to develop for at least two decades, and subtle
changes---for example, those produced by learning experiences---continue
to occur throughout life. (See Figures 15.4 and 15.5.) As we will see
later in this chapter, different regions of the cerebral cortex perform
specialized functions. Some receive and analyze visual information, some
receive and analyze auditory information, some control movement of the
muscles, and so on. Different regions receive different inputs, contain
different types of circuits of neurons, and have different outputs. What
factors control this pattern of development? The primary factors are
genetics, experience, and a process known as neurogenesis. Some brain
specialization is undoubtedly programmed genetically. The neurons
produced by the asymmetrical division of a particular progenitor cell
all follow a particular radial glial fiber, so they end up more or less
above the progenitor cell. If the progenitor cells in different regions
of the developing brain are themselves different, the neurons they
produce will reflect these differences. Experience also affects brain
development. For example, one cue for depth perception arises from the
fact that each eye gets a slightly different view of the world (Poggio &
Poggio, 1984). This form of depth perception, stereopsis, is the kind
obtained from a stereoscope or a three-dimensional movie. The particular
neural circuits that are necessary for stereopsis, which are located in
the cerebral cortex, will not develop unless an infant has experience
viewing objects with both eyes during a critical period early in life.
If an infant's eyes do not move together properly---if they are not
directed toward the same place in the environment (that is, if the eyes
are "crossed")---the infant won't develop stereoscopic vision,

even if the eye movements are later corrected by surgery on the eye
muscles. This critical period occurs sometime between 1 and 3 years of
age (Banks et al., 1975). Similar phenomena have been studied in
laboratory animals and have confirmed that sensory input affects the
connections established between cortical neurons. Evidence indicates
that a certain amount of neural rewiring can be accomplished even in the
adult brain. For example, after a person's arm has been amputated, the
region of the cerebral cortex that previously analyzed sensory
information from the missing limb soon begins analyzing information from
adjacent regions of the body, such as the stump of the arm, the trunk,
or the face. In fact, the person becomes more sensitive to touch in
these regions after the changes in the cortex take place (Elbert et al.,
1994; Kew et al., 1994; Yang et al., 1994). In addition, musicians who
play stringed instruments have a larger cortical region devoted to
analysis of sensory information from the fingers of the left hand (which
they use to press the strings), and when a blind person who can read
Braille touches objects with their fingertips, an enlarged region of the
cerebral ­cortex is activated (Elbert et al., 1995; Sadato et al., 1996).
As you read in Chapter 1, a debate about the production of new neurons
in the adult human brain is currently underway. While this information
may change with subsequent research, what follows here is a brief review
of the role of this phenomenon in postnatal brain development. For many
years, researchers believed that neurogenesis---production of new
neurons---could not ­ take place in the fully developed brain. However,
many studies have shown this belief to be incorrect---the adult brain
contains some stem cells (similar to the progenitor cells that give rise
to the cells of the developing brain) that can divide and produce
neurons. Detecting newly produced cells is done by administering a small
amount of a radioactive form of one of the nucleotide bases that cells
use to produce the DNA that is needed for neurogenesis. The next day,
the animals' brains are removed and examined with methods described in
Chapter 5. Such studies have found evidence for neurogenesis in two
parts of the adult brain: the hippocampus, primarily involved in
learning, and the olfactory bulb, involved in the sense of smell
(Doetsch & Hen, 2005). Evidence indicates that exposure to new odors can
increase the survival rate of new neurons in the olfactory bulbs, and
training on a learning task can enhance neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
(See Figure 15.6.) Chapter 13 has more to say about the role of
neurogenesis in learning. In addition, as we will see in Chapter 18,
depression or exposure to stress can suppress neurogenesis in the
hippocampus, and drugs that reduce stress and depression can reinstate
neurogenesis. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that growth of new
neurons can repair the effects of brain damage, such as that caused by
head injury or strokes.

Module Review: Development of the Nervous System An Overview of Brain
Development LO 15.1

Summarize the process of human brain development from ectoderm plate, to
neural tube, to three interconnected chambers.

The ectoderm begins to develop at approximately embryonic day 18. As
more cells are added to the neural plate, the edges of the plate begin
to curl together, forming the neural tube at approximately embryonic day
20. The neural tube fuses together at approximately embryonic day 28.
The tube then begins to develop three interconnected chambers that will
become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain in the fully developed
brain.

Prenatal Brain Development LO 15.2

Explain how prenatal development contributes to complex human brains.

The cerebral cortex of humans develops from the inside out, as
progenitor cells from the ventricular system move into their final
positions in the cortex. Initial brain cell development occurs during a
period of symmetrical division, followed by period of asymmetrical
division when the embryo is 7 weeks old. Asymmetrical division lasts for
approximately three months and produces radial glia, which help to
establish the cortex. Once neurons have migrated to their final
locations, they begin forming connections with other neurons. The axons
of approximately 50 percent

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 498

of the new neurons do not form synaptic connections, so they die by
apoptosis. Larger brains, especially those of the larger primates, are
convoluted. Convolutions increase the area of the cerebral cortex, which
means that the cortex of a convoluted brain contains many more neurons
than that of a smooth brain. The increased number of neurons in the
convoluted human cerebral cortex makes possible the complex circuitry
found in our brains.

Postnatal Brain Development LO 15.3

Provide examples of how genetic change, personal experience, and
neurogenesis can influence postnatal brain development.

Genetically, if the progenitor cells in different regions of the
developing brain are themselves different, the neurons they produce will
reflect these differences. Experience viewing objects with both eyes
contributes to the development of brain regions involved in stereopsis
and is an example of how personal experience can influence postnatal
brain development. Another example of the effect of experience on
postnatal brain development is that when a person who can read Braille
touches objects with their fingertips, an enlarged region of the
cerebral cortex is activated. Finally, new neurons are produced in the
hippocampus and olfactory bulb via neurogenesis throughout the lifespan.

Disorders of Development As you will read in this module, brain
development can be adversely affected by the presence of toxic chemicals
during pregnancy and by genetic abnormalities, both hereditary and
nonhereditary. In some instances the result is severe impairment of
cognitive development, or intellectual disability.

Toxic Chemicals LO 15.4

Describe the effects of alcohol on nervous system development.

One common cause of intellectual disability is the presence of toxins
that impair fetal development during pregnancy. A teratogen is any
chemical or toxin that detrimentally impacts development of an embryo.
For example, if a woman is infected by rubella (German measles) early in
pregnancy, the toxic chemicals released by the virus interfere with the
chemical signals that control development of the fetal brain. Most women
with access to health care are immunized for rubella to prevent them
from contracting it during pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to the Zika
virus is associated with impaired brain development that can result in
microcephaly or other significant anomalies in brain development (Mlakar
et al., 2016; Rasmussen et al., 2016). Research into the teratogenic
effects of the Zika virus is ongoing (Adibi et al., 2016). In addition
to the toxins produced by viruses, various drugs can adversely affect
fetal development. For example, intellectual disability in children can
be caused by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, especially
during the third to fourth week of pregnancy (Sulik, 2005). Some
investigators have suggested that damage to a developing nervous system
can be caused by a single alcohol binge during a critical period of
fetal development (Sokol et al., 2003). Babies born to women who
chronically use alcohol during pregnancy are typically smaller than
average and develop more slowly. Children exposed to alcohol prenatally
can develop fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, an inclusive term for a
range of neurodevelopmental changes characterized by altered facial
development and impaired brain development related to prenatal alcohol
exposure (Riley et al., 2011). Fetal alcohol syndrome is a specific
diagnosis within this category. The facial changes associated with this
disorder have relatively little impact on a child's

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 499

can contribute to problems in neural tube development, including spina
bifida (problems of spinal cord development) or anencephaly (problems of
brain development). How early in pregnancy might a neural tube defect
occur? (Hint: What is the age of an embryo when the neural tube
develops?)

development (Figure 15.7). The corresponding abnormalities in the
development of the brain produce much more serious consequences. Now
that we recognize the dangers of this syndrome, pregnant women are
advised to abstain from alcohol (and from other drugs with teratogenic
effects). Research suggests that alcohol disrupts typical brain
development by interfering with a neural adhesion ­ rotein---a protein
that helps to guide the growth of neup rons in the developing brain
(Abrevalo et al., 2008; Braun, 1996). Prenatal exposure to alcohol even
appears to have direct effects on neural plasticity. Sutherland and
colleagues (1997) found that the offspring of female rats that consumed
moderate amounts of alcohol during pregnancy showed smaller amounts of
long-term potentiation (described in Chapter 13). Fetal alcohol exposure
adversely alters the development of neuronal stem cells and progenitor
cells (Vangipuram & Lyman, 2010) and the functions of neuronal growth
factors such as BDNF and NGF (nerve growth factor; Carito et al., 2019),
even when the alcohol is consumed by the father (Abel, 2004; Ceccanti et
al., 2016). Altogether, the results of various lines of research suggest
that an array of factors are likely involved in the ­teratogenic effects
of prenatal alcohol exposure.

Inherited Metabolic Disorders LO 15.5

Contrast the symptoms, causes, and treatments of inherited metabolic
disorders.

Inherited mutations in the synthesis of some enzymes (also called
inherited metabolic disorders) can cause brain damage or impair brain
development. Typical cell functioning requires intricate interactions
among many biochemical systems. These systems depend on enzymes, which
are responsible for constructing or breaking down particular chemical
compounds. Enzymes are proteins and therefore are produced by mechanisms
involving the chromosomes, which contain the recipes for their
synthesis. When inherited mutations in the recipe for a particular
enzyme occur, the enzyme cannot be synthesized correctly. If the enzyme
is a critical one, the results can be very serious. There are at least a
hundred different inherited metabolic disorders that can affect the
development of the brain. The most common is called phenylketonuria
(PKU). This disease is caused by an inherited lack of an enzyme that
converts phenylalanine (an amino acid) into tyrosine (another amino
acid). Excessive amounts of phenylalanine

in the blood interfere with the myelination of neurons in the central
nervous system. Much of the myelination of the cerebral hemispheres
takes place after birth. When an infant born with PKU consumes foods
containing phenylalanine, the amino acid accumulates, and brain
development is adversely affected. The result is severe intellectual
disability, with an average IQ of approximately 20 by 6 years of age.
For comparison, the IQ scale is devised such that the average score in
the general population is approximately 100. Fortunately, PKU can be
treated by putting infants on a low-phenylalanine diet. The diet keeps
the blood level of phenylalanine low, and myelination of the central
nervous system takes place normally. Once myelination is complete, the
dietary restraints can be relaxed somewhat, because a high level of
phenylalanine no longer threatens brain development. During prenatal
development a fetus is protected by its mother's metabolism, which
removes the phenylalanine from its circulation. However, if the mother
has PKU, she must follow a strict diet during pregnancy so the baby's
brain will not be adversely affected. If the mother eats a typical diet,
rich in phenylalanine, the high blood level of this compound will not
harm her brain, but it will harm that of her fetus

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 500

Diagnosing PKU immediately after birth is imperative so that the
infant's brain is never exposed to high levels of phenylalanine.
Consequently, many governments have passed laws that mandate a PKU test
for all newborn babies. The test is inexpensive and accurate, and it has
prevented many cases of intellectual disability. Other genetic errors of
metabolism can be treated in similar fashion. For example, untreated
pyridoxine ­ ependency results in damage to cerebral white matter, to d
the thalamus, and to the cerebellum. It is treated by large doses of
vitamin B6. Another error of metabolism, galactosemia, is an inability
to metabolize galactose, a sugar found in milk. If it is not treated,
it, too, causes damage to cerebral white matter and to the cerebellum.
The treatment is use of a milk substitute that does not contain
galactose. (Galactosemia should not be confused with lactose
intolerance, which is caused by an insufficient production of lactase,
the digestive enzyme that breaks down lactose. Lactose intolerance leads
to digestive disturbance, not brain damage.) Some other inherited
metabolic disorders cannot yet be treated successfully. For example,
Tay-Sachs disease, which occurs mainly in children of Eastern European

09/11/2021 18:27

The Developing Nervous System 501

Jewish descent, causes the brain to swell and damage itself against the
inside of the skull and against the folds of the dura mater that encase
it. The neurological symptoms begin by 4 months of age and include an
exaggerated startle response to sounds, listlessness, irritability,
spasticity, seizures, dementia, and finally death. Tay-Sachs disease is
one of several metabolic "storage" disorders. All cells contain
lysosomes, sacs of material encased in membrane. These sacs constitute
the cell's wasteremoval system; they contain enzymes that break down
waste substances that cells produce in the course of their normal
activities. The broken-down waste products are then recycled (used by
the cells again) or excreted. Metabolic storage disorders are genetic
errors of metabolism in which one or more vital enzymes are missing.
Particular kinds of waste products cannot be destroyed, so they
accumulate in the lysosomes. The lysosomes get larger and larger, the
cells get larger and larger, and eventually the brain begins to swell
and become damaged. New animal models of the disease and treatment
strategies are being developed and may someday include gene therapy to
change the mutated gene or new strategies to prevent neurodegeneration
and inflammation (Solovyeva et al., 2018). Researchers investigating
hereditary errors of metabolism hope to prevent or treat these disorders
in several ways (Solovyeva et al., 2018). Some disorders may be treated
like PKU, by avoiding a constituent of the diet that cannot be
tolerated. Others may be treated by administering a substance that the
body requires. Still others may be cured with the techniques of genetic
engineering such as CRISPR-cas 9 (see Chapter 5).

Down Syndrome LO 15.6

of several relatively safe procedures for obtaining prenatal samples
from the placenta, amniotic fluid, or umbilical cord has allowed
physicians to identify cells with chromosomal abnormalities and to
determine whether the fetus has Down syndrome, using a karyotype to
examine the chromosomes. (See Figure 15.8.) Down syndrome, first
described in 1866 by John Langdon Down, occurs in approximately 1 out of
700 births in the United States. Individuals with this disorder often
have short stature and changes in physical facial development. They may
learn to speak later then their typically developing peers, but most
individuals with Down syndrome learn to speak by 5 years of age.
Generally, the brain of a person with Down syndrome is approximately 10
percent lighter than that of a typically developing peer, the
convolutions (gyri and sulci) are smaller and less folded, the frontal
lobes are smaller, and the superior temporal gyrus (the location of
Wernicke's area) is thinner. After age 30, the brain of a person with
Down syndrome develops abnormal microscopic structures and begins to
degenerate. Because this degeneration resembles that of Alzheimer's
disease, it will be discussed in the next module. If efforts to develop
effective therapies for Alzheimer's disease are successful, they might
also be useful in preventing the degeneration seen in the brains of
people with Down syndrome.

Figure 15.8 Karyotype of Down Syndrome A karyotype allows a physician to
examine the number of chromosomes present in a sample of genetic
material. In this example, notice that there are three copies of
chromosome 21 (red arrow). This is the karyotype of a female with Down
syndrome.

Identify the symptoms, interventions, and cause of Down syndrome.

Down syndrome is a congenital disorder that results in abnormal
development of the brain, producing intellectual disability in varying
degrees. Congenital does not necessarily mean hereditary; it only refers
to a disorder that is present at birth. Down syndrome is caused by the
presence of an extra 21st chromosome. A small portion of chromosome 21,
which includes approximately 300 genes, contains the region responsible
for the developmental changes associated with Down syndrome (Belichenko
et al., 2010). The syndrome is associated with the mother's age; in the
majority of cases, an error in meiosis produces an ovum that has two
(rather than one) 21st chromosomes (this same error can occur in sperm
cells as well, but it is less common). The likelihood of this error
increases in women over 35. When fertilization occurs, the addition of
the father's 21st chromosome makes three, rather than two, 21st
chromosomes. The extra chromosome presumably causes biochemical changes
that impair brain development. The development

The results of several studies suggest that some drug treatments may be
beneficial in addressing learning and memory impairment associated with
Down syndrome. Mouse models of Down syndrome suggest that overactivity
of the GABA system may impair hippocampal synaptic plasticity and
associated learning and memory. Treatment with GABA antagonists enhanced
long-term potentiation and improved performance on memory tasks that
involved the hippocampus (Kleschevnikov et al., 2012). While this
research with animal models is promising, the therapeutic potential of
GABA antagonist drugs is limited by their potential side effects. Drugs
that reduce GABA activity can result in seizures, and individuals with
Down

syndrome are at increased risk for seizures compared to the general
population (Martínez-Cué et al., 2014). Another potential drug treatment
to improve learning and memory in a mouse model of Down syndrome is the
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. Researchers found
increased performance on memory tasks and long-term potentiation in the
hippocampus of mice that had additional copies of chromosomes (a model
of Down syndrome) following fluoxetine administration. Fluoxetine
treatment also reduced GABA concentrations in the brains of the mice,
suggesting that this treatment might be beneficial in future clinical
trials (Begenisic et al., 2014). For a review of the disorders of
development discussed in this module, see Table 15.1.

During pregnancy fetal brain development can be negatively impacted by
exposure to alcohol, particularly during critical periods. Alcohol
interferes with neural adhesion protein, neurotrophic factors, and
neural plasticity, resulting in abnormal brain development.

Inherited Metabolic Disorders LO 15.5

Contrast the symptoms, causes, and treatments of inherited metabolic
disorders.

Several inherited metabolic disorders can impair brain development. For
example, phenylketonuria is caused by the lack of an enzyme that
converts phenylalanine into tyrosine. PKU interferes with myelin
development, and if untreated, results in intellectual disability. This
disorder can be treated with diet low in phenylalanine. Pyridoxine
dependency causes damage to white matter, the thalamus, and the
cerebellum and can be treated with vitamin B6. Galactosemia can also
damage white matter and the cerebellum, and can be treated with a diet
that does not contain milk sugar. Storage disorders, such as Tay-Sachs
disease, are caused by the inability of cells to destroy

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 502

waste products within the lysosomes, which causes the cells to swell and
eventually die. Treatment for Tay-Sachs is not currently available.

Down Syndrome LO 15.6

Identify the symptoms, interventions, and cause of Down syndrome.

Down syndrome is produced by the presence of an extra 21st chromosome.
The brain development of people with Down syndrome is altered and
results in cognitive impairment. After age 30 the brains of people with
Down syndrome typically develop features similar to those of people with
Alzheimer's disease. Research with animal models of Down syndrome
suggests that GABA antagonists or selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors might be useful in some aspects of learning and memory in
Down syndrome.

The Developing Nervous System 503

Autism Spectrum Disorder Neurodevelopmental disorders encompass a
variety of diagnoses that may include variation (neurodiversity) or
changes to the developing nervous system that produce a variety of
symptoms related to sensory, motor, social, cognitive, or emotional
processing, learning, memory, ­attention, motivation, or communication.
The differences or symptoms are typically present early in life, and
various neurodevelopmental disorders may co-occur (Bölte et al., 2019).
The following modules of this c­ hapter describe two neurodevelopmental
disorders: autism s­pectrum disorder (ASD) and
attention-deficit/hyperactivity ­ ­disorder (ADHD). The case of Leo at the
beginning of this chapter illustrates some of the characteristics of
ASD. The symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (often simply
referred to as autism) include differences in social interactions and
communication with other people and the presence of repetitive,
stereotyped behaviors, fixated interests, or strict adherence to
routines. Some people with ASD also have cognitive impairments. The
syndrome was named and characterized by Kanner (1943), who chose the
term a­ utism (auto, "self," -ism, "condition") to refer to the child's
apparent self-absorption. Today, ASD is considered a neurodevelopmental
disorder by some, while others consider autism part of the spectrum of
neurodiversity present among all individuals. Discussion of how to
conceptualize and describe characteristics of autism is active and
ongoing. The neuroscience research described in the following sections
primarily views autism as a neurodevelopmental disorder, however there
are a wide variety of perspectives on how to characterize autism. The
prevalence of ASD is approximately 1 percent in the United States and
other countries (Brugha et al., 2011). The disorder is four times more
common in men and boys than in women and girls. However, if only cases
of autism with intellectual disability are considered, the ratio is 2:1,
and if only cases of autism with average or aboveaverage intelligence
and typical communicative ability are considered, the ratio is
approximately 7:1 (Fombonne, 2005). These data suggest that differences
in social characteristics of ASD are much more common in males, but the
cognitive and communicative differences are more evenly shared by males
and females. A related diagnosis, Rett syndrome, is a genetic
neurological syndrome present only in girls. At one time, clinicians
believed that ASD was more prevalent in families with higher
socioeconomic status, but more recent studies have found that the
frequency of diagnosis is the same in all socioeconomic classes. The
reported incidence of ASD has increased in the past two decades, but
evidence indicates that the apparent

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 503

increase is a result of heightened awareness of autism and broadening of
the diagnostic criteria. Despite concerns that childhood vaccines cause
ASD, studies have failed to find evidence that autism is linked to
childhood immunization with vaccines. In fact, the investigator who
originally claimed to have obtained evidence for a linkage between
immunization and autism was found guilty of dishonesty by the U.K.
General Medical Council, and the article that first made this claim was
discredited and retracted by the journal that published it, The Lancet
(Dwyer, 2010).

Symptoms LO 15.7

List the symptoms of ASD.

According to the DSM-5, a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder requires
the presence of two broad categories of symptoms affecting social
interaction and communication, and repetitive patterns of behavior,
interests, or activities present from early childhood. Diagnosis also
requires that the symptoms are significant enough that they negatively
impact quality of life (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, p. 53).
Social symptoms are typically the first to emerge. Infants later
diagnosed with ASD may appear ambivalent to being held, or they may arch
their backs when picked up, as if they do not want to be held, or may
not look or smile at their caregivers or seek someone else for comfort
if ill, hurt, or tired. As they get older, children with ASD may have
limited ­social relationships with other children or may avoid or reduce
eye contact with people. Language development in autism spectrum
disorder may be altered, delayed, or nonexistent. Language symptoms of
ASD could include echoing what is said or referring to oneself in the
second or third person. For example, someone with ASD might interpret,
"You want some milk?" to mean "I want some milk." In ASD, some
individuals may memorize and repeat words and phrases. Other
language-related symptoms of ASD can include talking about
preoccupations without understanding other people's interests or
interpreting other people's speech literally. Autism spectrum disorder
can include highly specific interests and behaviors. One example is
stereotyped movements, such as flapping a hand back and forth or rocking
back and forth. Other examples can include investigating objects by
sniffing them, feeling their texture, or moving them back and forth, or
being extremely attached to a particular object and insistent on
carrying it around. People may become preoccupied in lining up objects
or in forming patterns with them, not noticing events going on nearby.
Individuals with ASD may insist on following precise routines and become
distressed when they are hindered from doing so. Although ASD can
involve impaired

cognitive abilities, not everyone with this diagnosis experiences
deficits, and people with ASD may be physically adept, graceful, or have
exceptional cognitive skills. (See Table 15.2.)

Genetic and Environmental Factors LO 15.8

Describe the roles of genetic and environmental factors in ASD.

Evidence indicates that autism spectrum disorder is strongly heritable.
The best evidence for genetic factors comes from twin studies. These
studies indicate that the concordance rate for ASD in monozygotic twins
is approximately 70--90 percent, while the rate in dizygotic twins
studied so far is approximately 5--10 percent (Sebat et al., 2007). A
study by Ozonoff and colleagues (2011) found that an infant with an
older sibling with ASD has an 18.7 percent likelihood of developing the
disorder. Having multiple older siblings with ASD increased the
liklihood to 32.2 percent. Genetic studies indicate that ASD can be
caused by a wide variety of rare mutations, especially those that alter
neural development and communication (Betancur et al., 2009). Mutations
to non-coding regions of the genome may also be involved (Brandler et
al., 2018; Nakanishi et al., 2019). The fact that autism spectrum
disorder is highly heritable is presumptive evidence that the disorder
is a result of structural or biochemical changes in the brain. In
addition, a variety of medical disorders---especially those that occur
during prenatal development---can produce the symptoms of autism.
Evidence suggests that approximately 10 percent of all cases of ASD have
definable biological causes, such as rubella (German measles) during
pregnancy, prenatal thalidomide, encephalitis caused by the herpes
virus, and tuberous sclerosis, a genetic disorder that causes the
formation of benign tumors in many organs, including the brain (DeLong,
1999; Fombonne, 2005; Rapin, 1999). Ploeger and colleagues (2010)
suggest that interference with a particular stage of prenatal
development can cause ASD. Early organogenesis is a stage of embryonic
­development that occurs during days 20--40 after fertilization. During
this stage, major organs are beginning to develop, and factors that
alter development can cause many abnormalities, including limb

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 504

deformities, malformations of the skull and face, and brain pathologies.
In the 1960s, many pregnant women took thalidomide, a drug that
suppressed the symptoms of morning sickness. Unfortunately, it was
discovered later that this drug caused severe birth defects---including
autism spectrum disorder. Because most women knew when they had taken
thalidomide, the time of drug exposure could be correlated with ASD
diagnosis in the women's children. It turned out that the sensitive
period, during which exposure to thalidomide was most likely to cause
the development of autism, was 20 to 36 days postfertilization, which
coincides with the stage of early organogenesis. Presumably,
drug-induced alteration in brain development at this time set the stage
for later ­development of ASD.

Brain Changes LO 15.9

Describe differences in the brain associated with ASD.

Evidence links several types of changes in the development of the brains
of children with autism spectrum disorder. Courchesne and colleagues
(2005, 2007) note that in ASD, although the brain is, on average,
slightly smaller at birth, it begins to grow unusually quickly, and by 2
to 3 years of age it is about 10 percent larger than the brain of an
agematched child without ASD. Following this early spurt, grown in the
brain of a person with ASD slows down, so by adolescence it is only
about 1--2 percent larger than that of a peer without ASD. Not all parts
of the brain show the same pattern of growth in autism spectrum
disorder. The regions that appear to be most involved in the behaviors
associated with autism show the greatest growth early in life and the
slowest growth between early childhood and adolescence. For example, the
frontal cortex and temporal cortex grow quickly during the first 2 years
of life but then show little or no increase in size during the next 4
years in ASD, whereas these two regions grow by 20 percent and 17
percent, respectively, among peers not diagnosed with ASD. However, the
growth pattern of some regions of the cerebral cortex, such as the
striate cortex and extrastriate cortex, remain unchanged in ASD. The
amygdala also shows an unusual pattern of growth during development. By
4 years of age it is larger in ASD. By early adulthood it is the same
size as the amygdala of peers with ASD but contains fewer neurons
(Schumann & Amaral, 2006). The brains of people with autism also show
changes in white matter. In a study of the brain in ASD, Herbert and
colleagues (2004) found that the volume of white matter containing
short-range axons was increased but that the volume of white matter
containing long-range axons that

(2005, 2007) suggest that producing excessive numbers of neurons early
in development may cause the development of such a large number of
short-range axons that the development of long-range axons is inhibited.
The apparent hyperconnectivity of local regions of the cerebral cortex
might possibly account for the exceptional isolated talents and skills
shown by some people diagnosed with ASD. Frith and colleagues (1991)
suggested that some of the social differences of autism spectrum
disorder stem from changes in the brain that may make it more difficult
for people to form a "theory of mind." Theory of mind includes the
ability "to predict and explain the behavior of other humans in terms of
their mental states" (p. 434), which impacts the ability to infer the
thoughts, feelings, and intentions of other people from their emotional
expressions, tone of voice, and behavior. Imaging studies have
demonstrated that unlike typically developing brains, autistic brains
have a different pattern of activation (Kana et al., 2014), including
reduced amygdala activity while assessing the mental state of a person
in a photograph, a task that requires using a theory of mind (BaronCohen
et al., 1999). Researchers have employed structural- and
functionalimaging methods to investigate the neural basis of symptoms in
autism spectrum disorder. For example, Castelli and colleagues (2002)
showed typically developing volunteers and people with ASD animations
that depicted two triangles interacting in various goal-directed ways
(for example, chasing or fighting) or in a way that suggested that one
triangle was trying to trick or coax the other. One typically developing
volunteer described an animation in this way: "Triangles cuddling inside
the house. Big wanted to persuade little to get out. He didn't want to .
. . cuddling again" (p. 1843). People with ASD were able to accurately
describe the goal-directed interactions of the triangles, but they had
difficulty accurately describing the "intentions" of a triangle trying
to trick or coax the other. In other words, they had difficulty forming
a theory of mind. Functional imaging during presentation of the
animations showed normal activation of early levels of the visual
association cortex (the extrastriate cortex), but activation of the
superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the medial prefrontal cortex was much
lower among people with autism. (See Figure 15.9.) Previous research has
shown that the STS plays an important role in detection of stimuli that
indicate the actions of another individual (Allison et al., 2000). A
possible lack of interest in or understanding of other people by people
with autism spectrum disorder can be reflected in the response to the
sight of the human face. As we saw in Chapter 6, the fusiform face area
(FFA), in the extrastriate cortex, is involved in the recognition of

individual faces. A functional-imaging study by Schultz (2005) found
little or no activity in the FFA in a sample of adults with autism
spectrum disorder as they looked at pictures of human faces. (See Figure
15.10.) People with ASD may have difficulty recognizing facial
expressions of emotion or the direction of another person's gaze or have
low rates of eye contact with other people. In autism, it seems possible
that the FFA responds differently to the sight of the human face because
very little time may be spent studying other people's faces and so
expertise in interpersonal interactions does not develop. Grelotti and
colleagues (2005) reported the case of a boy with ASD who had an extreme
interest in Digimon cartoon characters. Functional imaging showed no
activation of the FFA when the boy viewed photos of faces, but photos of
Digimon characters evoked strong activation of this region. This case
suggests that if the sight of faces does not activate the FFA in people
with autism, it could be related to a lack of experience with faces, not
by abnormalities in the FFA. A study by Pelphrey and colleagues (2002)
found that people with autism spectrum disorder who were asked to
identify the emotions shown in photographs of faces tended not to look
at other people's eyes, which are informative in making judgments of
emotion. This tendency likely contributes to difficulty analyzing social
information that can occur in autism. Altered development of the
amygdala in people with autism may be at least partly responsible for
generally low rates of eye contact with other people and difficulty in
assessing other people's emotional state.

Volume of right caudate nucleus

Many investigators have noted that the presence of repetitive,
stereotyped behavior and obsessive preoccupations with particular
subjects in autism spectrum disorder resemble the symptoms of
obsessive-compulsive disorder. As described in Chapter 18, the symptoms
of OCD appear to be related to increased activity of the caudate
nucleus. Research suggests that the same may be true for the behavioral
symptoms of autism. Several studies have observed increased volume of
the caudate nucleus in autism (Langen et al., 2007; Sears et al., 1999).
In fact, Hollander and colleagues (2005) found that the volume of the
right caudate nucleus was positively correlated with ratings of
repetitive behavior in patients with ASD. (See Figure 15.11.) Chapters 8
and 11 describe the role of a circuit of mirror neurons in the
perception of emotions and behavioral intentions. This circuit is
typically activated when individuals see another person produce an
expression of emotion or perform a goal-directed action, and feedback
from this activity helps individuals understand what the person feels or
is trying to accomplish. In other words, the mirror neuron system may be
involved in people's ability to understand what others are trying to do
and to empathize with their emotions. Iacoboni and Dapretto (2006)
suggested that the social characteristics of autism may be a result of
altered development of the mirror neuron system. A functionalimaging
study by Dapretto and colleagues (2006) observed reduced activation in
the mirror motor neuron system of children with ASD, and a structural
MRI study by Hadjikhani and colleagues (2006) found that the cerebral
cortex in the mirror neuron system was thinner in people with ASD. A
study by Senju and colleagues (2007) found that children with autism did
not yawn when they

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 506

saw a video of other people yawning. A group of people without ASD
showed an increased rate of yawning during or immediately after seeing
videos that depicted yawning but not those that depicted other kinds of
mouth movements. Presumably, the mirror neuron system is involved in
this type of imitation. Baron-Cohen (2002) noted that the behavioral
characteristics of people with autism spectrum disorder appear to
amplify traits that tend to be associated with males. As we saw, the
overall incidence of ASD is four times more prevalent in males.
Baron-Cohen hypothesized that ASD may be a reflection of an "extreme
male brain." According to Baron-Cohen, people with ASD show an
exaggerated pattern of masculine interests and behaviors. For example, a
lack of interest in other people and an obsession with counting and
lining up objects in a row that is seen in many people with autism are
seen as extreme examples of masculine traits. However, this theory has
received criticism on the grounds that it does not address all aspects
of gender identity and the "masculine traits" or lack of empathy are not
universal in autism. We saw in Chapter 10 that sexual differentiation of
the brain is largely controlled by exposure to prenatal androgens.
Auyeung and colleagues (2009) used two tests that measure symptoms of
autism spectrum disorder to assess the behavior of typically developing
children whose mothers had undergone amniocentesis (removal of a small
amount of amniotic fluid during pregnancy). Auyeung and colleagues found
a significant positive correlation in both boys and girls between fetal
testosterone levels and scores on these tests. In addition, Knickmeyer
and colleagues (2006) found that females with congenital adrenal
hyperplasia, who were exposed to abnormally high levels of androgens
during fetal development,

09/11/2021 18:27

The Developing Nervous System 507

had a greater number of traits associated with autism. Even if
Baron-Cohen's hypothesis is correct, we cannot conclude that autism is
caused by prenatal exposure to excessive amounts of testosterone. An
"extreme masculine brain" could be caused by genetic abnormalities that
increase the sensitivity of a developing brain to androgens, and there
could be (and probably are) other causes of autism that have nothing to
do with masculinization of the brain. Recent studies have produced
contradictory results and suggested that previous conclusions were based
on small, under powered studies. For example, Nadler and colleagues
(2019) assessed a causal role of testosterone in cognitive empathy. The
authors reported no effect of testosterone administration on measures of
cognitive empathy (a measure used in many prior studies) in two large
samples of men. In addition to changes in steroid hormones, changes in
neuropeptide signaling may be involved in the symptoms of autism. As we
saw in Chapter 10, oxytocin, a peptide that serves as a hormone and
neuromodulator, facilitates pair bonding and increases trust and
closeness to others. Modahl and colleagues (1998) reported

that children with ASD had lower levels of this peptide. Studies suggest
that oxytocin can increase sociability of people with ASD. Guastella and
colleagues (2010a) found that administering oxytocin increased the
performance of adolescent boys with ASD on a test of emotional
recognition. Andari and colleagues (2010) found that oxytocin increased
the performance of adults with ASD on a computerized ball-toss game that
required social interactions with fictitious partners. In contrast, a
large randomized controlled trial found little effect of oxytocin on
social symptoms, but improvement on repetitive behaviors in ASD (Yamasue
et al., 2019). Other researchers have suggested that changes in the
genetic code for the oxytocin receptor may underlie social differences
in ASD (Campbell et al., 2011). New treatment approaches to autism have
begun to focus on these brain-based changes. Several research groups are
pursuing oxytocin-based interventions (Gordon et al., 2013; Preti et
al., 2014) or deep brain stimulation of the prefrontal cortex (Enticott
et al., 2014) as new avenues of treatment for symptoms of autism.

Module Review: Autism Spectrum Disorder Symptoms LO 15.7

List the symptoms of ASD.

Symptoms of ASD include altered social interaction and communication, as
well as restricted, repetitive interests, activities, or patterns of
behavior. Symptoms are present early in life.

Genetic and Environmental Factors LO 15.8

Describe the roles of genetic and environmental factors in ASD.

Genetic studies have shown that autism is highly heritable but that many
different genes are involved. ASD can also be caused by events that
interfere with prenatal development, such as prenatal thalidomide
exposure or maternal rubella infection.

Brain Changes LO 15.9

Describe differences in the brain associated with ASD.

MRI studies indicate that the brains of babies who are later diagnosed
with ASD show more rapid growth until 2 to 3 years of age and then grow
more slowly than the brains of typically-developing children. The
amygdala

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 507

follows a similar pattern of development. Regions of the brain involved
in higher-order processes, such as communicative functions and
interpretation of social stimuli, develop more quickly in people with
ASD but then development slows. People with ASD may tend not to pay
attention to other people's faces, as reflected in the lack of
activation of the fusiform face area when they do so, and their ability
to perceive emotional expressions on other people's faces is altered.
The volume and connectivity of white matter in the brain is changed in
ASD. Activation of the STS and prefrontal cortex in tasks requiring
theory of mind is different in ASD. Reduced activation of the mirror
neuron system may be involved in ASD. Increased activity in the caudate
nucleus may be involved in some of the behavioral symptoms of ASD.
Reduced levels of the neuropeptide oxytocin or changes in the oxytocin
receptor may also be involved in symptoms of ASD.

Thought Question To develop future treatments for ASD, it would be
highly beneficial to have an identical disease model to test novel
treatments for their efficacy and safety. Based on what you have learned
in Chapter 5, suggest an optimal yet ethical model for testing future
ASD drugs.

Attention-Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder Some children have significant
difficulty concentrating, remaining still, and working on a task. At one
time or another, most children exhibit these characteristics. But
children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) display
these symptoms so often that they interfere with the children's ability
to learn. Symptoms of ADHD can affect individuals in both childhood and
adulthood.

Symptoms LO 15.10 List the symptoms of ADHD. ADHD is the most common
behavior disorder that shows itself in childhood. It is often first
discovered in the classroom, where children are expected to sit quietly
and pay attention to the teacher or to work steadily on a project. Some
children's inability to meet these expectations then becomes evident.
They have difficulty withholding a response, act without reflecting,
often show reckless and impetuous behavior, and let interfering
activities intrude into ongoing tasks. According to the DSM-5, the
diagnosis of ADHD requires the presence of six or more of nine symptoms
of inattention and/or six or more of nine symptoms of hyperactivity and
impulsivity that have persisted for at least 6 months. (See Table 15.3.)
Descriptions of inattention symptoms include such things as "often had
difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities" or "is
often easily distracted by extraneous stimuli." Symptoms of
hyperactivity and impulsivity include such things as "often runs about
or climbs excessively in situations in which it is inappropriate" or
"often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations
or games)" (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, pp. 59--60.) The
prevalence of ADHD is approximately 5 percent of children in most
cultures (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Boys are about 10
times more likely than girls to receive a diagnosis of ADHD, but in
adulthood

the ratio is approximately 2 to 1, which suggests that many girls with
this disorder are not diagnosed. Because the symptoms can vary---some
children's symptoms are primarily those of inattention, some are those
of hyperactivity, and some show mixed symptoms---most investigators
believe that this disorder has more than one cause. Diagnosis is often
difficult because the symptoms are not well defined. ADHD is often
associated with aggression, conduct disorder, learning disabilities,
depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Approximately 60 percent of
children with ADHD continue to display symptoms of this disorder into
adulthood, at which time a disproportionately large number develop
antisocial personality disorder and may be diagnosed with a substance
abuse disorder (Ernst et al., 1998). Adults with ADHD are also more
likely to show cognitive impairments and lower occupational attainment
than would be predicted by their education (Seidman et al., 1998).
According to Sagvolden and his colleagues (Sagvolden & Sergeant, 1998;
Sagvolden et al., 2005), the impulsive and hyperactive behaviors that
are seen in children with ADHD are the result of a delay of
reinforcement gradient that is steeper than normal. As we saw in Chapter
13, the occurrence of an appetitive stimulus can reinforce the behavior
that just preceded it. For example, a piece of food can reinforce the
lever press that a rat just made, and a smile can reinforce a person's
attempts at conversation. Reinforcing stimuli are most effective if they
immediately follow a behavior: The longer the delay, the less effective
the reinforcement. Sagvolden and Sergeant suggest that deficiencies in
dopaminergic transmission in the brains of people with ADHD increase the
steepness of their delay of reinforcement gradient, which means that
immediate reinforcement is even more effective in these children, but
even slightly delayed reinforcement loses its potency. (See Figure
15.12.) Why would a steeper delay of reinforcement gradient produce the
symptoms of ADHD? According to Sagvolden and his colleagues, for people
with a steep gradient, reinforcement with a short delay will be even
more effective, thus producing overactivity. On the other

hand, people will be less likely to engage in behaviors that are
followed by delayed reinforcement, as many of our behaviors (especially
classroom activities) are. In support of this hypothesis, Sagvolden and
colleagues (1998) trained typically developing boys and boys with ADHD
on an operant conditioning task. When a signal was present, responses
would be reinforced every 30 seconds with coins or small prizes. When
the signal was not present, responses were never reinforced. The
typically developing boys learned to respond only when the signal was
present. When the signal was off, they waited patiently until it came on
again. In contrast, the boys with ADHD showed impulsive
behavior---intermittent bursts of rapid responses whether the signal was
present or not. According to the investigators, this pattern of
responding was what would be expected by a steep delay of reinforcement
gradient.

dopamine in the human prefrontal cortex have effects on behavior comes
from studies of people with two different variants of the gene for an
enzyme that affects dopamine levels in the brain. COMT
(catechol-O-methyltransferase) is an enzyme that breaks down
catecholamines (including dopamine and norepinephrine) in the
extracellular fluid. Although reuptake is the primary means of removing
catecholamines from the synapse, COMT also plays a role in deactivating
these neurotransmitters after they are released. Mattay and colleagues
(2003) noted that the clinical effects of amphetamine (which are similar
to those of methylphenidate) are variable. In some people, amphetamine
increases positive mood and facilitates performance on cognitive tasks,
but in other people it has the opposite effect. Mattay and colleagues
tested the effect of amphetamine on tasks that made demands on working
memory in people with two different variants of the COMT gene. They
found that people with the val-val variant, who have lower brain levels
of catecholamines, performed better when they were given low doses of
amphetamine. In contrast, administration of amphetamine to people with
the met-met variant, who have higher brain levels of catecholamines,
actually impaired their performance. Presumably, the first group was
pushed up the U-shaped curve, and the second group, already around the
top of the curve, was pushed down the other side. (See Figures 15.13 and
15.14.)

The graph shows the differential effects of amphetamine on the
performance on a working-memory task of people with two different

Genetic and Environmental Factors

There is strong evidence from both family studies and twin studies that
hereditary factors play an important role in determining a person's
likelihood of developing ADHD. The estimated heritability of ADHD is
high, ranging from 75 percent to 91 percent (Thapar et al., 2005).
Genetic differences in enzymes involved in catecholamine transmission
may help us understand factors associated with ADHD. Good evidence that

Brain Changes LO 15.12 Describe differences in the brain associated with
ADHD. Castellanos and colleagues (2002) reported decreased total brain
volume among children with ADHD compared to typically developing peers.
A study by Shaw and colleagues (2007) found differences in the
development of the brains of children with ADHD as well. The
investigators found that cortical growth was delayed in children with
ADHD. In fact, the cortical thickness of the brains of children with
ADHD at age 10.5 years was about the same as that of the brains of
unaffected children at 7.5 years. Ultimately, the growth of the brains
of the children with ADHD caught up with those of unaffected children.
The symptoms of ADHD resemble those produced by damage to the prefrontal
cortex: distractibility, forgetfulness, impulsivity, poor planning, and
hyperactivity (Aron et al., 2004). As we saw in Chapter 13, the
prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in short-term memory. We use
short-term memory to remember what we have just perceived, to remember
information that we have just recalled from long-term memory, and to
process ("work on") all of this information. For this reason, one aspect
of short-term memory is often referred to as working memory. The
prefrontal cortex uses working memory to guide thoughts and behavior,
regulate attention, monitor the effects of our actions, and organize
plans for future actions (Arnsten, 2009). Damage or abnormalities in the
neural circuits that perform these functions give rise to the symptoms
of ADHD.

M15_CARL0287_13_GE_C15.indd 510

A common treatment for ADHD is administering methylphenidate (Ritalin),
a drug that inhibits the reuptake of dopamine. Amphetamine, another
dopamine agonist, also reduces the symptoms of ADHD, but this drug is
used much less often. As we will see in Chapter 17, the fact that
dopamine antagonists reduce the positive symptoms of schizophrenia
suggested the hypothesis that schizophrenia is caused by overactivity of
dopaminergic transmission. Similarly, the fact that methylphenidate, a
dopamine agonist, alleviates the symptoms of ADHD has suggested the
hypothesis that this disorder is caused by underactivity of dopaminergic
transmission. As we saw in Chapter 13, normal functioning of the
prefrontal cortex is impaired by low levels of dopamine receptor
stimulation in this region, so the suggestion that abnormalities in
dopaminergic transmission play a role in ADHD seems reasonable. Berridge
and colleagues (2006) administered methylphenidate to rats and
established a moderate dose that improved their performance on tasks
that required attention and working memory---tasks that involve the
participation of the prefrontal cortex. They used microdialysis to
measure the release of dopamine and norepinephrine and found that the
drug increased the levels of both of these neurotransmitters in the
prefrontal cortex but not in other brain regions. A follow-up study by
Devilbiss and Berridge (2008) found that a moderate dose of
methylphenidate increased the responsiveness of neurons in the
prefrontal cortex. A high dose of methylphenidate profoundly suppressed
neural activity. Many studies have shown that the effect of dopamine
levels in the prefrontal cortex on the functions of this region follow
an inverted U-shaped curve. (See Figure 15.14.) Graphs of many
behavioral functions have an inverted U shape. For example, moderate
levels of motivation increase performance on most tasks, but very low
levels fail to induce a person to perform, and very high levels tend to
make people nervous and interfere with their performance. The
dose-response curve for the effects of methylphenidate also follow an
inverted U-shaped function, which is why Berridge and colleagues tested
different doses of the drug to find a dose that optimized the animals'
performance. Clinicians have found the same to be true for the treatment
of ADHD: Doses that are too low are ineffective, and doses that are too
high produce increases in activity level that disrupt children's
attention and cognition. We mentioned that Berridge et al. (2006) found
that methylphenidate increased the level of both dopamine and
norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex. It appears that both of these
effects improve the symptoms of ADHD. Drugs that block α2 receptors (one
of the families of receptors that respond to norepinephrine) impair
performance of monkeys on working-memory tasks and produce the symptoms
of ADHD. Conversely, drugs that stimulate these receptors improve
performance (Arnsten & Li, 2005).

The Developing Nervous System 511

Evidence suggests that optimal levels of both dopamine and
norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex facilitate the functions of this
region, and the effects of methylphenidate on both of these
neurotransmitters is responsible for the drug's therapeutic effects.
Most investigators believe that ADHD is caused by changes in a network
of brain regions that involves the striatum (caudate nucleus and
putamen) as well as the prefrontal cortex, which has reciprocal
connections with the striatum. Functional-imaging studies lend support
to

this hypothesis. Studies have reported decreased activation of the
caudate nucleus (Durston et al., 2003; Rubia et al., 1999; Vaidya et
al., 2005) or medial prefrontal cortex (Rubia et al., 1999; Tamm et al.,
2004) while participants with ADHD were performing tasks that required
careful attention and the ability to inhibit a response. Given the
importance of dopaminergic innervation of both regions, this provides
additional support to the idea that abnormalities in dopaminergic
transmission may be responsible for the ­alterations in brain functions
observed in ADHD.

Module Review: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Symptoms LO
15.10 List the symptoms of ADHD. Children with ADHD show combinations of
symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

Genetic and Environmental Factors LO 15.11 Describe the roles of genetic
and environmental factors in ADHD. Family and twin studies indicate a
heritable component in this disorder. Molecular genetic studies have
found an association between ADHD and different alleles for COMT, an
enzyme that deactivates monoamines. Evidence suggests that a steeper
delay of reinforcement gradient may account for impulsiveness and
hyperactivity.

Brain Changes LO 15.12 Describe differences in the brain associated with
ADHD. Growth of the brains of children with ADHD follows that of the
brains of unaffected children, but the rate

of growth is slower. Most investigators believe that ADHD is caused by
changes in a network of brain regions that involves the striatum and the
prefrontal cortex. Functional-imaging studies have shown hypoactivation
of these structures in the brains of people with ADHD while they are
performing tasks that require careful attention and the ability to
inhibit a response. The most common medical treatment is
methylphenidate, a dopamine agonist, which suggests this disorder is
caused by u ­ nderactivity of dopaminergic transmission.

Mrs. R., a divorced, 50-year-old elementary school teacher, was sitting
in her car, waiting for a traffic light to change. Suddenly, her right
foot began to shake. Afraid that she would accidentally move forward
into the intersection, she quickly turned the car off. First her lower
leg started shaking, then her upper leg as well. She felt her body, then
her arm, begin to shake in rhythm with her leg. The shaking slowed and
finally stopped. By this time the light had changed to green, and the
cars behind her began honking. She had recovered enough to drive home.
The next evening, some close friends visited her apartment for dinner.
After dinner, her right foot began shaking again. This time she was
standing up, and the shaking---much more violent than before---caused
her to fall. Her friends found Mrs. R. lying

The case of Mrs. R. highlights several important themes in this chapter.
Mrs. R. experienced seizures as a result of a benign tumor. As you will
read, there are different types of tumors and several different
conditions that can produce seizures. Seizures can involve physical
symptoms in restricted parts of the body or they can involve the entire
body and include changes in consciousness. Amnesia and confusion
following a seizure (as Mrs. R. experienced) are common, and most
seizures end within a relatively short period of time. Although the
brain is the most protected organ, many pathological processes can
damage it or disrupt its functioning. Because much of what we have

on the floor, her legs and arms held out stiffly before her, shaking
uncontrollably. She was unconscious and did not respond to her friends
as they tried to help her. The shaking stopped less than a minute later.
Mrs. R. regained consciousness but seemed confused. Mrs. R. went to a
hospital. After hearing a description of Mrs. R.'s symptoms, the
emergency room physician immediately called a neurologist, who ordered a
CT scan. The scan showed a small, circular white spot between the
frontal lobes, above the corpus callosum. Two days later, a neurosurgeon
removed a small benign tumor, and Mrs. R. fully recovered. She was
relieved to learn that her type of brain tumor rarely produces brain
damage if it is removed quickly.

Tumors and Seizures It is estimated that over 680,000 individuals are
living with brain tumors in the United States alone (Porter et al.,
2010), and that 3--5 percent of the global population will experience a
seizure during their lifetime (Bell et al., 2014; Sander & Shorvon,
1996). These two conditions can occur separately, or, as in the case of
Mrs. R., a tumor may cause a seizure. Over 3 million adults in the
United States have a current or past diagnosis of seizure disorder (Zack
& Kobau, 2017). The following module will describe the biological basis
and symptoms of tumors and seizures, conditions that impact the lives of
many.

Tumors LO 16.1 Describe the symptoms and causes of and treatments for
brain tumors. A tumor is a mass of cells whose growth is uncontrolled
and that serves no useful function. Some tumors are malignant, or
cancerous, but the majority are benign or harmless (Davis et al., 2001;
Porter et al., 2010). The major distinction between being malignant or
benign is whether

Figure 16.1 Benign and Malignant Tumors Benign tumors are encapsulated.
Malignant tumors lack encapsulation and infiltrate surrounding tissue.
Cells from a malignant tumor can travel to new places in the body and
cause additional tumors to grow. Benign

Malignant (cancer)

the tumor is encapsulated. An encapsulated tumor has a distinct border
between the mass of tumor cells and the surrounding tissue. Encapsulated
tumors can be surgically removed and will not regrow. Malignant tumors
grow by infiltrating the surrounding tissue, and there is no clear
border between the tumor and healthy tissue. If the surgeon removes the
tumor, some cells may be missed, and these cells will produce a new
tumor. In addition, malignant tumors can produce metastases. A
metastasizing tumor will shed cells, which then travel through the
bloodstream, lodge in capillaries, and cause new tumors to grow in
different locations in the body. (See Figure 16.1.) Tumors damage brain
tissue in two ways: by compression and by infiltration. Any tumor
growing in the brain, malignant or benign, can produce neurological
symptoms and threaten the patient's life. Even a benign tumor occupies
space and pushes against the brain. This is called compression.
Compression can directly destroy brain tissue, or it can indirectly
block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and cause hydrocephalus (see
Chapter 3). Figure 16.2 illustrates the compressive effect of a large
nonmalignant tumor that has displaced the lateral and third ventricles.
Malignant t­umors cause both compression and infiltration. As a malignant
tumor grows, it infiltrates and invades the surrounding region and
destroys cells in its path, causing even more damage. CAUSES Tumors do
not originate from nerve cells, which

are not capable of dividing. Instead, they come from other cells found
in the brain or from metastases originating elsewhere in the body. The
most common types are listed in ­Table 16.1. The most serious types of
tumors are metastases and the gliomas (derived from various types of
glial

and Figure 16.3b show gliomas located in the F basal ganglia and the
pons, respectively. Figure 16.3c shows an e­ pendymoma (a type of glioma)
in the lateral ventricles. The case at the beginning of this chapter
described Mrs. R., whose sudden onset of seizures suggested the presence
of a tumor near the top of the primary motor cortex. Indeed, she had a
meningioma, an encapsulated, benign tumor consisting of cells that
typically make up the

dura mater or arachnoid membrane. Such tumors tend to originate either
in the part of the dura mater that is found between the two cerebral
hemispheres or along the tentorium, the sheet of dura mater that lies
between the occipital lobes and the cerebellum. (See Figure 16.3d.)
Evidence indicates that the malignancy of brain tumors is caused by rare
subpopulations of cells (Hadjipanayis & Van Meir, 2009). Malignant
gliomas contain tumor initiating cells, which originate from
transformations of neural stem cells. These cells rapidly proliferate
and give rise to a glioma. Some tumors are sensitive to radiation and
can be destroyed by a beam of radiation focused on them. Usually, a
neurosurgeon first removes as much of the tumor as possible, and then
the remaining cells are targeted by the radiation. A special type of
radiation therapy called stereotactic radiosurgery can also be used.
This technique consists of delivering highly targeted radiation to the
tumor site, sparing the surrounding tissue. To target a specific
location in the brain, stereotactic coordinates (from a patient's own CT
or MRI scan) are used (Lippitz et al., 2014). (See Chapter 5 for more
information on these methods.) ­Another technique called laser-induced
thermal therapy uses heat generated from a laser to ablate tissue

exposure. (See Figure 16.4.) Similar to radiosurgery, physicians use MRI
and stereotactic techniques to position fiber optic materials at the
site of the focus, and ablate the tissue by activating an attached
laser. This technique can be used to treat tumors or scar tissue
responsible for seizures (see the next module for more information;
Ashraf et al., 2018; Shukla et al., 2017). Other tumors (such as the one
Mrs. R. had) can be completely removed by conventional surgery. Some
brain tumors respond to chemotherapy, with or without radiation or
surgical interventions. Chemotherapy involves administering a drug that
causes rapidly dividing cells (such as cancer cells), to die, by
interfering with their DNA replication. Chemotherapy drugs can be
administered orally, intravenously, or by implantation directly in the
region where the cancer cells are located. See Chapter 4 to review the
routes of drug administration. When administered systemically,
chemotherapy drugs target all dividing cells in the body (not just
cancer cells), resulting in side effects such as hair loss due to the
death of dividing cells in the hair follicles. Bevacizumab is a drug
that inhibits angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels. Because a
rapidly growing tumor requires an increased blood supply, its cells
secrete vascular endothelial growth factor, a chemical that induces
local angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels). Bevacizumab binds
with and deactivates the growth factor to slow the growth of a glioma.
Unfortunately, the drug

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 516

increases survival by only a few months, so more effective drugs---such
as drugs that bind with proteins found specifically on tumor initiating
cells---will be needed to completely destroy these tumors (Bredel, 2009;
Chamberlain, 2011).

Seizures LO 16.2 Describe the symptoms and causes of and treatments for
seizures. A seizure is a period of sudden, excessive activity of
cerebral neurons. Sometimes, if neurons that make up the motor system
are involved, a seizure can cause a convulsion, which is uncontrollable
activity of the muscles, such as Mrs. R. experienced during her seizure.
Not all seizures cause convulsions; in fact, most do not. In some
cultures and religious traditions, seizures are considered to be a
punishment from a deity or the work of demons. In other cultures,
seizures are welcomed as evidence of a spiritual connection and signal
that the individual may become a healer or shaman (Fadiman, 1997). In
the Western medical tradition, Hippocrates noted that head injuries to
soldiers and gladiators sometimes led to seizures like the ones he saw
in his patients, which suggested that seizures had a physical cause
(Hoppe, 2006). A single seizure can occur, for example as a result of an
injury or tumor, or a person may experience many seizures during a
lifetime. Because of negative connotations, some

Table 16.2 The Classification of Seizures I. Generalized seizures (with
no known focus in the brain) A. Tonic-clonic (grand mal) B. Absence
(petit mal) C. Atonic (loss of muscle tone; temporary paralysis) II.
Partial seizures (starting from a focus in the brain) A. Simple (no
major change in consciousness) B. Complex (with altered consciousness)

physicians prefer not to use the term epilepsy to refer to a condition
that involves seizures. Instead, they use the phrase seizure disorder to
refer to a condition that has many causes. Table 16.2 presents a summary
of the basic categories of seizures. Two distinctions are important:
partial versus generalized seizures and simple versus complex ones.
Partial seizures have a definite focus, or source of irritation:
typically, either a scarred region caused by an old injury or a
developmental abnormality such as a malformed blood vessel. The neurons
that become involved in the seizure are restricted to a small part of
the brain. Generalized seizures are widespread, involving most of the
brain. In many cases they grow from a focus, but in some cases their
origin is not discovered. Simple and complex seizures are two categories
of partial seizures. Simple partial seizures often cause changes in
consciousness but do not cause loss of consciousness. In contrast,
because of their particular location and severity, complex partial
seizures lead to loss of consciousness. (See Figure 16.5.) The most
severe form of seizure is often referred to as a grand mal seizure (also
called a tonic-clonic seizure). This seizure is generalized, and because
it includes the motor systems of the brain, it is accompanied by
convulsions. Often,

before having a grand mal seizure, a person has warning symptoms, such
as changes in mood or perhaps a few sudden jerks of muscular activity
upon awakening. (Almost everyone sometimes experiences these jolts while
falling asleep.) A few seconds before the seizure occurs, the person may
experience an aura, which is likely caused by excitation of neurons
surrounding a seizure focus. This excitation has effects similar to
those that would be produced by electrical stimulation of the region.
The nature of an aura varies according to the location of the focus. For
example, because structures in the temporal lobe are involved in the
control of emotional behaviors, seizures that originate from a focus
located there often begin with feelings of fear and dread or,
occasionally, euphoria. The beginning of a grand mal seizure is called
the tonic phase. In this phase, all of a person's muscles contract
forcefully. The arms are rigidly outstretched, and the person may make
an involuntary cry as the tense muscles force air out of the lungs. (At
this point the patient is unconscious.) The person holds a rigid posture
for about 15 seconds, and then the clonic phase begins. The muscles
begin trembling, then start jerking convulsively---quickly at first,
then more and more slowly. Meanwhile, the eyes roll, the person's facial
muscles contract, and the tongue may be bitten. Intense activity of the
autonomic nervous system manifests itself in sweating and salivation.
After a short period of time, the person's muscles relax; only then does
regular breathing begin again. The person may fall into an unresponsive
sleep, which can last for several minutes. After that the person may
awaken briefly but usually falls back into an exhausted sleep that may
last for several hours.

518 Chapter 16 Other types of seizures are far less dramatic. Partial
seizures involve relatively small portions of the brain. The symptoms
can include sensory changes, motor activity, or both. For example, a
simple partial seizure that begins in or near the motor cortex can
involve jerking movements that start in one place and spread throughout
the body as the excitation spreads along the precentral gyrus. In the
case described at the beginning of the chapter, Mrs. R. displayed such a
progression, caused by a seizure triggered by a meningioma. The tumor
was pressing against the "foot" region of the left primary motor cortex.
When the seizure began, it involved the foot; and as it spread, it began
involving the other parts of the body. (See Figure 16.6.) Mrs. R.'s
first seizure was a simple partial seizure, but her second one would be
classified as a complex partial seizure because she lost ­consciousness.
A seizure that begins in the occipital lobe may produce visual symptoms
such as spots of color, flashes of light, or temporary blindness; one
originating in the parietal lobe can evoke somatosensations, such as
feelings of pain or heat and cold. Seizures in the temporal lobes may
cause hallucinations that include old memories; presumably, neural
circuits involved in these memories are activated by the spreading
excitation. Depending on the location and extent of the seizure, the
person may or may not lose consciousness. Children are especially
susceptible to seizure disorders. Some children do not have grand mal
episodes but instead have very brief seizures that are referred to as a­
bsence s­ eizures. During an absence seizure, which is a generalized
seizure, the child may stop what they are doing and stare off into the
distance for a few seconds, often blinking their eyes repeatedly. These
seizures are also sometimes referred to as petit mal seizures. During
this time the children are unresponsive, and they usually do not notice
their attacks.

Figure 16.6 Primary Motor Cortex and Seizures Mrs. R.'s seizure began in

Because absence seizures can occur up to several hundred times each day,
they can disrupt a child's performance in school. Unfortunately, many
children experiencing absence seizures could be considered inattentive
and unmotivated unless a seizure disorder is diagnosed. Seizures can
have serious consequences: They can cause brain damage. Approximately 50
percent of patients with seizure disorders show evidence of damage to
the hippocampus. The amount of damage is correlated with the number and
severity of seizures the patient has had. Significant hippocampal damage
can be caused by a single episode of status epilepticus, a relatively
rare condition in which the patient undergoes a series of seizures
without regaining consciousness. The damage appears to be caused by an
excessive release of glutamate during the seizure, which can cause
glutamate excitotoxicity (Thompson et al., 1996). Glutamate
excitotoxicity will be further discussed in an upcoming module on
cerebrovascular accidents and causes damage similar to excitotoxic
lesions described in Chapter 5. CAUSES Seizures have many causes. The
most common cause is scarring, which may be produced by an injury, a
stroke, a developmental abnormality, or the irritating effect of a
growing tumor. After a head injury, it can take several months for a
person to develop the resulting seizures. Genetic factors contribute to
the incidence of seizure disorders (Berkovic et al., 2006). Nearly all
of the genes that have been identified as playing a role in seizure
disorders control the production of ion channels, which is not
surprising, considering the fact that ion channels control the
excitability of the neural membrane and are responsible for the
propagation of action potentials. However, most seizure disorders are
caused by nongenetic factors. In the past, many cases were considered to
be idiopathic (of unknown causes). The development of MRI techniques
with greater resolution and sensitivity has meant that small brain
abnormalities responsible for triggering seizures are now more likely to
be seen. Various drugs and infections that cause a high fever can also
produce seizures. High fevers are most common in children, and
approximately 3 percent of children 4 years of age and younger sustain
seizures associated with fevers (Berkovic et al., 2006). In addition,
seizures are commonly associated with withdrawal from chronic alcohol,
barbiturate, and sometimes benzodiazepine use when a person suddenly
stops taking the drug. The sudden release from the inhibiting effects of
the drug leaves the brain in a hyperexcitable condition. In fact, this
condition is a medical emergency because it can be fatal. Substituting a
longer-acting drug and gradually reducing the amount of drug used can
reduce the likelihood of seizures during withdrawal from these sedative
drugs.

Seizure disorders are treated with anticonvulsant drugs, many of which
work by increasing the effectiveness of inhibitory synapses, often by
increasing inhibition via GABAergic synapses. Many people respond well
to these medications and sustain a high quality

of life. In a few instances, drugs provide little or no help. Sometimes,
seizure foci remain so irritable that, despite drug treatment, brain
surgery is required, as we saw in the opening case of Chapter 3. The
surgeon removes the region of the brain surrounding the focus (usually
located in the medial temporal lobe). Most patients recover well, with
their seizures eliminated or greatly reduced in frequency. Mrs. R.'s
treatment, described in the opening case of this chapter, was a
different matter; in her case the removal of a tumor eliminated the
source of the irritation and ended her seizures. No healthy brain tissue
was removed. Because seizure surgery often involves removing a
substantial amount of brain tissue (usually from one of the temporal
lobes), we might expect it to cause behavioral deficits. But in most
cases the reverse is true. People's performance on tests of
neuropsychological functioning usually improves. How can removing brain
tissue improve a person's performance? The answer is provided by looking
at what happens in the brain not during seizures but between them. The
seizure focus, usually a region of scar tissue, irritates the brain

tissue surrounding it, causing increased neural activity that tends to
spread to adjacent regions. Between seizures this increased excitatory
activity is held in check by a compensatory increase in inhibitory
activity. That is, inhibitory neurons in the region surrounding the
seizure focus become more active. This phenomenon is known as interictal
inhibition. A seizure occurs when the excitation overcomes the
inhibition. The problem is that the compensatory inhibition does more
than hold the excitation in check. It also suppresses the normal
functions of a rather large region of brain tissue surrounding the
seizure focus. Even though a seizure focus may be small, its effects are
experienced over a much larger area of the brain, even between seizures.
Removing the seizure focus and some surrounding brain tissue eliminates
the source of the irritation and makes the compensatory inhibition
unnecessary. Freed from interictal inhibition, the brain tissue located
near the site of the former seizure focus can now function normally, and
the patient's neuropsychological abilities will show an improvement.

Module Review: Tumors and Seizures Tumors LO 16.1

Describe the symptoms and causes of and treatments for brain tumors.

Tumors produce brain damage by compression and, in the case of malignant
tumors, infiltration. Brain tumors are caused by the uncontrolled growth
of various types of cells other than neurons. Benign tumors are
encapsulated and thus have a distinct border and may be successfully
removed with surgery. Malignant tumors may be removed with surgery, and
the remaining cells may be treated with radiation or chemotherapy.
Malignant gliomas contain tumor initiating cells, derived from neural
stem cells, which are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation.
Bevacizumab, a drug that inhibits the formation of blood vessels by
malignant tumors, can help slow growth of these tumors.

Seizures LO 16.2

Describe the symptoms and causes of and treatments for seizures.

Seizures are periodic episodes of abnormal electrical activity of the
brain. Partial seizures are localized, beginning with a focus---usually,
some scar tissue caused by previous damage or a tumor. When they begin,
they can produce an aura, consisting of particular sensations or changes
in mood. Simple partial seizures do not produce

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 519

profound changes in consciousness; complex partial seizures do.
Generalized seizures may or may not originate at a single focus, but
they involve most of the brain. Some seizures involve motor activity,
including the grand mal convulsions that accompany generalized seizures.
The convulsions are caused by involvement of the brain's motor systems;
the patient first shows a tonic phase, consisting of a few seconds of
rigidity, and then a clonic phase, consisting of rhythmic jerking.
Absence seizures, also called petit mal seizures, are common in
children. These generalized seizures are characterized by periods of
inattention and temporary loss of awareness. Seizures produced by
abstinence after chronic use of alcohol or other sedative drugs appear
to be produced by a sudden release from inhibition. Seizures are treated
with anticonvulsant drugs and, in the case of intractable seizure
disorders caused by an abnormal focus, seizure surgery, which usually
involves the medial temporal lobe.

Thought Question About 50 percent of people with seizure disorders show
evidence of damage to the hippocampus, which is located in the temporal
lobe. Describe how a researcher could design a study to determine
whether the seizure activity caused the hippocampal damage, or whether
the hippocampal damage caused the seizure activity.

520 Chapter 16

Cerebrovascular Accidents You have already learned about the effects of
cerebrovascular accidents, or strokes, in earlier chapters. For example,
you read that strokes can produce impairments in perception, emotional
recognition and expression, memory, and language. This module will
describe only the causes and treatments of strokes. The incidence of
strokes in the United States averages over 750,000 per year (Benjamin et
al., 2018). The likelihood of having a stroke is related to age; the
probability doubles each decade after 45 years of age and reaches 1 to 2
percent per year by age 75.

Causes LO 16.3 Explain how cerebrovascular accidents can occur. The two
major types of strokes are hemorrhagic and ischemic. Hemorrhagic strokes
are caused by bleeding within the brain, usually from a malformed blood
vessel or from one that has been weakened by high blood pressure. The
blood that leaks out of the defective blood vessel accumulates within
the brain, putting pressure on the surrounding brain tissue and damaging
it. Loss of blood flow to a region is called ischemia. Ischemic
strokes---those that block a blood vessel and obstruct the flow of
blood---can be caused by thrombi or emboli. A thrombus is a blood clot
that forms in blood vessels, especially in places where their walls are
already damaged. Sometimes, thrombi become so large that blood cannot
flow through the vessel, causing a stroke. People who are susceptible to
the formation of thrombi are often advised to take a drug such as
aspirin, which helps to prevent clot formation. An embolus is a piece of
material that forms in one part of the vascular system, breaks off, and
is carried through the bloodstream until it reaches an

artery too small to pass through. It lodges there, damming the flow of
blood through the rest of the vascular tree (the "branches" and "twigs"
arising from the artery). Emboli can consist of a variety of materials,
including bacterial debris from an infection in the lining of the heart
or pieces broken off from a blood clot. (See Figure 16.7.) What,
exactly, causes neurons to die when the blood supply to a region of the
brain is interrupted? We might expect that the neurons simply starve to
death because they lose their supply of glucose and oxygen to metabolize
it. However, research indicates that the immediate cause of neuron death
is the presence of excessive amounts of glutamate. In other words, the
damage produced by loss of blood flow to a region of the brain is
actually an excitotoxic lesion, similar to those produced in a
laboratory animal by the injection of an excitotoxic chemical, described
in Chapter 5. (See Koroshetz & Moskowitz, 1996, and Lo et al., 2003, for
a review.) When the blood supply to a region of the brain is
interrupted, the oxygen and glucose in that region are quickly depleted.
As a consequence, the sodium potassium transporters, which regulate the
balance of ions inside and outside the cell, along with other cellular
mechanisms, stop functioning. Neural membranes become depolarized, which
causes the release of glutamate. Activating glutamate receptors further
increases the inflow of sodium ions and causes cells to absorb excessive
amounts of calcium through NMDA channels. The presence of excessive
amounts of sodium and calcium within cells is toxic. The intracellular
sodium causes the cells to absorb water and swell. The inflammation
attracts microglia and activates them, causing them to become
phagocytic. The phagocytic microglia begin destroying injured cells.
Inflammation also attracts white blood cells, which can adhere to the
walls of capillaries near the ischemic region and obstruct them. The
presence

of excessive amounts of calcium in the cells activates a variety of
calcium-dependent enzymes, many of which destroy molecules that are
vital for normal cell functioning. (See Figure 16.8.) Finally, damaged
mitochondria produce free radicals---molecules with unpaired electrons
that act as powerful oxidizing agents. Free radicals are extremely toxic
and destroy nucleic acids, proteins, and fatty acids.

Treatments LO 16.4 Explain how short- and long-term symptoms of
cerebrovascular accidents are treated. If a hemorrhagic stroke is caused
by high blood pressure, medication is given to reduce the person's blood
pressure. If a hemorrhagic stroke is caused by weak or malformed blood
vessels, brain surgery may be used to seal off the faulty vessels to
prevent another hemorrhage. If a thrombus was responsible for the stroke
and if the patient reaches a stroke-treatment center soon enough,
attempts will be made to dissolve or physically remove the blood clot.
Even if immediate treatment is not available, the patient will

receive anticoagulant drugs to make the blood less likely to clot,
reducing the likelihood of another stroke. If an embolus broke away from
a bacterial infection, antibiotics will be given to suppress the
infection. Strokes produce permanent brain damage, but, depending on the
size of the affected blood vessel, the amount of damage can vary from
negligible to massive. Researchers have sought ways to minimize the
amount of brain damage caused by strokes. One approach has been to
administer drugs that dissolve blood clots in an attempt to reestablish
circulation to an ischemic brain region. This approach has had some
success. Administering a clot-dissolving drug called tPA (tissue
plasminogen activator) as soon as possible after the onset of a stroke
can be beneficial, but the longer it takes to receive the drug, the less
beneficial impact it has on health and recovery (Kim et al., 2016). tPA
is an enzyme that helps dissolve fibrin, a protein involved in clot
formation. Another potential clot-reducing treatment is an anticoagulant
enzyme called desmoteplase, isolated from the saliva of vampire bats.
Clinical trials have found that desmoteplase restores blood flow if
given up to 9 hours after

benefits of this drug treatment are unclear (Albers et al., 2017; Hacke
et al., 2005; see Prabhakaran et al., 2015, for review of stroke
treatment research). (See Figure 16.9.) Some large cerebral occlusions
can be removed with various medical devices (Frendl & Csiba, 2011). (See
Figure 16.10). The devices are inserted into a cerebral blood vessel and
extended until they reach the obstruction. One type of device works like
a corkscrew, grabbing the obstruction so that the surgeon can pull it
out (Figure 16.10a). The second type of device works by suction: Once
the tip of the device touches the obstruction, a vacuum is applied, and
the surgeon pulls out the clot (Figure 16.10b). Other types of stent
devices may be put into place around the occlusion and deployed to trap

the occlusion against the vessel wall and immediately restore blood
flow. The thrombus is then retrieved along with the stent (Figure
16.10c). The disadvantages of these approaches are that some clots are
difficult to reach, and attempts at mechanical removal can further
damage the blood vessel. How can strokes be prevented? Risk factors that
can be reduced by medication or changes in lifestyle include high blood
pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and high blood levels of
cholesterol. The actions we can take to reduce these risk factors are
well known, so they will not be described in detail here.
Atherosclerosis, a process in which the linings of arteries develop a
layer of plaque, consisting of deposits of cholesterol, fats, calcium,
and cellular waste products, is a precursor to heart attacks (myocardial
infarctions) and ischemic strokes, caused by clots that form around
atherosclerotic plaques in cerebral and cardiac blood vessels.
Atherosclerotic plaques often form in the internal carotid artery---the
artery that supplies most of the blood flow to the cerebral hemispheres.
These plaques can cause severe narrowing of the interior of the artery,
greatly increasing the risk of a massive stroke. This narrowing can be
visualized in an angiogram, produced by injecting a radiopaque dye into
the blood and examining the artery with a computerized X-ray machine.
(See Figure 16.11.) If the narrowing is severe, a carotid endarterectomy
can be performed. The surgeon makes an incision in the neck that exposes
the carotid artery, inserts a shunt in the artery, cuts the artery open,
removes the plaque, and sews the artery shut again (and the neck too, of
course). Endarterectomy has been shown to be particularly helpful in
reducing the risk of stroke in people under 75 years of age (MRC
Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial Collaborative Group, 1994). Another
surgical treatment option involves the placement of a stent in a
narrowed carotid artery (Yadav et al., 2004). An arterial stent is an
implantable device made of mesh that is used to expand and hold open a
partially occluded artery. These devices were first developed for

Figure 16.10 Removing Occlusions Devices can be deployed through the
vascular system to the site of an occlusion. The devices use various
strategies to secure occlusions and allow them to be removed. The
devices can include coils (a), aspiration devices (b), or stent
retrievers (c). Source: Prabhakaran, S., Ruff, I., & Bernstein, R. A.

treatment of arteries that serve the heart and later modified for use in
the carotid artery. Unfortunately the use of carotid stents is
associated with an increased number of future strokes, and the death
rate following implantation is higher. (See Figure 16.12.) It is not
clear what the

future of stent development will bring, but new designs and materials,
including polymers that can release clotbreaking drugs, are being tested
to evaluate the potential of stents once more (Dibra et al., 2010; Diaz
et al., 2018; Kouvelos et al., 2015). What can be done after a stroke
has occurred, assuming that intervention with clot dissolution or
removal was unsuccessful or unavailable? The major strategies involve
administration of drugs that block factors present in the brain that
inhibit axonal growth, activating the brain's intrinsic neural growth
factors, and reducing swelling and inflammation. For example, animal
studies have shown that administration of antibodies against NogoA, a
myelin protein that inhibits the branching and growth of axons, can
increase recovery from brain damage, and administration of inosine, a
naturally occurring chemical, activates a protein that also encourages
axon growth (Benowitz & Carmichael, 2010). And depending on the location
of the brain damage, people who have strokes will receive physical
therapy and perhaps speech therapy to help them recover lost function.
Several studies have shown that exercise and sensory stimulation can
facilitate recovery from the effects of brain damage (Cotman et al.,
2007). For example, Taub and colleagues (2006) studied patients with
strokes that impaired their ability to use one arm and hand. The
researchers put the unaffected arm in a sling for 14 days and gave the
patients training sessions during which the patients were forced to use
the affected arm. A placebo group received cognitive, relaxation, and
physical fitness exercises for the same amount of time. This procedure
(which is called constraint-induced movement therapy) produced long-term
improvement in the patients' ability to use the affected arm. (See
Figure 16.13.) A study by Liepert and colleagues (2000) found that
constraint-induced movement therapy caused changes in

Figure 16.12 Effects of Carotid Stents

524 Chapter 16 the connections of the primary motor cortex. The
investigators used transcranial magnetic stimulation to map the area of
the contralateral motor cortex that was involved in control of the
impaired arm before and after treatment. Aside from improving the
patients' use of the impaired arm, the treatment caused an expansion of
this region---apparently, into adjacent areas of the motor cortex---that
was still present when the patients were tested 6 months later. As you
read in Chapter 8, mirror neurons in the parietal lobe and ventral
premotor cortex become active when a person performs an action or sees
someone else performing it. Ertelt and colleagues (2007) enrolled
patients who had experienced a stroke in a course of therapy that
combined repetitive practice of hand and arm movements used in daily
life with the watching of videos of actors performing the same
movements. The patients' motor functions showed long-term improvement
relative to those of patients in a control group who performed the
exercises but watched videos of sequences of geometric symbols.
Moreover,

functional-imaging studies showed increased activity in brain regions
involved in movement, including the ventral premotor cortex and the
supplementary motor area. In some cases of brain or spinal cord damage,
patients are unable to perform useful limb movements, even after
intensive therapy. In such cases, investigators have attempted to devise
brain--computer interfaces that permit the patient to control electronic
and mechanical devices in order to perform useful actions. Developers of
such interfaces have implanted arrays of microelectrodes directly into
the patient's motor cortex and have applied surface electrodes to
measure changes in EEG activity transmitted through the skull and scalp.
These devices, while still experimental, permit patients to move
prosthetic hands, perform actions with multijointed robotic arms, move
the cursor of a computer display, and operate a computer (Wolpaw &
McFarland, 2004; Hochberg et al., 2006). Some interface systems have
been used therapeutically to improve motor function as well (Ang et al.,
2015; Pichiorri et al., 2015; Soekadar et al., 2015).

Module Review: Cerebrovascular Accidents Causes LO 16.3

Explain how cerebrovascular accidents can occur.

Cerebrovascular accidents occur through rupture of a blood vessel or
occlusion (obstruction) of a blood vessel by a thrombus or embolus. A
thrombus is a blood clot that forms within a blood vessel. An embolus is
a piece of debris that is carried through the bloodstream and lodges in
an artery.

Treatments LO 16.4

Explain how short- and long-term symptoms of cerebrovascular accidents
are treated.

If a hemorrhagic stroke is caused by high blood pressure, medication is
given to reduce the person's blood pressure. If a hemorrhagic stroke is
caused by weak and malformed blood vessels, brain surgery may be used to
seal off the faulty vessels to prevent another hemorrhage. If a thrombus
was responsible for the stroke, attempts will

counselor. He had earned a college degree in social work and passed the
licensing exams required to work as a professional counselor; however,
he was having trouble finding and keeping a job in his chosen field.

be made to dissolve or physically remove the blood clot. Even if
immediate treatment is not available, the patient will receive
anticoagulant drugs to make the blood less likely to clot, reducing the
likelihood of another stroke. If an embolus broke away from a bacterial
infection, antibiotics will be given to suppress the infection. Drug
treatments are being developed to reduce damage after a stroke has
occurred. Physical therapy can facilitate longterm recovery.
Constraint-induced movement therapy or brain--computer interface therapy
can also be used to help restore movement of limbs.

Thought Question Many of the treatments currently available for
cerebrovascular accidents have side effects or cannot be used by all
patients. There is a great need for safer, more effective treatment
strategies. Describe a novel approach to treating patients who have
experienced a stroke. Describe how your treatment would address
preventing neural damage or promoting brain-based recovery following a
stroke.

Throughout his life, A. P. sustained multiple traumatic brain injuries
from fights and a serious car accident. A CT scan revealed damage to his
right frontal lobe several years after the last injury. Following that
injury, A. P. experienced significant problems with executive function
and became easily distracted, irritable, impatient, and disorganized,
and had trouble controlling his anger in some situations.

24/11/21 2:01 PM

Neurological Disorders 525

To address his concerns about his career, A. P. sought the help of a
therapist to develop more effective strategies for organization and
report-writing in his profession. After conducting several cognitive
tests to assess A. P.'s strengths and weaknesses, the therapist designed
report-writing software for social work interviews that would address A.
P.'s executive and organizational deficits. Over the course of 10 weeks,
the therapist worked with A. P. to refine and practice his
report-writing skills. Following treatment, A. P. secured a position as
a chemical-dependency counselor. He worked with his employer and
therapist to further tailor his report-writing to the outpatient clinic
he worked for. A. P. was successfully promoted to a more senior position
in the clinic within a year (Turkstra & Flora, 2002).

The case of A. P. highlights several important themes in this module. A.
P. experienced repeated traumatic brain injuries, the evidence of which
was observable years later as a lesion in his frontal cortex. The injury
resulted in cognitive and emotional symptoms that had potentially
serious consequences for his career and quality of life. An intervention
to address these deficits allowed A. P. to pursue his professional
development and meet his career goals (Turkstra & Flora, 2002).

Causes LO 16.5 Identify some causes of traumatic brain injury. Traumatic
brain injury (TBI) is a serious health problem (Chen & D'Esposito,
2010). In the United States alone, approximately 1.4 million people are
treated in an emergency department, 270,000 people are hospitalized, and
52,000 people die due to TBI. In particular, over 300,000 instances of
TBI have been reported among U.S. military personnel since 2000
(Fischer, 2015). Traumatic brain injury can be caused by a projectile or
a fall against a sharp object that fractures the skull, causing the
brain to be wounded by the object or by a piece of the broken skull.
Closed-head injuries do not involve penetration of the brain, but these
injuries can also cause severe injury or death. Among military
personnel, a frequent cause of TBI has been injury by explosive devices.
Undoubtedly, many other people receive brain injuries but not a
diagnosis. Open-head injuries (also called penetrating brain injuries)
cause damage to the portion of the brain that is injured by the
penetrating object or skull bone fragments. In addition, damage to blood
vessels can deprive parts of the brain of their normal blood supply, and
the accumulation of blood within the brain can cause further damage by
exerting pressure within the brain. A closedhead injury---for example,
caused by a blow with a blunt object against the right side of a
person's forehead---will

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 525

bruise the right frontal lobe as it comes into sudden impact with the
inside of the skull. (This blow to the brain is known as the coup.) The
brain will then recoil in the opposite direction and smash against the
left posterior region of the skull. (This blow is known as the
contrecoup.) In many cases, the contrecoup can produce more damage than
the coup. Closed-head injury can damage more than the cerebral cortex at
the point of the coup and contrecoup. Bundles of axons can be torn and
twisted, blood vessels can be ruptured, and cerebrospinal fluid can
distort the walls of the ventricles. And as we saw in the module on
seizure disorders, traumatic brain injury can be followed several months
later by seizures. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a form of
TBI, produces neurodegeneration due to repeated head trauma. CTE has
received attention for its prevalence in athletes who participate in
contact sports and experience frequent and repeated head trauma. A
diagnosis of CTE (like other neurodegenerative disorders you will read
about later in this chapter) can be confirmed by postmortem examination
of brain tissue, but researchers are actively looking for biomarkers
that could be used to diagnose CTE earlier (Cherry et al., 2017; Mez et
al., 2017). CTE symptoms of mood and cognitive impairment can appear
years after the injury occurred. Similar to the brains of individuals
with Alzheimer's disease, abnormal tau protein accumulates in the cortex
of CTE patients. Patients with CTE also display reduced brain volume and
enlarged ventricles (Korngold et al., 2013). In particular, the corpus
callosum, regions of the cortex, and the limbic system appear to be
damaged, resulting in characteristic deficits in executive control and
mood regulation that are associated with this disease (Baugh et al.,

Treatments LO 16.6 Describe treatments for traumatic brain injuries.
Immediate, primary treatments for TBI typically include reducing
swelling and intracranial pressure, as well as ensuring adequate blood
flow to the injured region (McConeghy et al., 2012). Long-term TBI
treatments address the symptoms that develop after the initial injury.
Even mild cases of TBI can greatly increase a person's risk of
sustaining symptoms that are not immediately obvious but that manifest
themselves as the person ages. For example, the likelihood of
Alzheimer's disease is much higher in a person who has received blows to
the head earlier in life. Aside from causing physical trauma to the
brain, TBI results in increased levels of adenosine and glutamate in the
injured brain tissue. The increased glutamate converts the adenosine
from its normal role as an anti-inflammatory agent to an agent

that promotes inflammation, which causes further damage. Treatment with
a drug that inhibits the release of glutamate can prevent this switch in
the role of extracellular adenosine (Dai et al., 2010). Other
pharmacological treatments have been tested in an attempt to reduce
activity of intra- and extracellular processes related to neuron damage
in TBI, but most results are negative or have not yet been tested in
appropriate large, randomized clinical trials (McConeghy et al., 2012).

Treatment of the long-term behavioral and cognitive effects of TBI
involves the same strategies as those employed in the treatment of brain
damage caused by cerebrovascular accidents. The case of A. P.
demonstrated one example of a behavioral intervention that addressed
some of the long-term effects of TBI. Other researchers have suggested
treatments focused on managing the psychological symptoms of TBI
(Bergersen et al., 2017; Mehta et al., 2018; Nassir Ghaemi et al.,
2019).

Module Review: Traumatic Brain Injury Causes LO 16.5

Identify some causes of traumatic brain injury.

Traumatic brain injury can be caused by a projectile or a fall against a
sharp object that fractures the skull, causing the brain to be wounded
by the object or by a piece of the broken skull. Closed-head injuries
can also produce traumatic brain injury.

Treatments LO 16.6

Describe treatments for traumatic brain injuries.

Treatments include interventions to immediately reduce swelling and
intracranial pressure and provide adequate blood flow following injury.
Drug treatment to reduce

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 526

glutamate activity can also be used immediately following the injury.
Behavioral interventions of psychological symptom management may be
effective in addressing the long-term symptoms of TBI.

Thought Question Although the exact relationship between head injury and
development of CTE is not yet fully understood, it seems that reducing
the severity and frequency of head trauma in contact sports is one way
to reduce the incidence of CTE. Given what is known about CTE, what
recommendations would you give to coaches to reduce CTE among the
contact sport athletes with whom they work?

Neurological Disorders 527

Degenerative Disorders Many disease processes cause degeneration of the
cells of the brain. Some of these conditions injure particular kinds of
cells, a fact that provides the hope that research will uncover the
causes of the damage and find a way to halt it and prevent it from
occurring in other people. The following module will discuss information
about degenerative disorders that are caused by prion infection
(transmissible spongiform encephalopathies), and that affect motor
behavior (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, multiple sclerosis) and cognition (Alzheimer's disease,
Korsakoff's syndrome). For each disorder, information about causes and
treatments will be presented.

Figure 16.15 Misfolded Proteins PrPc is a normal protein

PrPSc is the disease-causing form of the prion protein

Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies LO 16.7 Describe how
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies cause brain damage. The
outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or "mad cow disease")
in Great Britain in the late 1980s and early 1990s brought a peculiar
form of brain disease to public attention. BSE is a transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)---a fatal contagious brain disease whose
degenerative process gives the brain a spongelike (or Swiss
cheese--like) appearance. Besides BSE, these diseases include
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru, which
affect humans; scrapie, which primarily affects sheep; and chronic
wasting disease, which affects deer and elk. Although scrapie cannot be
transmitted to humans, BSE can, and it produces a variant of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Unlike other transmissible diseases, TSEs are
caused not by microorganisms but by simple proteins, which have been
called prions, or "protein infectious agents" (Prusiner, 1982). Prion
proteins are found primarily in the membrane of neurons, where they are
believed to play a role in synaptic function and in preservation of the
myelin sheath (Popko, 2010). Prion proteins are resistant to proteolytic
enzymes---enzymes that are able to destroy proteins by breaking the
peptide bonds that hold a protein's amino acids together. Prion proteins
are also resistant to levels of heat that denature normal proteins,
which explains why cooking meat from cattle with BSE does not destroy
the infectious agent. The sequence of amino acids of normal prion
protein (PrPc) and infectious prion (PrPSc) are identical. How, then,
can two proteins with the same amino acid sequences have such different
effects? The answer is that the functions of proteins are determined
largely by their three-dimensional shapes. The only difference between
PrPc and PrPSc is the way the protein is folded. (See Figure 16.15.)
Once misfolded PrPSc is introduced into a cell, it causes normal PrPc to
become misfolded too, and

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 527

the process of this transformation ultimately kills them. (See Miller,
2009, for a review.) A familial form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is
transmitted as a dominant trait, caused by a mutation of the PRNP gene
located on the short arm of chromosome 20, which codes for the human
prion protein gene. Fatal familial insomnia, which you read about in
Chapter 9, is also transmitted in families via an inherited mutation of
the PRNP gene. However, most cases of TSEs are sporadic diseases. That
is, they occur in people without a family history of prion protein
disease. Prion protein diseases are unique not only because they can be
transmitted by means of a simple protein but also because they can be
genetic or sporadic---and the genetic and sporadic forms can be
transmitted to others. The most common form of transmission of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans is through transplantation of
tissues such as dura mater or corneas, harvested from cadavers of people
who were infected with a prion disease. One form of human prion protein
disease, kuru, was transmitted a different way. Out of respect for
recently deceased relatives, members of indigenous groups in New Guinea
consumed their tissues as part of a funeral ritual and sometimes thus
contracted the disease. This practice has since ended (Gajdusek, 1977).
The word kuru means "to shiver." This term likely refers to the tremors
or ataxia that result from degeneration of the cerebellum in this
disorder (Collins et al., 2001). Whatever role normal PrPc plays, it
does not seem to be essential for the life of a cell. Bueler and
colleagues (1993) found that the cells of mice with a targeted mutation
of the prion protein gene produced absolutely no prion protein and did
not develop mouse scrapie when they were inoculated with the misfolded
prions that cause this disease. Mice without the mutation that were
inoculated with these prions died within 6 months.

24/11/21 2:01 PM

528 Chapter 16 A study by Steele and colleagues (2006) suggests that
normal prion protein plays a role in neural development and
differentiation in fetuses and neurogenesis in adults. The investigators
produced a genetically engineered strain of mice that produced increased
amounts of PrPc and found increased numbers of proliferating cells in
the subventricular zone and more neurons in the dentate gyrus, compared
with normal mice. Some investigators (for example, Bailey et al., 2004)
have suggested that a prionlike mechanism could play a role in
establishing and maintaining long-term memories. Long-term memories can
last for decades, and prion proteins, which are resistant to the
destructive effects of enzymes, might maintain synaptic changes for long
periods of time. Criado and colleagues (2005) found that mice with a
targeted mutation against the PRNP gene showed deficits in a spatial
learning task and in establishment of long-term potentiation in the
dentate gyrus. Papassotiropoulos and colleagues (2005) found that people
with a particular allele of the prion protein gene remembered 17 percent
more information 24 hours after a word list--learning task than did
people with a different allele. (Both alleles are considered normal and
are not associated with a prion protein disease.) Mallucci and
colleagues (2003) created a genetically modified mouse strain whose
neurons produced an enzyme at 12 weeks of age that destroyed normal
prion protein. When the animals were a few weeks of age, the
experimenters infected them with misfolded mouse scrapie prions. Soon
thereafter, the animals began to develop spongy holes in their brains,
indicating that they were infected with mouse scrapie. Then, at 12
weeks, the enzyme became active and started destroying normal PrPc.
Although analysis showed that glial cells in the brain still contained
misfolded PrPSc, the disease process stopped. Neurons stopped making
normal PrPc, which could no longer be converted into PrPSc, so the mice
went on to live normal lives. The disease process continued to progress
in mice without the special enzyme, and these animals soon died. The
authors concluded that the process of conversion of PrPc to PrPSc is
what kills cells. How might misfolded prion protein kill neurons? As we
will see later in this chapter, the brains of people with several other
degenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's
disease, frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and
Huntington's disease, also contain aggregations of misfolded proteins
(Miller, 2009; Lee et al., 2010). We will also see that although these
misfolded proteins are not prions, the disease process can be
transmitted to the brains of other animals by inoculating them with the
proteins. As we saw in Chapter 15, cells contain the means by which they
can commit suicide---a process known as apoptosis. Apoptosis can be
triggered either externally, by a chemical signal telling the cell that
it is no longer needed (for example, during development), or internally,
by evidence that biochemical processes in the cell have become disrupted
so

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 528

that the cell is no longer functioning properly. Perhaps the
accumulation of misfolded, abnormal proteins provides such a signal.
Apoptosis involves production of "killer enzymes" called caspases.
Mallucci and colleagues (2003) suggest that inactivation of caspase-12,
the enzyme that appears to be responsible for the death of neurons
infected with PrPSc, may provide a treatment that could arrest the
progress of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Other researchers
have become interested in developing anti-prions that replicate and
out-compete the infectious prions. Initial studies suggest that this
strategy may also hold promise as a future treatment for these diseases
(Diaz-Espinoza et al., 2018).

Parkinson's Disease LO 16.8 Describe the symptoms and causes of and
treatments for Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease occurs in
approximately 1 percent of people over 65 years of age. Parkinson's
disease is caused by degeneration of the nigrostriatal system---the
dopaminesecreting neurons of the substantia nigra that send axons to the
basal ganglia. As we saw in Chapter 8, the motor deficits of patients
with Parkinson's disease can be described as a deficiency of automatic,
habitual responses caused by damage to the basal ganglia. For example,
once a person with Parkinson's disease is seated, he or she finds it
difficult to rise. Once the person begins walking, he or she has
difficulty stopping. Reaching for an object can be accurate, but the
movement usually begins only after a considerable delay. Writing is slow
and labored, and as it progresses, the letters get smaller and smaller.
Postural movements are impaired. A healthy person who is bumped while
standing will quickly move to restore balance---for example, by taking a
step in the direction of the impending fall or by reaching out with the
arms to grasp onto a piece of furniture. However, a person with
Parkinson's disease fails to do so and simply falls. A person with this
disorder is even unlikely to put out his or her arms to break the fall.
Parkinson's disease also produces a resting tremor--- vibratory
movements of the arms and hands that diminish somewhat when the
individual makes purposeful movements. The tremor is accompanied by
rigidity; the joints appear stiff. However, the tremor and rigidity are
not the cause of the slow movements. In fact, some patients with
Parkinson's disease show extreme slowness of movements but little or no
tremor. Examining the brains of patients who had Parkinson's disease
shows the near-disappearance of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Many
surviving dopaminergic neurons show Lewy bodies, abnormal circular
structures found within the cytoplasm. Lewy bodies have a dense protein
core, surrounded by a halo of radiating fibers (Forno, 1996). (See
Figure 16.16.)

Figure 16.17 The Role of Parkin in Parkinson's Disease

Parkin is involved in the destruction of abnormal or misfolded proteins
by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. If parkin is defective because of a
mutation, abnormal or misfolded proteins cannot be destroyed, so they
accumulate in the cell. If α-synuclein is defective because of a
mutation, parkin is unable to tag it with ubiquitin, and it accumulates
in the cell.

Misfolded protein Parkin attaches molecules of ubiquitin to misfolded
protein, targeting it for destruction by the proteasome

What are the effects of the loss of dopaminergic neurons on normal brain
functioning? Functional-imaging studies have shown that akinesia
(difficulty in initiating movements) was associated with decreased
activation of the supplementary motor area and that tremors are
associated with abnormalities of a neural system involving the pons,
midbrain, cerebellum, and thalamus (Buhmann et al., 2003; Grafton,
2004). CAUSES Although most cases of Parkinson's disease do not appear
to have genetic origins, researchers have discovered that the mutation
of a particular gene located on chromosome 4 will produce this disorder
(Polymeropoulos et al., 1996). This gene produces a protein known as
α-synuclein, which is normally found in the presynaptic terminals and is
thought to be involved in synaptic transmission in dopaminergic neurons
(Moore et al., 2005). The mutation produces what is known as a toxic
gain of function because it produces a protein that results in effects
that are toxic to the cell. Mutations that cause toxic gain of function
are normally dominant because the toxic substance is produced whether
one or both members of the pair of chromosomes contain the mutated gene.
Abnormal α-synuclein becomes misfolded and forms aggregations,
especially in dopaminergic neurons (Goedert, 2001). The dense core of
Lewy bodies consists primarily of these aggregations, along with
neurofilaments and synaptic vesicle proteins. Another hereditary form of
Parkinson's disease is caused by mutation of a gene on chromosome 6 that
produces a protein that has been named parkin (Kitada et al., 1998).
This mutation causes a loss of function, which makes it a recessive
disorder. If a person carries a mutated parkin gene on only one
chromosome, the normal allele on the other chromosome can produce a
sufficient amount of normal parkin for normal cellular functioning, and
the person will not develop Parkinson's disease. Normal parkin plays a
role in transferring defective or misfolded proteins to the
proteasomes---­ organelles responsible for destroying these proteins
(Moore et al., 2005). This mutation permits high levels of defective
protein to accumulate in dopaminergic neurons and ultimately

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 529

Ubiquitin molecules

Proteasome breaks misfolded protein into its constituent amino acids
Amino acids

damage them. Figure 16.17 illustrates the role of parkin in the action
of proteasomes. Parkin assists in the tagging of abnormal or misfolded
proteins with numerous molecules of ubiquitin, a small, compact globular
protein. Ubiquitination (as this process is called) targets the abnormal
proteins for destruction by the proteasomes, which break them down into
their constituent amino acids. Defective parkin fails to ubiquinate
abnormal proteins, and they accumulate in the cell, eventually killing
it. For some reason, dopaminergic neurons are especially sensitive to
this accumulation. The overwhelming majority of the cases of Parkinson's
disease (approximately 95 percent) are sporadic. That is, they occur in
people without a family history of Parkinson's disease. What, then,
triggers the accumulation of α-synuclein and the destruction of
dopaminergic neurons? Research suggests that Parkinson's disease may be
caused by toxins present in the environment, by faulty metabolism, or by
unrecognized infectious disorders. For example, the insecticides
rotenone and paraquat can cause Parkinson's disease, and, presumably, so
can other unidentified toxins. All of these

24/11/21 2:01 PM

530 Chapter 16 chemicals inhibit mitochondrial function, which leads to
the aggregation of misfolded α-synuclein, especially in dopaminergic
neurons. These accumulated proteins eventually kill the cells (Dawson &
Dawson, 2003; Johnson et al., 2018). The brain contains multiple systems
of dopaminergic neurons, for example the nigrostriatal system (whose
damage causes Parkinson's disease), and the mesolimbic/ mesocortical
system, which consists of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental
area that innervate the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex.
Parkinson's disease damages only the nigrostriatal system, so there must
be an important difference between the dopaminergic neurons in these
systems. Mosharov and colleagues (2009) suggest that the critical
difference is that calcium channels are involved in regulating the
spontaneous activity of DA cells in the nigrostriatal system and sodium
channels are involved in regulating the activity of those in the
mesolimbic/mesocortical system. Research with rodent models of
Parkinson's disease suggests that the presence of α-synuclein, elevated
intracellular calcium ions, and elevated levels of intracellular
dopamine combine to kill these cells. Interference with any of these
three factors prevents damage to these cells. Because DA neurons of the
mesolimbic/mesocortical system do not contain elevated levels of calcium
ions, they are spared. TREATMENTS Although there is no cure for
Parkinson's

disease, researchers and clinicians have developed several
pharmacological and surgical intervention options to treat the symptoms
of the disease.

Drug Treatments As we saw in Chapter 4, the standard treatment for
Parkinson's disease is l-DOPA, the precursor of dopamine. An increased
level of l-DOPA in the brain causes a patient's remaining dopaminergic
neurons to produce and secrete more dopamine and, for a time, alleviates
the symptoms of the disease. But this compensation does not work
­indefinitely; eventually, the number of nigrostriatal dopaminergic
neurons declines to such a low level that the symptoms become worse.
Unfortunately, the l-DOPA also activates DA neurons in the
mesolimbic/mesocortical system and produces side effects such as
hallucinations and delusions. Another drug, deprenyl, is often given to
patients with Parkinson's disease, usually in conjunction with l-DOPA.
Deprenyl inhibits the activity of the enzyme MAO-B. The original
rationale for administering deprenyl to patients with Parkinson's
disease was that it might prevent unknown toxins from producing further
damage to dopaminergic neurons. Many studies (for example, Mizuno et
al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011) confirm that administration of deprenyl
slows the progression of Parkinson's disease, especially if deprenyl
therapy begins soon after the onset of the disease. However, the
benefits of deprenyl and other MAO-B inhibitors appear to be reduction
in symptoms. While it does not appear that drug treatments are currently
useful in preventing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, other drugs
that can act as dopamine agonists or acetylcholine antagonists may be
useful in treating symptoms (Fox et al., 2018). Drug treatments do not
appear to slow the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (Williams,
2010). (See Figure 16.18.)

Surgical Procedures Neurosurgeons have been developing three stereotaxic
procedures designed to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease
that no longer respond to treatment with l-DOPA. The first one,
transplantation of fetal tissue, attempts to reestablish the secretion
of dopamine in the neostriatum. The tissue is obtained from the
substantia nigra of aborted human fetuses and implanted into the caudate
nucleus and putamen by means of stereotaxically guided needles. As we
saw in Chapter 5, PET scans have shown that dopaminergic fetal cells are
able to grow in the recipient and secrete dopamine, reducing the
patient's symptoms---at least initially. In a study of 32 patients with
fetal tissue transplants, Freed (2002) found that those whose symptoms
had previously responded to l-DOPA were most likely to benefit from the
surgery. Presumably, these patients had a sufficient number of basal
ganglia neurons with receptors that could be stimulated by the dopamine
secreted by either the medication or the transplanted tissue.
Unfortunately, many transplant patients later developed severe,
persistent ­ dyskinesias---troublesome and often painful involuntary
movements. As a result, fetal transplants of dopaminergic fetal cells
are no longer recommended (Olanow et al., 2003). Further examination of
the fate of fetal transplants has shown that although the transplanted
cells can survive and form connections with neurons in the recipient's
tissue, these cells eventually develop deposits of α-synuclein. Studies
with animal models of Parkinson's disease show that misfolded
α-synuclein is transferred from the recipient's own neurons to the
grafted neurons (Kordower et al., 2011). As many investigators have
noted, misfolded proteins responsible for several neurodegenerative
diseases, including Parkinson's disease, can be transferred from cell to
cell in the brain, where they induce further protein misfolding, just
like prion proteins (Lee et al., 2011). It appears that adding healthy
cells to the basal ganglia of patients with Parkinson's disease will
ultimately fail unless a way is found to stop the process that results
in the deposition of misfolded α-synuclein. Another therapeutic
procedure has a long history, but only recently have technological
developments in imaging methods and electrophysiological techniques led
to an increase in its popularity. The principal output of the basal
ganglia comes from the internal division of the globus pallidus (GPi).
(The caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus are the three major
components of the basal ganglia.) This output, which is directed through
the subthalamic nucleus (STN) to the motor cortex, is inhibitory.
Furthermore, a decrease in the activity of the dopaminergic input to the
caudate nucleus and putamen causes

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 531

an increase in the activity of the GPi. In this way, damage to the GPi
might be expected to relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. (See
Figure 16.19.) In the 1950s, Leksell and his colleagues performed
pallidotomies (surgical destruction of the internal division of the
globus pallidus) in patients with severe Parkinson's disease (Laitinen
et al., 1992; Svennilson et al., 1960). The surgery often reduced the
rigidity and enhanced the patient's ability to move. Unfortunately, the
surgery occasionally made the patient's symptoms worse and sometimes
resulted in partial blindness. (The optic tract is located next to the
GPi.) With the development of l-DOPA therapy in the late 1960s,
pallidotomies were abandoned. However, it eventually became evident that
l-DOPA worked for a limited time and that the symptoms of Parkinson's
disease would eventually return. For that reason, in the 1990s,
neurosurgeons again began experimenting with pallidotomies, first with
laboratory animals and then with humans (Graybiel, 1996; Lai et al.,
2000). This time, they used MRI scans to find the location of the GPi
and then inserted an electrode into the target region. The surgeon would
then pass radiofrequency current to heat and destroy the brain tissue.
The results of this procedure were so promising that several
neurological teams began promoting its use in the treatment of
relatively young patients whose symptoms no longer respond to l-DOPA.
Neurosurgeons have also targeted the STN in patients with advanced
Parkinson's disease. As Figure 16.19 shows, the subthalamic nucleus has
an excitatory effect on the GPi; therefore, damage to the subthalamic
nucleus decreases the activity of this region and removes some of the
inhibition on motor output. This surgery brings depressed motor activity
back to normal (Guridi & Obeso, 2001). (See Figure 16.20.) In Chapter 5
you read about optogenetic methods that enable a researcher to stimulate
or inhibit specific types of neurons in specific locations of the brain.
Kravitz and colleagues (2010) used a genetically engineered virus to
insert into mice light-sensitive proteins in the neurons of the striatum
that receive inputs from axons of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia
nigra. They used two different procedures that enabled them to stimulate
neurons that contained either dopamine D1 receptors (part of the direct
pathway of the cortical-- basal ganglia loop) or dopamine D2 receptors
(part of the indirect pathway). As Figure 16.19 shows, activation of the
direct pathway inhibits the GPi and activation of the indirect pathway
excites the GPi. They found that activation of the indirect pathway,
which excites the GPi, caused the mice to display the motor symptoms
seen in

lesions of the nigrostriatal system, who displayed the symptoms of
Parkinson's disease. When they stimulated this pathway, which inhibits
the GPi, the parkinsonian symptoms disappeared. This experiment clearly
and elegantly demonstrates that---at least in this mouse model---the
motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are produced by a shift of balance
in favor of the indirect pathway. These findings explain why surgical
lesions targeted at the GPi can reduce these symptoms. The third
stereotaxic procedure aimed at relieving the symptoms of Parkinson's
disease involves implanting electrodes in the STN or the GPi and
attaching a device

that permits the patient to electrically stimulate the brain through the
electrodes. (See Figure 16.21.) According to some studies, deep brain
stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus is as effective as brain
lesions in suppressing tremors and has fewer adverse side effects
(Esselink et al., 2009). In addition, a 3-year follow-up study found no
evidence of cognitive deterioration in patients who received implants
for deep brain stimulation (Funkiewiez et al., 2004). DBS may also have
effects on the affective and cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease
such as depression and dementia, but the results of these studies are
less clear (Castelli et al., 2006; Funkiewiez et al., 2004).

of the more extensive network shown in Figure 16.19. Lesioning parts of
the indirect pathway between the STN and the GPi can help reduce motor
inhibition. The output of GPi leads to motor inhibition. Lesioning the

The fact that either lesioning or stimulation alleviates tremors
suggests that deep brain stimulation has an inhibitory effect on STN
neurons, but an optogenetic study by Gradinaru and colleagues (2009)
indicates that the effects of DBS are more complex than that. Gradinaru
and colleagues produced unilateral motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease
in mice by damaging the nigrostriatal dopamine system on the right side
of the brain. They inserted inhibitory light-sensitive protein into the
right subthalamic nucleus and found that inhibition of neurons in this
nucleus had no effect on the motor symptoms, which suggests that DBS
does not exert its beneficial effects by simply inhibiting neurons of
the STN. Next, they inserted excitatory light-sensitive protein in the
right STN and found that excitation of neurons in this nucleus did not
affect motor symptoms, so DBS does not reduce parkinsonian motor
symptoms through excitation of the STN, either. Next, the investigators
inserted excitatory light-sensitive protein in the axons of neurons
entering the STN. This time, excitation of these axons did suppress the
parkinsonian motor symptoms. These results suggest that DBS exerts its
therapeutic effects not through simple excitation or inhibition of
neurons in the STN but by causing undoubtedly more complex changes in
the firing of particular neurons in the STN by activating axons that
enter this structure. Gene Therapy Researchers have been attempting to
develop strategies of gene therapy to treat the symptoms of

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 533

Parkinson's disease. Kaplitt and colleagues (2007) introduced a
genetically modified virus into the subthalamic nucleus of patients with
Parkinson's disease that delivered a gene for GAD, the enzyme
responsible for the biosynthesis of the major inhibitory
neurotransmitter, GABA. The production of GAD turned some of the
excitatory, glutamate-producing neurons in the subthalamic nucleus into
inhibitory, GABA-producing neurons. As a result, the activity of the GPi
decreased, the activity of the supplementary motor area increased, and
the symptoms of the patients improved. A larger double-blind clinical
trial confirmed the efficacy and safety of this procedure (LeWitt et
al., 2011). Reviewing the studies published using various treatments for
Parkinson's disease reflects the changes in treatment strategies over
time, the advent of new surgeries, realization of the limitations of
treatments like l-DOPA, and more recent work on gene therapies and DBS
(Lozano et al., 2018). (See Figure 16.22.)

uncontrollable ones, especially jerky limb movements. The movements of
Huntington's disease look like fragments of purposeful movements but
occur involuntarily. This disease is progressive, includes cognitive and
emotional changes, and eventually causes death, usually within 10--15
years after the symptoms begin. (See Figure 16.23.) The symptoms of
Huntington's disease usually begin in the person's 30s and 40s but can
sometimes begin in the early 20s. The first signs of neural degeneration
occur in the putamen, in a specific group of inhibitory neurons:
GABAergic medium spiny neurons. Damage to these neurons removes some
inhibitory control exerted on the premotor and supplementary motor areas
of the frontal cortex. Loss of this control leads to involuntary
movements. As the disease progresses, neural degeneration is seen in
many other regions of the brain, including the cerebral cortex. CAUSES
Huntington's disease is a hereditary disorder, caused by a dominant gene
on chromosome 4. In fact, the gene has been located, and its defect has
been identified as a repeated sequence of bases (called CAG repeats)
that code for the amino acid glutamine (Collaborative Research Group,
1993). This repeated sequence causes the gene product---a protein called
huntingtin (Htt)---to contain an elongated stretch of glutamine.
Abnormal Htt becomes misfolded and forms aggregations that accumulate in
the nucleus. Longer stretches of glutamine are associated with patients
whose symptoms began at a younger

age, a finding that indicates that this abnormal portion of the
huntingtin molecule is responsible for the disease. (See Figure 16.24.)
These facts suggest that the mutation causes the disease through a toxic
gain of function---that abnormal Htt causes harm. In fact, the cause of
death of neurons in Huntington's disease is apoptosis (cell "suicide").
Li and colleagues (2000) found that transgenic mice that are a model for
Huntington's disease lived longer if they were given a caspase
inhibitor, which suppresses apoptosis. Abnormal Htt may trigger
apoptosis by impairing the function of the ubiquitin-protease system,
which activates caspase, one of the enzymes involved in apoptosis (Hague
et al., 2005).

536 Chapter 16 Normal Htt is found in cells throughout the body, but it
occurs in especially high levels in neurons and in cells of the testes.
It is found in the cytoplasm, where it associates with microtubules,
vesicular membrane, and synaptic proteins, which suggests that it plays
a role in vesicular transport, release of neurotransmitter, and
recycling of vesicular membrane (Levine et al., 2010). A targeted
mutation against the Htt gene is fatal, causing death of the fetus early
in development (Nasir et al., 1995), so the huntingtin protein plays an
essential role in development. Researchers have debated the role played
by the accumulations of misfolded Htt in the nucleus (known as inclusion
bodies) in development of the disease. These inclusions could cause
neural degeneration, they could have a protective role, or they could
play no role at all. Studies by Arrasate and her colleagues (Arrasate et
al., 2004; Miller et al., 2010) strongly suggest that inclusion bodies
actually protect neurons. The investigators prepared tissue cultures
from rat striatal neurons that they infected with genes that expressed
fragments of abnormal Htt. Some of the neurons that produced the mutant
Htt formed inclusion bodies; others did not. The investigators used a
robotic microscope to see what happened to the cells over a period of
almost 10 days. They found that the inclusion bodies appeared to have a
protective function. Neurons that contained inclusion bodies had lower
levels of mutant Htt elsewhere in the cell, and these neurons lived
longer than those without these accumulations. (See Figure 16.25.)

At present there is no treatment for Huntington's disease. However, some
research has focused on reducing the levels of mutant Htt in cells, with
the goal of developing therapeutic treatments for the future. Southwell
and colleagues (2009) prepared a special type of antibody that acts
intracellularly (an intrabody) called Happ1. This antibody targets a
portion of the huntingtin protein. Tests with five different
experimental models of Huntington's disease in mice found that insertion
of the Happ1 gene into the animals' brains suppressed production of
mutant Htt and improved the animals' disease symptoms. Another approach
by DiFiglia and her colleagues (DiFiglia et al., 2007; Pfister et al.,
2009) involves injection of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) into the
striatum that blocked the transcription of the Htt genes---and hence the
production of mutant Htt protein---in this region. The treatment
decreased the size of inclusion bodies in striatal neurons, prolonged
the life of the striatal neurons, and reduced the animals' motor
symptoms. Other researchers have experimented with using antisense
oligonucleotides (see Chapter 5) to reduce the amount of mutant Htt
protein. Antisense oligonucleotides can inactivate the messenger RNA for
Htt, preventing the production of mutant Htt proteins (Imbert et al.,
2019; Kordasiewicz et al., 2012). Other research groups have begun to
explore the ability to remove CAG repeats from the HTT gene using
CRISPR-Cas9 techniques (Dabrowska et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2017).

LO 16.10 Describe the symptoms and causes of and treatments for
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a
degenerative disorder that attacks spinal cord and cranial nerve motor
neurons (Zinman & Cudkowicz, 2011). The incidence of this disease is
approximately 5 in 100,000. The symptoms include spasticity (increased
tension of muscles, causing stiff and awkward movements), exaggerated
stretch reflexes, progressive weakness and muscular atrophy, and,
finally, paralysis. The muscles that control eye movements are spared.
Some cognitive abilities, such as executive function, working memory,
language, and social cognition, may also be affected (Goldstein &
Abrahams, 2013). Death usually occurs 5--10 years after the onset of the
disease as a result of failure of respiratory muscles. Ten percent of
the cases of ALS are hereditary; the other 90 percent are sporadic. Of
the hereditary cases, 10--20 percent are caused by a mutation in the
gene that produces the enzyme superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), found on
chromosome 21. This mutation causes a toxic gain of function that leads
to protein misfolding and aggregation, impaired axonal transport, and
mitochondrial dysfunction. CAUSES

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 536

24/11/21 2:02 PM

Neurological Disorders 537

It also impairs glutamate reuptake into glial cells, which increases
extracellular levels of glutamate and causes excitotoxicity in motor
neurons (Bossy-Wetzel et al., 2004). And like the other degenerative
brain disorders described in this module that involve misfolded
proteins, mutant SOD1 can be transmitted from cell to cell, as prion
proteins are. However, there is presently no evidence that the disease
can be transmitted between individuals (Münch & Bertolotti, 2011). SOD1
normally functions as a detoxifying enzyme found in the cytoplasm and
mitochondria. It converts superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen and
hydrogen peroxide (Milani et al., 2011). Superoxide radicals are
naturally present in the cytoplasm but become toxic in sufficiently high
concentrations. Many investigators believe that the primary cause of
sporadic ALS is an abnormality in RNA editing. In most cases, proteins
are produced by a two-step process: a copy of an active gene is
transcribed to a strand of messenger RNA, which is then translated into
a sequence of amino acids at a ribosome. However, in some cases, enzymes
alter mRNA molecules between transcription and translation so that a
different protein is produced. In sporadic ALS, faulty editing of mRNA
that codes for a particular glutamate receptor subunit (GluR2) in motor
neurons results in the production of glutamate AMPA receptors that admit
increased amounts of calcium ions into these neurons. As you have read
previously in this chapter, excess intracellular calcium contributes to
apoptosis, and a result, the cells die from excitotoxicity. Kawahara and
colleagues (2004) examined the spinal cords and brains of five patients
who had died of ALS and found evidence for deficient RNA editing in
spinal cord motor neurons in all of them. All of the motor neurons from
people without ALS showed normal RNA editing. Hideyama and colleagues
(2010) prepared a targeted mutation against the gene for an enzyme
involved in editing RNA responsible for the production of the GluR2
subunit and used a viral vector to insert this mutated gene into mouse
motor neurons. The animals showed a decline in motor ability
characteristic of ALS that was produced by slow death of motor neurons
in the spinal cord and brain. Using antisense oligonucleotides to
inhibit mRNA for SOD1 shows potential in reducing SOD1 and extending
survival times in rodent models of ALS (McCampbell et al., 2018).

Multiple Sclerosis LO 16.11 Describe the symptoms and causes of and
treatments for multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an
autoimmune demyelinating disease. At scattered locations within the
central nervous system, the person's immune system attacks myelin
sheaths, leaving behind hard patches of debris called ­sclerotic plaques.
(See Figure 16.26.) The normal transmission of neural messages through
the demyelinated axons is interrupted. Because the damage occurs in
white matter located throughout the brain and spinal cord, a wide
­variety of neurological symptoms are seen. The symptoms of multiple
sclerosis often appear, increase in intensity and then decrease, to be
followed by another increase in symptoms after varying periods of time.
In most cases, this pattern, known as remitting-relapsing MS, is
followed by progressive MS later in the course of the disease.
Progressive MS is characterized by a slow, continuous increase in the
symptoms of the disease. CAUSES Women are diagnosed with MS somewhat
more frequently than men, and the disorder usually occurs in people in
their late 20s or 30s. People who spend their childhood in places far
from the equator are more likely to be diagnosed with the disease than
are those who live close to the equator. Hence, it is likely that some
disease contracted during a childhood spent in a region in which the
virus is prevalent causes the person's immune system to attack his or
her own myelin. Perhaps a virus weakens the blood--brain barrier,
allowing myelin protein into the general circulation and sensitizing the
immune system to it, or perhaps the virus attaches itself to myelin. In
addition, people born during the late winter and early spring are at
higher risk, which suggests that infections contracted by a pregnant
woman (for example, a viral disease contracted during the winter) may
also increase

Hospital, Portland, Oregon.

The only current pharmacological treatment for ALS is riluzole, a drug
that reduces glutamateinduced excitotoxicity, probably by decreasing the
release of glutamate. Clinical trials found that patients treated with
riluzole lived an average of approximately 2 months longer than those
who received a placebo (Miller et al., 2003). Clearly, research to find
more effective therapies is warranted.

538 Chapter 16 susceptibility to this disease. Regardless of the origin,
the process is a long-lived one, lasting for many decades. TREATMENTS
Only a few treatments for multiple sclerosis have shown promise (Aktas
et al., 2009). The first is interferon β, a protein that modulates the
responsiveness of the immune system. Administration of interferon β has
been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks and to slow
the progression of neurological disabilities in some patients with
multiple sclerosis (Arnason, 1999). However, the treatment is only
partially effective. Another partially effective treatment is glatiramer
acetate (also known as copaxone or copolymer-1). Glatiramer acetate is a
mixture of synthetic peptides composed from random sequences of the
amino acids tyrosine, glutamate, alanine, and lysine. Interferon β and
glatiramer acetate are effective only for the remitting-relapsing form
of MS and not the progressive form. An experimentally induced
demyelinating disease known as experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE)
can be produced in laboratory animals by injecting them with protein
found in myelin. The immune system then becomes sensitized to myelin
protein and attacks the animal's own myelin sheaths. Glatiramer acetate
turned out to do just the opposite; rather than causing EAE, it
prevented its occurrence, apparently by stimulating certain cells of the
immune system to secrete anti-inflammatory chemicals such as interleukin
4, which suppress the activity of immune cells that would otherwise
attack the patient's myelin (Farina et al., 2005). As you might expect,
researchers tested glatiramer acetate in people with MS and found that
the drug reduced the symptoms of patients who showed the
relapsing-remitting form of the disease: periodic occurrences of
neurological symptoms followed by partial remissions. A structural MRI
study by Sormani and colleagues (2005) found a reduction of 20--54
percent in white matter lesions in 95 percent of patients treated with
glatiramer acetate. The drug is now approved for treatment of this
disorder. Although interferon β and glatiramer acetate provide some
relief, neither treatment halts the progression of MS. Recent clinical
trials have suggested that a new drug, BG-12, may be effective in
reducing the number of brain lesions, the rate of relapse, and the rate
of disability progression in relapsing MS (Fox et al., 2012; Gold et
al., 2012; Kappos et al, 2014). One other encouraging approach to
treatment of MS is the transplantation of autologous hemopoietic stem
cells---transplants of adult stem cells taken from a patient's own blood
or bone marrow. A clinical trial with 21 MS patients reported
significant improvements in neurological symptoms at the end of 37
months (Burt et al., 2009). Because the symptoms of remitting-relapsing
MS are episodic---new or worsening symptoms followed by partial
recovery---patients and their families often attribute the changes in
the symptoms to things that have

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 538

happened recently. For example, if the patient has taken a new
medication or gone on a new diet and the symptoms get worse, the patient
may attribute the symptoms to the medication or diet. Conversely, if the
patient gets better, they may credit the medication or diet. The best
way to end exploitation of MS patients (and many others) by people
selling useless treatments is to develop genuinely effective therapies.

Dementia LO 16.12 Describe the symptoms and causes of and treatments for
Alzheimer's disease. Several neurological disorders result in dementia,
a deterioration of intellectual abilities resulting from an organic
brain disorder. The most common form of dementia is called Alzheimer's
disease, which occurs in approximately 10 percent of the population
above the age of 65 and almost 50 percent of people older than 85. It is
characterized by progressive loss of memory and other cognitive
functions. At first, people may have difficulty remembering appointments
and sometimes fail to think of words or other people's names. As time
passes, they show increasing confusion and difficulty with tasks such as
managing their finances. The memory deficit most critically involves
recent events, and thus it resembles the anterograde amnesia of
Korsakoff's syndrome (described in the next section). If people with
advanced Alzheimer's disease venture outside alone, they are likely to
get lost. As this fatal disease progresses, symptoms become increasingly
severe (Terry & Davies, 1980). Alzheimer's disease produces severe
degeneration of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, neocortex
(especially the association cortex of the frontal and temporal lobes),
nucleus basalis, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei. Figure 16.27 shows
the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's disease and

of a healthy control brain. You can see how much wider the sulci are in
the patient's brain, especially in the frontal and temporal lobes,
indicating substantial loss of cortical tissue. Some of the pathology of
Alzheimer's disease overlaps with that of other conditions affecting the
brain. For example, Lewy bodies were previously described in the context
of Parkinson's disease, and they are also frequently associated with
dementia. The presence of Lewy bodies is found in up to 20 percent of
patients diagnosed with dementia (Breitve et al., 2014). Earlier, we
also mentioned that the brains of people with Down syndrome usually
develop abnormal structures that are also seen in patients with
Alzheimer's disease: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
Amyloid plaques are extracellular deposits that consist of a dense core
of a protein known as β-amyloid, surrounded by degenerating axons and
dendrites, along with activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, cells
that are involved in destruction of damaged cells. Eventually, the
phagocytic glial cells destroy the degenerating axons and dendrites,
leaving only a core of β-amyloid (usually referred to as Aβ).
Neurofibrillary tangles consist of dying neurons that contain
intracellular accumulations of twisted filaments of hyperphosphorylated
tau protein. Normal tau protein serves as a component of microtubules,
which provide the cells' transport mechanism. During the progression of
Alzheimer's disease, excessive amounts of phosphate ions become attached
to strands of tau protein, thus changing the molecular structure.
Abnormal filaments are seen in the soma and proximal dendrites of
pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex, which disrupt transport of
substances within the cell. Eventually the cell dies, leaving behind a
tangle of protein filaments. (See Figure 16.28.) Formation of amyloid
plaques is caused by the production of a defective form of Aβ. The
production of Aβ takes several steps. First, a gene encodes the
production of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), a chain of
approximately 700 amino acids. APP is then cut apart in two places by
enzymes known as secretases to produce Aβ. The

first, β-secretase, cuts the "tail" off of an APP molecule. The second,
γ-secretase (gamma-secretase), cuts the "head" off. The result is a
molecule of Aβ that contains either 40 or 42 amino acids. (See Figure
16.29.) The location of the second cut of the APP molecule by
γ-secretase determines which form is produced. In healthy brains, 90--95
percent of the Aβ molecules are of the short form; the other 5--10
percent are of the long form. In patients with Alzheimer's disease the
proportion of long Aβ rises to as much as 40 percent of the total. High
concentrations of the long form have a tendency to fold themselves
improperly and form aggregations, which have toxic effects on the cell.
(As we saw earlier in this chapter, abnormally folded prions and
α-synuclein proteins form aggregations that result in brain
degeneration.) Usually, small amounts of long Aβ can easily be cleared
from the brain. The molecules are given an ubiquitin tag that marks them
for destruction, and they are transported to the proteasomes, where they
are rendered harmless. However, this system cannot keep up with
abnormally high levels of production of long Aβ.

540 Chapter 16 Acetylcholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain are
among the first cells to be affected in Alzheimer's disease. Aβ serves
as a ligand for the p75 neurotrophic receptor, a receptor that normally
responds to stress signals and stimulates apoptosis (Sotthibundhu et
al., 2008). Basal forebrain ACh neurons contain high levels of these
receptors; thus, once the level of long-form Aβ reaches a sufficiently
high level, these neurons begin to die. Figure 16.30 shows the abnormal
accumulation of Aβ in the brain of a person with Alzheimer's disease.
Klunk and his colleagues (Klunk et al., 2003; Mathis et al., 2005)
developed PiB, a chemical that binds with Aβ and readily crosses the
blood--brain barrier. They gave the patient and a healthy volunteer an
injection of a radioactive form of PiB and examined their brains with a
PET scanner. You can see the accumulation of the protein in the
patient's cerebral cortex. The ability to measure the levels of Aβ in
the brains of Alzheimer's patients will enable researchers to evaluate
the effectiveness of potential treatments for the disease. When such a
treatment is devised, the ability to identify the accumulation of Aβ
early in the development of the disease will make it possible to begin a
patient's treatment before significant degeneration---and the
accompanying decline in cognitive abilities---has occurred. As we saw
earlier, the brains of Alzheimer's patients contain abnormal forms of
two types of proteins: Aβ and tau. It appears that excessive amounts of
abnormal Aβ, but not tau protein, are responsible for the disease.
Mutations in the Aβ precursor, APP, produce both forms of abnormal

proteins and cause the development of both amyloid plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles. However, mutations in the gene for tau protein
(found on chromosome 17) produce only neurofibrillary tangles. The
result of these mutations is a disorder known as frontotemporal dementia
(also known as Pick's disease), which causes degeneration of the frontal
and temporal cortex, resulting in emotional changes and loss of
executive functions caused by damage to the prefrontal cortex and
language disturbance caused by temporal lobe damage (Goate, 1998;
Goedert & Spillantini, 2000). It appears that the presence of excessive
amounts of Aβ in the cytoplasm of cells, not the formation of
extracellular amyloid plaques, is the cause of neural degeneration
(Bossy-Wetzel et al., 2004). Intracellular oligomers of Aβ (aggregations
of several Aβ molecules) activate microglia, causing an inflammatory
response that triggers the release of toxic cytokines---chemicals
produced by the immune system that normally destroy infected cells. Aβ
oligomers also trigger an excessive release of glutamate by glial cells,
which causes excitotoxicity because of excessive inflow of calcium ions
through neural NMDA receptors. They also cause synaptic dysfunction and
suppress the formation of long-term potentiation, perhaps because of
interference with axonal and dendritic transport. Research has shown
that at least some forms of Alzheimer's disease occur in families and
thus appear to be hereditary. Because the brains of people with Down
syndrome (caused by an extra 21st chromosome) also contain deposits of
Aβ, some investigators hypothesized that chromosome 21 may be involved
in the production of this protein. In fact, St. George-Hyslop and
colleagues (1987) found that chromosome 21 does contain the gene that
produces APP. Since the discovery of the APP gene, several studies have
found specific mutations of this gene that produce familial Alzheimer's
disease (Martinez et al., 1993; Farlow et al., 1994). In addition, other
studies have found numerous mutations of two presenilin genes, found on
chromosomes 1 and 14, that also produce Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal
APP and presenilin genes all cause the defective long form of Aβ to be
produced (Hardy, 1997). The two presenilin proteins, PS1 and PS2, are
subunits of γ-secretase, which is not a simple enzyme but consists of a
large multiprotein complex (De Strooper, 2003). Yet another genetic
cause of Alzheimer's disease is a mutation in the gene for
apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a glycoprotein that transports cholesterol in
the blood and also plays a role in cellular repair. One allele of the
ApoE gene, known as E4, increases the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's
disease, apparently by interfering with the removal of the long form of
Aβ from the extracellular space in the brain (Roses, 1997; Bu, 2010). In
contrast, the ApoE2 allele may actually protect people from developing
Alzheimer's disease. (The most common form of ApoE is the E3 allele.)

CAUSES

24/11/21 2:02 PM

Neurological Disorders 541

Traumatic brain injuries, such as those you read about in the previous
section on TBI and CTE, are also a serious risk factor for Alzheimer's
disease. For example, examination of the brains of people who have
sustained closed head injuries reveals a widespread distribution of
amyloid plaques. Risk of Alzheimer's disease following traumatic brain
injury is especially high in people who possess the ApoE4 allele (Bu,
2010). Obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol levels, and diabetes are
also risk factors, and these factors, too, are exacerbated by the
presence of the ApoE4 allele (Martins et al., 2006). Although
genetically triggered production of abnormal Aβ plays an important role
in the development of Alzheimer's disease, the fact is that most forms
of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic, not hereditary. So far, the
strongest known nongenetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (other
than age) is traumatic brain injury. Another factor, level of education,
has also been shown to play an important role. The Religious Orders
Study, supported by the U.S. National Institute on Aging, measures the
cognitive performance of older Catholic clergy members (priests, nuns,
and monks) and examines their brains when they die. A report by Bennett
and colleagues (2003) found a positive relationship between increased
number of years of formal education and cognitive performance, even in
people whose brains contained significant concentrations of amyloid
plaques. For example, people who had received some postgraduate
education had significantly higher cognitive test scores than people
with the same concentration of amyloid plaques but less formal
education. Thus, formal education appears to enable a person to maintain
a higher level of cognitive performance even in the face of brain
degeneration. Ninety percent of the people who are participating in the
study received some college education. It is possible that if people
with much less formal education were studied, an even stronger
relationship between education and resistance to dementia would be seen.
Of course, it is possible that variables such as individual differences
in cognitive ability affect the likelihood that a person will pursue
advanced studies, and these differences, by themselves, could play an
important role. In any case, engaging in vigorous intellectual activity
and adopting a lifestyle that promotes good general health are probably
the most important things a person can do to stave off the development
of dementia. Billings and colleagues (2007) performed an experiment with
AD mice, a strain of genetically modified mice that contain a mutant
human gene for APP that leads to the development of Alzheimer's disease.
The investigators began training the mice early in life on the Morris
water maze task, described in Chapter 13. The mice were trained at
3-month intervals between the ages of 2 months and 18 months. The
training delayed the accumulation of

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 541

Aβ and led to a slower decline of the animals' performance. This study
lends support to the conclusion that cognitive activity delays the
appearance of Alzheimer's disease. Like the transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies caused by misfolded prion proteins, the misfolded Aβ
responsible for Alzheimer's disease can also be propagated from cell to
cell, and from animal to animal. Kane and colleagues (2000) prepared a
dilute suspension of homogenized brain tissue taken from deceased
patients with Alzheimer's disease and injected some of the liquid in the
brains of mice. Three months later, they found profuse development of
amyloid plaques and vascular deposits of Aβ. Even more unsettling,
Eisele and colleagues (2009) coated stainless-steel wires with minute
amounts of misfolded Aβ and implanted them in the brains of mice. This
procedure, too, induced β-amyloidosis in the recipients---even when the
wires had been boiled before they were implanted. As we saw, prion
proteins retain their infective potency even after being heated to the
boiling point. Apparently, misfolded Aβ also retains its ability to act
as a seed that induces misfolding in a recipient brain. Fortunately,
Eisele and colleagues found that more thorough sterilization of the
wires blocked the ability of the Aβ to trigger the production of
misfolded protein, so it is unlikely that Alzheimer's disease could be
transmitted by means of surgical instruments. TREATMENTS Pharmacological
treatments for Alzheimer 's disease include acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) and an NMDA
receptor antagonist (memantine). Because acetylcholinergic neurons are
among the first to be damaged in Alzheimer's disease and because these
neurons play a role in cortical activation and memory, drugs that
inhibit the destruction of ACh and hence enhance its activity have been
found to provide a modest increase in cognitive measures among patients
with this disease. However, these drugs have no effect on the process of
neural degeneration and do not prolong patients' survival. Memantine, a
noncompetitive NMDA receptor blocker, appears to produce a slight
improvement in symptoms of dementia by slowing excitotoxic destruction
of acetylcholinergic neurons caused by the entry of excessive amounts of
calcium (Rogawski & Wenk, 2003). Perhaps the most promising approaches
to the prevention of Alzheimer's disease come from immunological
research with AD mice. Schenk and colleagues (1999) and Bard and
colleagues (2000) attempted to sensitize the immune system against Aβ.
They injected AD mice with a vaccine that, they hoped, would stimulate
the immune system to destroy Aβ. The treatment worked: The vaccine
suppressed the development of amyloid plaques in the

24/11/21 2:02 PM

542 Chapter 16 brains of mice that received the vaccine from an early
age and halted or even reversed the development of plaques in mice that
received the vaccine later in life. A clinical trial with Alzheimer's
patients attempted to destroy Aβ by sensitizing the patient's immune
systems to the protein (Monsonego & Weiner, 2003). In a double-blind
study, 30 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease were given
injections of a portion of the Aβ protein. Twenty of these patients
generated antibodies against Aβ, which slowed the course of the disease,
presumably because their immune systems began destroying Aβ in their
brain and reducing the neural destruction caused by the accumulation of
this protein. Hock and colleagues (2003) compared the cognitive
abilities of the patients who generated Aβ antibodies to those who did
not. As Figure 16.31 shows, antibody production significantly reduced
cognitive decline. One of the patients whose immune system generated
antibodies against Aβ died of a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in a
blood vessel serving the lungs). Nicoll and colleagues (2003) examined
this patient's brain and found evidence that the immune system had
removed Aβ from many regions of the cerebral cortex. Unfortunately, the
injections of the Aβ antigen caused an inflammatory reaction in the
brains of 5 percent of the patients, so the clinical trial was
terminated. New approaches to treatment have included preliminary trials
of aducanumab, a replica of a naturally occurring protective antibody
that recognizes Aβ oligomers. This research reflects a new approach to
immunotherapy that will (we hope) avoid inflammatory reactions (Fu et
al., 2010; Marciani, 2015).

Korsakoff's Syndrome LO 16.13 Describe the symptoms and causes of
Korsakoff's syndrome. Another degenerative disorder characterized by
symptoms of dementia, Korsakoff's syndrome, is neither hereditary nor
contagious. It is caused by environmental factors---usually (but not
always) involving chronic consumption of alcohol. The disorder actually
results from a thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency that can be caused by
alcohol abuse (Adams, 1969; Haas, 1988). Because people who abuse
alcohol receive a substantial number of calories from the alcohol they
ingest, they usually eat a poor diet, and their vitamin intake is
consequently low. Furthermore, alcohol interferes with intestinal
absorption of thiamine. The ensuing deficiency produces brain damage.
Thiamine is essential for a step in metabolism: the carboxylation of
pyruvate, an intermediate product in the breakdown of carbohydrates,
fats, and amino acids. Korsakoff's syndrome sometimes occurs in people
who have been severely malnourished and have then received intravenous
infusions of glucose; the sudden availability of glucose to the cells of
the brain without adequate thiamine with which to metabolize it damages
the cells, probably because they accumulate pyruvate. Hence, standard
medical practice is to administer thiamine along with intravenous
glucose to severely malnourished patients. As we saw in Chapter 13, the
brain damage incurred in Korsakoff's syndrome causes anterograde
amnesia. Although degeneration is seen in many parts of the brain, the
damage that characterizes this disorder occurs in the mammillary bodies,
located at the base of the brain, in the posterior hypothalamus. (See
Figure 16.32.)

Module Review: Degenerative Disorders Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathies

Huntington's Disease

LO 16.7

LO 16.9

Describe how transmissible spongiform encephalopathies cause brain
damage.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, scrapie, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy are produced by a
simple protein molecule. The sequence of amino acids of normal prion
protein (PrPc) and infectious prion protein (PrP Sc) are identical, but
their three-dimensional shapes differ in the way that they are folded.
Somehow, the presence of a misfolded prion protein in a neuron causes
normal prion proteins to become misfolded, and a chain reaction ensues.
The transformation of PrP c into PrP Sc kills the cell, apparently by
triggering apoptosis.

Parkinson's Disease LO 16.8

Describe the symptoms and causes of and treatments for Parkinson's
disease.

Parkinson's disease is caused by degeneration of dopamine-secreting
neurons of the substantia nigra that send axons to the basal ganglia and
results in resting tremor and muscle rigidity, slowness of movement and
postural instability. The death of these neurons is caused by the
aggregation of misfolded protein, α-synuclein. Parkinson's disease is
associated with two mutations. One mutation produces defective
α-synuclein, and another produces defective parkin, a protein that
assists in the tagging of abnormal proteins for destruction by the
proteasomes. The accumulation of α-synuclein can also be triggered by
some toxins, which suggests that nonhereditary forms of the disease may
be caused by toxic substances present in the environment. Treatment of
Parkinson's disease includes administration of l-DOPA, implantation of
fetal dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia, stereotaxic destruction
of a portion of the globus pallidus or subthalamic nucleus, and
implantation of electrodes that enable the patient to electrically
stimulate the subthalamic nucleus. Research using optogenetic methods
reveals that the beneficial effects of DBS are produced by activation of
axons that enter the subthalamic nucleus. Fetal transplants of
dopaminergic neurons have been less successful than they had initially
appeared to be, probably because the α-synuclein is transferred to the
grafted neurons from the recipient's own neurons. A trial of gene
therapy designed to reduce excitation in the subthalamic nucleus
produced promising results.

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 543

Describe the symptoms and causes of and treatments for Huntington's
disease.

Huntington's disease, an autosomal dominant ­hereditary disorder,
produces degeneration of the caudate nucleus and putamen. Symptoms
include involuntary fragments of purposeful movement. Mutated huntingtin
p ­ rotein misfolds and forms aggregations that accumulate in the nucleus
of GABAergic neurons in the putamen. ­Although the primary effect of
mutated huntingtin is gain of toxic function, the disease also appears
to involve a loss of function; a targeted mutation in mice against the
Htt gene is fatal. Evidence also suggests that inclusion bodies have a
protective function and that damage is done by mutated huntingtin
dispersed throughout the cell. Animal studies that target intracellular
antibodies against a portion of Htt and that transferred small
interfering RNA targeted against the Htt gene have produced promising
results. There are currently no treatments available, however research
with intrabodies and siRNA show promising results.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis LO 16.10 Describe the symptoms and causes
of and treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis is a fatal degenerative disorder that attacks motor neurons
and produces spasticity, exaggerated stretch reflexes, progressive
weakness, muscular atrophy, and paralysis. Ten percent of the cases are
hereditary, caused by a mutation of the gene for SOD1; the other 90
percent are sporadic. The primary cause of sporadic ALS appears to be an
abnormality in RNA editing, which results in the production of AMPA
receptor subunits that permit the entry of excessive amounts of calcium
into the cells. The only pharmacological treatment is riluzole, a drug
that reduces glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.

Multiple Sclerosis LO 16.11 Describe the symptoms and causes of and
treatments for multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (MS), a
demyelinating disease, is characterized by periodic attacks of
neurological symptoms, usually with partial remission between attacks
(remitting-relapsing MS), followed by progressive MS later in life.
Symptoms of MS include a variety of neurological symptoms. The damage
appears to be caused

24/11/21 2:02 PM

544 Chapter 16

by the body's immune system, which attacks the protein contained in
myelin. Most investigators believe that a viral infection early in life
somehow sensitizes the immune system to myelin protein. Effective
treatments for remitting-relapsing MS include interferon β, and
glatiramer acetate, a mixture of synthetic peptides that appears to
stimulate certain immune cells to secrete anti-inflammatory chemicals.

Dementia LO 16.12 Describe the symptoms and causes of and treatments for
Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disease
characterized by symptoms of dementia, involves much of the brain; the
disease process eventually destroys most of the hippocampus and cortical
gray matter. The brains of affected individuals contain many amyloid
plaques, which contain a core of misfolded long-form Aβ protein
surrounded by degenerating axons and dendrites, and neurofibrillary
tangles, composed of dying neurons that contain intracellular
accumulations of twisted filaments of tau protein. Hereditary forms of
Alzheimer's disease involve defective genes for the amyloid precursor
protein (APP), for the secretases that cut APP into smaller pieces, or
for apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a glycoprotein involved in transport of
cholesterol and the repair of cell membranes. A promising treatment is
vaccination against Aβ, and administration of the antigen may ­provide a
way to avoid triggering an inflammatory reaction.

Disorders Caused by Infectious Diseases Between 1991 and 1992, nine
college students developed symptoms of headache, fever, neck stiffness,
and altered mental status. The students all lived in the same community.
The symptoms of three of the students were severe, and their illness was
ultimately fatal. Seeking to learn more about this unusual and alarming
outbreak, epidemiologists tried to identify the cause of the students'
symptoms and any possible connection among the cases. Researchers
interviewed the surviving students and their friends about where they
lived, what clubs and athletic or social activities they participated
in, the classes they attended, their parttime jobs, and their contact
with the other sick students. No direct link was found among the cases.
Upon further investigation, the researchers found that six of the
students had visited the same local bar approximately 1 week prior to
their illness. The researchers then surveyed

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 544

Temporary reduction of symptoms is seen in some patients who are treated
with anticholinergic drugs or drugs that serve as NMDA antagonists.
Exercise and intellectual stimulation appear to delay the onset of
Alzheimer's disease, and obesity, high cholesterol levels, and diabetes
are significant risk factors.

Korsakoff's Syndrome LO 16.13 Describe the symptoms and causes of
Korsakoff's syndrome. Korsakoff's syndrome produces anterograde amnesia
and is often a result of alcohol abuse, but it can also be caused by
malnutrition that results in a thiamine deficiency. The most obvious
location of brain damage is the mammillary bodies, but damage also
occurs in many other parts of the brain. Treatment includes preventive
measures such as ensuring enough thiamine in the diet and administering
thiamine along with glucose to severely malnourished patients.

Thought Question You may have noticed several similarities among
different degenerative disorders in this module. Identify two
similarities among the disorders and explain why the disorders might
share this element in common. You might consider common symptoms,
genetic contributions, protein misfolding, or neurotransmitter
alterations.

community members about bars and restaurants in the area and respondents
rated the bar as exceptionally crowded and smoky. Researchers
hypothesized that a crowded and smoky environment facilitated the spread
of the infectious organism. Follow-up investigation revealed that a bar
employee tested positive for Neisseria meningitides, the infectious
agent responsible for the students' illness (Imrey et al., 1996).

This case illustrates several characteristics of disorders caused by
infectious diseases. Several neurological disorders can be caused by
infectious disease transmitted by bacteria, fungi or other parasites, or
viruses. The most common are encephalitis and meningitis. Encephalitis
is an infection that invades the entire brain. The symptoms of acute
encephalitis include fever, irritability, and nausea, often followed by
convulsions, delirium, and signs of brain damage, such as aphasia or
paralysis. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment aside from
supportive care, and between 5 and 20 percent

of the cases are fatal; 20 percent of the survivors show some residual
neurological symptoms. This module describes the symptoms, causes, and
treatments for encephalitis and meningitis (inflammation of the
meninges), the most common disorders caused by infectious diseases.
Figure 16.33 highlights the different sites of inflammation in
meningitis and encephalitis.

Encephalitis LO 16.14 Identify the symptoms and causes of and treatments
for encephalitis. Encephalitis can also be caused by the herpes simplex
virus, which is the cause of cold sores (or "fever blisters") that most
people develop in and around their mouth from time to time. Normally,
the viruses live quietly in the trigeminal nerve ganglia nodules on the
fifth cranial nerve that contain the cell bodies of somatosensory
neurons that serve the face. The viruses proliferate periodically,
traveling down to the ends of nerve fibers, where they cause sores to
develop in mucous membranes. Unfortunately, they occasionally (but
rarely) go the other way into the brain. Herpes encephalitis is a
serious disease; the virus attacks the frontal and temporal lobes in
particular and can severely damage them. Two other forms of viral
encephalitis may be familiar to you: polio and rabies. Acute anterior
poliomyelitis ("polio") is fortunately very rare in developed countries
since the development of vaccines that immunize people against the
disease. The virus causes specific damage to motor neurons of the brain
and spinal cord: neurons in the primary motor cortex; in the motor
nuclei of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and brain stem; in the cerebellum;
and in the ventral horns of the gray matter of the spinal cord.
Undoubtedly, these motor neurons contain some chemical substance that
either attracts the virus or in some way makes the virus become lethal
to them.

M16_CARL0287_13_GE_C16.indd 545

Rabies is caused by a virus that is passed from the saliva of an
infected mammal directly into a person's flesh by means of a bite wound.
The virus travels through peripheral nerves to the central nervous
system and there causes severe damage. It also travels to peripheral
organs, such as the salivary glands, which makes it possible for the
virus to find its way to another host. The symptoms include a short
period of fever and headache, followed by anxiety, excessive movement
and talking, difficulty in swallowing, movement disorders, difficulty in
speaking, seizures, confusion, and, finally, death within 2 to 7 days of
the onset of the symptoms. The virus has a special affinity for cells in
the cerebellum and hippocampus, and damage to the hippocampus probably
accounts for the emotional changes that are seen in the early symptoms.
Fortunately, the incubation period for rabies lasts up to several months
while the virus climbs through the peripheral nerves. (If the bite is
received in the face or neck, the incubation time will be much shorter
because the virus has a shorter distance to travel before it reaches the
brain.) During the incubation period a person can receive a vaccine that
will confer immunity to the disease; the person's own immune system will
destroy the virus before it reaches the brain. Several infectious
diseases cause brain damage even though they are not primarily diseases
of the central nervous system. One such disease is caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS). Records of autopsies have revealed that at least 75
percent of people who died of AIDS show evidence of brain damage (Levy &
Bredesen, 1989). Brain damage associated with an HIV infection can
produce a range of syndromes, from mild neurocognitive disorder to
HIV-associated dementia (also called AIDS dementia complex, or ADC).
Neuropathology caused by HIV infection is characterized by damage to
synapses and death of neurons in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and
basal ganglia (Mattson et al., 2005; Valcour et al., 2011). Infection
can also be minimized by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a preventative
strategy to administer antiretroviral drugs prior to, or immediately
after, possible HIV exposure. Aggressive treatment with combination
antiretroviral therapy, if started soon after the infection is
discovered, can prevent or minimize damage to the brain. However, active
viruses can persist in the brain even when they cannot be detected in
the blood, so the patients' cognitive abilities and affective state
should be carefully monitored. If the viral infection is not treated,
the brain damage progresses and leads to a loss of cognitive and motor
functions and is the leading cause of cognitive decline in people under
40 years of age. At first the patients may become forgetful, they may
think and reason more slowly, and they may have word-finding
difficulties (anomia). Eventually, they may stop speaking. Motor
deficits may begin with tremor and difficulty in making complex
movements

24/11/21 2:02 PM

546 Chapter 16 but then may progress so much that the patient becomes
largely immobile (Maj, 1990). For several years, researchers have been
puzzled by the fact that although an HIV infection certainly causes
neural damage, neurons are not themselves infected by the virus.
Instead, the virus lives and replicates in the brain's astrocytes. The
neuropathology appears to be caused by the glycoprotein gp120 envelope
that coats the RNA that is responsible for the AIDS infection. The gp120
binds with other proteins that trigger apoptosis (Alirezaei et al.,
2007; Mattson et al., 2005).

Meningitis LO 16.15 Identify the symptoms and causes of and treatments
for meningitis. Another category of infectious diseases of the brain
actually involves inflammation of the meninges, the layers of connective
tissue that surround the central nervous system. Meningitis can be
caused by viruses or bacteria. The symptoms of all forms include
headache, a stiff neck, and, depending on the severity of the disorder,
convulsions, confusion or loss of consciousness, and sometimes death.
The stiff neck is one of the most important symptoms. Neck

movements cause the meninges to stretch; because they are inflamed, the
stretch causes severe pain. Thus, the patient resists having his or her
neck moved. The students in the case at the beginning of this module
experienced meningitis. The outbreak in the community was reduced
through vaccination of thousands of additional students. The most common
form of viral meningitis usually does not cause significant brain
damage. However, various forms of bacterial meningitis do. The usual
cause is spread of a middle-ear infection into the brain, introduction
of an infection into the brain from a head injury, or the presence of
emboli that have dislodged from a bacterial infection present in the
chambers of the heart. Such an infection is often caused by unclean
hypodermic needles; therefore, people who use intravenous drugs are at
particular risk for meningitis (as well as many other diseases). The
inflammation of the meninges can damage the brain by interfering with
circulation of blood or by blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid
through the subarachnoid space, causing hydrocephalus. In addition, the
cranial nerves are susceptible to damage. Fortunately, bacterial
meningitis can usually be treated effectively with antibiotics. Of
course, early diagnosis and prompt treatment are essential, because
neither antibiotics nor any other known treatment can repair a damaged
brain.

affects the entire brain and can cause symptoms of fever, irritability,
nausea, seizures, and neurological symptoms. One form is caused by the
herpes simplex virus, which infects the trigeminal nerve ganglia of most
of the population. This virus tends to attack the frontal and temporal
lobes. The polio virus attacks motor neurons in the brain and spinal
cord, resulting in motor deficits or even paralysis. The rabies virus,
acquired by an animal bite, travels through peripheral nerves and
attacks the brain, particularly the cerebellum and hippocampus. An HIV
infection also produces brain damage when the gp120 protein envelope of
the HIV binds with other proteins that trigger apoptosis. Aggressive
treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy can minimize brain
damage.

treatments for meningitis. Meningitis is an infection of the meninges,
caused by viruses or bacteria that produce symptoms of headache, stiff
neck, and, depending on the severity of the disorder, convulsions,
confusion or loss of consciousness, and sometimes death. The bacterial
form, which is usually more serious, is generally caused by an ear
infection, a head injury, or an embolus from a heart infection.

Thought Question Properties of some viruses are actively used in
research. For instance, HIV has a special enzyme, reverse transcriptase,
to convert its RNA to DNA to replicate and this enzyme is now used in
laboratories to synthesize coding DNA using RNA as a template, allowing
gene expression analysis. Think of another virus described in this
chapter that can be used in research.

in late adolescence or early adulthood, and the disorder is more common
in men than in women. Individuals with schizophrenia can experience a
wide range of symptoms, from auditory hallucinations, to delusions, to
blunted affect, reduced social interaction, and problems with attention
and focus. Treatments for symptoms of schizophrenia include various
types of therapeutic interventions, including cognitive behavioral
therapies, family psychoeducation, social skills training, supported
employment, and antipsychotic medications (Mueser et al., 2013). Many
people experience adverse side effects of these medications, however,
and compliance with treatments can be challenging. While the symptoms of

Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects
approximately 1 percent of the world's population. Estimates place the
total economic cost of schizophrenia in the United States at over \$155
billion (Cloutier et al., 2016). Schizophrenia is not a new disorder;
descriptions of symptoms in ancient writings suggest that the disorder
has likely existed for thousands of years (Jeste et al., 1985).
Schizophrenia may be one of the most misused psychological terms in
existence. The word literally means "split mind," but it does not imply
a split or multiple personality. The man who invented the term, Eugen
Bleuler (1911/1950), intended the term schizophrenia to refer to a break
with reality caused by disorganization of the various functions of the
mind, such that thoughts and feelings no longer worked together in a
typical fashion. Clinicians have developed criteria for reliably
diagnosing the disorder in people of a wide variety of cultures (Flaum &
Andreasen, 1990). As you'll read in this chapter, evidence suggests that
schizophrenia is associated with atypical prenatal development, with
some features present in childhood, such as poor social adjustment and
academic performance; deficient psychomotor function (Schiffman et al.,
2004); or physical anomalies, including a high-steepled palate, partial
webbing of two middle toes, or especially wide- or narrow-set eyes
(Schiffman et al., 2002). Although studies have found that people who
develop schizophrenia show some characteristics even during childhood,
the symptoms of schizophrenia typically begin

Description LO 17.1 Provide examples of positive, negative, and
cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. The main symptom categories of
schizophrenia are universal, and clinicians have developed criteria for
diagnosing the disorder in people of a wide variety of cultures (Flaum &
Andreasen, 1990). Schizophrenia is often characterized by three
categories of symptoms: positive, negative, and cognitive (Mueser &
McGurk, 2004). POSITIVE SYMPTOMS Positive symptoms are called "positive"
because the symptoms are in excess of typical functioning and make
themselves known by their presence either to the person experiencing the
symptoms or to others interacting with the person (see Elyn's case at
the beginning of the chapter for an example). Positive symptoms include
thought disorders, delusions, and hallucinations. A thought
disorder---disorganized, irrational thinking---is an important symptom
of schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia often have difficulty
arranging their thoughts logically and sorting out plausible conclusions
from improbable ones. In conversation they may jump from one topic to
another as new associations come up. Sometimes, they may use meaningless
words or choose words for rhyme rather than for meaning. Delusions are
beliefs that are contrary to fact and that are not held by a subgroup to
which the person belongs (such as religious beliefs). Delusions of
persecution are false beliefs that others are following, plotting
against, and conspiring against oneself. Delusions of grandeur are false
beliefs in one's power and importance, such as a conviction that one has
supernatural powers or has special knowledge that no one else possesses.
Delusions of control are related to delusions of persecution; the person
believes (for example) that they are being controlled by others through
such means as radar or a tiny receiver implanted in their brain.
Hallucinations are perceptions of stimuli that are not actually present.
The most common hallucinations in schizophrenia are auditory
hallucinations, which are found in approximately 70 percent of
individuals, followed by visual hallucinations (25 percent), and
hallucinations in any of the other senses (approximately 10 percent;
Mueser et al., 1990). The typical schizophrenic hallucination consists
of voices talking to the person. The voices might order the person to do
something, scold the person for their unworthiness, or utter meaningless
phrases. (See Table 17.1.)

Schizophrenia and the Affective Disorders

Table 17.1 Examples of Symptoms of Schizophrenia Symptom Positive
Hallucinations Thought disorders Delusions Persecution Grandeur Control
Negative Flattened emotional response Poverty of speech Lack of
initiative and persistence Anhedonia Social withdrawal Cognitive
Difficulty in sustaining attention Low psychomotor speed Deficits in
learning and memory Poor abstract thinking Poor problem solving

NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS In contrast to the positive symptoms, the negative
symptoms of schizophrenia are called "negative" because they represent
an absence or decrease in typical behaviors, such as reduced emotional
response, reduced speech, lack of initiative and persistence, anhedonia
(inability to experience pleasure), and social withdrawal.

The cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia may be produced by abnormalities
in the brain regions that overlap with those involved in negative
symptoms. These symptoms include difficulty sustaining attention, low
psychomotor speed (for example, in movements that include a cognitive
element, such as reaction time, connecting numbers or letters in
sequence, or alternating numbers and letters), deficits in learning and
memory, poor abstract thinking, and poor problem solving. (Look again at
Table 17.1.) Positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms are not specific
to schizophrenia; they are seen in other disorders as well. Some of
these other disorders also involve brain damage, especially to the
frontal lobes. As we will see later in this chapter, positive symptoms
appear to involve excessive activity in some neural circuits that
include dopamine as a neurotransmitter, and negative symptoms and
cognitive symptoms appear to be caused by developmental or degenerative
processes that impair the typical functions of some regions of the
brain. Depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and smoking are also very
common in schizophrenia.

COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 551

551

The symptoms of schizophrenia often appear gradually, over a period of
several years. Typically, the first clinical symptoms of schizophrenia
tend to be symptoms of depression, which are followed by social
withdrawal or impairment (negative symptoms) and cognitive difficulties
(cognitive symptoms), and then positive symptoms (Häfner, 2000; Häfner &
an der Heiden, 2003; Häfner et al., 1999; Häfner et al., 2003; Häfner et
al., 2005). As we will see later, this progression of symptoms provides
some hints about the nature of the brain abnormalities that are
responsible for them.

Genetic Factors LO 17.2 Describe the role of genetic factors in
schizophrenia. Evidence from twin (Gottesman & Shields, 1982; Tsuang et
al., 1991) and adoption (Kety et al., 1968, 1994) studies and research
investigating mutations, paternal age, and epigenetics all suggest that
heritability plays a role in the development of schizophrenia. If
schizophrenia were a simple trait produced by a single gene, we would
expect to see this disorder in at least 75 percent of the children of
two parents with schizophrenia if the gene were dominant. If it were
recessive, all children of two parents with schizophrenia should develop
the disorder. However, the actual incidence is less than 50 percent,
which means either that several genes are involved or that having
"schizophrenia genes" imparts a susceptibility to develop schizophrenia,
with the disease itself being triggered by other factors. Let's look
more closely at some of the evidence for the role of various genetic
factors in schizophrenia. If the susceptibility hypothesis is true, then
we would expect that some people carry "schizophrenia genes" but do not
express them; that is, their environment is such that schizophrenia is
never triggered. This hypothesis could be tested among monozygotic twins
in which one twin was diagnosed with schizophrenia and the other was
not. Gottesman and Bertelsen (1989) examined the children of both
members of discordant pairs of monozygotic twins and found that the
percentage of children with schizophrenia was nearly identical for both
members of such pairs: 16.8 percent for the children of parents with
schizophrenia and 17.4 percent for the children of parents without
schizophrenia. For dizygotic twins the percentages were 17.4 percent and
2.1 percent, respectively. These results provide strong evidence for the
heritability of schizophrenia and also support the conclusion that
carrying "schizophrenia genes" does not mean that a person will
necessarily develop schizophrenia. In the past, most researchers assumed
that discordance for schizophrenia in monozygotic twins must be caused
by

TWIN AND ADOPTION STUDIES

12/11/2021 10:36

552 Chapter 17 differential exposure to some environmental factors after
birth. Not only are monozygotic twins genetically identical, but they
also share the same intrauterine environment. Because all prenatal
factors should be identical, any differences must be a result of factors
in the postnatal environment. However, some investigators have pointed
out that the prenatal environment of monozygotic twins is not identical.
In fact, there are two types of monozygotic twins: monochorionic and
dichorionic. The formation of monozygotic twins occurs when the
blastocyst (the developing organism) splits in two---when it clones
itself. If twinning occurs before day 4, the two organisms develop
independently, with each forming its own placenta. (That is, the twins
are dichorionic. The chorion is the outer layer of the blastocyst, which
gives rise to the placenta.) If twinning occurs after day 4, the two
organisms become monochorionic, sharing a single placenta. (See Figure
17.2.) The placenta plays an extremely important role in prenatal
development. It transports nutrients to the developing organism from the
mother's circulation and transports waste products to her, which she
metabolizes in her liver or excretes in her urine. It also constitutes
the barrier through which toxins or infectious agents must pass if they
are to affect fetal development. The prenatal environments of
monochorionic twins, who share a single placenta, are more similar than
those of dichorionic twins. Thus, we might expect that the concordance
rates for schizophrenia of monochorionic monozygotic twins should be
higher than those of dichorionic monozygotic twins, and as Davis and his
colleagues (1995) reported, they are. Davis and his colleagues examined
sets of monozygotic twins who were concordant and discordant for
schizophrenia. They used several indices to estimate whether a given
pair was monochorionic or dichorionic. (For example, twins with mirror
images of physical features such as fingerprints,

handedness, birthmarks, or hair swirls are more likely to be
monochorionic.) The investigators estimated that the concordance rate
for schizophrenia was 10.7 percent in the dichorionic twins and 60
percent in the monochorionic twins. These results provide strong
evidence for an interaction between heredity and environment during
prenatal development. MUTATIONS So far, researchers have found hundreds
of

genes that appear to be involved in the likelihood of developing
schizophrenia (Harrison, 2015). Evidence for linkage to susceptibility
for schizophrenia has been reported for 21 of the 23 pairs of
chromosomes (Crow, 2007), and a large number of rare mutations in these
genes play a role in the development of schizophrenia (Walsh et al.,
2008). One rare mutation involves a gene known as DISC1 (disrupted in
schizophrenia 1). This gene is involved in regulation of embryonic and
adult neurogenesis, neuronal migration during embryonic development,
function of the postsynaptic density in excitatory neurons, and function
of mitochondria (Brandon et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2009; Park et al.,
2010; Wang et al., 2010). Mutations of this gene have been found in some
families with a high incidence of schizophrenia (Chubb et al., 2008;
Schumacher et al., 2009). Although the incidence of DISC1 mutation is
very low, its presence appears to increase the likelihood of
schizophrenia by a factor of 50 (Blackwood et al., 2001). This mutation
also appears to increase the incidence of other mental disorders,
including bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and autism (Kim
et al., 2009). We will describe research on the role of DISC1
malfunction in an animal model later in this chapter. As research using
new genetic techniques progresses, the complexity of genetic mutations
may become more apparent and reveal the importance of interactions
between genes and interactions between genes and environment

Schizophrenia and the Affective Disorders

(Harrison, 2015). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS; see Chapter 5)
are currently being used to locate new candidate portions of genes that
will help us better understand the genetic complexity of schizophrenia,
as well as tailor new treatment strategies (Collier et al., 2016;
Marshall et al., 2017; Ripke et al., 2011). PATERNAL AGE The effect of
paternal age provides further evidence that genetic mutations may affect
the incidence of schizophrenia (Brown et al., 2002; de Kluiver et al.,
2017; Sipos et al., 2004). Several studies have found that the children
of older fathers are more likely to develop schizophrenia. Some
researchers believe that the increased incidence of schizophrenia is
caused by mutations in the spermatocytes, the cells that produce sperms.
These cells divide every 16 days after puberty, which means that they
have divided approximately 540 times by age 35. In contrast, women's
oocytes divide 23 times before the time of birth and only once after
that. The likelihood of a copying error in DNA replication when a cell
divides increases with the number of cell divisions, and an increase in
copying errors may cause an accumulation of mutations that are
responsible for an increased incidence of schizophrenia.

Several researchers (for example, Swerdlow, 2011; Tsankova et al., 2007)
suggest that epigenetic mechanisms, as well as mutations, may contribute
to the development of schizophrenia. Epigenetic mechanisms control the
expression of genes. The long strands of DNA that constitute the
chromosomes are wound around a series of proteins known as histones.
Groups of atoms can attach to the amino acids in the histone proteins
and change their characteristics. For example, when methyl groups
(--CH3) attach to histone proteins, the regions of DNA wound around them
draw in more tightly, which prevents these regions from being translated
into messenger RNA. Thus, methylation of histone proteins prevents the
expression of particular genes. (Other groups of atoms can also bind
with histone proteins and either inhibit or promote gene expression.)
Many epigenetic changes are initiated by environmental events such as
exposure to toxins, and some epigenetic changes can be transmitted to
offspring. EPIGENETICS

Environmental Factors LO 17.3 Describe the role of environmental factors
in schizophrenia. The following sections summarize some research in the
areas of epidemiology and obstetric complications related to
schizophrenia. In addition to the factors discussed in these sections,
and the genetic factors discussed in the previous section, individual
environmental risk factors such

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 553

553

as immigration status, poverty, substance use, and trauma including
childhood abuse appear to be related to the development of schizophrenia
(Pries et al., 2018; van Os & Kapur, 2009; van Os & McGuffin, 2003;
Varese et al., 2012). Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and
causes of diseases in populations. Epidemiological studies examine the
relative frequency of diseases in groups of people in different
environments and try to correlate the disease frequencies with factors
that are present in these environments. Evidence from these studies
indicates that the incidence of schizophrenia is related to several
environmental factors that occur independently or that interact: season
of birth, viral epidemics, vitamin D deficiency, population density,
prenatal malnutrition, substance abuse, and complications of pregnancy
and birth (Brown & Derkits, 2010; King et al., 2010). Let's examine each
of these factors in turn.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES

Season of Birth Many studies have shown that people born during the late
winter and early spring are more likely to develop schizophrenia---a
phenomenon known as the seasonality effect. For example, Kendell and
Adams (1991) studied the month of birth of over 13,000 patients with
schizophrenia born in Scotland between 1914 and 1960. They found that
disproportionately more patients were born in February, March, April,
and May. (See ­Figure 17.3.) These results have been confirmed by studies
in several parts of the Northern Hemisphere (Davies et al., 2003). In
the Southern Hemisphere some studies have reported a disproportionate
number of people with schizophrenia born during late winter and early
spring---during the months of August through December---while others
have found no effect (McGrath & Welham, 1999). Viral Epidemics What
factors might be responsible for the seasonality effect? One possibility
is that pregnant women may be more likely to contract a viral illness
during a critical phase of their child's development if they are
pregnant during the fall or winter. The brain development of the fetus
may be adversely affected either by a toxin produced by the virus
or---more likely---by the mother's antibodies against the virus, which
cross the placenta barrier and attack cells of the developing fetus. As
Selemon and Zecevic (2015) note, studies have found an association
between maternal infection in the first or second trimester and
increased incidence of schizophrenia in offspring. (As we will see
later, evidence suggests that critical aspects of brain development
occur during the second trimester.) In fact, Kendell and Adams (1991)
found that the relative number of people who develop schizophrenia born
in late winter and early spring was especially high if the temperature
was lower than normal during the previous autumn---a condition

that keeps people indoors and favors the transmission of viral
illnesses. If the viral hypothesis is true, then an increased incidence
of schizophrenia should be seen in babies born a few months after an
influenza epidemic, whatever the season. Several studies have observed
just that (Mednick et al., 1990; Sham et al., 1992). A study by Brown
and colleagues (2004) examined stored samples of blood serum that had
been taken during pregnancy from mothers of children who later developed
schizophrenia. They found elevated levels of interleukin-8, a protein
secreted by cells of the immune system. The presence of this chemical
indicates the presence of an infection or other inflammatory process,
and supports the suggestion that maternal infections during the second
trimester can increase the incidence of schizophrenia in the women's
children. Brown (2006) notes that research has found that maternal
infection with at least two other infectious diseases---rubella (German
measles) and toxoplasmosis---is associated with an increased incidence
of schizophrenia. Other research has documented associations between
other infections later in life with developing schizophrenia. In related
lines of research, some studies employing immunomodulatory drugs (such
as aspirin) show promise for reducing symptoms of schizophrenia (see
Tomasik et al., 2016 for review). Vitamin D Deficiency Although cold
weather and crowding may contribute to the seasonality effect by
increasing the likelihood of contracting infectious illness, another
variable may be a common factor: a vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is a
fat-soluble chemical that is produced in the skin by the action of
ultraviolet rays on a chemical derived

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 554

from cholesterol. Harms and colleagues (2011) summarized the results of
a number of studies investigating vitamin D deficiency and its
association with increased risk of schizophrenia. These studies reported
a relationship between maternal vitamin D deficiency and schizophrenia
in children in more extreme latitudes (where the intensity and duration
of sunlight exposure is reduced), in urban areas (where lifestyle may
reduce sunlight exposure), and among people with greater amounts of the
pigment melanin in their skin, particularly at extreme latitudes where
the risk of vitamin D deficiency is compounded by reduced sunlight
exposure overall (melanin makes skin darker and reduces vitamin D
synthesis; Harms et al., 2011). An analysis of vitamin D in newborn
infants found that individuals with the lowest measures of vitamin D at
birth were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia later in life
(Eyles et al., 2018). One study found that taking a vitamin D supplement
during the first year of a child's life was associated with reduced
incidence of schizophrenia among boys (McGrath et al., 2004). Because
vitamin D plays an important role in brain development, deficiency may
be a risk factor for schizophrenia. These considerations suggest that at
least some of the increased incidence of schizophrenia in city dwellers
and those who live in cold climates may be attributable to a vitamin D
deficiency. In fact, Eyles and colleagues (2018) found the lowest levels
of vitamin D among newborn babies born during the fall, winter, and
early spring, coinciding with the seasonality effect of schizophrenia.
(See Figure 17.4.) Population Density Several studies have found that
the seasonality effect occurs primarily in cities but is rarely found in
rural areas. In fact, the likelihood of developing schizophrenia is
approximately three times higher in people who live in the middle of
large cities than in those who live in rural areas (Eaton et al., 2000).
Because viruses are more readily transmitted in regions with high
population densities, this finding is consistent with the hypothesis
that at least one of the causes of the seasonality effect is exposure of
pregnant women to viral illnesses during the second trimester. However,
Pedersen and Mortensen (2001) found that, up to the age of 15 years, the
longer a person lives in a city, the more likely it becomes that the
person will develop schizophrenia. This suggests that an urban
environment may also affect people's susceptibility to schizophrenia
postnatally as well as prenatally. Prenatal Malnutrition and Stress
Another prenatal effect was discovered by Susser and his colleagues
(Susser and Lin, 1992; Susser et al., 1996), who found a twofold
increase in the incidence of schizophrenia in the offspring of women who
were pregnant during the Hunger Winter,

a severe food shortage that occurred in the Netherlands when Germany
blockaded the country during World War II. Davis and Bracha (1996)
suggest that the specific cause of the famine-related schizophrenia may
have been a thiamine deficiency---or, more precisely, an abrupt buildup
of toxins in the brains of the developing fetuses when their mothers
suddenly began eating a normal diet when the blockade ended in May 1945.
As we saw in Chapter 16, sudden refeeding after a thiamine deficiency
can cause brain damage. Other studies have shown that underweight women
are more likely to give birth to babies who later develop schizophrenia
and that low-birth-weight babies have a higher incidence of
schizophrenia (Kunugi et al., 2001; Wahlbeck et al., 2001). In addition
to malnutrition, these situations likely generated significant stress
responses in the pregnant mothers. Other researchers have reported that
other prenatal stressors, such as exposure to a terrorist attack
(Weinstein et al., 2018), are associated with increased incidence of
schizophrenia in offspring. Substance Abuse A final category of
environmental risk factors for development of schizophrenia is substance
abuse---particularly maternal smoking. Zammit and colleagues (2009)
studied the effects of maternal use of tobacco, cannabis, or alcohol
during pregnancy and found that tobacco use was associated with
increased risk. Even paternal tobacco use increased this risk, which
suggests that

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 555

555

secondhand smoke was sufficient to adversely affect fetal development.
Excessive alcohol intake increased the risk of schizophrenia only if the
mother drank more than 210 ml of pure alcohol per week. As we saw in
Chapter 15, alcohol intake during pregnancy puts the fetus at risk for
developing fetal alcohol syndrome. Many researchers are interested in
the relationship between marijuana use and schizophrenia. A variety of
studies have documented a relationship between marijuana use,
particularly during adolescence, and schizophrenia. For example,
researchers have reported that repeated marijuana use by teenagers
(Andréasson et al., 1987; Arseneault et al., 2002) is associated with
increased incidence of schizophrenia in adulthood, although a causal
relationship has not yet been established. Semple and colleagues (2005)
summarize possible explanations for this association, such as shared
biological or environmental factors related to substance use and
schizophrenia, self-medication, or cannabis use increasing the risk for
schizophrenia. Some studies indicate that individuals at increased risk
of developing schizophrenia are more likely to use marijuana (Karcher et
al., 2019; Power et al., 2014; Verweij et al., 2017). Marijuana includes
a variety of different psychoactive components; however, research has
focused primarily on the compounds THC and cannabidiol. Intravenous
administration of THC worsened positive, negative, and cognitive
symptoms in people with schizophrenia (D'Souza et al., 2005). Research
on the effects of cannabidiol have produced mixed results, with some
studies reporting reduced positive symptoms (Leweke et al., 2012;
McGuire et al., 2017) or no effect on symptoms among people with
schizophrenia (Boggs et al., 2018). While any causal relationship
between marijuana use and schizophrenia remains unclear at this time,
researchers are actively pursuing information about the relationship
between marijuana and psychosis, as well as the roles various
cannabinoid compounds may play in the endocannabinoid system in
schizophrenia (see Hamilton & Monaghan (2019). Interactions and
Protective Factors Many studies have found an interaction between
hereditary factors and the environmental factors that we have just
reviewed (Brown & Derkits, 2010; Freedman, 2010; Mittal et al., 2008).
For example, a person born to a woman who had pyelonephritis during
pregnancy is twice as likely to develop schizophrenia and four times
more likely to do so if they have has a family history of schizophrenia.
(Pyelonephritis is an infectious disease introduced through the urinary
tract that is often associated with pregnancy.) By itself, maternal
depression does not increase the risk of developing schizophrenia in a
woman's offspring, but the likelihood of schizophrenia increases by a
factor of four in the case of familial genetic risk.

12/11/2021 10:36

556 Chapter 17 While a large body of research has focused on risk
factors (genetic and environmental) involved in the development of
schizophrenia, less research has been conducted to identify protective
factors. Avoiding exposure to environmental toxins and infectious
agents, nutritional stability during pregnancy, vitamin B and D
supplementation when needed, avoidance of prenatal stressors, avoidance
of early life stressors, avoidance of early life use of cannabis, and
supportive social and family environments may all be important
protective factors among individuals at genetic risk for schizophrenia
(Schlosser et al., 2012). Due to the correlational nature of many
studies and the lack of specific focus on protective factors,
understanding of these factors in schizophrenia is currently limited.
OBSTETRIC COMPLICATIONS Evidence indicates that obstetric complications
can also contribute to schizophrenia. In fact, several studies have
found that if a person with schizophrenia does not have relatives with
schizophrenia or a related disorder, that person is more likely to have
had a history of complications at or around the time of childbirth, and
the person is more likely to develop symptoms of schizophrenia at an
earlier age. A meta-analysis of eight studies by M. Cannon and
colleagues (2002) found that the most important factors are
complications of pregnancy, including diabetes of the mother, Rh
incompatibility between mother and fetus, bleeding, and preeclampsia
(also known as toxemia, a condition characterized by high blood
pressure, edema, and protein in the urine); abnormal fetal development,
including low birth weight, congenital malformations, and reduced head
circumference; and complications of labor and delivery, including
emergency Caesarean section, uterine complications, and fetal oxygen
deprivation. According to Boska (2004), the most important
characteristic of complications of labor and delivery is interruption of
the blood flow or oxygen supply to the brain. A study by Rehn and
colleagues (2004) provided direct evidence that deprivation of an
adequate blood supply to the uterus and placenta can have harmful
effects on

brain development. The investigators produced chronic placental
insufficiency in pregnant guinea pigs by tying off one uterine artery at
midgestation. When the offspring of these animals reached adolescence,
they showed reduced brain weight and enlarged cerebral ventricles but no
sign of gliosis in the brain. As we will see in the next section, these
changes are also seen in the brains of people with schizophrenia. As you
read earlier, schizophrenia is a heritable disease, but its heritability
is less than 100 percent. It is likely that what is inherited is a
susceptibility to environmental factors that adversely affect brain
development or cause brain damage later in life. According to this
hypothesis, having some "schizophrenia genes" makes a person more likely
to develop schizophrenia if they are exposed to these factors. However,
genetic heritability is not necessarily required to develop the
disorder; some cases of schizophrenia occur even in families with no
history of schizophrenia or related mental illnesses. For a review of
the environmental factors related to onset of schizophrenia, see Table
17.2.

Anomalies in Schizophrenia LO 17.4 Describe the behavioral, physical,
and brain anomalies associated with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is
associated with changes in behavior, physical features, and brain
structure and function. Some of these anomalies are present even before
the onset of symptoms of schizophrenia, or are present in unaffected
family members, supporting the biological basis for this disorder. The
following sections will describe research in each of these areas.
BEHAVIORAL ANOMALIES Both behavioral and anatomical evidence indicates
that abnormal development is associated with schizophrenia. Let's first
consider behavioral evidence. Walker and her colleagues (Walker et al.,
1996; Walker et al., 1994) obtained home movies from families with a
child who was later diagnosed with

Research Support for Role of Environmental Factor in Development of
Schizophrenia

Season of birth

People born during the late winter and early spring are more likely to
develop schizophrenia.

Viral epidemics

An increased incidence of schizophrenia is seen in people born a few
months after an influenza epidemic.

Population density

The likelihood of developing schizophrenia is approximately three times
higher in people who live in the middle of large cities than in those
who live in rural areas.

Prenatal malnutrition

Low-birth-weight babies have a higher incidence of schizophrenia.

Substance abuse

Tobacco use during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of
schizophrenia in offspring. Positive correlations have been reported
between early marijuana use and schizophrenia.

Interactions

A person born to a woman who had pyelonephritis during pregnancy is
twice as likely to develop schizophrenia and four times more likely to
do so if they have a family history of schizophrenia.

Obstetric complications

Emergency Caesarean section, uterine complications, and fetal oxygen
deprivation at birth are associated with increased risk of
schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia and the Affective Disorders

PHYSICAL ANOMALIES Minor physical anomalies, such as a high-steepled
palate or especially wide-set or narrow-set eyes, have also been
associated with the incidence of schizophrenia (Schiffman et al., 2002).
(See Table 17.3.) These differences were first reported in the late
nineteenth century by Kraepelin, one of the pioneers in schizophrenia
research. As Schiffman and his colleagues note, these anomalies provide
evidence of factors that have adverse effects on development. They found
that people who have relatives diagnosed with schizophrenia normally
have an 11.9 percent likelihood of developing schizophrenia. This
likelihood increases to 30.8 percent in people who also have minor
physical anomalies; thus, the factors that produce minor physical
anomalies are at least partly independent of the genetic factors
associated with schizophrenia. Many of the anomalies in Table 17.3
represent craniofacial

changes of the head, eyes, ears, and mouth. Anomalies in these physical
features may be closely related to underlying brain development and may
arise from common developmental processes (Weinberg et al., 2007). Many
studies have found evidence of loss of brain tissue in CT and MRI scans
of people with schizophrenia. In one of the earliest studies, Weinberger
and Wyatt (1982) obtained CT scans of 80 people with chronic symptoms of
schizophrenia and 66 controls of the same mean age (29 years). Without
knowledge of the patients' diagnoses they measured the area of the
lateral ventricles in the scan that cut through them at their largest
extent, and they expressed this area relative to the area of brain
tissue in the same scan. The relative ventricle size of the
schizophrenia group was more than twice as great as that of the control
group. (See Figure 17.5.) The most likely cause of the enlarged
ventricles is loss of brain tissue, and the scans provide evidence that
schizophrenia is associated with brain abnormalities. In fact,
HulshoffPol and colleagues (2002) found that although everyone loses
some cerebral gray matter as they age, the rate of tissue loss is
greater in patients with schizophrenia. (See Figure 17.6.)
Gutiérrez-Galve and colleagues (2010) found that both patients with
schizophrenia and their nondiagnosed relatives showed gray matter loss
in the frontal and temporal cortex, suggesting that genetic factors
affected cortical development and increased susceptibility to factors
that cause schizophrenia. Presumably, the healthy relatives did not
encounter these factors. As mentioned earlier, some monozygotic twins
are discordant for schizophrenia. One twin develops BRAIN ANOMALIES

schizophrenia. They had independent observers examine the behavior of
the children. In comparison with their nondiagnosed siblings, the
children who were later diagnosed with schizophrenia displayed more
negative affect in their facial expressions and were more likely to show
abnormal movements. (The ratings were done blind; the observers did not
know which children were later diagnosed with schizophrenia.) In a
similar study, Schiffman and colleagues (2004) supported these results.
In 1972, 265 Danish children, age 11--13 years, were videotaped briefly
while eating lunch. One-third of the group had one parent who was
diagnosed with schizophrenia. In 1991, the investigators examined the
medical records of these children and determined which of them had
developed schizophrenia. Raters, who did not know the identities of the
children, found that the children who later developed schizophrenia
displayed less sociability. Among the boys, those who later developed
schizophrenia also displayed somewhat deficient psychomotor functioning.
The results of these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that
although the symptoms of schizophrenia are not seen in childhood, the
early brain development of children who later develop schizophrenia is
altered.

schizophrenia, and the other does not. Suddath and colleagues (1990)
obtained evidence that differences in the structure of the brain may
reflect this discordance. The investigators examined MRI scans of
monozygotic twins who were discordant for schizophrenia and found that
in almost every case the twin with schizophrenia had larger lateral and
third ventricles, their anterior hippocampus was smaller, and the total
volume of the gray matter in the left temporal lobe was reduced. Figure
17.7 shows a set of MRI scans from a pair of twins; as you can see, the

lateral ventricles are larger in the brain of the twin with
schizophrenia. There is disagreement about whether to classify
schizophrenia as a neurodegenerative disease. Similar to the other
neurodegenerative diseases you read about in Chapter 16, schizophrenia
symptoms are related to a loss in brain volume. Some researchers suggest
that schizophrenia fits the definition of a neurodegenerative disease
because it involves a chronic and progressive loss of brain tissue
accompanied by neurological and behavioral symptoms. For example, DeLisi
and colleagues (2006) demonstrated the progressive loss of brain volume
(and enlarged ventricles) in an adult patient with chronic symptoms of
schizophrenia over 10 years. (See Figure 17.8.) The authors further
suggest that changes in brain structure are present prior to the onset
of symptoms. In contrast, Woods (1998) notes that MRI studies suggest
that schizophrenia involves a sudden, rapid loss of brain volume,
typically during young adulthood, with little evidence for continuing
degeneration. Woods suggests that the disease process of schizophrenia
begins prenatally and then lies dormant until puberty, when some unknown
mechanism triggers degeneration of some population of neurons. The brain
abnormalities that develop prenatally account for the deficits in social
behavior and poor academic performance seen in people who later develop
schizophrenia. Then, sometime after puberty, when many developmental
changes occur in the brain, more serious degeneration occurs, and the
symptoms of schizophrenia begin to appear. A study by Thompson and
colleagues (2001) found dramatic evidence for loss of cortical gray
matter during adolescence in patients with early-onset schizophrenia.
The investigators used structural MRI procedures to measure the volume
of the gray matter of the cerebral cortex at 2-year intervals in
patients with schizophrenia and control

participants. Adolescence is a time when "pruning" takes place in the
brain, and the MRI scans showed an expected loss of cortical gray matter
in control participants of about 0.5--1.0 percent. However, the loss of
tissue was approximately twice as large in participants with
schizophrenia. The degeneration started in the parietal lobes, and the
wave of destruction continued rostrally, including the temporal lobes,
somatosensory and motor cortexes, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(dlPFC). A subsequent study from the same laboratory (Cannon et al.,
2002) compared the cortical gray matter of brains of members of
identical twin pairs who were discordant for schizophrenia. Identical
twins are genetically identical, so differences in their cortical gray
matter are presumably related to the presence or absence of
schizophrenia. The investigators found that volumes of several regions
of the cerebral cortex---especially the dlPFC---were reduced in the
twins that developed schizophrenia. (We'll say more about this part of
the brain later in the chapter.) The evidence we have cited so far
suggests that the most important cause of schizophrenia is disturbance
of prenatal brain development that, in most cases, ultimately manifests
itself after puberty. Presumably, genetic factors make some fetuses more
sensitive to events that can disturb development. In addition, damage
caused by environmental obstetric complications can lead to development
of schizophrenia even in the absence of hereditary factors. The effect
of these factors is reflected in cortical development and, perhaps, in
altered activity at dopaminergic synapses.

The Mesolimbic Dopamine Pathway: Positive Symptoms LO 17.5 Explain the
role of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway in the positive symptoms of
schizophrenia. Pharmacological evidence suggests that the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia are caused by abnormalities in DA neurons. The
dopamine hypothesis suggests that the positive symptoms of schizophrenia
are caused by overactivity of DA synapses. We will explore some of this
evidence in the following sections. EFFECTS OF DOPAMINE AGONISTS AND
ANTAGONISTS Around the middle of the twentieth century,

a French drug company developed a compound called chlorpromazine, which
seemed to reduce shock and anxiety following surgery (Snyder, 1974).
Chlorpromazine was tried on patients with a variety of mental disorders:
mania, depression, anxiety, neuroses, and schizophrenia (Delay &
Deniker, 1952a, 1952b). The drug was not very effective in treating
neuroses or affective psychoses, but it had dramatic effects on
schizophrenia.

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 559

559

The discovery of the antipsychotic effects of chlorpromazine profoundly
altered the way in which physicians treated patients with schizophrenia
and made prolonged hospital stays unnecessary for many patients. The
efficacy of antipsychotic drugs has been established in many
double-blind studies (Baldessarini, 1977). Antipsychotic drugs
eliminate, or at least diminish, positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The
beneficial effects are not just a change in the patient's attitudes; the
hallucinations and delusions go away or become less severe. Since the
discovery of chlorpromazine, many other drugs have been developed that
relieve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. These drugs were found
to have one property in common: They block D2 and D3 dopamine receptors
(Creese et al., 1976; Strange, 2008). Another category of drugs has the
opposite effect. These drugs produce positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
The drugs that can produce these symptoms have a pharmacological effect
in common: They act as dopamine agonists. These drugs include
amphetamine, cocaine, and methylphenidate (which block the reuptake of
dopamine) and l-DOPA (which stimulates the synthesis of dopamine). The
symptoms that these drugs produce can be alleviated with antipsychotic
drugs, a result that further strengthens the argument that the
antipsychotic drugs exert their therapeutic effects by blocking dopamine
receptors. How might we explain the apparent link between overactivity
of dopaminergic synapses and the positive symptoms of schizophrenia? As
we saw in Chapters 4 and 13, important systems of dopaminergic neurons
begin in two midbrain nuclei: the substantia nigra and the ventral
tegmental area. Most researchers believe that the mesolimbic pathway,
which begins in the ventral tegmental area and ends in the nucleus
accumbens and amygdala, is more likely to be involved in the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia. As we saw in Chapter 13, the activity of
dopaminergic synapses in the mesolimbic system appears to be a vital
link in the process of reinforcement. Drugs that act as agonists at
these synapses (such as cocaine and amphetamine) strongly reinforce
behavior; if taken in large doses, they also produce the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia. Perhaps the two effects of the drugs are
related. If reinforcement mechanisms were activated at inappropriate
times, then inappropriate behaviors---including delusional
thoughts---might be reinforced. At one time or another, all of us have
had some irrational thoughts, which we normally brush aside and forget.
But if neural mechanisms of reinforcement became active while these
thoughts were occurring, we would tend to take them more seriously. In
time, delusions might develop. Fibiger (1991) suggested that paranoid
delusions may be caused by increased activity of the dopaminergic input
to the amygdala. Kapur (2003) further suggested that increased
dopaminergic activity could enhance the salience and motivational
aspects

12/11/2021 10:36

560 Chapter 17 of stimuli (including stimuli such as hallucinations),
prior to the full development of schizophrenia symptoms. As we saw in
Chapter 11, the amygdala is involved with conditioned emotional
responses elicited by aversive stimuli. The amygdala receives a strong
projection from the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, so Fibiger's
suggestion is certainly plausible. In support of this idea, Pinkham and
colleagues (2011) reported that people with schizophrenia who
experienced paranoia were more likely to misidentify a neutral facial
expression as one showing anger. People with schizophrenia who were not
exhibiting paranoid symptoms identified neutral facial expressions as
the control participants did. ABNORMALITIES IN DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION

What evidence suggests that dopaminergic activity in the brains of
people with schizophrenia is atypical? Studies have found evidence that
dopaminergic neurons in the brain of a person diagnosed with
schizophrenia may indeed release more dopamine (Breier et al., 1997;
Laruelle et al., 1996). A functional-imaging study by Laruelle and
colleagues measured the release of dopamine caused by an intravenous
injection of amphetamine. As we saw in Chapter 4, amphetamine stimulates
the release of dopamine, apparently by causing the dopamine transporters
that are present in the terminal buttons to run backward, pumping
dopamine out rather than retrieving it after it has been released. This
effect inhibits the reuptake of dopamine as well. Laruelle and
colleagues found that the amphetamine

caused the release of more dopamine in the striatum of patients with
schizophrenia than in control participants. They also found that
patients with greater amounts of dopamine release showed greater
increases in positive symptoms. (See Figure 17.9.) Another
possibility---that the brains of patients with schizophrenia contain a
greater number of dopamine receptors---received much attention for
several years. Because the earliest antipsychotic drugs appeared to work
by blocking D2 receptors, the earliest studies looked for increases in
the numbers of these receptors in the brains of people with
schizophrenia. Researchers have performed two types of analyses:
postmortem measurements in the brains of people with schizophrenia and
PET scans after treatment with radioactive ligands for dopamine
receptors. Reviews of these studies (Kestler et al., 2001; Stone et al.,
2007) concluded that there might be modest increases in the numbers of
D2 receptors in the brains of people with schizophrenia but that it
seems unlikely that these increases are the primary cause of the
disorder. CONSEQUENCES OF LONG-TERM DRUG TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA The
discovery of drugs that re-

duce or eliminate the symptoms of schizophrenia has had a revolutionary
effect on the treatment of this disorder. But for many years, all the
drugs commonly used to treat schizophrenia caused serious side effects.
Because these drugs reduce dopamine transmission, the side effects they
produce are very similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's

disease. Recall from Chapter 16 that symptoms of Parkinson's disease are
the result of the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.
By blocking dopamine transmission, the early antipsychotics all produced
at least some symptoms resembling those of Parkinson's disease: slowness
in movement, lack of facial expression, and general weakness. For most
patients these symptoms were temporary. Unfortunately, a more serious
side effect occurred in approximately one-third of all patients who took
the "classic" antipsychotic drugs for an extended period. As a result of
taking these drugs, many people developed a neurological disorder called
tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia appears to be the opposite of
Parkinson's disease. Whereas patients with Parkinson's disease have
difficulty moving, patients with tardive dyskinesia are unable to stop
moving. Indeed, dyskinesia commonly occurs when patients with
Parkinson's disease receive too much l-DOPA. The accepted explanation
for tardive dyskinesia has been a phenomenon known as
supersensitivity---a compensatory mechanism in which some types of
receptors become more sensitive if they are inhibited for a period of
time by a drug that blocks them. Presumably, when D2 receptors in the
caudate nucleus and putamen are chronically blocked by an antipsychotic
drug, they become supersensitive, which in some cases overcompensates
for the effects of the drug, causing the neurological symptoms to occur.

The Mesocortical Dopamine Pathway: Negative and Cognitive Symptoms LO
17.6 Explain the role of the cortex in the negative and cognitive
symptoms of schizophrenia. Fortunately, researchers have discovered
medications that treat the symptoms of schizophrenia without producing
the neurological side effects of the original antipsychotic drugs, and
it appears that tardive dyskinesia can largely be avoided with newer
drug treatments. At least one of these atypical antipsychotics,
clozapine, seems to reduce the positive, negative, and cognitive
symptoms. Clozapine, the first of the atypical antipsychotic
medications, has been joined by several others, including risperidone,
olanzapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole. To understand how these drugs
work, we first need to know more about the results of research on the
neuropathology of schizophrenia, which brings us to the next section. So
far, we have been discussing the physiology of the positive symptoms of
schizophrenia---principally, hallucinations, delusions, and disordered
thoughts. These symptoms could very well be related to one of the known
functions of dopaminergic neurons:

HYPOFRONTALITY

reinforcement. But the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia
are different. Whereas the positive symptoms are unique to schizophrenia
(and to amphetamine or cocaine psychosis), the negative and cognitive
symptoms are similar to those produced by brain damage caused by several
different means. As you have read, many pieces of evidence suggest that
these symptoms of schizophrenia are a result of brain abnormalities,
especially in the prefrontal cortex, the target of the mesocortical
pathway. Weinberger (1988) first suggested that the negative symptoms of
schizophrenia are caused primarily by hypofrontality, decreased activity
of the frontal lobes---in particular, of the dlPFC. Many studies have
shown that individuals with schizophrenia do poorly on
neuropsychological tests that are sensitive to prefrontal damage.
Hypofrontality in the dlPFC that is responsible for negative symptoms
may also be related to hyperactivity in the mesolimbic pathways that is
responsible for positive symptoms. Typically, the dlPFC exerts
inhibitory control over the mesolimbic pathways. In hypofrontality,
control over the mesolimbic pathway is disinhibited, contributing to
increased activity (and positive symptoms) arising from this region.
What might produce the hypofrontality that so many studies have
observed? As we saw in the discussion of the role of dopamine in
positive symptoms of schizophrenia, dopamine agonists such as cocaine
and amphetamine can cause positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Two other
drugs, PCP (phencyclidine, also known as "angel dust") and ketamine
("Special K"), can cause positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of
schizophrenia (Adler et al., 1999; Avila et al., 2002; Lahti et al.,
2001). Because PCP and ketamine elicit the full range of the symptoms of
schizophrenia, many researchers believe that studying the physiological
and behavioral effects of these drugs will help to solve the puzzle of
schizophrenia. The negative and cognitive symptoms produced by ketamine
and PCP are apparently caused by a decrease in the metabolic activity of
the frontal lobes. Jentsch and colleagues (1997) administered PCP to
monkeys twice a day for 2 weeks. Then, 1 week later, they tested the
animals on a task that involved reaching around a barrier for a piece of
food, which is performed poorly by monkeys with lesions of the
prefrontal cortex. Monkeys in the control group performed well, but
those that had been treated with PCP showed a severe deficit. (See
Figure 17.10.) Impaired glutamate activity may be involved in the
development of schizophrenia, particularly the negative and cognitive
symptoms. Support for the glutamate hypothesis initially came from
studies that reported reduced concentrations of glutamate in the CSF of
patients with schizophrenia (Kim et al., 1980) and the observation that
chronic, low doses of glutamate

We mentioned earlier that a mutation of the DISC1 gene is a known
genetic cause of schizophrenia. Niwa and colleagues (2010) infused a
small interfering RNA (siRNA) that targeted the DISC1 gene into
progenitor cells of the ventricular zone of fetal mice. (You will recall
from Chapter 15 that these progenitor cells give rise to the brain's
neurons.) The procedure suppressed DISC1 expression in pyramidal neurons
of the prefrontal cortex during the last week of fetal development. At
first, these neurons appeared normal, but at around the time of puberty,
abnormalities were seen in the physiological characteristics of
pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and in the structure of their
dendritic spines. Abnormalities also began appearing in the mesocortical
dopaminergic system that projects to the prefrontal cortex, which
resulted in a lower level of dopamine in this region. While these
changes were occurring, behavioral abnormalities resembling those of
schizophrenia began to emerge. These findings suggest that abnormalities
in the pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex constitute the primary
cause of the process that leads to schizophrenia. (See Figure 17.11.)
The findings of another study support a different hypothesis---that
abnormalities in the striatal dopaminergic system may constitute the
primary cause of the process that leads to schizophrenia. Lewis and
colleagues (2005) reviewed evidence that the hypofrontality seen in
people with schizophrenia appears to be a result of deficits in
inhibitory GABAergic transmission in the dlPFC that disrupts normal
electrical rhythms generated in this region. Li and colleagues (2011)
used a genetically modified viral vector to insert genes in the striatum
of mice (including both the dorsal striatum and the nucleus accumbens)
that increased the production of D2 dopamine receptors there. As in the
study by Niwa and colleagues, this procedure caused the development of
behavioral deficits characteristic of schizophrenia, including abnormal
activity of the dlPFC, caused by a deficit in inhibitory GABAergic
transmission in this region. (See Figure 17.12.) DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES

antagonist drugs, such as PCP and ketamine, produced negative and
cognitive symptoms in healthy individuals (Coyle, 2006). These findings
suggested that decreased glutamate activity may be involved in negative
and cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. As you might recall from
Chapter 4, PCP is an indirect antagonist of glutamate NMDA-receptors.
(So is ketamine.) By inhibiting the activity of NMDA receptors, PCP
suppresses the activity of several regions of the brain---most notably,
the dlPFC. These drugs also decrease the level of dopamine utilization
in this region (Elsworth et al., 2008), possibly as a result of the
inhibitory effect on NMDA receptors. The hypoactivity of NMDA and
dopamine receptors appears to play an important role in the production
of negative and cognitive symptoms: Suppression of these receptors
causes hypofrontality, which appears to be the primary cause of these
two categories of symptoms. We saw that the atypical antipsychotic drug
clozapine alleviates the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of
schizophrenia. It also reduces the psychotic symptoms that are triggered
in humans by ketamine (Malhotra et al., 1997). (Because PCP has toxic
effects, it is not normally used in studies with humans.) In a study
with monkeys, Youngren and colleagues (1999) found that injection of
clozapine, which causes a decrease in the release of dopamine by the
mesolimbic system, which apparently reduces the positive symptoms, also
causes an increase in the release of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex,
which apparently reduces the negative and cognitive symptoms. There is
one more interesting aspect of PCP and ketamine that might have some
relevance to the causes of schizophrenia. As we saw, ketamine and PCP
have similar effects. Ketamine is used as an anesthetic for children

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 562

and animals. It is not often used as an anesthetic in adult humans
because it produces episodes of psychosis when the person awakens after
the surgery. Ketamine does not have this effect in prepubertal children,
and administration of PCP does not damage the brains of rats until the
animals reach puberty (Marshall & Longnecker, 1990; Stone et al., 2007).
No one knows why ketamine (and probably PCP) produces psychotic behavior
only in adults; perhaps the explanation is related to the fact that the
symptoms of schizophrenia also emerge after puberty. (Whatever
developmental changes occur after puberty that make the brain
susceptible to the psychotic effects of NMDA antagonists may also be
related to the emergence of symptoms of schizophrenia at this time.)

The research findings presented in this section explain why the
"classic" antipsychotic drugs fail to reduce negative and cognitive
symptoms: One of the causes of these symptoms is decreased activation of
dopamine receptors in the prefrontal cortex, and drugs that block
dopamine receptors would, if anything, make these symptoms worse. What
is different about the newer atypical antipsychotic drugs? The atypical
antipsychotic drugs seem to do the impossible: They increase
dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex and reduce it in the
mesolimbic system. Let's examine the action of an atypical antipsychotic
drug, aripiprazole (Lieberman, 2004; Winans, 2003). Aripiprazole acts as
a partial agonist at dopamine receptors. A partial agonist is a drug
that has a very high affinity for a particular receptor but activates
that receptor less than the normal ligand does. This means that in a
patient with schizophrenia, aripiprazole serves as an antagonist in the
mesolimbic system, where too much dopamine is present, but serves as an
agonist in regions such as the prefrontal cortex, where too little
dopamine is present. Hence, this action appears

ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 563

to account for the ability of aripiprazole to reduce all three
categories of schizophrenic symptoms. (See Figure 17.13.) New treatment
strategies have also been proposed for symptoms of schizophrenia. Given
the wide variety of genetic and environmental factors involved in this
disorder, there may be many possible treatment targets yet to be
studied. Growing interest in the role of the endocannabinoid system in
schizophrenia has prompted researchers to study the antipsychotic
effects of cannabinoid agonists like cannabidiol (McGuire et al., 2017),
anti-inflammatory drugs (Khandaker et al., 2015), or supplementing with
dietary substances like choline that may be deficient prenatally and
associated with later development of schizophrenia (Ross et al., 2013).
Schizophrenia is a complex and serious disorder, which has stimulated
many hypotheses and much research. Some hypotheses have not been
supported; others have not yet been adequately tested. Possibly, future
research will find that all of the current hypotheses are incorrect or
that new hypotheses will be correct.

Module Review: Schizophrenia Description LO 17.1

Provide examples of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of
schizophrenia.

Schizophrenia consists of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms,
the first involving the presence of unusual behavior (such as
hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thoughts) and the latter two
involving the absence or deficiency of normal behavior. Negative
symptoms include flattened emotional response, poverty of speech, lack
of initiative and persistence, anhedonia, and social withdrawal.
Cognitive symptoms include difficulty sustaining attention, low
psychomotor speed, and poor abstract thinking and problem solving.

Genetic Factors LO 17.2

Describe the role of genetic factors in schizophrenia.

There is an increased incidence of schizophrenia among the children of
parents with schizophrenia, although the disease does not appear to be a
simple trait produced

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 564

by a single gene. Among discordant dizygotic twins, there is an
increased incidence of schizophrenia among the children of the twin with
schizophrenia, compared to the children of the twin without
schizophrenia. Evidence indicates that not all cases are caused by
heredity, and many people who appear to carry "schizophrenia genes" do
not develop the disorder. Evidence suggests that paternal age is a
factor in schizophrenia, presumably because of the increased likelihood
of mutations in the chromosomes of cells that produce sperms. A large
variety of rare mutations or epigenetic factors may predispose people to
schizophrenia.

Environmental Factors LO 17.3

Describe the role of environmental factors in schizophrenia.

Studies of the epidemiology of schizophrenia indicate that season of
birth, viral epidemics during pregnancy, a cold climate, increased
population density, and prenatal malnutrition all contribute to the
occurrence of schizophrenia. The most sensitive period appears to occur

12/11/2021 10:36

Schizophrenia and the Affective Disorders

during the first or second trimester of pregnancy. A vitamin D
deficiency, caused by insufficient exposure to sunlight or insufficient
intake of the vitamin itself, may at least partly account for the
effects of season of birth, population density, a cold climate, and
maternal nutrition. In addition, movies of young children who were later
diagnosed with schizophrenia indicate the early presence of
abnormalities in movements and facial expressions. More evidence is
provided by the presence of an increased size of the third and lateral
ventricles and a decreased size of the hippocampus in the nonaffected
member of monozygotic twins who are discordant for schizophrenia. The
increased concordance rate of monochorionic monozygotic twins provides
further evidence that hereditary and prenatal environmental factors may
interact. Obstetric complications also increase the risk of
schizophrenia, even in people who have no family history of the
disorder.

Anomalies in Schizophrenia LO 17.4

Describe the behavioral, physical, and brain anomalies associated with
schizophrenia.

Some behavioral symptoms, such as reduced sociality and abnormal motor
movements, may precede a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Physical
abnormalities associated with schizophrenia include minor physical
anomalies. Brain anomalies associated with schizophrenia include
enlarged ventricles and reduced brain volume.

The Mesolimbic Dopamine Pathway: Positive Symptoms LO 17.5

Explain the role of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway in the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia.

The dopamine hypothesis, which was inspired by the finding that dopamine
antagonists alleviate the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and that
dopamine agonists increase or even produce them, states that the
positive symptoms of schizophrenia are caused by hyperactivity of
dopaminergic synapses in the mesolimbic system, which targets the
nucleus accumbens and amygdala. The involvement of dopamine in
reinforcement could plausibly explain the positive effects of
schizophrenia; inappropriately reinforced thoughts could persist and
become delusions. There is no evidence that an abnormally large amount
of dopamine is released under resting conditions, but PET studies
indicate that the administration of amphetamine causes a larger release
of dopamine in the brains of people with schizophrenia. Evidence
indicates

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 565

565

that the brains of people with schizophrenia may contain slightly
increased numbers of D2 dopamine receptors, but this increase does not
appear to play a primary role in the incidence of schizophrenia.

The Mesocortical Dopamine Pathway: Negative and Cognitive Symptoms LO
17.6

Explain the role of the cortex in the negative and cognitive symptoms of
schizophrenia.

The negative symptoms of schizophrenia appear to be a result of
hypofrontality (decreased activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex), which may be caused by a decreased release of dopamine in this
region. People with schizophrenia do poorly on tasks that require
activity of the prefrontal cortex, and functional-imaging studies
indicate that the prefrontal cortex is hypoactive when the patients
attempt to perform these tasks. Other research suggests abnormalities in
the neurons of the prefrontal cortex constitute the primary cause of the
process that leads to schizophrenia. The drugs PCP and ketamine mimic
both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Long-term
administration of PCP to monkeys disrupts their performance of a
reaching task that requires the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, the
disruption is related to the decrease in prefrontal dopaminergic
activity caused by the drug. Evidence suggests that hypofrontality
causes an increase in the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the
mesolimbic system, thus producing the positive symptoms of
schizophrenia. Connections between the prefrontal cortex and the ventral
tegmental area appear to be responsible for this phenomenon. Clozapine
reduces hypofrontality, increases monkeys' performance on the reaching
task, and decreases the release of dopamine in the ventral tegmental
area---and decreases both the positive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia.

Thought Question Suppose someone with schizophrenia refuses to take
antipsychotic medication or receive any other form of therapy for their
symptoms. The person is homeless and undernourished, and has little
social support or contact with others. The person is not violent, and
has never talked about committing suicide, so we cannot prove that their
behavior constitutes an immediate threat to themselves or to others.
Should they be forced to receive treatment, or does the person have the
right to refuse treatment?

Affective Disorders Affect, as a noun, refers to feelings or emotions.
While the primary symptom of schizophrenia is disordered thoughts, the
affective disorders (also called mood disorders) are characterized by
disordered feelings. This module describes the various types of
affective disorders, and discusses what we know about the causes and
treatments.

Description LO 17.7 Contrast the symptoms of major depressive disorder
and bipolar disorder. Feelings and emotions are essential parts of human
existence. They represent our evaluation of the events in our lives. In
a very real sense, feelings and emotions are what human life is all
about. For most people, their emotional state reflects what is happening
to them: Feelings are tied to events in the real world and are usually
the result of reasonable assessments of the importance these events have
for people's lives. But for some people, affect becomes divorced from
reality and they have feelings of extreme elation (mania) or despair
(depression) that are not consistent with events in their lives. For
example, depression that accompanies the loss of a loved one is a
typical response, but severe, clinical depression that becomes a way of
life--- and does not respond to the sympathetic effort of friends and
relatives---is atypical. Clinical depression has a prevalence of
approximately 3 percent in men and 7 percent in women, which makes it
the fourth leading cause of disability (Kessler et al., 2003). There are
two principal types of major affective disorders. The first type is
characterized by alternating periods of mania and depression---a
condition called bipolar disorder. This disorder affects men and women
in approximately equal numbers. Episodes of mania can last from a few
days to several months. Bipolar disorder is often severe, disabling, and
treatment-resistant (Chen et al., 2010). The episodes of depression that
follow generally last three times as long as the mania. The second type
of affective disorder is major depressive disorder (MDD), characterized
by depression without mania. This depression may be continuous and
unremitting or, more typically, may come in episodes. Mania without
periods of depression sometimes occurs, but it is rare. People diagnosed
with an affective disorder are at increased risk of death by suicide;
15.9 percent of people with MDD (Chen & Dilsaver, 1996) and 31.1 percent
of people with bipolar disorder (Tondo et al., 2016) attempt to commit
suicide. Schneider and colleagues (2001) found that the rate of death by
unnatural causes (not all suicides are diagnosed as such) for people
with affective disorders was 28.8 times higher than expected for people
of the same age in the general population. Individuals diagnosed with
affective

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 566

disorders and schizophrenia have similar increased risk of suicide
(Gallego et al., 2015; Inskip et al., 1998). People who are depressed
may have very little energy, and move or talk slowly, sometimes becoming
almost torpid. At other times, they may pace around restlessly and
aimlessly. People experiencing depression may cry a lot. They may be
unable to experience pleasure and lose their appetite for food and sex.
Their sleep may be disturbed. People with depression often have
difficulty falling asleep, and awaken early and find it difficult to get
to sleep again. People with depression often become constipated, and
secretion of saliva decreases. People who are severely depressed may
feel extremely unworthy and have strong feelings of guilt. Episodes of
mania are characterized by a sense of euphoria that does not seem to be
justified by circumstances. The diagnosis of mania is partly a matter of
degree. It is difficult to call exuberance and a zest for life
pathological, but people with mania usually exhibit nonstop speech and
motor activity, and grandiosity. People with mania may quickly change
from topic to topic and often have delusions, but lack the severe
thought disorganization that is seen in schizophrenia. People
experiencing mania may be full of their own importance and become
irritable, angry, or defensive if they are contradicted. Frequently,
they go for long periods without sleep, working furiously on projects
that are often unrealistic, or engaging in other extreme goal-directed
behaviors. Sometimes, the work of mania is truly extraordinary. For
example, George Frideric Handel wrote Messiah, one of the masterpieces
of choral music, during a period of mania.

Genetic Factors LO 17.8 Describe the role of genetic factors in
affective disorders. Evidence indicates that a tendency to develop an
affective disorder is a heritable characteristic. (See Hamet & Tremblay,
2005, for a review.) For example, Rosenthal (1971) found that close
relatives of people diagnosed with affective disorders are 10 times more
likely to develop these disorders than are people without diagnosed
relatives. Gershon and colleagues (1976) found that if one member of a
set of monozygotic twins was diagnosed with an affective disorder, the
likelihood that the other twin would be similarly diagnosed was 69
percent. In contrast, the concordance rate for dizygotic twins was only
13 percent. The heritability of affective disorders implies that they
have a biological basis. Genetic studies have found evidence that genes
on several chromosomes may be involved in affective disorders, but the
findings of most of the earlier linkage studies have not been replicated
(Hamet & Tremblay, 2005). A review of genomewide association studies
(Terracciano et al., 2010) found that the RORA gene, involved in
controlling circadian rhythms, had the strongest association with the

12/11/2021 10:36

Schizophrenia and the Affective Disorders

occurrence of major depressive disorder. Evidence suggested that another
gene, GRM8, which codes for the production of a metabotropic glutamate
receptor, may also be involved. McGrath and colleagues (2009) found that
RORB, another circadian gene, was associated with rapid cycling bipolar
disorder seen in children. As we will see later in this chapter,
disturbances in sleep and circadian rhythms may play a role in the
development of affective disorders. New candidate genes are currently
being assessed, and more remain to be evaluated for their role in
affective disorders (Amare et al., 2017; Gatt et al., 2015).

Biological Treatments LO 17.9 Identify biological treatments for
affective disorders. There are several established and experimental
biological treatments for major depressive disorder: monoamine oxidase
(MAO) inhibitors, drugs that inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine or
serotonin or interfere with NMDA receptors, electroconvulsive therapy,
transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation, vagus nerve
stimulation, bright-light therapy (phototherapy), and sleep deprivation.
Phototherapy and sleep deprivation are discussed in a later section of
this chapter. Bipolar disorder can be treated by lithium and some
anticonvulsant and antipsychotic drugs. The fact that these disorders
often respond to biological treatment provides additional evidence that
they have a physiological basis. Furthermore, the fact that lithium is
effective in treating bipolar affective disorder but not major
depressive disorder suggests that there is a fundamental biological
difference between these two illnesses (Soares & Gershon, 1998).
Clinical trials suggest that approximately two-thirds of patients with
symptoms of depression respond to antidepressant interventions; however,
approximately one-third also respond to placebo treatment. Approximately
one-third of individuals with depression do not respond to standard
antidepressant treatment at all (Stahl, 2008). This section will first
discuss several antidepressant treatments, and then explore some
additional pharmacological treatment strategies for affective disorders.
Before the 1950s there was no effective drug treatment for depression.
In the late 1940s clinicians noticed that some drugs used for treating
tuberculosis seemed to elevate the patient's mood. Researchers
subsequently found that a derivative of these drugs, iproniazid, reduced
symptoms of depression (Crane, 1957). Iproniazid inhibits the activity
of MAO. As you read in Chapter 4, MAO destroys excess monoamine
transmitter substances within terminal buttons. Iproniazid increases the
presence of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the synapse.
Other MAO inhibitors were soon discovered. Unfortunately, these drugs
can have harmful side effects, so they must be used with caution.

PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 567

567

Antidepressants Fortunately, another class of antidepressant drugs was
soon discovered that did not have these side effects: the tricyclic
antidepressants. These drugs were found to inhibit the reuptake of 5-HT
and norepinephrine by terminal buttons. By reducing reuptake, the drugs
keep the neurotransmitter in contact with the postsynaptic receptors,
prolonging the postsynaptic potentials. Thus, both the MAO inhibitors
and the tricyclic antidepressant drugs are monoaminergic agonists. More
recently, other drugs have been discovered that have similar effects.
The most important of these are the selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), whose action is described by their name. These
drugs---for example, fluoxetine (Prozac), citalopram (Celexa), and
paroxetine (Paxil)---are widely prescribed for their antidepressant
properties and for their ability to reduce the symptoms of
obsessive-compulsive disorder and social phobia (described in Chapter
18). Another class of antidepressant drugs has been developed, the
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which also do
what their name indicates. These include milnacipran, duloxetine, and
venlafaxine, with relative effects on 5-HT and noradrenergic
transporters of 1:1, 1:10, and 1:30, respectively (Stahl et al., 2005).
These ratios refer to the selectivity of the drug molecule for blocking
the serotonin:norepinephrine transporters to prevent reuptake of these
neurotransmitters. SSRIs and SNRIs have fewer nonspecific actions, and
therefore fewer side effects, than the tricyclic antidepressants and MAO
inhibitors. (See Figure 17.14.) The short-term effects of all
antidepressant drugs are to increase the amount of monoamine
neurotransmitter present in the synapse to bind to the postsynaptic and
presynaptic receptors. This occurs as soon as the drug molecules reach
the synapse, typically within minutes or hours of ingesting the drug.
However, there is a therapeutic lag, and it takes several weeks of
taking the drug for a person to experience antidepressant effects. Why
does it take so long for these drugs to be effective if they reach the
synapse almost immediately? One possible answer to this question is that
in response to several weeks of elevated levels of neurotransmitter
(particularly 5-HT), presynaptic autoreceptors desensitize and become
less sensitive to the neurotransmitter. Recall from Chapter 4 that
blocking (or in this case, desensitizing) autoreceptors results in an
increase in release of neurotransmitter from the terminals. This further
enhances the amount of neurotransmitter present in the synapse,
amplifying the message to postsynaptic receptors. The time course for
desensitization of presynaptic autoreceptors coincides with the onset of
therapeutic effect of antidepressants and is thought to be responsible
for some or all of the antidepressant action of these drugs.
Unfortunately, stimulating the postsynaptic receptors not only produces
therapeutic effects, it is also responsible for the side effects of
these drugs (Stahl, 2008).

Ketamine Although most antidepressant drugs currently in use act as
noradrenergic or serotonergic agonists by inhibiting the reuptake of
these neurotransmitters, evidence shows that an NMDA antagonist,
ketamine, may alleviate the symptoms of treatment-resistant depression.
Research with laboratory animals found that injections of ketamine
reduced behaviors similar to those seen in depressed humans, and imaging
studies with humans indicate that depressed patients showed increased
brain levels of glutamate, which suggests that interference with
glutamatergic transmission might have therapeutic effects

A new antidepressant drug, brexanolone, may hold promise for treating
symptoms of postpartum depression (depression among women following
birth of a child). The drug was approved for use in the United States in
2019 following clinical trials demonstrating antidepressant effects in
postpartum women (Kanes et al., 2017; Meltzer-Brody et al., 2018).
During the studies, the drug was administered intravenously over the
course of 60 hours; however, significant antidepressant effects were
reported by the end of the infusion (less than 3 days) and maintained
for many participants for at least 30 days. (See Figure 17.15.)
Brexanolone produces its effects very differently from the other
antidepressant drugs described in this module and acts as an indirect
agonist of the GABAA receptor (see Chapter 4).

(Yilmaz et al., 2002; Sanacora et al., 2004). Zarate and colleagues
(2006) administered injections of ketamine or placebo to patients with
treatment-resistant depression. In less than 2 hours after the ketamine
injections, 71 percent of the patients showed an improvement in their
symptoms, and 29 percent showed a remission of their symptoms. This
positive response persisted for at least 1 week. (See Figure 17.16.) As
clinical trials assessing the antidepressant effects of ketamine
continue to accumulate, most show promising results (Lee et al., 2015;
McGirr et al., 2015; Newport et al., 2015). Because it is an effective,
fast-acting treatment for severe depression, the best use of ketamine
may be to reduce the likelihood of suicide in severely depressed
patients until another, slower-acting treatment can take effect.
Unfortunately, by definition, people with treatmentresistant depression
have not responded to other treatments. You will recall from the
discussion of schizophrenia earlier in this chapter that chronic
administration of ketamine or PCP, another NMDA antagonist, produces the
symptoms of schizophrenia. Clearly, depression cannot be treated with
long-term administration of large doses of ketamine, but in a test of
safety of repeated doses of ketamine, aan het Rot and colleagues (2010)
found that administration of six infusions of a moderate dose over a
period of 12 days produced a strong antidepressant effect with only mild
or transient side effects. The beneficial effects lasted an average of
19 days, with one patient free of symptoms for over 3 months. In another
study of treatment-resistant patients with moderate to severe

depression, a single infusion of ketamine was more effective than a
control infusion in reducing depression symptoms. Approximately 40
percent of the ketamine group (and none of the control group) continued
to experience improvement in depression symptoms for up to 1 month after
the infusion (Murrough et al., 2013). Lithium The therapeutic effect of
lithium, the drug used to treat bipolar affective disorders, also occurs
very rapidly. This drug, which is administered in the form of lithium
carbonate, is most effective in treating the manic phase of a bipolar
affective disorder; once the mania is eliminated, depression usually
does not follow (Gerbino et al., 1978; Soares & Gershon, 1998). Lithium
does not suppress normal feelings of emotions, but it leaves patients
able to feel and express joy and sadness in response to events in their
lives. Similarly, it does not impair intellectual processes; many
patients have received the drug continuously for years without any
apparent ill effects (Fieve, 1979). Between 70 and 80 percent of
patients with bipolar disorder show a positive response to lithium
within 1 to 2 weeks (Price & Heninger, 1994). Lithium does have adverse
side effects. As you read in Chapter 4, the therapeutic index is the
difference between an effective dose and a toxic dose. Unfortunately,
the therapeutic index for lithium is low. Side effects include hand
tremors, weight gain, excessive urine production, and thirst. Toxic
doses produce nausea, diarrhea, motor incoordination, confusion, and
coma. Because of the low therapeutic index, patients' blood levels of
lithium must be tested regularly to be certain that they do not receive
an overdose. Unfortunately, some patients are not able to tolerate the
side effects of lithium, and even more unfortunately, lithium is by far
the most effective treatment for bipolar disorder. The specific
pharmacological effects of lithium that are responsible for its ability
to eliminate mania remain largely unknown, despite many years of
research (Alda, 2015; Phiel & Klein, 2001). Some researchers suggest
that the drug stabilizes the population of certain classes of
neurotransmitter receptors in the brain (especially serotonin
receptors), preventing wide shifts in neural sensitivity (Jope et al.,
1996). Others have shown that lithium may increase the production of
neuroprotective proteins that help to prevent cell death (Manji et al.,
2001). In fact, Moore and colleagues (2000) found that 4 weeks of
lithium treatment for bipolar disorder increased the volume of cerebral
gray matter in patients' brains, a finding that suggests that lithium
facilitates neural or glial growth. We saw earlier in this chapter that
schizophrenia can be caused by a mutation of the DISC1 gene, which is
normally involved in neurogenesis, neuronal migration, function of the
postsynaptic density in excitatory neurons, and mitochondrial function.
Research indicates that lithium has an effect on the

12/11/2021 10:36

570 Chapter 17 function of DISC1 in the postsynaptic density. Mutation
of DISC1 increases the likelihood of bipolar disorder as well as
schizophrenia, and lithium appears to compensate for the adverse effects
of this mutation (Brandon et al., 2009; Flores et al., 2011). Another
biological treatment for depression has a long history. Early in the
twentieth century, a physician named von Meduna noted that patients with
psychotic symptoms who were also subject to seizures showed improvement
immediately after each attack. He reasoned that the storm of neural
activity in the brain that constitutes a grand mal seizure somehow
improved the patients' mental condition. He developed a way to produce
seizures by administering a drug, but the procedure was dangerous to the
patient. In 1937, Ugo Cerletti, an Italian psychiatrist, developed a
less dangerous method for producing seizures (Cerletti & Bini, 1938). He
decided to attempt to use electricity to induce a seizure more safely.
Cerletti tried the procedure on dogs and found that an electrical shock
to the skull did produce a seizure and that the animals recovered with
no apparent ill effects. He then used the procedure on humans and found
it to be safer than the chemical treatment that was previously used. As
a result of Cerletti's experiments, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
became a common treatment for mental illness. Before a person receives
ECT, they are anesthetized and given a drug similar to curare, which
paralyzes the muscles, preventing injuries that might be produced by a
convulsion. The patient is attached to a respirator until the effects of
this drug wear off. Electrodes are placed on the patient's scalp (most
often to the non-speech-dominant hemisphere, to avoid damaging verbal
memories), and electrical current is used to trigger a seizure. Usually,
a patient receives three treatments per week until maximum improvement
is seen, which usually involves six to 12 treatments. The effectiveness
of ECT has been established by placebo studies, in which some patients
are anesthetized but not given shocks (Weiner & Krystal, 1994). Although
ECT was originally used for a variety of disorders, including
schizophrenia, its use is now most typically limited to treatment of
mania and depression. Antidepressant drug treatment has some adverse
side effects, including nausea, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and weight
gain. However, the major problem is that, in a substantial percentage of
patients, the drug fails to relieve their depression. Between 20 and 40
percent of patients with major depressive disorder do not show a
significant response to initial treatment with an antidepressant drug.
When patients do not respond, physicians will try different drugs. Some
of these patients do eventually respond, but others do not and exhibit
treatment-resistant depression. The reason that the list of biological
treatments presented

ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 570

in the first part of this module is so long is because no single
treatment works for all patients---and for some patients, no treatment
works at all. The existence of so many patients with treatment-resistant
depression has motivated researchers to try to develop ways to alleviate
the symptoms of patients who continue to suffer. Even when depressed
patients respond to treatment with antidepressant drugs, they do not do
so immediately; improvement in symptoms is not usually seen before 2 to
3 weeks of drug treatment. In contrast, the effects of ECT are more
rapid. A few seizures induced by ECT can effectively reduce symptoms of
severe, treatment-resistant depression within a single treatment, or
over the course of a few days. Remission of symptoms is greater than 50
percent, but relapse is a common problem (Holtzheimer & Mayberg, 2011b).
Although prolonged and excessive use of ECT causes brain damage,
resulting in long-lasting impairments in memory (Squire, 1974), the
judicious use of ECT during the interim period before antidepressant
drugs become effective has undoubtedly saved the lives of some suicidal
patients. Since its initial development, improved ECT procedures have
reduced the memory impairment associated with this treatment. How does
ECT exert its antidepressant effect? It has been known for a long time
that seizures have an anticonvulsant effect: ECT decreases brain
activity and raises the seizure threshold of the brain, making it less
likely for another seizure to occur (Nobler et al., 2001; Sackeim et
al., 1983). The changes associated with this effect may be responsible
for reducing the symptoms of depression. However, evidence concerning
the nature of the antidepressant effects of ECT is still inconclusive
(Bolwig, 2011). Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve is another
intervention that shows some promise of reducing the symptoms of
depression (Groves & Brown, 2005). Vagus nerve stimulation provides an
indirect form of brain stimulation. It is painless and does not elicit
seizures---in fact, the procedure was originally developed as a
treatment to prevent seizures in patients with seizure disorders. The
stimulation is accomplished by means of a device similar to the one used
for deep brain stimulation, except that the electrodes stimulate the
vagus nerve. Approximately 80 percent of the axons in the vagus nerve
are afferent, so electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve activates
several regions of the brain stem. The procedure appears helpful,
particularly for patients with treatment-resistant depression, and has
also been used in the treatment of other mental illness for which few or
limited treatment options exist (Cimpianu et al., 2017; Daban et al.,
2008) (See Figure 17.17.)

the release of dopamine in this region plays a critical role in
reinforcement and the response to pleasurable stimuli. In fact, animals
will press a lever that causes stimulation of this region. Because
depression is characterized by sadness, apathy, and loss of pleasure,
this region appeared to be a logical target for DBS. Bewernick and
colleagues (2010) found that DBS of the nucleus accumbens did indeed
reduce the symptoms of depression in 50 percent of treatment-resistant
patients who had previously shown no response to pharmacological
treatment, psychotherapy, or ECT.

ECT without introducing the risk of cognitive impairments or memory
loss. Several studies have suggested that TMS applied to the prefrontal
cortex reduces the symptoms of depression without producing any apparent
negative side effects (Fitzgerald, 2004; Kito et al., 2011; Padberg &
Moller, 2003). However, most studies show a response rate of less than
30 percent, and long-term relapse rates appear to be similar to those
seen with ECT (Berlim et al., 2014; Holtzheimer & Mayberg, 2011b). DEEP
BRAIN STIMULATION As we saw in Chapter 16, direct electrical stimulation
of the brain of the subthalamic nucleus provides significant relief of
the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Preliminary research also suggests
that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may also be a useful therapy for
treatment-resistant depression (Mayberg et al., 2005; Lozano et al.,
2008). Mayberg and her colleagues implanted electrodes just below the
subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (subgenual ACC), a region of the
medial prefrontal cortex. If you look at a sagittal view of the corpus
callosum, you will see that the front of this structure looks like a
bent knee---genu, in Latin. The subgenual ACC is located below the
"knee" at the front of the corpus callosum. Response to the stimulation
began quickly, and it increased with time. One month after surgery, 35
percent of the patients showed an improvement in symptoms, and 10
percent showed a complete remission. Six months after surgery, 60
percent showed improvement, and 35 percent showed remission. Deep brain
stimulation has also been directed toward the nucleus accumbens. You
will recall from Chapter 13 that

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 571

Mayberg and her colleagues (Holtzheimer & Mayberg, 2011b; Mayberg, 2009;
Mayberg et al., 2005) suggest that the frontal cortex plays a critical
role in development of depression. In particular, they hypothesize that
the subgenual ACC serves as an important focal point in a network of
brain regions that are involved in the regulation of mood and that a
decrease in the activity of this region is consistently seen after
successful antidepressant treatment. As you read, DBS in the subgenual
ACC provides relief of depressive symptoms. In fact, a reliable finding
in neuroimaging studies of depressed patients is hyperactivity of this
region, along with decreased activity in other regions of the frontal
cortex, including the dorsolateral PFC, the ventrolateral PFC, the
ventromedial PFC, and the orbitofrontal cortex (Mayberg, 2009). Studies
have shown that a variety of successful antidepressant treatments
reliably decrease the activity of the subgenual ACC and, usually,
increase the activity of other regions of the frontal cortex. Figure
17.18 shows functional-imaging scans of patients with
treatment-resistant depression taken before DBS of the subgenual ACC
(a), after 3 months of DBS (b), and after 6 months of DBS (c). Increased
activity is shown in red, and decreased activity is shown in blue. As
you can see, the subgenual ACC initially was hyperactive, but after DBS
successfully reduced symptoms of depression, this region decreased its
activity. The responses are redrawn from the scans published by Mayberg
and her colleagues (2005) using a midsagittal view of the brain. Changes
in activity that were seen in more lateral regions of the prefrontal
cortex are not shown. Figure 17.19 shows the results of
functional-imaging scans of the medial frontal region of depressed
patients who were successfully treated with a variety of treatments,
including DBS, TMS of the prefrontal cortex, ECT, vagus nerve
stimulation (VNS), and administration of an SSRI, an SNRI, and a
placebo. Successful treatment led to decreased activity in the subgenual
ACC. As in Figure 17.18, increases in activity after successful
treatment are shown in red; decreases are shown in blue.

Schizophrenia and the Affective Disorders

Why does successful treatment of the symptoms of depression appear to be
linked to decreased activity in the subgenual ACC and increased activity
in regions of the prefrontal cortex? The subgenual ACC is reciprocally
connected with several regions of the prefrontal cortex. It is also
connected with the amygdala, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens. As we
saw in Chapter 11, the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in
inhibition of the amygdala, which is involved in the acquisition and
expression of negative emotional responses such as fear. Successful
treatment of the symptoms of depression, which decreases the activity of
the subgenual ACC, may result in decreased activity of the amygdala
through direct connections between these two structures and through
indirect connections via the prefrontal cortex. The precise role of the
subgenual ACC will be elucidated only through further research.

The Monoamine Hypothesis LO 17.11 Explain the monoamine theory of
affective disorders. The fact that depression can be treated with MAO
inhibitors and drugs that inhibit the reuptake of monoamines suggested
the monoamine hypothesis: Depression is caused by insufficient activity
of monoaminergic neurons. Most investigators have focused their research
efforts on two monoamines: norepinephrine and serotonin. As we saw
earlier in this chapter, the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was
suggested by the fact that dopamine agonists can produce the symptoms of
schizophrenia and dopamine antagonists can reduce them. The monoamine
hypothesis of depression was suggested by the fact that monoamine
antagonists can produce the symptoms of depression and monoamine
agonists can reduce them. As you read in Chapter 4, the drug reserpine
blocks the activity of transporters that fill synaptic vesicles in
monoaminergic terminals with the neurotransmitter. Reserpine was
previously used to lower blood pressure by blocking the release of
norepinephrine in muscles in the walls of blood vessels, which causes
these muscles to relax. However, reserpine has a serious side effect: By
interfering with the release of serotonin and norepinephrine in the
brain, it can cause depression. In fact, in the early years of its use
as a hypotensive agent, up to 15 percent of the people who received it
became depressed (Sachar & Baron, 1979). As we can see, a monoamine
antagonist produces the symptoms of depression, and monoamine agonists
alleviate them. Delgado and colleagues (1990) developed an ingenious
approach to study the role of serotonin in depression: the tryptophan
depletion procedure. They studied depressed patients who were receiving
antidepressant medication and

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 573

573

were currently feeling well. For the first day they had the patients
follow a low-tryptophan diet. Then the next day, the patients drank an
amino acid "cocktail" that contained no tryptophan. The uptake of amino
acids through the blood--brain barrier is accomplished by amino acid
transporters. Because the patients' blood level of tryptophan was very
low and that of the other amino acids was high, very little tryptophan
found its way into the brain, and the level of tryptophan in the brain
fell drastically. Tryptophan is the precursor of 5-HT, or serotonin.
Thus, the treatment lowered the level of serotonin in the brain. Delgado
and his colleagues found that the tryptophan depletion caused most of
the patients to relapse back into depression. Then, when they began
eating a normal diet again, they recovered. These results strongly
suggest that the therapeutic effect of at least some antidepressant
drugs depends on the availability of serotonin in the brain. Subsequent
studies have confirmed these results (Neumeister et al., 2004; Young &
Leyton, 2002). Most investigators believe that the simple monoamine
hypothesis---that depression is caused by low levels of norepinephrine
or serotonin---is just that: too simple. The effects of tryptophan
depletion certainly suggest that serotonin plays a role in depression,
but depletion causes depression only in people with a personal or family
history of depression. An acute decrease in serotonergic activity in
healthy people with no family history of depression has no effect on
mood. There appear to be physiological differences in the brains of the
vulnerable people. Also, although SSRIs and SNRIs increase the level of
5-HT or norepinephrine in the brain very rapidly, the drugs do not
relieve the symptoms of depression until they have been taken for
several weeks and monoaminergic neurons have adapted to the presence of
increased neurotransmitter. This fact suggests that something other than
a simple increase in monoaminergic activity is responsible for the mood
effects of these drugs. Many investigators believe that the increased
extracellular levels of monoamines produced by administering
antidepressant drugs begin a chain of events that eventually produce
changes in the brain that are ultimately responsible for antidepressant
effect. The exact nature of this chain of events is still unknown.

Role of the 5-HT Transporter LO 17.12 Critique the role of serotonin
transporter allele polymorphisms in affective disorders. Several studies
have accumulated evidence that implicates the serotonin transporter in
depression. A portion of the gene---the promoter region---for the 5-HT
transporter (5HTT) comes in two forms, short and long. A longitudinal
study by Caspi and colleagues (2003) followed 847 people

12/11/2021 10:36

574 Chapter 17 over a period of more than 20 years, starting at 3 years
of age, and recorded the occurrence of stressful events in their lives,
including abuse during childhood, romantic disasters, bereavements,
illnesses, and job crises. The investigators found that the probability
of major depression and suicidality increased with the number of
stressful life events the people had experienced. Moreover, the increase
was much greater for people with one or two copies of the short alleles
for the 5-HTT promoter. This study showed evidence of an interaction
between environment and genetics. (See Figure 17.20.) The results of
many other studies suggested that the 5-HTT promoter played an important
role in the development of depression. For example, Rausch and
colleagues (2002) found that depressed people with two long alleles for
this gene were more likely to respond to treatment with an
antidepressant drug than were those with one or two short alleles. In
fact, people with two long alleles were even more likely to respond to
the placebo. A study by Lee and colleagues (2004) found that depressed
people with two long alleles who were treated with antidepressant drugs
had a much better long-term outcome (up to 3 years) than did people with
one or two short alleles. Neumeister and colleagues (2002) found that
tryptophan depletion was more likely to produce symptoms of depression
in people with one or two short alleles. Unfortunately, several
meta-analyses of the studies investigating a possible role of the 5-HTT
promoter in depression have concluded that, although some studies have
found positive effects, when the results of all published studies were
combined, subtle effects (Rao et al., 2019) or

no significant effects emerged (Risch et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2010;
Viviani et al., 2010). Until further research shows otherwise, it
appears that a role of the 5-HTT promoter in depression is unclear.

Role of Neurogenesis LO 17.13 Describe the role of neurogenesis in
affective disorders and their treatment. As we saw in Chapter 3 and
Chapter 13, neurogenesis can take place in the dentate gyrus---a region
of the hippocampal formation---in the adult brain. Several studies with
laboratory animals have shown that stressful experiences that produce
the symptoms of depression suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, and the
administration of antidepressant treatments, including MAO inhibitors,
tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, ECT, and lithium, increases
neurogenesis. In addition, the delay in the action of antidepressant
treatments is about the same length as the time it takes for newborn
neurons to mature. Moreover, if neurogenesis is suppressed by a
low-level dose of X-radiation, antidepressant drugs lose their
effectiveness. (See Samuels & Hen, 2011, for a review.) There is
currently no way to directly measure the rate of neurogenesis in the
living human brain. So far, all the evidence about human neurogenesis
has been by extrapolation from studies with laboratory animals. However,
a study by Pereira and colleagues (2007) used an MRI procedure that
permitted them to estimate the blood volume of particular regions of the
hippocampal formation in both mice and humans. They found that exercise

of several stages. The sleep of people with depression tends to be
shallow; slow-wave sleep is reduced, and stage 1 sleep is increased.
Sleep is fragmented; people tend to awaken frequently, especially toward
the morning. In addition, REM sleep occurs earlier, the first half of
the night contains a higher proportion of REM periods, and REM sleep
contains an increased number of rapid eye movements (Kupfer, 1976; Vogel
et al., 1980). (See Figure 17.22.) Evidence also suggests that up to 90
percent of people who experience an episode of depression report changes
in their patterns of sleep and usually have difficulty initiating and
maintaining a good night's sleep (Wulff et al., 2010). In addition,
persistent insomnia in a person with a history of depressive episodes
increases the risk of relapsing into another one, and sleep disruption
experienced by new mothers increases the risk of postpartum depression
(Posmontier, 2008). REM SLEEP DEPRIVATION One effective antidepressant

(running wheels for the mice, an aerobic exercise regimen for humans)
increased the blood volume of the dentate gyrus---the region where
neurogenesis takes place---in both species. Histological procedures
verified that increased neurogenesis in the mouse brain correlated with
the increased blood volume, which strongly supports the conclusion that
the exercise induces neurogenesis in the human brain, as well. (See
Figure 17.21.) In clinical trials, aerobic exercise yields significant
antidepressant effects among people experiencing depression (Morres et
al., 2018; Schuch et al., 2016). Researchers have also become interested
in the complex relationships among increased glucocorticoids, markers of
inflammation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of individuals
experiencing depression. Some researchers have hypothesized that
elevated levels of cortisol (a glucocorticoid) or cytokines (a marker of
inflammation released by the immune system) may be responsible for
damage to the hippocampus or for suppressing neurogenesis in depression
(Song & Wang, 2011; Zunszain et al., 2011). As researchers continue to
test these hypotheses, the results of their studies may lead to an
expanded understanding of the role of the hippocampus in depression.

treatment is sleep deprivation, either total or selective. Selective
deprivation of REM sleep, accomplished by monitoring people's EEG and
awakening them whenever they show signs of REM sleep, alleviates
depression (Vogel et al., 1990; Vogel et al., 1975). The therapeutic
effect, like that of the antidepressant medications, occurs slowly, over
the course of several weeks. Some patients show long-term improvement
even after the deprivation is discontinued; making it a practical as
well as an effective treatment. In addition, regardless of their
specific pharmacological effects, other treatments for depression
suppress REM sleep, delaying its onset and

Scherschlicht et al., 1982; Thase, 2000; Vogel et al., 1990). These
facts suggest that REM sleep and mood might somehow be causally related.
These results suggest that an important effect of successful
antidepressant treatment may be to suppress REM sleep, and the changes
in mood may be a result of this suppression. However, at least one
antidepressant drug has been shown in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
study not to suppress REM sleep (Mayers & Baldwin, 2005). It is unlikely
that suppression of REM sleep is the only way in which antidepressant
drugs work. Another form of selective sleep deprivation, slow-wave sleep
deprivation (SWS deprivation) effectively reduces depressive symptoms in
some patients. A trial study by Landsness and colleagues (2011) had
people with major depressive disorder sleep in a laboratory equipped
with EEG monitoring equipment. Whenever slow waves appeared in a
person's EEG, the investigators presented sounds that suppressed the
slow waves without waking the person up. The results were promising:
Self-rated symptoms of depression decreased in most of the patients.
(See Figure 17.23.) Although the investigators did not directly
manipulate REM sleep, SWS deprivation also affected the percentage of
total sleep time spent in REM sleep. In fact, decreases in REM

Research, 45, 1019--1026.

TOTAL SLEEP DEPRIVATION Total sleep deprivation also

has an antidepressant effect. Unlike specific deprivation of REM sleep,
which takes several weeks to reduce depression, total sleep deprivation
produces immediate effects (Wu & Bunney, 1990). Typically, the
depression is lifted by the sleep deprivation but returns the next day,
after a normal night's sleep. In fact, ketamine treatment and total
sleep deprivation are the only treatments that produce an immediate (but
transient) effect. Wu and Bunney suggest that, during sleep, the brain
produces a chemical that has a depressogenic effect in susceptible
people. During waking, this substance is gradually metabolized and hence
inactivated. Some of the evidence for this hypothesis is presented in
Figure 17.24. The data are taken from eight different studies cited by
Wu and Bunney (1990) and show self-ratings of depression of people who
did and did not respond to sleep deprivation. Total sleep deprivation
improves the mood of patients with major depression approximately
two-thirds of the time. Why do only some people benefit from sleep
deprivation? This question has not yet been answered, but several
studies have shown that it is possible to predict who will respond and
who will not (Haug, 1992; Riemann et al., 1991; Wirz-Justice & Van den
Hoofdakker, 1999). In general, patients with depression whose mood
remains stable will

were actually produced by suppression of REM sleep. However, REM sleep
deprivation usually produces a therapeutic effect over the course of
several weeks, and the benefits in this study occurred after just one
night of SWS deprivation. This promising approach appears to deserve
further study.

Schizophrenia and the Affective Disorders

ROLE OF ZEITGEBERS Yet another phenomenon relates depression to sleep
and waking---or, more specifically, to the mechanisms that are
responsible for circadian rhythms. Some people become depressed during
the winter season, when days are short and nights are long (Rosenthal et
al., 1984). The symptoms of this form of depression, called seasonal
affective disorder (SAD), are somewhat different from those of major
depression; both forms include lethargy and sleep disturbances, but
seasonal depression includes a craving for carbohydrates and an
accompanying weight gain. (As you will recall, many people with major
depression tend to lose their appetite.) SAD, like MDD and bipolar
disorder, appears to have a genetic basis. In a study of 6,439 adult
twins, Madden and colleagues (1996) found that SAD ran in families, and
they estimated that at least 29 percent of the variance in seasonal mood
disorders could be attributed to genetic factors. One of the genetic
factors that contribute to susceptibility to SAD is a particular allele
of the gene responsible for the production of melanopsin, the retinal
photopigment that detects the presence of light and synchronizes
circadian rhythms (Wulff et al., 2010). González and Aston-Jones (2006,
2008) found that rats that spent 6 weeks in total darkness exhibited
behavioral symptoms of depression in an animal model of this disorder.
In addition, the investigators found increased apoptosis (programmed
cell death) in noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus,
dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area, and serotonergic
neurons of the

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 577

raphe nuclei. In addition, they observed fewer NE, DA, and 5-HT
terminals in the prefrontal cortex. (You will recall from Chapter 9 that
these monoaminergic regions play an important role in sleep and waking.)
Administration of desipramine, an antidepressant drug, decreased both
the behavioral and anatomical signs of depression. Perhaps, the authors
note, the anatomical changes they observed are responsible for the
depressant effects of prolonged exposure to limited amounts of light.
(See Figure 17.25.) SAD can be treated by phototherapy: exposing people
to bright light for several hours a day (Rosenthal et al., 1984; Stinson
& Thompson, 1990). As you will recall, circadian rhythms of sleep and
wakefulness are controlled by the activity of the suprachiasmatic
nucleus of the hypothalamus. Light serves as a zeitgeber; that is, it
synchronizes the activity of the biological clock to the day/night
cycle. One possibility is that people with SAD require a
stronger-than-normal zeitgeber to reset their biological clock.
According to Lewy and colleagues (2006), SAD is caused by a mismatch
between cycles of sleep and cycles of melatonin secretion. Normally,
secretion of melatonin begins in the evening, before people go to sleep.
In fact, the time between the onset of melatonin secretion and the
midpoint of sleep (halfway between falling asleep and waking up in the
morning) is approximately 6 hours. People with SAD most often show a
phase delay between cycles of melatonin and sleep; that is, the time
interval between the onset of melatonin secretion and the midpoint of
sleep is more than 6 hours. Exposure

probably not benefit from sleep deprivation, whereas those whose mood
fluctuates probably will. The patients who are most likely to respond
are those who feel depressed in the morning but then gradually feel
better as the day progresses. In these people, sleep deprivation appears
to prevent the depressogenic effects of sleep from taking place and
simply permits the trend to continue. If you examine Figure 17.24, you
can see that the responders were already feeling better by the end of
the day. This improvement continued through the sleepless night and
during the following day. The next night they were permitted to sleep
normally, and their depression was back the following morning. As Wu and
Bunney note, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that sleep
produces a substance with a depressogenic effect. Although total sleep
deprivation is not a practical method for treating depression (it is
impossible to keep people awake indefinitely), several studies suggest
that partial sleep deprivation can hasten the beneficial effects of
antidepressant drugs. For example, Leibenluft and colleagues (1993)
found that depriving treatment-resistant patients of sleep either early
or late in the night facilitated treatment with antidepressant
medication. Some investigators have found that intermittent total sleep
deprivation (for example, twice a week for 4 weeks) can have beneficial
results (Papadimitriou et al., 1993).

578 Chapter 17 to bright light in the morning or administration of
melatonin late in the afternoon (or, preferably, both treatments)
advances the circadian cycle controlled by the biological clock in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus. (These cycles were discussed in Chapter 9.)
Those people with SAD who show a phase advance in their cycles can best
be treated with exposure to bright light in the evening and
administration of melatonin in the morning. (See Figure 17.26.) By the
way, phototherapy has been found to help patients with major depressive
disorder, especially in conjunction with administration of
antidepressant drugs (Terman, 2007). Phototherapy is a safe and
effective treatment for SAD. According to a study by Wirz-Justice and
colleagues (1996), a special apparatus is not even needed. The authors
found that a 1-hour walk outside each morning reduced the symptoms of
SAD. They noted that even on an overcast winter day, the early morning
sky provides considerably more illumination than normal indoor
artificial lighting, so a walk outside increases a person's exposure to
light. The exercise helps, too. Many studies (for example, Dunn et al.,
2005) have shown that a program of exercise improves the symptoms of
depression.

secretion begins in the evening, approximately 6 hours before the

secreting melatonin earlier, showing a phase delay between cycles of

advance, with melatonin secretion beginning at a later time. Source:

Contrast the symptoms of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.

The symptoms of major depressive disorder include chronic or episodic
depression without mania. People with major depressive disorder feel
sad, unworthy, and guilty and have an increased incidence of suicide.
The symptoms of bipolar disorder include alternating periods of mania
and depression. Symptoms of mania include feeling euphoric, exhibiting
increased speech and motor activity, and grandiosity.

Genetic Factors LO 17.8

Describe the role of genetic factors in affective disorders.

Heritability studies suggest that genetic anomalies are at least partly
responsible for these disorders. Close relatives of people with
affective disorders are 10 times more likely to develop these disorders
than are people without diagnosed relatives. The concordance rate for
affective disorders is 69 percent in monozygotic twins, versus 13
percent in dizygotic twins.

M17_CARL0287_13_GE_C17.indd 578

Identify biological treatments for affective disorders.

Biological treatments for affective disorders include monoamine oxidase
(MAO) inhibitors, drugs that inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine or
serotonin, enhance GABA activity, or interfere with NMDA receptors;
electroconvulsive therapy; transcranial magnetic stimulation; deep brain
stimulation; vagus nerve stimulation; phototherapy; sleep deprivation;
and lithium.

Role of the Frontal Cortex LO 17.10 Describe the role of the frontal
cortex in depression. A consistent finding in neuroimaging studies of
depressed patients is hyperactivity of subgenual ACC along with
decreased activity in other regions of the frontal cortex, including the
dorsolateral PFC, the ventrolateral PFC, the ventromedial PFC, and the
orbitofrontal cortex. A variety of successful antidepressant treatments
reliably decrease the activity of the subgenual ACC and, usually,
increase the activity of other regions of the frontal cortex.

disorders. The therapeutic effect of noradrenergic and serotonergic
agonists and the depressant effect of reserpine, a monoaminergic
antagonist, suggested the monoamine hypothesis of depression: that
depression is caused by insufficient activity of monoaminergic neurons.
Depletion of tryptophan (the precursor of 5-HT) in the brain causes a
recurrence of depressive symptoms in depressed patients who are in
remission, which lends further support to the conclusion that 5-HT plays
a role in mood. However, although SSRIs have an immediate effect on
serotonergic transmission in the brain, they do not relieve the symptoms
of depression for several weeks, posing a challenge to the monoamine
hypothesis.

Role of the 5-HT Transporter LO 17.12 Critique the role of serotonin
transporter allele polymorphisms in affective disorders. Stressful life
experiences increase the likelihood of depression in people with one or
two short alleles of the 5-HT transporter promoter gene, and a better
response to antidepressant treatment is seen in depressed people with
two long alleles. However, the results of existing meta-analyses do not
support a significant role for the 5-HT transporter promoter in
depression.

affective disorders and their treatment. Stress and depression are
associated with reduced hippocampal neurogenesis. Antidepressant
treatment increases hippocampal neurogenesis. The time period of onset
of therapeutic effect coincides with the time period of increased
neurogenesis.

Role of Circadian Rhythms LO 17.14 Summarize the role of circadian
rhythms in affective disorders. Sleep disturbances are characteristic of
affective disorders. In fact, total sleep deprivation rapidly (but
temporarily) reduces depression in many people, and selective
deprivation of REM sleep does so slowly (but more lastingly). In
addition, almost all effective antidepressant treatments suppress REM
sleep. A specific form of depression, seasonal affective disorder, can
be treated by exposure to bright light.

Thought Question In this chapter, you read about a variety of biological
factors related to affective disorders. Many experts also believe that
environmental factors such as trauma or changes in sleep, day length, or
hormones also play a role in these disorders. Choose one affective
disorder and describe an example of how biological and environmental
factors might interact as risk or protective factors.

Graciela is a busy college student, 6 weeks away from graduation. She is
involved in intramural sports and works as an undergraduate researcher
in a neuroscience lab on campus. Her hockey team is playing in the
championship next week, and she is completing a study of serotonin cells
that her advisor believes could be published in a prestigious journal.
Graciela's week is filled with classes, time in the lab, hockey
practices, and homework. She has also applied to six graduate programs
and four full-time laboratory technician positions in hopes of beginning
a career after graduation. She has three exams next week and has been
staying up very late to study, but is having trouble remembering facts
that used to come easily to her. On top of everything else, she has had
a sinus infection for nearly a week, which is further draining her
energy. Hurrying across campus so she wouldn't be late to class one day,
she suddenly felt herself filled with an intense fear. Her mind began
racing. Did she complete all of her assignments?

Graciela's experience illustrates that both physiological symptoms, such
as shortness of breath and increased heart rate, and emotional symptoms,
such as the experience of fear, can accompany anxiety disorders such as
panic disorder. As you read this chapter, consider how elements of
Graciela's experience reveal the role of the nervous system in stress
and immune responses, and the experience of anxiety. The chapter begins
with a description of stress, a physiological reaction that many people
experience as part of their daily lives. Next, we will explore some of
the disorders that

Had she shut down the equipment in the lab? Did she send in her final
job application? She began having difficulty breathing. She was able to
take only short, shallow breaths, and her hands and arms were tingling.
She could feel her heart pounding and her body shaking. Terrified,
Graciela suddenly fell to the ground. She wondered if she were having a
heart attack. A friend saw Graciela fall, rushed to her side, and called
an ambulance. At the hospital doctors ran an EKG test to record the
activity of Graciela's heart. They also ran a number of other stress
tests. Fortunately, the tests indicated that Graciela's heart was
healthy and she had not had a heart attack. The consensus was that
Graciela experienced a panic attack, a period of symptoms that can
include shortness of breath, irregularities in heartbeat, and other
autonomic symptoms accompanied by intense fear. Recurrent panic attacks
are one of the criteria for a diagnosis of panic disorder.

can include elements of a chronic or pathological stress response:
posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, and
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Stress Aversive stimuli can harm people's health. Many harmful effects
are produced not by the stimuli themselves but by our reactions to them.
Walter Cannon, the physiologist who

24/11/21 2:13 PM

582 Chapter 18 criticized the James-Lange theory described in Chapter
11, introduced the term stress to refer to the physiological reaction
caused by the perception of aversive or threatening situations. The word
stress was borrowed from engineering, in which it refers to the action
of physical forces on mechanical structures. The word can be a noun or a
verb, and the noun can refer to situations or the individual's response
to them. When we say that someone was subjected to stress, we really
mean that someone was exposed to a situation that elicited a particular
reaction in that person: a stress response. The physiological responses
that accompany the negative emotions prepare us to threaten rivals or
fight them, or to run away from dangerous situations. Cannon introduced
the phrase fight-or-flight response to refer to the physiological
reactions that prepare us for the strenuous efforts required by fighting
or running away. Usually, once we have fought with an adversary or run
away from a dangerous situation, the threat is over, and our
physiological condition can return to normal. The fact that the
physiological responses may have adverse long-term effects on our health
is unimportant as long as the responses are brief. But sometimes, the
threatening situations are continuous rather than episodic, producing a
more or less continuous stress response. And as we will see in the
following module on posttraumatic stress disorder, sometimes threatening
situations are so severe that they trigger responses that can last for
months or years.

Physiology of the Stress Response LO 18.1 Compare the SAM system and HPA
axis in coordinating a stress response. As we saw in Chapter 11,
emotions consist of behavioral, autonomic, and endocrine responses. The
latter two components, the autonomic and endocrine responses, are the
ones that can have adverse effects on health. (The behavioral components
can, too, if, say, a person rashly gets into a fight with someone who is
much bigger and stronger.) Because threatening situations generally call
for vigorous activity, the autonomic and endocrine responses that
accompany them are catabolic and help to mobilize the body's energy
resources. The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system is
active, and the adrenal glands secrete epinephrine, norepinephrine, and
steroid stress hormones. Because the effects of sympathetic activity are
similar to those of the adrenal hormones, we will limit our discussion
to the hormonal responses. The release of catecholamine stress hormones
(epinephrine and norepinephrine) is controlled by the sympathetic
adrenal-medullary system, while release of the glucocorticoid hormones
is controlled by the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. The release of
catecholamine stress hormones is controlled by

SYMPATHETIC ADRENAL-MEDULLARY SYSTEM

M18_CARL0287_13_GE_C18.indd 582

the sympathetic adrenal-medullary system (SAM system). In response to a
stressful stimulus or environment, the hypothalamus and the sympathetic
nervous system stimulate the adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and
norepinephrine. Together, these catecholamine hormones initiate a rapid
activation of the sympathetic nervous system. (See Figure 18.1.)
Epinephrine affects glucose metabolism, causing the nutrients stored in
muscles to become available to provide energy for strenuous exercise.
Along with norepinephrine, the hormone also increases blood flow to the
muscles by increasing the output of the heart. In doing so, it increases
blood pressure, which, over the long term, contributes to cardiovascular
disease. Besides serving as a stress hormone, norepinephrine is (as you
know) secreted in the brain as a neurotransmitter. Some of the
behavioral and physiological responses produced by aversive stimuli
appear to be mediated by noradrenergic neurons (McCall et al., 2015).
For example, micro-­ dialysis studies have found that stressful
situations increase the release of norepinephrine in the hypothalamus,
frontal cortex, and lateral basal forebrain (Cenci et al., 1992; Yokoo
et al., 1990). Montero and colleagues (1990) found that destroying the
noradrenergic axons that ascend from the brain stem to the forebrain
prevented the rise in blood pressure that is normally produced by social
isolation stress. The stressinduced release of norepinephrine in the
brain is controlled by a pathway from the central nucleus of the
amygdala to the locus coeruleus, the nucleus of the brain stem that
contains norepinephrine-secreting neurons (Van Bockstaele et al., 2001).
The other stress-related hormone is cortisol, a steroid secreted

The secretion of glucocorticoids does more than help an animal react to
a stressful situation: It helps the animal to survive. If a rat's
adrenal glands are removed, the rat becomes much more susceptible to the
effects of stress. In fact, a stressful situation that a normal rat
would take in its stride might be fatal to one whose adrenal glands have
been removed. And physicians know that if an adrenalectomized person is
subjected to stressors, he or she must be given additional amounts of
glucocorticoid (Tyrell & Baxter, 1981).

Health Effects of Long-Term Stress LO 18.2 Describe the negative health
outcomes associated with chronic stress. Many studies of people who have
experienced chronic or repeated stressful situations have found evidence
of ill health. For example, survivors of concentration camps, who were
subjected to long-term stress, have had generally poorer health later in
life than other people of the same age (Cohen, 1953). A review of
research involving hundreds of thousands of people reported a
significant relationship between workrelated stress and increased risk
of heart disease and stroke (Kivimäki & Kawachi, 2015). Drivers of
subway trains that injure or kill people are more likely to experience
illnesses several months later (Theorell et al., 1992). Air traffic
controllers, especially those who work at busy airports where the danger
of collisions is greatest, show a greater incidence of high blood
pressure, which gets worse as they grow older (Cobb & Rose, 1973). (See
Figure 18.2.) They also are more likely to develop ulcers or diabetes.

Figure 18.2 Stress and Hypertension The graph shows the incidence of
hypertension in various age groups of air traffic controllers at
high-stress and low-stress airports. Source: Based on data from Cobb,
S., & Rose, R. M. (1973). Hypertension, peptic ulcer, and diabetes in
air traffic controllers. Journal of the American Medical Association,

by the adrenal cortex. Cortisol is called a glucocorticoid because it
has profound effects on glucose metabolism. In addition, glucocorticoids
help to break down protein and convert it to glucose, help to make fats
available for energy, increase blood flow, and stimulate behavioral
responsiveness, presumably by affecting the brain. They decrease the
sensitivity of the gonads to luteinizing hormone (LH), which suppresses
the secretion of the sex steroid hormones. For example, Singer and
Zumoff (1992) found that the blood level of testosterone in male
hospital residents (doctors, not patients) was severely depressed,
presumably because of the stressful work schedule they were obliged to
follow. In women, daily self-report ratings of stress were inversely
related to estradiol concentrations (Roney et al., 2015).
Glucocorticoids have other physiological effects, too, some of which are
only poorly understood. Almost every cell in the body contains
glucocorticoid receptors, which means that few of them are unaffected by
these hormones. Glucocorticoid release is controlled by the activity of
the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA axis). Glucocorticoid
secretion is controlled by neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the
hypothalamus (PVN), whose axons terminate in the median eminence, where
the hypothalamic capillaries of the portal blood supply to the anterior
pituitary gland are located. (The pituitary portal blood supply was
described in Chapter 3.) The neurons of the PVN secrete a peptide called
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the anterior
pituitary gland to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH
enters the general circulation and stimulates the adrenal cortex to
secrete glucocorticoids. (See Figure 18.1.) CRH (also called CRF, or
corticotropin-releasing factor) is also secreted within the brain, where
it serves as a neuromodulator/neurotransmitter, especially in regions of
the limbic system that are involved in emotional responses, such as the
periaqueductal gray matter, the locus coeruleus, and the central nucleus
of the amygdala. The behavioral effects produced by an injection of CRH
into the brain are similar to those produced by aversive situations.
This indicates that some elements of the stress response appear to be
produced by the release of CRH by neurons in the brain. For example,
intracerebroventricular injection of CRH decreases the amount of time a
rat spends in the center of a large open chamber, which is considered an
anxiety-like behavior (Britton et al., 1982), enhances the acquisition
of a classically conditioned fear response (Cole & Koob, 1988), and
increases the startle response elicited by a sudden loud noise (Swerdlow
et al., 1986). On the other hand, intracerebroventricular injection of a
CRH antagonist reduces the anxiety-like behavior in animal models caused
by a variety of stressful situations (Gafford et al., 2012; Heinrichs et
al., 1994; Kalin et al., 1988; Skutella et al., 1994). The effects of
CRH on stress response in the brain appear to be mediated through
feedback to the locus coeruleus (McCall et al., 2015).

A key researcher in this area, Hans Selye, suggested that most of the
harmful effects of stress were produced by the prolonged secretion of
glucocorticoids (Selye, 1976). Although the short-term effects of
glucocorticoids are essential and often beneficial, the long-term
effects of sustained glucocorticoid exposure are damaging. These effects
include increased blood pressure, damage to muscle tissue, steroid
diabetes, infertility, inhibition of growth, inhibition of the
inflammatory responses, and suppression of the immune system. High blood
pressure can lead to heart attacks and stroke. Inhibition of growth in
children who are subjected to prolonged stress prevents them from
attaining their full height. Inhibition of the inflammatory response
makes it more difficult for the body to heal itself after an injury, and
suppression of the immune system makes an individual vulnerable to
infections. Long-term administration of steroids to treat inflammatory
diseases often produces cognitive deficits and can even lead to steroid
psychosis, whose symptoms include profound distractibility, anxiety,
insomnia, depression, hallucinations, and delusions (de Kloet et al.,
2005; Lewis & Smith, 1983). A growing collection of research suggests
that impaired regulation of the HPA axis is involved in many of the
harmful effects of long-term stress (McEwen, 2006). Allostasis is a term
to describe the process of responding to stimuli and regaining and
maintaining homeostasis. Allostasis may include a change in the set
point of a system to respond to stimuli that are outside the range of
typical homeostatic functioning (McEwen & Wingfield, 2010; Sterling &
Eyer, 1988). A related concept, allostatic load refers to the cumulative
and collective wear and tear on body systems when there is too much
stress response or when the stress response is not turned off.
Allostatic load has been implicated in the negative health effects of
prolonged or exaggerated stress response in stress and anxiety
disorders. Fortunately, interventions such as physical activity and
social integration can help restore healthy homeostatic HPA axis
regulation (McEwen & Gianaros, 2010). The adverse effects of stress on
healing were demonstrated in a study by Kiecolt-Glaser and colleagues
(1995), who performed punch biopsy wounds in the participants' forearms,
a harmless procedure that is used often in medical research. The
participants were people who were providing long-term care for relatives
with Alzheimer's disease---a situation that is known to cause
stress---and control participants of the same approximate age and family
income. The investigators found that wound healing took significantly
longer in the caregivers (48.7 days versus 39.3 days). (See Figure
18.3.) A subsequent study (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2005) found that the
wounds of couples who displayed high levels of hostile behavior healed
more slowly than those of couples with more friendly interactions.
Another study found impaired wound healing among students during an exam
period, compared to summer vacation (Marucha et al., 1998).

Effects of Stress on the Brain LO 18.3 Compare the effects of long-term
glucocorticoid exposure and early nurturing experiences on the brain in
response to stress. Stress can have long-lasting effects on the brain.
This section will explore some of the research documenting brain changes
following exposure to stress, as well as the unique contributions of
early life stressors and new research on stress resilience. Sapolsky and
his colleagues have investigated one rather serious long-term effect of
stress: brain damage. As you learned in Chapter 13, the hippocampal
formation plays a crucial role in learning and memory, and evidence
suggests that one of the causes of memory loss that occurs with aging is
degeneration of this brain structure. Research with animals has shown
that long-term exposure to glucocorticoids destroys neurons located in
the CA1 field of the hippocampal formation. The hormones appear to
destroy the neurons by decreasing the entry of glucose and decreasing
the reuptake of glutamate (McEwen & Sapolsky, 1995; Sapolsky, 1992,
1995). Both of these effects make neurons more susceptible to
potentially harmful events, such as decreased blood flow, which often
occurs as a result of the aging process. The increased amounts of
extracellular glutamate permit calcium to enter through NMDA receptors.
(You will recall that the entry of excessive amounts of calcium can kill
neurons.) Perhaps, then, the stressors to which people are subjected
throughout their lives increase the likelihood of memory problems as
they grow older. In fact, Lupien and colleagues (1996) found that older
adults

24/11/21 2:13 PM

Stress and Anxiety Disorders 585

with elevated blood levels of glucocorticoids learned a maze more slowly
than did those with normal levels. Even brief exposure to stress can
have adverse effects on normal brain functioning. Diamond and his
colleagues (Diamond et al., 1999; Mesches et al., 1999) placed rats
individually in a Plexiglas box and then placed the box in a cage with a
cat for 75 minutes. Although the cat could not harm the rats, the cat's
presence (and odor) elicited a stress response. The stressed rats' blood
glucocorticoid concentration increased to approximately five times its
normal level. The investigators found that this short-term stress
affected the functioning of the animals' hippocampi. The stressed rats'
ability to learn a spatial task was impaired, and primed-burst
potentiation (a form of long-term potentiation) was impaired in
hippocampal slices taken from stressed rats. (See Figure 18.4.) A study
by Thomas and colleagues (2007) found that acute stress diminished the
long-term survival of hippocampal neurons produced by the process of
neurogenesis. Among people who experience a traumatic event and develop
posttraumatic stress disorder, reduced hippocampal activity is
associated with poorer performance on a variety of memory tasks (Joshi
et al., 2019). As we saw in Chapter 17, impaired hippocampal
neurogenesis appears to play a role in the development of depression.
Uno and colleagues (1989) found that if long-term stress is intense
enough, it can cause severe brain damage in young primates. The
investigators studied a colony of vervet monkeys housed in a primate
center in Kenya. They found that some monkeys died, apparently from
stress.

Learning The graphs show the effects of acute stress caused by exposing
a rat to the sight and smell of a cat. The stress raised the
glucocorticoid level (corticosterone, in the case of a rat), impaired
the development of primed-burst potentiation (PBP, a form of longterm
potentiation) in slices taken from these animals, and interfered with
learning of a spatial task that requires the hippocampus. Source: Based

Vervet monkeys have a hierarchical society, and monkeys near the bottom
of the hierarchy are picked on by the others and almost continuously
subjected to stress. (Ours is not the only species with social
structures that cause a stress reaction in some of its members.) The
deceased monkeys had gastric ulcers and enlarged adrenal glands, which
are signs of chronic stress. Upon examination of their brains,
researchers discovered that neurons in the CA1 field of the hippocampal
formation were completely destroyed. Severe stress appears to cause
brain damage in humans as well. Jensen and colleagues (1982) found
evidence of brain degeneration in CT scans of people who had been
subjected to torture. Stress early in life also appears to affect brain
development. Van Harmelen and colleagues (2010) found that episodes of
emotional maltreatment during childhood were associated with an average
7.2 percent reduction in the volume of the dorsomedial prefrontal
cortex. (See Figure 18.5.) You will read more about the effects of early
life stress on brain development in the next section on prenatal stress.
Several studies have confirmed that the stress of chronic pain has
adverse effects on the brain and on cognitive behavior. Apkarian and
colleagues (2004b) found that each year of severe chronic back pain
resulted in the loss of 1.3 cm3 of gray matter in the cerebral cortex,
with the greatest reductions seen in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
In addition, Apkarian and colleagues (2004a) found that chronic back
pain led to poor performance on a task that has been shown to be
affected by prefrontal lesions. These researchers have also investigated
the role of the hippocampus in chronic pain using a series of studies.
Among human volunteers, people experiencing chronic back pain and a
related pain syndrome had decreased

Prenatal stress can cause longlasting problems in learning and memory by
interfering with normal development of the hippocampus. Son and
colleagues (2006) subjected pregnant mice to stress caused by periodic
restraint in a small chamber. They found that this treatment interfered
with the establishment of hippocampal long-term potentiation in the
offspring of the stressed females, along with impairments in a spatial
learning task that requires the participation of the hippocampus. In
humans, some studies have reported that prenatal and early life stress
can reduce hippocampal volume in adulthood (Woon & Hedges, 2008).
Brunson and colleagues (2005) confirmed that stress early in life can
cause the deterioration of normal hippocampal functions later in life.
During the first week after birth the investigators placed female rats
and their newborn pups in cages with hard floors and only a small amount
of nesting material. When the animals were tested at 4--5 months of age,
their behavior was normal. However, when they were tested at 12 months
of age, the investigators observed impaired performance in the Morris
water maze and deficient development of longterm potentiation in the
hippocampus. They also found dendritic atrophy in the hippocampus, which
might have accounted for the impaired spatial learning and synaptic
plasticity. Salm and colleagues (2004) found that mild prenatal stress
can affect brain development and produce changes that last the animal's
lifetime. Once a day during the last week of gestation, they removed
pregnant rats from their cage and gave them an injection of a small
amount of sterile saline---a procedure that lasted less than 5 minutes.
This mild stress altered the development of the rat pups' amygdalae. The
investigators found that the volume of the lateral nucleus of the
amygdala, measured in adulthood,

hippocampal volume. Volunteers with osteoarthritis did not differ from
control participants in hippocampal volume, suggesting that different
types of chronic pain are related to different brain changes (Mutso et
al., 2012). In another study, the researchers report that experimentally
manipulating hippocampal neurogenesis in mice prior to an injury
affected their development of chronic pain. Using an ICV infusion of a
drug to decrease neurogenesis reduced pain-related behaviors in mice.
This result was replicated using hippocampal ablation, which also
produced reduced pain-related behavior in the mice. Finally, mutant mice
with lower levels of neurogenesis and cognitive performance also showed
reduced pain-related behavior. Mutant mice with increased hippocampal
neurogenesis displayed increased pain-related behaviors. The authors
suggest that hippocampal-associative learning is involved in chronic
pain and cognitive behavior (Apkarian et al., 2016).

was increased by approximately 30 percent in the animals that sustained
mild prenatal stress. (See Figure 18.6.) As previous experiments have
shown, prenatal stress increases fearfulness in a novel environment
(Ward et al., 2000). Presumably, the increased size of the lateral
nucleus contributes to this fearfulness. At least some of the effects of
prenatal stress on the fetus appear to be mediated by the secretion of
glucocorticoids. Barbazanges and colleagues (1996) subjected pregnant
female rats to stress and later observed the effects of this treatment
on their offspring once they grew up. They found that the prenatally
stressed rats showed a prolonged secretion of glucocorticoids when they
were subjected to restraint stress as adults. However, if the mothers'
adrenal glands had been removed so that glucocorticoid levels could not
increase during the stressful situation, their offspring reacted
normally in adulthood. (The experimenters gave the adrenalectomized
mothers controlled amounts of glucocorticoids to maintain them in good
health.) (See Figure 18.7.) RESILIENCE The news about stress and the
brain is not all bad, however. Researchers are increasingly interested
in studying resilience and plasticity in the brain. The vast majority of
individuals exposed to early life or long-term stress maintain healthy
brain and psychological functioning. Factors such as the presence of
various protective hormones (such as testosterone, neuropeptide Y, and a
hormone called DHEA that mediates negative effects of excess cortisol)
and controlled exposure to stress-related stimuli can promote resilience
in the event of stress. Researchers are actively investigating brain
changes, gene expression,

study by Fenoglio and colleagues (2006) found that some experiences that
occur during early life can reduce reactivity to stressful situations in
adulthood. Fenoglio and colleagues removed rat pups from their cage,
handled them for 15 m ­ inutes, and then returned them to their cage.
Their mother immediately began licking and grooming the pups. This

nurturing behavior activated several regions of the pups' brains,
including the central nucleus of the amygdala and the paraventricular
nucleus of the hypothalamus, the location of neurons that secrete CRH.
The result of this treatment was to reduce the production of CRH in
response to stressful stimuli, which conferred a lifelong a­ ttenuation
of the hormonal stress response.

Psychoneuroimmunology LO 18.4 Summarize the relationship between the
immune and nervous systems in response to stress. As we have seen,
long-term stress can be harmful to one's health and can even result in
brain damage. The most important cause of these effects is an elevated
level of glucocorticoids, but high blood pressure caused by epinephrine
and norepinephrine also plays a contributing role. In addition, the
stress response can impair the functions of the immune system, which
protects us from assault by viruses, microbes, fungi, and other types of
parasites. Study of the interactions between the immune system and
behavior (mediated by the nervous system) is called
psychoneuroimmunology. Some research in this field is described in the
following section. THE IMMUNE SYSTEM The immune system is one of the
most complex systems of the body. Its function is to protect us from
infection, and because infectious organisms have developed devious
tricks through the process of evolution, our immune system has evolved
devious tricks of its own. The description we provide here is
abbreviated and simplified, but it presents some of the important
elements of the system. The immune system derives from white blood cells
that develop in the bone marrow and in the thymus gland. Some of the
cells roam through the blood or lymphatic system; others reside
permanently in one place. Two types of specific immune reaction occur
when the body is invaded by foreign organisms, including bacteria,
fungi, and viruses: chemically mediated and cell-mediated reactions.
Chemically mediated immune reactions involve antibodies. Infectious
microorganisms have unique proteins on their surfaces, called antigens.
These proteins serve as the invaders' calling cards, identifying them to
the immune system. Through exposure to the microorganisms, the immune
system learns to recognize these proteins. The result of this learning
is the development of special lines of cells that produce specific
antibodies--- proteins that recognize antigens and help to kill the
invading microorganisms. One type of antibody is released into the
circulation by B-lymphocytes (or B cells), which receive their name from
the fact that they develop in bone marrow. These antibodies, called
immunoglobulins, are chains of protein.

24/11/21 2:13 PM

588 Chapter 18 Each type of immunoglobulin (there are five of them) is
identical except for one end, which contains a unique receptor. A
particular receptor binds with a particular antigen, just as a molecule
of a hormone or neurotransmitter binds with its receptor. When the
appropriate line of B-lymphocytes detects the presence of an invading
bacterium, the cells release their antibodies, which bind with the
antigens present on the surface of the invading microorganisms. The
antigens either kill the invaders directly or attract other white blood
cells, which then destroy them. (See Figure 18.9a.) The other type of
defense by the immune system, cell-mediated immune reactions, is
produced by T-lymphocytes (or T cells), which originally develop in the
thymus gland. These cells also produce antibodies, but the antibodies
remain attached to the outside of their membrane. T-lymphocytes
primarily defend the body against fungi, viruses, and multicellular
parasites. When antigens bind with their surface antibodies, the cells
either directly kill the invaders or signal other white blood cells to
come and kill them. (See Figure 18.9b.) The reactions illustrated in
Figure 18.9 are much simplified; actually, both chemically mediated and
cellmediated immune reactions involve several different types of cells.
The communication between these cells is accomplished by cytokines,
chemicals that stimulate cell division. The cytokines that are released
by certain white blood cells when an invading microorganism is detected
(principally interleukin-1 and interleukin-2) cause other white blood
cells to proliferate and direct an attack against the invader. The
primary way in which glucocorticoids suppress specific immune responses
is by

interfering with the messages conveyed by the cytokines (Sapolsky,
1992). As we will see in the next section, the stress response can
increase the likelihood of contracting infectious diseases. What is the
physiological explanation for these effects? One answer, probably the
most important one, is that stress increases the secretion of
glucocorticoids, and as we have seen, these hormones directly suppress
the activity of the immune system. Earlier in this chapter, you read
about the results of studies of chronic stress on wound healing in
caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Additional research in
this population has revealed the relationship between stress and immune
function. A direct relationship between stress and the immune system was
demonstrated by Kiecolt-Glaser and colleagues (1987). Using several
different laboratory tests, these investigators found that caregivers of
family members with Alzheimer's disease, who certainly underwent
considerable stress, showed weaker immune systems. One measure of the
quality of a person's immune response is the amount of antibodies
produced in response to a vaccination. Glaser and colleagues (2000)
found that people taking care of spouses with Alzheimer's disease
maintained lower levels of IgG antibodies after receiving a pneumococcal
bacterial vaccine. (See Figure 18.10.) Bereavement, another source of
stress, also suppresses the immune system. Schleifer and colleagues
(1983) tested the husbands of women with breast cancer and found that
their immune response was lower after their wives died. Knapp and
colleagues

(1992) even found that when healthy participants imagined themselves
       reliving unpleasant emotional experiences, the immune response
       measured in samples of their blood was decreased. Finally, people
       facing the psychological stress of undergoing surgery (Ahlers et
       al., 2008), taking an academic exam (Paik et al., 2000), or
       perhaps even experiencing Facebook-induced social stress (Campisi
       et al., 2012) display various degrees of immune suppression.
       Several studies indicate that the suppression of the immune
       response by stress is largely (but not entirely) mediated by
       glucocorticoids (Keller et al., 1983). Because the secretion of
       glucocorticoids is controlled by the brain (through its secretion
       of CRH), the brain is responsible for the suppressing effect of
       these hormones on the immune system. Neurons in the central
       nucleus of the amygdala send axons to CRH-secreting neurons in
       the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus; thus, we can
       reasonably expect that the mechanism that is responsible for
       negative emotional responses is also responsible for the stress
       response and the immunosuppression that accompanies it. Often
       when a married person dies, their spouse dies soon afterward,
       frequently of an infection. In fact, a wide variety of
       stress-producing events in a person's life can increase the
       susceptibility to illness. For example, Glaser and
       colleagues (1987) found that medical students were more likely to
       contract acute infections and to show evidence of suppression of
       the immune system during the time that final examinations were
       given. Stone and colleagues (1987) attempted to determine whether
       stressful events in people's daily lives might STRESS AND
       INFECTIOUS DISEASES

M18_CARL0287_13_GE_C18.indd 589

predispose them to upper respiratory infection. If a person is exposed
to a microorganism that might cause such a disease, the symptoms do not
occur for several days; that is, there is an incubation period between
exposure and signs of the actual illness. Thus, the authors reasoned
that if stressful events suppressed the immune system, one might expect
to see a higher likelihood of respiratory infections several days after
such stress. To test their hypothesis, they asked volunteers to keep a
daily record of desirable and undesirable events in their lives over a
12-week period. The volunteers also kept a daily record of any
discomfort or symptoms of illness. The results were as predicted: During
the 3- to 5-day period just before showing symptoms of an upper
respiratory infection, people experienced an increased number of
undesirable events and a decreased number of desirable events in their
lives. (See Figure 18.11.) Stone and colleagues (1987) suggest that the
effect is caused by decreased production of a particular immunoglobulin
that is present in the secretions of mucous membranes, including those
in the nose, mouth, throat, and lungs. This immunoglobulin, IgA, serves
as the first defense against infectious microorganisms that enter the
nose or mouth. They found that IgA is associated with mood; when a
person is unhappy or depressed, IgA levels are lower than normal. Other
studies have reported reductions in IgA associated with stress induced
by academic exams, with reductions lasting as long as 2 weeks beyond the
end of the stressor (Deinzer et al., 2000, Deinzer & Schüller,

given nasal drops containing cold viruses were much more likely to
develop colds if they reported stressful experiences during the past

Module Review: Stress Physiology the Stress Response LO 18.1

Compare the SAM system and HPA axis in coordinating a stress response.

The SAM system consists of hypothalamic and sympathetic nervous system
activation of the adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and
norepinephrine. The HPA axis consists of activation of the hypothalamus,
resulting in release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH
activates the anterior pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH). ACTH causes the adrenal glands to release glucocorticoids, which
contribute to glucose metabolism, stimulate behavioral responsiveness,
increase blood flow, and result in suppressed secretion of sex steroid
hormones. Together, activation of the SAM system and HPA axis contribute
to generating a stress response to enable an individual to respond to a
stressor.

Health Effects of Long-Term Stress LO 18.2

Describe the negative health outcomes associated with chronic stress.

Although increased levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine can raise
blood pressure, most long-term stress-related harm to health comes from
glucocorticoids. Prolonged exposure to high levels of these hormones can

M18_CARL0287_13_GE_C18.indd 590

lead to hypertension, damaged muscle tissue, infertility, inhibited
growth, inhibited inflammatory response, and suppressed immune function.
These effects can contribute to increased incidence of ulcers, diabetes,
heart attack, stroke, increased wound-healing time, and growth
inhibition in children.

Effects of Stress on the Brain LO 18.3

Compare the effects of long-term glucocorticoid exposure and early
nurturing experiences on the brain in response to stress.

Prolonged glucocorticoid exposure can damage the hippocampus, and acute
stress can impair hippocampal functioning. Exposure to stress during
prenatal or early postnatal life can affect brain development, including
impaired hippocampus function and increased size of the amygdala. Early
life exposure to nurturing behavior activated several regions of rat
pups' brains, including the central nucleus of the amygdala and the
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the location of neurons
that secrete CRH. The result of this treatment was to reduce the
production of CRH in response to stressful stimuli, which conferred a
lifelong attenuation of the hormonal stress response.

Psychoneuroimmunology LO 18.4

Summarize the relationship between the immune and nervous systems in
response to stress.

Psychoneuroimmunology is a field of study that investigates interactions
between behavior and the immune system, mediated by the nervous system.
A variety of stressful situations have been shown to increase people's
susceptibility to infectious diseases. The most important mechanism by
which stress impairs immune function is through increased blood levels
of glucocorticoids produced by the HPA axis. The neural input to the
bone marrow, lymph nodes, and thymus gland may also play a role.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder The aftermath of tragic and traumatic
events such as those that accompany wars, violence, and natural
disasters often includes psychological symptoms that persist long after
the stressful events are over. According to the DSM-5, posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) consists of the "development of characteristic
symptoms following exposure to one or more traumatic events" (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013, p. 274). The likelihood of developing
PTSD is increased if the traumatic event involved danger or violence
from other people, such as assault, rape, or wartime experiences (Yehuda
& LeDoux, 2007). Although men are exposed to traumatic events more often
than are women, women are more likely to develop PTSD after being
exposed to such events (Fullerton et al., 2001). The lifetime prevalence
of PTSD is 8.7 percent in the United States (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013; Kessler et al., 2005); however, rates of
approximately 0.5--1 percent are reported in Europe and most Asian,
African, and Latin American countries (Hinton & Lewis-Fernandez, 2011).
The onset and severity of PTSD varies across cultures, and culture may
influence the expression of PTSD symptoms (Hinton & Lewis-Fernandez,
2011).

Thought Question There is a well-known saying about elderly couples who
spend many decades together--- "they lived happily and died on the same
day." Your nephew, a Psychology student, while writing a coursework on
successful relationships in long-term marriages came across many cases,
where a spouse died not long after the beloved had passed away. Often
spouses die within a week of each other. There is even a name for this
phenomenon---broken heart syndrome. Your nephew has reached out to you
to understand if stress is the cause behind this and if the heart is
literally "broken," thus causing death. Briefly explain the key
mechanisms of the stress response and highlight the role of
glucocorticoids mediating the stress response.

Symptoms LO 18.5 List the symptoms of PTSD. The symptoms of PTSD include
recurrent dreams or recollections of the traumatic event, feelings that
the traumatic event is recurring ("flashback" episodes), and intense
psychological distress. These dreams, recollections, or flashback
episodes can lead the person to avoid thinking about the traumatic
event, which often results in diminished interest in social activities,
feelings of detachment from others, suppressed emotional feelings, and a
sense that the future is bleak and empty. Other psychological symptoms
include difficulty falling or staying asleep, irritability, outbursts of
anger, difficulty in concentrating, and heightened reactions to sudden
noises or movements. As this description indicates, people with PTSD
have impaired mental health functioning and tend to have generally poor
physical health (Zayfert et al., 2002). (See Table 18.1.)

Genetic and Environmental Factors LO 18.6 Describe the roles of genetic
and environmental factors in PTSD. The risk for PTSD depends on both

592 Chapter 18 survivors of the genocide in the Rwanda. They found that
the likelihood of developing PTSD increased with the number of traumatic
events the person had experienced. (See Figure 18.13.) They also found
that people with a particular allele of the gene responsible for the
production of COMT, the enzyme that destroys catecholamines present in
the interstitial fluid, were more likely to develop PTSD. This allele
(the Val158Met polymorphism) is associated with slower destruction of
catecholamines, which supports the conclusion from other research that
these neurotransmitters are associated with the deleterious effects of
stress. Twin studies have shown that the overlap between PTSD and panic
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder is at
least partly a result of shared genetic factors (Nugent et al., 2008).
Presumably, these genetic factors make some people more sensitive to the
effects of stress. Evidence from twin studies suggests that genetic
factors also play a role in a person's susceptibility to develop PTSD.
In fact, genetic factors influence not only the likelihood of developing
PTSD after being exposed to traumatic events but also the likelihood
that the person will be involved in such an event (Stein et al., 2002).
For example, people with a genetic predisposition toward irritability
and anger are more likely to be assaulted, and those with a
predisposition toward risky behavior are more likely to be involved in
accidents. A few studies have identified specific genes as possible risk
factors for developing PTSD. These genes include those responsible for
the production of dopamine D2 receptors, dopamine transporters, and 5-HT
transporters (Nugent et al., 2008).

Brain Changes LO 18.7 Describe changes in the brain associated with
PTSD. As we saw in the previous section, studies with laboratory animals
have shown that prolonged exposure to stress can cause brain
abnormalities, particularly in the hippocampus and amygdala. Imaging
studies have found evidence of hippocampal damage in veterans with
combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (Bremner et al., 1995;
Gurvits et al., 1996). In the study by Gurvits and colleagues, the
volume of the hippocampal formation was reduced by over 20 percent, and
the loss was proportional to the amount of combat exposure the veteran
had experienced. Lindauer and colleagues (2005) found that police
officers with PTSD had a smaller hippocampus than those who had also
been exposed to trauma but had not developed the disorder. A study by
Gilbertson and colleagues (2002) suggests that at least part of the
reduction in hippocampal volume seen in people with PTSD may predate the
exposure to stress. In other words, a smaller hippocampus may be a
predisposing factor in the acquisition of PTSD. Gilbertson and
colleagues studied 40 pairs of monozygotic twin brothers in which only
one member experienced combat during the Vietnam War. Almost half of the
men who experienced combat developed PTSD. As expected, the hippocampal
volumes of these men were smaller than those of the men who did not
develop PTSD after their combat experience. In addition, a smaller
hippocampus was associated with more severe PTSD. The interesting fact
is that the twin brothers of the PTSD patients who stayed home also
showed smallerthan-average hippocampal volumes. Given that monozygotic
twins are genetically identical and usually have very similar brains,
this finding suggests that a person with a small hippocampus is more
likely to develop PTSD after exposure to psychological trauma. (See
Figure 18.14.) What role might the hippocampus play in a person's
susceptibility to developing PTSD? One possibility is that the
hippocampus, which is involved in contextual learning, participates in
recognition of the context in which a traumatic event occurs. The
hippocampus then aids in distinguishing safe from dangerous contexts
(Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007). Consider a person who has been attacked by
another person. The sight of other people who even slightly resemble the
attacker or situations that even slightly resemble the one in which the
attack occurred might then activate the amygdala and trigger an
emotional response. However, a normally functioning hippocampus would
detect the difference between the present context and the one associated
with the attack and inhibit the activity of the amygdala. What brain
mechanisms suppress the emotional reaction and enable a person to
recover? As we saw in Chapters 11 and 17, the prefrontal cortex can
exert an

The graph shows that the size of the hippocampus of twins not exposed to
combat was similar to the size of their combat-exposed co-twins whether
or not the co-twins had PTSD. These results suggest that hippocampal
size is a genetically determined trait that predates the exposure to
combat.

cortex in response to the sight of happy or fearful faces in control

inhibitory effect on the amygdala and suppress emotional reactions. For
example, the medial prefrontal cortex plays an essential role in the
extinction of conditioned emotional responses. In fact, Milad and
colleagues (2004) found that the medial prefrontal cortex was thicker in
people who showed rapid extinction of a conditioned emotional response.
Additionally, van Harmelen and colleagues (2010) found a reduction in
the volume of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in adults who had
sustained emotional maltreatment during childhood. Several studies have
found evidence that the amygdala is responsible for emotional reactions
in people with PTSD and that the prefrontal cortex plays a role in these
reactions in people without PTSD by inhibiting the activity of the
amygdala (Rauch et al., 2006). For example, a functionalimaging study by
Shin and colleagues (2005) found that, when shown pictures of faces with
fearful expressions, people with PTSD showed greater activation of the
amygdala and smaller activation of the prefrontal cortex than did people
without PTSD. In fact, the symptoms of the people with PTSD were
positively correlated with the activation of the amygdala and negatively
correlated with the activation of the medial prefrontal cortex. (See
Figure 18.15.) A growing body of research is investigating the
relationship between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and PTSD. As described
in Chapter 16, TBI is defined as "a blow or jolt to the head that
disrupts brain function resulting in a brief loss or alternation of
consciousness" (also known as a concussion; Simmons & Matthews, 2012,
p. 599). Individuals

involved in combat, motor vehicle accidents, or sports accidents may
sustain TBI that can cause injury to axons and contribute to
neuropsychiatric symptoms. PTSD and TBI are found to co-occur in many
individuals, particularly those involved in military combat. PTSD and
TBI share several common features, such as anxiety and increased
vigilance (Kaplan et al., 2010). Overlapping brain regions in the
frontal cortex and changes in BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor)
may be involved in both TBI and PTSD (Kaplan et al., 2010; Simmons &
Matthews, 2012).

Treatment LO 18.8 Summarize treatments for PTSD. Many individuals
display resilience in the face of trauma. Although many people are
exposed to potentially traumatic events during their lives, most people
do not develop PTSD (Kessler et al., 1995). For example, Rothbaum and
Davis (2003) reported that 2 weeks after having been raped, 92 percent
of the individuals they studied showed symptoms that met the criteria
for PTSD. However, within 30 days, the symptoms in most of the study
participants had subsided. The most common treatments for PTSD are
cognitive behavioral therapy, group therapy, and antidepressants.
Research supports the effectiveness of these interventions, and provides
some clues about their effects in the brain. For example, psychotherapy
for PTSD is associated with decreased amygdala activity and increased
activity in the prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and
hippocampus (Thomaes et al., 2014). Treatment with SSRIs reduces PTSD
symptoms, improves cognitive function, and increases hippocampal volume
(Bossini et al., 2007; Vermetten et al., 2003). Using a different
therapeutic approach, Boggio and colleagues (2010) reported on the
results of a clinical trial of transcranial magnetic stimulation

They found that 10 sessions of stimulation of the left or right dlPFC
significantly reduced the symptoms of PTSD and that the beneficial
effects were still seen 3 months later. (See Figure 18.16.) Some
treatment strategies focus on preventing PTSD following a traumatic
event. In a review of preventive

pharmacological therapies, Searcy and colleagues (2012) described
studies that included administration of cortisol to patients immediately
after experiencing trauma, with the goal of providing additional
negative feedback to the HPA axis to reduce its activity. This
counterintuitive strategy appeared to be effective, and patients
receiving cortisol were subsequently less likely to meet criteria for
PTSD than were patients receiving a placebo. In the same review, Searcy
and colleagues (2012) reported on the effectiveness of blocking
catecholamine stress hormones (epinephrine or norepinephrine) and
enhancing GABAergic activity using drug administration immediately
following exposure to a traumatic event. Some researchers and clinicians
tried administering propranolol, an antagonist at the beta adrenergic
receptor, after a traumatic event (Vaiva et al., 2003) or prior to a
therapy session intended to consolidate the memory of the traumatic
event (Brunet et al., 2018) in an effort to interrupt the consolidation
or reconsolidation of traumatic memories. Although the results of these
studies suggest that this strategy may be beneficial, this approach has
been met with controversy over concerns about preventing memory
consolidation. Although the results are currently limited to a few
studies, it appears that administrating drugs to manipulate stress
response immediately after a traumatic event may be an effective
treatment strategy for PTSD (Searcy et al., 2012).

Module Review: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms LO 18.5

List the symptoms of PTSD.

Symptoms of PTSD include recurrent dreams or recollections of a
tramautic event; feelings that the traumatic event is recurring
("flashback" episodes); and indications of intense psychological
distress, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, irritability,
outbursts of anger, difficulty in concentrating, and heightened
reactions to sudden noises or movements.

Genetic and Environmental Factors LO 18.6

Describe the roles of genetic and environmental factors in PTSD.

The risk for developing PTSD depends on both genetic and environmental
factors. Environmental factors can include number of traumatic events
experienced, and presence of danger or violence from other people, such
as in assault, rape, or wartime experiences. Predisposing genetic
factors appear to involve differences in the genes for D2 receptors,
dopamine transporters, and 5-HT

M18_CARL0287_13_GE_C18.indd 594

transporters. Decreased hippocampal volume is a predisposing factor for
the development of PTSD.

Brain Changes LO 18.7

Describe changes in the brain associated with PTSD.

Reduced volume of and damage to the hippocampus are associated with
PTSD. The prefrontal cortex of people who are resistant to the
development of PTSD following severe stress appears to inhibit the
amygdala. The prefrontal cortex appears to be hypoactive in people with
PTSD. TBI and PTSD may co-occur and involve overlapping brain changes.

Treatment LO 18.8

Summarize treatments for PTSD.

Treatments for PTSD include psychotherapy and antidepressants.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
appears to reduce the symptoms of PTSD. Interventions to prevent the
development of PTSD following a traumatic event are currently being
studied.

Anxiety Disorders Anxiety disorders are characterized by extreme fear
and anxiety. With a lifetime prevalence of approximately 28 percent,
anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders. In
addition, anxiety disorders often cooccur with affective and substance
use disorders (Tye et al., 2011). This module describes four anxiety
disorders with evidence for contributing biological factors: panic
disorder, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety
disorder. Although obsessive-compulsive disorder is sometimes associated
with anxiety disorders, it has different symptoms from the other anxiety
disorders and involves different brain regions, so it is discussed
separately at the end of the chapter.

Symptoms LO 18.9 List the symptoms of anxiety disorders. Panic disorder
includes episodic attacks of acute anxiety--- periods of intense and
unremitting terror that range from a few seconds to a few hours. The
prevalence of this disorder is approximately 3--5 percent among adults
in the United States (Schumacher et al., 2011); however, rates are lower
in Asian, African, and Latin American countries (approximately 0.1--0.8
percent) (Lewis-Fernández et al., 2010). Cultural differences and
expectations are involved in the experiences of panic disorder (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013). Women are approximately twice as likely
as men to experience panic disorder, and this difference emerges in
early adolescence (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Panic
attacks include many physical symptoms, such as shortness of breath,
clammy sweat, irregularities in heartbeat, dizziness, faintness, and
feelings of unreality. The person experiencing a panic attack often
feels that they are going to die and often seeks help in a hospital
emergency room. Many people with panic disorder also experience
anticipatory anxiety---the fear that another panic attack will occur.
This anticipatory anxiety is a symptom of another anxiety disorder:
agoraphobia (agora means "open space"). The symptoms of agoraphobia
include intense fear or anxiety about leaving home, being in open
spaces, or being in enclosed spaces or in lines or crowds.

M18_CARL0287_13_GE_C18.indd 595

again. However, this person never sought treatment as he ­believed that
PTSD did not have a biological basis. Write an email to this war
veteran's friend describing materials you would design explaining the
brain changes associated with PTSD. In your email, include information
about how therapeutic treatment can produce changes in the brain.

People with agoraphobia may avoid these situations and experience fear
or anxiety about these situations that is out of proportion to the
actual threat or danger they pose. Some people with this disorder have
stayed inside their homes for years, afraid to venture outside, where
they might have a panic attack in public. The primary characteristics of
generalized anxiety disorder are excessive anxiety and worry, difficulty
in controlling these symptoms, and clinically significant signs of
distress and disruption of people's lives. The prevalence of generalized
anxiety disorder is approximately 3 percent, and the incidence is
approximately two times greater in women than in men. People of European
descent and individuals from developed countries experience generalized
anxiety disorder more frequently (Lewis-Fernández et al., 2010). Social
anxiety disorder (also called social phobia) is a persistent, excessive
fear of being exposed to the scrutiny of other people that leads people
to avoid social situations that involve speaking or performing in
public. If such situations are unavoidable, the person experiences
intense anxiety and distress. The prevalence of social anxiety disorder,
which is almost equally likely in men and women, is approximately 5
percent. In the United States, nonHispanic Caucasian individuals
experience higher rates of social anxiety disorder than persons of
Asian, Latino, African American, and Afro-Caribbean descent
(LewisFernández et al., 2010). The experience of social anxiety disorder
differs by culture. In Japan and Korea, individuals may experience
taijin kyofusho, or anxiety about making others uncomfortable. Research
suggests that the symptoms of both taijin kyofusho and social anxiety
disorder can be effectively treated with drugs that increase activity in
the serotonin system, suggesting a shared neural basis (Stein, 2009).

Genetic and Environmental Factors LO 18.10 Describe the roles of genetic
and environmental factors in anxiety disorders. Family studies and twin
studies indicate that panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and
social anxiety disorder all have a hereditary component (Hettema et al.,
2001; Merikangas & Low, 2005). Genetic investigations indicate

that variations in the gene that encodes production of the BDNF protein
may play a role in anxiety disorders. BDNF regulates neuronal survival
and differentiation during development, plays a role in long-term
potentiation and memory, and is associated with anxiety and depression
(Yu et al., 2009). A particular allele of the BDNF gene (Val66Met)
impairs extinction of conditioned fear memory in both humans and mice,
and results in atypical activity of frontal cortex--amygdala circuitry.
This allele does not normally occur in mice, but it can be inserted into
their genome. Soliman and colleagues (2010) found that the presence of
the Val66Met allele altered the circuitry of the vmPFC and impaired the
extinction of a conditioned fear response in both mice and humans. In
addition, the presence of this allele decreased the activity of the
vmPFC during extinction. Panic attacks can be triggered in people with a
history of panic disorder by a variety of treatments that activate the
autonomic nervous system, such as through injections of lactic acid (a
by-product of muscular activity), yohimbine (an a2 adrenoreceptor
antagonist), or doxapram (a drug used by anesthesiologists to increase
breathing rate), or by breathing air containing an elevated amount of
carbon dioxide (Stein & Uhde, 1995). Lactic acid and carbon dioxide both
increase heart rate and rate of respiration, just as exercise does;
yohimbine has direct pharmacological effects on the nervous system.

Brain Changes LO 18.11 Describe changes in the brain associated with
anxiety disorders. Functional-imaging studies suggest that the amygdala
and the cingulate, prefrontal, and insular cortexes are involved in
anxiety disorders. Fischer and colleagues (1998) witnessed an unexpected
panic attack in a participant while her regional cerebral blood flow was
being measured by a PET scanner. They observed decreased activity in the
right orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. Pfleiderer and
colleagues (2007) also observed a panic attack in a participant
undergoing fMRI scanning and saw

M18_CARL0287_13_GE_C18.indd 596

increased activity in the amygdala. Phan and colleagues (2005) found
that people with social anxiety disorder showed increases in the
activation of the amygdala when they looked at pictures of faces with
angry, disgusted, or fearful expressions. In addition, the activation of
the amygdala was positively correlated with the severity of the people's
symptoms. Monk and colleagues (2008) found that adolescents with
generalized anxiety disorder showed increased activation of the amygdala
and decreased activation of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex while
looking at angry faces. They also found evidence that activation of the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) suppressed amygdala activation in
healthy control participants but not in those with anxiety disorder. (As
you will recall from Chapter 11, the vmPFC plays a critical role in
extinction and inhibition of fear and anxiety.) Stein and colleagues
(2007) found that college students with a high level of anxiety (but
without a diagnosis of one of the anxiety disorders) showed increased
activation of the amygdala and the insular cortex, both of which
correlated positively with students' anxiety measures. Tye and
colleagues (2011) found that optogenetic stimulation of the terminals of
neurons of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala that formed synapses
with neurons in the central nucleus caused an immediate termination of
anxious behavior of mice. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of these
same terminals induced anxious behaviors. Optogenetic methods, described
in Chapter 5, hold the promise of discovery of the neural circuits
involved in the development and control of anxiety.

Treatment LO 18.12 Summarize treatments for anxiety disorders. Anxiety
disorders are sometimes treated with benzodiazepines. As we just saw,
increased activity of the amygdala is a common feature of the anxiety
disorders. The amygdala contains a high concentration of GABAA
receptors, which are the target of the benzodiazepines. (See Figure
18.17.) Benzodiazepines contribute to hyperpolarization by

enhancing the entry of negatively charged chloride ions into neurons.
Paulus and colleagues (2005) found that administration of a
benzodiazepine (lorazepam) decreased the activation of both the amygdala
and the insula of participants looking at emotional faces.
Administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist (having an
action opposite that of benzodiazepines), produces panic in patients
with panic disorder but not in control participants (Nutt et al., 1990).
Benzodiazepines are often used for emergency medical treatment of
anxiety disorders because the therapeutic effects of these drugs have a
rapid onset. However, they are less appropriate for long-term treatment.
They cause sedation, they induce tolerance and withdrawal symptoms, and
they have a potential for abuse. For these reasons, researchers have
been seeking other drugs to treat anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines
exert their effects by interacting with GABAA receptors at a specific
binding site (Sigel & Buhr, 1997). Chemicals that activate one of the
known binding sites on this receptor, the neurosteroid binding site,
enhance the activity of the GABAA receptor. During anxiety attacks, the
synthesis of neurosteroids--- and hence the activity of the GABAA
receptor---is suppressed. A recently developed drug, XBD173, enhances
the synthesis of neurosteroids and hence increases the activity of the
GABAA receptor. Tests with human patients have shown that the drug
reduces panic and does not produce sedation or withdrawal symptoms after
7 days of treatment (Nothdurfter et al., 2011). This drug appears to be
a promising candidate for treatment of anxiety disorders. As we saw in
Chapter 17, serotonin appears to play a role in depression. Much
evidence suggests that serotonin plays a role in anxiety disorders, too.
Even though the symptoms of the anxiety disorders discussed in this
section are very different from those of obsessive-compulsive

disorder (described in the next module), specific serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs, such as fluoxetine), which serve as potent serotonin
agonists, have become the first-line medications for treating all of
these disorders---preferably in combination with cognitive behavioral
therapy (Asnis et al., 2001; Ressler & Mayberg, 2007). Figure 18.18
shows the effect of fluvoxamine, an SSRI, on the number of panic attacks
in patients with panic disorder. As we also saw in Chapter 17,
administration of indirect agonists of the NMDA receptors that attach to
the glycine binding site have been used experimentally to successfully
treat the symptoms of schizophrenia. Preliminary research suggests that
the same may be true for anxiety disorders. Several studies have
successfully used d-cycloserine (DCS) in conjunction with cognitive
behavioral therapy to treat patients with anxiety disorders. For
example, studies have shown that DCS facilitates treatment of social
anxiety disorder and panic disorder. (See Figure 18.19.) In the
treatment of anxiety disorders, cognitive behavioral therapy often uses
procedures that desensitize patients to the objects or situations they
fear. For example, Ressler and colleagues (2004) used a computer program
to expose patients to a virtual glass elevator, gradually bringing them
higher and higher from the ground. This procedure appears to work by
extinguishing a conditioned emotional response. In fact, a study by
Walker and colleagues (2002) found that injections of d-cycloserine
facilitated the extinction of a conditioned emotional response in rats.
The drug had no effect on performance of a conditioned emotional
response unless it was administered along with extinction training.
Injections of the drug by itself had no effect. Presumably,
d-cycloserine exerts its therapeutic effect by augmenting the ability of
cognitive behavioral therapy to extinguish fear responses.

Thought Question Now that you have read about some of the research
investigating the biological basis of anxiety disorders and their

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder As the name implies, people with an
obsessive-­compulsive disorder (OCD) suffer from obsessions---persistent
and involuntary thoughts, images, or urges that will not leave
them---and compulsions---behaviors that they cannot keep from
performing. The incidence of obsessive-compulsive disorder is 1--2
percent both in the United States and internationally. Females are
slightly more likely than males to have this diagnosis. The symptoms of
OCD most commonly begin in young adulthood (Robbins et al., 1984).

Symptoms LO 18.13 List the symptoms of OCD. Obsessions include concern
or disgust with bodily secretions, dirt, germs, and the like; fear that
something terrible might happen; or a need for symmetry, order, or
exactness. Most compulsions fall into one of four categories: counting,
checking, cleaning, and avoidance. For example, people might repeatedly
check burners on the stove to see that they are off and check windows
and doors to be sure that they are locked. Some people will wash their
hands hundreds of times a day, even if their hands become covered with
painful sores. Other people meticulously clean their house or endlessly
wash, dry, and fold their clothes. Some become afraid to leave home
because they fear contamination, and some refuse to touch other members
of their family. If they do accidentally become "contaminated," people
diagnosed with OCD may have lengthy purification rituals. Obsessions are
seen in a variety of mental disorders, including schizophrenia. However,
unlike people with schizophrenia, people with obsessive-compulsive
disorder recognize that their thoughts and behaviors are irrational.
Compulsions often become more and more demanding until they interfere
with people's careers and daily lives. Although OCD is often associated
with the other anxiety disorders, it is now believed to more closely
align with other disorders that feature dysfunctional thoughts and
repetitive behaviors such as hoarding or trichotillomania (hair-pulling
disorder) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). (See Table 18.3.)
Some investigators believe that the compulsive behaviors seen in OCD are

of potential danger---that are released from normal control mechanisms
by a brain dysfunction (Rapoport & Wise, 1988). Fiske and Haslam (1997)
suggest that the behaviors seen in OCD are simply pathological examples
of typical human behaviors to develop and practice social rituals. For
example, people perform cultural rituals to mark transitions or changes
in social status, to diagnose or treat illnesses, to restore
relationships with deities, or to ensure the success of hunting or
planting. Consider the following scenario from Fiske and Haslam (1997):
Imagine that you are traveling in an unfamiliar country. Going out for a
walk, you observe a man dressed in red, standing on a red mat in a
red-painted gateway. . . . He utters the same prayer six times. He
brings out six basins of water and meticulously arranges them in a
symmetrical configuration in front of the gateway. Then he washes his
hands six times in each of the six basins, using precisely the same
motions each time. As he does this, he repeats the same phrase,
occasionally tapping his right finger on his earlobe. Through your
interpreter, you ask him what he is doing. He replies that there are
dangerous polluting substances in the ground, . . . \[and that\] he must
purify himself or something terrible will happen. He seems eager to tell
you about his concerns. (p. 211) Why is the man acting this way? Is he a
priest following a sacred ritual, or does he have obsessive-compulsive
disorder? Without knowing more about the rituals followed by the man's
culture, we cannot say. Fiske and Haslam compared the features of OCD
and other psychological disorders in descriptions of rituals, work, or
other activities in 52 cultures. They reported that the features of OCD
were found in rituals. The features

Evidence indicates that hereditary factors play at least some part in
the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Several studies have
found a greater concordance for obsessions and compulsions in
monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins (Hettema et al., 2001). Family
studies have found that OCD is associated with a neurological disorder
that appears during childhood (Pauls & Leckman, 1986; Pauls et al.,
1986). This disorder, Tourette's syndrome, is characterized by muscular
and vocal tics: facial grimaces, squatting, pacing, twirling, barking,
sniffing, coughing, grunting, or repeating specific words (especially
vulgarities). Leonard and colleagues (1992a, 1992b) found that many
patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder had tics and that many
patients with Tourette's syndrome showed obsessions and compulsions.
Grados and colleagues (2001) found a family association between OCD and
tic disorders (a broad category that includes Tourette's syndrome). Both
groups of investigators believe that the two disorders are produced by
the same underlying genotype. It is not clear why some people with this
genotype develop Tourette's syndrome and others develop
obsessive-compulsive disorder. As with schizophrenia, not all cases of
OCD have a genetic origin; the disorder sometimes occurs after brain
damage caused by various means, such as birth trauma, encephalitis, and
head trauma (Berthier et al., 1996; Hollander et al., 1990). In
particular, the symptoms appear to be associated with damage to or
dysfunction of the basal ganglia, cingulate gyrus, and prefrontal cortex
(Giedd et al., 1995; Robinson et al., 1995).

Tic disorders (including OCD) can be caused by a group A b-hemolytic
streptococcal infection (Kawikova et al., 2010; Perlmutter et al.,
1998). This infection can trigger several autoimmune diseases, in which
the patient's immune system attacks and damages certain tissues of the
body, including the valves of the heart, the kidneys, and---in this
case---parts of the brain. These diseases are sometimes referred to as
pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with
streptococcal infections, or, PANDAS. Figure 18.20 shows the parallel
course of a child's symptoms and the level of antistreptococcal DNA-B in
her blood, which indicates the presence of an active infection. The
symptoms of OCD appear to be produced by damage to the basal ganglia.
Bodner and colleagues (2001) report the case of a 25-year-old man whose
untreated sore throat developed into an autoimmune disease that produced
obsessions and compulsions. The investigators found antibodies to type A
b-hemolytic streptococcus, and MRI scans indicated abnormalities in the
basal ganglia. An MRI study of 34 children with streptococcus-associated
tics or OCD by Giedd and colleagues (2000) found an increase in the size
of the basal ganglia that they attributed to an autoimmune inflammation
of this region.

Rating of OCD symptoms

of other psychological disorders were much less common. On the whole,
the evidence suggests that the symptoms of OCD represent an exaggeration
of typical human behavior. In an in-lab study, Zhong and Liljenquist
(2006) found that students at Northwestern University in the United
States apparently unknowingly consider cleansing rituals to "wash away
their sins." The investigators had the participants recall in detail
either an ethical or an unethical deed they had committed in the past.
Later, they were asked to complete some word fragments by filling in
letters where blanks occurred. Some word fragments could be made into
words that did or did not pertain to cleansing. For example, W---H,
SH--ER, and S--P could be wash, shower, and soap, or they could be wish,
shaker, and step. The participants who had described a misdeed were much
more likely to think of cleansing-related words. And when offered a free
gift---either a pencil or an antiseptic wipe--- participants who
described a misdeed were more likely to choose the antiseptic wipe.

Stress and Anxiety Disorders 601

Treatment LO 18.16 Summarize treatments for OCD. Three drugs are
regularly used to treat the symptoms of OCD: clomipramine, fluoxetine,
and fluvoxamine. These effective antiobsessional drugs are specific
blockers of 5-HT reuptake; thus, they are serotonergic agonists. In
general, serotonin has an inhibitory effect on species-typical
behaviors, which tempted several investigators to speculate that these
drugs alleviate the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder by
reducing the strength of innate tendencies for counting, checking,
cleaning, and avoidance behaviors that may underlie this disorder. Brain
regions that have been implicated in OCD, including the orbitofrontal
cortex and the basal ganglia, receive input from serotonergic terminals
(El Mansari & Blier, 1997; Lavoie & Parent, 1990). The importance of
serotonergic activity in inhibiting compulsive behaviors is underscored
by three interesting compulsions: trichotillomania, onychophagia, and
acral lick dermatitis. Trichotillomania is compulsive hair pulling.
People with this disorder (almost always females) often spend hours each
night pulling hairs out one by one, sometimes eating them (Rapoport,
1991). Onychophagia is compulsive nail biting, which in its extreme can
cause severe damage to the ends of the fingers. (For those who are
sufficiently agile, toenail biting is not uncommon.) Doubleblind studies
have shown that both of these disorders can be treated successfully by
clomipramine, the drug of choice for OCD (Leonard et al., 1992a). Acral
lick dermatitis is a disease of dogs, not humans. Some dogs will
continuously lick at a part of their body, especially their wrist or
ankle (called the carpus and the hock). The licking removes the hair and
often erodes away

M18_CARL0287_13_GE_C18.indd 601

the skin as well. The disorder seems to be genetic; it is seen almost
exclusively in large breeds such as Great Danes, Labrador retrievers,
and German shepherds, and it runs in families. A double-blind study
found that clomipramine reduces this compulsive behavior (Rapoport et
al., 1992). We saw in the previous section that an NMDA receptor
agonist, d-cycloserine, appears to be useful in treating the symptoms of
a variety of anxiety disorders. This drug appears to help in the
treatment of the symptoms of OCD as well. A double-blind study by
Wilhelm and colleagues (2008) found that compared with patients who
received a placebo, patients who received d-cycloserine along with
sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy showed a greater decrease in
their obsessive symptoms and retained this improvement after the
sessions ended. Presumably, the drug facilitated the extinction of the
maladaptive thoughts and behaviors, just as it facilitates the
extinction of conditioned emotional responses in patients with anxiety
disorders. (See Figure 18.21.) Some patients with severe OCD have been
successfully treated with cingulotomy---surgical destruction of specific
fiber bundles in the subcortical frontal lobe, including the cingulum
bundle (which connects the prefrontal and cingulate cortexes with the
limbic cortex of the temporal lobe) and a region that contains fibers
that connect the basal ganglia with the prefrontal cortex (Ballantine et
al., 1987; Mindus et al., 1994). These operations have a reasonably good
success rate (Dougherty et al., 2002). Another reasonably successful
surgical procedure, capsulotomy, destroys a region of a fiber bundle
(the internal capsule) that connects the caudate nucleus with the medial
prefrontal

and colleagues (2004) found that functional-imaging studies consistently
showed increased activity of the caudate nucleus and the orbitofrontal
cortex. Guehl and colleagues (2008) inserted microelectrodes into the
caudate nuclei of three patients with OCD who were being evaluated for
neurosurgery. They found that two of the patients, who reported the
presence of obsessive thoughts during the surgery, showed increased
activity in neurons in the caudate nucleus. The third patient, who did
not report obsessive thoughts, showed a lower rate of neural activity. A
review by Saxena and colleagues (1998) described several studies that
measured regional brain activity in patients with OCD before and after
successful treatment with drugs or cognitive behavioral therapy. In
general, the improvement in a patient's symptoms was correlated with a
reduction in the activity of the caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal
cortex. The fact that cognitive behavioral therapy and drug therapy
produced similar results is especially remarkable: It indicates that
very different procedures may bring about physiological changes that
alleviate symptoms of a serious mental disorder.

undone, so such procedures must be considered only as a last resort. As
Rück and colleagues report, some patients experience adverse side
effects after surgery, such as problems of planning, apathy, or
difficulty inhibiting socially inappropriate behavior. As we saw in
Chapter 16, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been found to be useful in
treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Because OCD, like
Parkinson's disease, appears to involve abnormalities in the basal
ganglia, several clinics have tried to use DBS of the basal ganglia or
fiber tracts connected with them to treat this disorder. This form of
therapy appears to reduce the symptoms of OCD in some patients (Abelson
et al., 2005; Larson, 2008). Le Jeune and colleagues (2010) found that
DBS of the subthalamic nucleus, which plays an integral role in the
cortical-- basal ganglia circuitry, reduces the symptoms of OCD. One of
the more modern forms of psychosurgery is destruction of the internal
capsule. Goodman and colleagues (2010)

found that DBS of the internal capsule reduced the symptoms of OCD in
four of six patients with severe, treatmentresistant OCD. A significant
benefit of DBS is that, unlike psychosurgical procedures that destroy
brain tissue, it is reversible: If no benefit is obtained from the
stimulation, the electrodes can be removed. As we saw in Chapters 8 and
16, the principal parts of the basal ganglia, the caudate nucleus and
the putamen, receive information from the cerebral cortex. As this
information is processed by the basal ganglia, it flows through two
pathways before it passes to the thalamus and is sent back to the
cortex. The direct pathway is excitatory, and the indirect pathway is
inhibitory. (See Figure 18.22.) Saxena and colleagues (1998) suggest
that the symptoms of OCD may be a result of overactivity of the direct
pathway. They propose that one of the functions of this pathway is
control of previously learned behavior sequences that have become
automatic so that they can be executed rapidly. The orbitofrontal
cortex, which is involved in recognizing situations that

Module Review: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Symptoms

Treatment

LO 18.13 List the symptoms of OCD.

LO 18.16 Summarize treatments for OCD.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by
obsessions---unwanted thoughts---and compulsions--- uncontrollable
behaviors, especially those involving cleanliness and attention to
danger.

OCD has a heritable basis and is related to Tourette's syndrome, a
neurological disorder characterized by tics and vocalizations. It can
also be caused by brain damage at birth, encephalitis, and head
injuries, especially when the basal ganglia are involved. A type A
b-hemolytic streptococcus infection can stimulate an autoimmune
attack---presumably on the basal ganglia---that produces symptoms of
OCD.

The most effective drugs for treating OCD are SSRIs such as
clomipramine, fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine. Three other
compulsions---hair pulling, nail biting, and (in dogs) acral lick
syndrome---are also suppressed by clomipramine. In conjunction with
cognitive behavioral therapy, d-cycloserine, which acts as an indirect
agonist at NMDA receptors, also appears to reduce the symptoms of OCD.
Some investigators believe that clomipramine and related drugs alleviate
the symptoms of OCD by increasing the activity of serotonergic pathways
that play an inhibitory role in species-typical behaviors. In severe
cases of OCD that do not respond to other treatments, surgical
procedures such as cingulotomy and capsulotomy may reduce symptoms. Deep
brain stimulation with implanted electrodes has been shown to be
effective in some patients and, unlike cingulotomy and capsulotomy, has
the benefit of being reversible.

Genetic and Environmental Factors LO 18.14 Describe the roles of genetic

LO 18.15 Describe changes in the brain associated with OCD. Functional
imaging indicates that people with obsessivecompulsive disorder tend to
show increased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex,
and caudate nucleus. Drug treatment or cognitive behavioral therapy that
successfully reduces the symptoms of OCD generally reduces the activity
of the orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus.

Imagine that you have a relative who was recently diagnosed with
obsessive-compulsive disorder. You learn that your loved one is
struggling to decide which treatment strategy is best for them. Your
relative calls you to ask about which treatment strategies have
brain-based evidence to support them. To help your relative be informed
in making this difficult decision, briefly outline some treatment
options and explain their effects in the nervous system.

Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov initially trained as a medical doctor.
During World War I in 1914 and again at the outbreak of the Russian
Civil war in 1917, Mikhail had worked at military hospitals saving lives
and gaining hands-on medical experience. Once during his medical
practice, he had to inject himself with morphine to ease the pain from a
severe reaction to a vaccine. Soon Bulgakov became addicted to the drug,
and later, when he became a writer at the age of 30, described his
experience in a novel called Morphine. The main character is Doctor
Polyakov, who injects himself with morphine to alleviate his severe
stomach pain. He finds that together with his physical pain, the drug
completely erases his mental suffering. Polyakov, like Bulgakov, then
makes the mistake of injecting himself with morphine for the second time
fearing recurrence of the stomach pain. Again, the doctor feels that his
memories do not trouble him anymore and that he can enjoy life again --
"I would say that a man can only work normally after an injection of
morphine." The novel shows how his addiction escalates and how morphine
takes over his life. He is no longer able to work without injecting
morphine at least twice a day, losses weight, and suffers from skin
infections from not sterilizing his syringes and needles. The only thing
in the world that makes him feel alive now is morphine. Polyakov needs
more of the drug and begins to steal it at every opportunity, risking
his professional reputation. When he finds himself in situations when he
can't inject, Polyakov plunges into the horrors of morphine withdrawal.
Bulgakov masterfully describes the symptoms: the excruciating pain all
over the body, constant profuse sweating, the stomach becomes "twisted
in knots", violent vomiting, and extreme diarrhoea, which make Polyakov
feel as if all bodily fluids are coming out at once. Physical

withdrawal symptoms---extreme anxiety, insomnia, chaotic thoughts and
various, often disturbing, hallucinations make this horrific experience
unbearable. When Polyakov realizes the addiction is ruining his life and
that he is unable to quit morphine without help, he undertakes a
treatment program in a specialized hospital. However, he fails to commit
to the therapy and leaves the clinic, stealing some of their morphine
stock. His drug abuse reaches a point where the dose needed is so high
that, even for a doctor with an easy access to pharmacy warehouses, it
is difficult to find enough. Polyakov tries reducing the dose and
quitting many times but ends up with an endless cycle of morphine
injections and merciless agony in between. Polyakov's story ends in
tragedy---after ten months of morphine abuse, he takes his own life at
the age of just twenty-four. Although the author takes us through
Polyakov's story through the lens of his own experience, Bulgakov is
believed to have recovered from his own drug addiction. Allegedly, his
wife, who had a duty of preparing Bulgakov's morphine solution, was
gradually diluting it down with distilled water. As a result, the writer
was able to reduce the drug use and eventually quit. However, recent
research evidence suggests that it might not be the case. Analysis of
the metabolites extracted from the surface of the pages of Bulgakov's
original manuscript Master i Margarita, detected morphine's metabolites
as well as the intact drug, indicating that during his final years
Bulgakov was taking large doses of morphine. Sources: Bulgakov M.A,

606 Chapter 19 Substance abuse poses serious problems to our species.
Con­ sider the negative outcomes caused by the abuse of one of our oldest
drugs, alcohol: vehicle accidents, fetal alcohol syndrome, cirrhosis of
the liver, Korsakoff's syndrome, and increased risk of heart disease and
stroke. Smoking (using nicotine) increases the risk of lung cancer,
heart attack, and stroke, and women who smoke give birth to smaller,
less healthy babies. Cocaine abuse can cause psychotic behavior, brain
damage, and death from overdose; competition for lu­ crative and illegal
markets disrupts neighborhoods and com­ munities, subverts social,
political, and judicial systems, and causes many preventable deaths. The
use of designer drugs exposes users to unknown dangers of untested and
often contaminated products, as several people discovered when they
developed Parkinson's disease after taking a synthetic opiate that was
tainted with a neurotoxin. (See the case at the beginning of Chapter 5.)
People who use drugs intravenously increase their risk of contracting
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, or other infectious
diseases. What makes using these drugs so attractive to so many people?
Part of the answer, as you might have predicted from what you have
learned about the physiology of reinforcement in Chapter 13, is that all
of these substances stimulate brain mechanisms responsible for positive
reinforcement, which is common to drugs in the category drugs of abuse.
In addition, most drugs in this category reduce or eliminate unpleasant
feelings, some of which are produced by the drugs them­ selves. The
immediate effects of these drugs are more power­ ful than the knowledge
that in the long term, there may be negative consequences. As a
category, drugs of abuse include licit (legal, e.g., nicotine, alcohol),
illicit (illegal, e.g., heroin), prescription (e.g., oxycodone),
nonprescription (e.g., inhal­ ants), naturally derived (present in a
plant, animal, or fungus, e.g., marijuana), and synthetic (made by
humans through a chemical process, e.g., methamphetamine) substances.
John's case includes many features of substance abuse that will be
explored in this chapter. For example, rates of substance abuse in
general are higher among men; how­ ever, some research suggests that
rates of prescription drug abuse may be similar among men and women
(Greenfield et al., 2010). Following nearly a decade of dramatic
increases in prescription painkiller abuse (Butler et al., 2013), drug
overdose deaths increased over 20 percent from 2015 to 2016, with the
majority attributed to synthetic opiates (such

as OxyContin; Scholl et al., 2019). In 2010, oxycodone man­ ufacturers
changed the formula of the pills to make it more difficult to crush the
pills or dissolve them to be snorted or injected. This change appeared
to reduce the number of people abusing the drug (Butler et al., 2013).
Training to treat opiate overdoses and wider distribution of the opiate
antagonist naloxone appear to have helped reduce fatali­ ties associated
with opiate abuse (Abouk et al., 2019; Walley et al., 2013) and
preliminary data suggest that increases in opiate overdose fatalities
may be tapering off (CDC, 2018). John's experience demonstrates many of
the diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder (American Psychiat­
ric Association, 2013). (See Table 19.1.) Substance use disorders are
characterized by impaired control over the use of the substance (such as
taking increasing amounts of the drug); a desire to reduce the amount of
the drug used or unsuccessful attempts to cut back; large amounts of
time spent obtaining the drug; drug craving; failure to meet
educational, occupational, or family obligations; continued use even
after experiencing interpersonal problems related to use of the drug;
failure to stop using the drug despite problems related to its use; and
experiencing tolerance and withdrawal (American Psychiatric Association,
2013). In this chapter, we will examine common features as­ sociated with
substance abuse. The chapter concludes with a closer examination of some
specific types of drugs that are commonly abused, followed by treatment
options.

Common Features of Substance Abuse The term addiction has fallen out of
favor with many re­ searchers and clinicians. Although addiction is
sometimes used to refer to severe problems related to compulsive or ha­
bitual behaviors ranging from drug use to gambling, many experts
disagree on what features define addiction, and the term typically has a
negative connotation. Instead, many professionals (as well as the
American Psychiatric Association---the organization responsible for
diagnostic cri­ teria for mental disorders) have adopted the term
substance abuse. This term has a more neutral connotation and is more
consistent with a medical model. The criteria described in Table 19.1
correspond to diagnosis with substance use disorder.

Table 19.1 Symptoms of Substance Use Disorders Repeated use of the
substance that results in tolerance to its effects Craving for the
substance Intentions to reduce use of the substance Large amounts of
time are spent seeking or using the substance, or recovering from its

Substance Abuse 607

Although the terminology differs somewhat from substance abuse, this
diagnosis corresponds with the pattern of behav­ iors we will describe as
substance abuse in this chapter. The medical model emphasizes biological
causes (includ­ ing physiological and genetic factors) that underlie
compulsive behaviors, such as substance abuse. This model typically em­
phasizes biologically based treatments such as using pharma­ cological
interventions to treat symptoms or change behavior. These treatments may
be combined into a biopsychosocial ap­ proach as one element among many
in a comprehensive treat­ ment plan designed to reduce drug-taking
behavior (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 1997). In this chapter,
we will focus on exploring the biological aspects of substance abuse.
The use of medication to treat pain and human suffering traces back
thousands of years. Long ago, people discovered that many substances
found in nature---primarily leaves, seeds, and roots of plants but also
some animal products--- had medicinal qualities. They discovered herbs
that helped to prevent infections, that promoted healing, that calmed an
upset stomach, that reduced pain, or that helped to provide a night's
sleep. They also discovered recreational drugs---drugs that produced
pleasurable effects when eaten, drunk, or smoked. The most universal
recreational drug, and perhaps the first one that our ancestors
discovered, is ethyl alcohol. Yeast spores are present everywhere, and
these microorganisms can feed on sugar solutions and pro­ duce alcohol as
a by-product. Undoubtedly, people in many different parts of the world
discovered the pleasurable ef­ fects of drinking liquids that had been
left alone for a while, such as the juice that had accumulated in the
bottom of a container of fruit. The juice may have become sour and
badtasting because of the action of bacteria, but the effects of the
alcohol encouraged people to experiment, which led to the development of
a wide variety of fermented beverages. Our ancestors discovered other
recreational drugs. Some of them were consumed only locally; others
became so popu­ lar that their cultivation as commercial crops spread
through­ out the world. For example, people in Asia discovered the
effects of the sap of the opium poppy and the beverage made

from the leaves of the tea plant, people in India discovered the effects
of the smoke of cannabis, people in South America discovered the effects
of chewing coca leaves and making a drink from coffee beans, and people
in North America dis­ covered the effects of the smoke of the tobacco
plant. Many of the drugs they discovered were actually poisons that
served to protect the plants from animals (primarily insects) that ate
them. Although the drugs were toxic in sufficient quantities, our
ancestors learned how to take these drugs in amounts that would not make
them ill---at least, not right away. The effects of these drugs on their
brains kept them coming back for more. Table 19.2 lists some of the most
commonly abused drugs and indicates their sites of action in the central
nervous system. The rest of this chapter will focus on understanding the
biological basis for abuse of these (and other, closely related) drugs.

Positive Reinforcement LO 19.1 Describe the neural mechanisms of
positive reinforcement that all drugs of abuse share. Drugs that lead to
dependency must first reinforce people's behavior. As we saw in Chapter
13, positive reinforcement refers to the effect that certain stimuli
have on the behaviors that preceded them. If, in a particular situation,
a behavior is regularly followed by an appetitive stimulus (one that the
or­ ganism will tend to approach), then that behavior will become more
frequent in that situation. For example, if a hungry rat accidentally
bumps into a lever and receives some food, the rat will eventually learn
to press the lever. What actually seems to happen is that the occurrence
of an appetitive stimulus acti­ vates a reinforcement mechanism in the
brain that increases the likelihood of the most recent response (the
lever press) in the present situation (the chamber that contains the
lever). Most drugs of abuse have clear reinforcing effects. (There is
one exception---hallucinogens). That is, their ef­ fects include
activation of the reinforcement mechanism. This activation strengthens
the response that was just made. Particularly if the drug was taken by a
fast-acting route

608 Chapter 19 such as injection or inhalation, the last response will
be the act of taking the drug, so that response will be reinforced. This
form of reinforcement is powerful and immediate and works with a wide
variety of species. For example, a rat or a monkey will quickly learn to
press a lever that controls a device that injects cocaine through a
plastic tube inserted into a vein. As you saw in the case of John at the
begin­ ning of the chapter, changing the route of administration can
change the abuse potential of a drug. Snorting, smok­ ing, or injecting a
drug automatically increases the abuse potential of the drug compared to
using a slower route of administration, such as taking a drug orally,
because more of the drug enters the brain more rapidly and activates the
reinforcement pathway more strongly. (See Figure 19.1.) When appetitive
stimuli occur, they usually do so because we just did something to make
them happen---and not because an experimenter was controlling the
situation. The effectiveness of a reinforcing stimulus is greatest if it
occurs immediately after a response. If the reinforcing stimulus is
delayed, it becomes consider­ ably less effective. The reason for this
fact is found by exam­ ining the function of operant conditioning:
learning about the consequences of our own behavior. Normally, causes
and effects are closely related in time; we engage in one behavior and
receive a corresponding consequence, good or bad. The consequences of
the actions teach us whether to repeat that action, and events that
follow a response by more than a few seconds were probably not caused by
that response. As we saw in Chapter 4, many individuals who use drugs
recreationally prefer heroin to morphine not because heroin has a
different effect, but because it has a more rapid effect. In fact,
heroin is converted to morphine as soon as it

reaches the brain. But because heroin is more lipid soluble, it passes
through the blood--brain barrier more rapidly, and its effects on the
brain are felt sooner than those of morphine. The most potent
reinforcement occurs when drugs produce sudden changes in the activity
of the reinforcement mecha­ nism; slow changes are much less reinforcing.
A person tak­ ing a drug recreationally typically seeks a sudden "rush"
produced by a fast-acting drug. (As we will see later, the use of
methadone to treat opiate abuse and nicotine patches to treat tobacco
abuse is based on this phenomenon.) Earlier, we posed the question of
why people expose themselves to the risks associated with abusing
reinforcing drugs. Do people choose to become dependent on a drug that
produces pleasurable effects in the short term but also produces
powerful aversive effects in the long term, includ­ ing loss of
employment and social status, legal problems and possible imprisonment,
damage to health, and even prema­ ture death? The answer is that, as we
saw, our reinforcement mechanism has evolved to deal with the immediate
effects of our behavior. The immediate reinforcing effects of a drug
can, for some individuals, overpower the recognition of the long-term
aversive effects. Fortunately, most people are able to resist the
short-term effects; only a minority of people who try highly reinforcing
drugs go on to abuse them. Although cocaine has one of the highest abuse
potentials of all recre­ ational drugs, only about 15 percent of people
who use it escalate their use of the drug to the point of substance
abuse (Wagner & Anthony, 2002). As we will see later, particular brain
mechanisms are responsible for inhibiting behavior that has unfavorable
long-term consequences. If a drug is taken by a slow-acting route,
reinforce­ ment can also occur, but the process is somewhat more
complicated. If a person takes a pill and several minutes later
experiences a feeling of euphoria, he or she will cer­ tainly remember
swallowing the pill. The recollection of this behavior will activate
some of the same neural circuits involved in actually swallowing the
pill, and the reinforce­ ment mechanism, now active because of the
effects of the drug, will reinforce the behavior. Other cognitive
processes contribute to the reinforcement, too, such as the expecta­ tion
that euphoric effects will occur. Perhaps someone said, "Take one of
these pills; you'll get a great high!" But if a nonhuman animal is
administered one of these pills, its be­ havior is unlikely to be
reinforced. By the time the euphoric effect occurs, the animal will be
doing something other than ingesting the drug. Without the ability to
associate the ef­ fects of the drug with an earlier behavior and thus
activate circuits involved in the performance of that behavior, the
delay between the behavior and the reinforcing effect of the drug
prevents the animal from learning to take the drug. NEURAL MECHANISMS As

have one physiological effect in common: They cause the re­ lease of
dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (White, 1996). This effect is not the
only effect of reinforcing stimuli, and even aversive stimuli can
trigger the release of dopamine (Salamone, 1992). But although there is
much that we do not yet understand about the neural basis of
reinforcement, the release of dopamine appears to be a necessary (but
not sufficient) condition for positive reinforcement to take place. Role
of the Mesolimbic Pathway Drugs that are abused--- including
amphetamine, cocaine, opiates, nicotine, alcohol, PCP, and
cannabis---trigger the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens
(NAC), as measured by microdialy­ sis (Di Chiara, 1995). Different drugs
stimulate the release of dopamine in different ways. The details of the
ways in which particular drugs interact with the mesolimbic dopa­
minergic system are described later, in sections devoted to specific
categories of drugs. (See Figure 19.2.) The fact that the reinforcing
properties of drugs involve the same brain mechanisms as natural
reinforcers indicates that these drugs take advantage of brain
mechanisms that normally help us adapt to our environment. It appears
that the process of substance abuse begins in the mesolimbic dopami­
nergic system and then produces long-term changes in other brain regions
that receive input from these neurons (Kauer & Malenka, 2007). The first
changes appear to take place in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Saal
and colleagues (2003) found that a single administration of a variety of
commonly

abused drugs (including cocaine, amphetamine, morphine, alcohol, and
nicotine) increased the strength of excitatory synapses on dopaminergic
neurons in the VTA in mice. This change appears to result from insertion
of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane of the DA
neurons (Mameli et al., 2009). As we saw in Chapter 13, this process,
normally mediated by glutamatergic NMDA receptors, is the neural basis
of many forms of learning. A single injection of a reinforcing drug
produces synaptic strengthening in the VTA that lasts for about 5 days.
If an animal receives cocaine for about 2 weeks, the changes in the VTA
persist. Role of the Striatum As a result of the changes in the VTA,
increased activation is seen in a variety of regions that receive
dopaminergic input from the VTA, including the ventral striatum, which
includes the NAC, and the dorsal striatum, which includes the caudate
nucleus and puta­ men. Synaptic changes that are responsible for the
compul­ sive behaviors that characterize substance abuse occur only after
continued use of a drug. The most important of these changes appears to
occur in the dorsal striatum. We saw in Chapter 13 that the basal
ganglia (which include the dorsal striatum) play a critical role in
operant conditioning, and substance abuse involves just that. At first,
the person using the drug experiences the plea­ surable effects of the
drug, reinforcing the behaviors that cause the drug to be delivered to
the brain (procuring the drug, taking necessary steps to prepare it,
then swallowing,

Connections Between Mesolimbic Pathway and Striatum An experiment by
Belin and Everitt (2008) suggests that the neural changes responsible
for chronic drug use follow a dorsally cascading set of reciprocal
connections between the striatum and the ventral tegmental area.
Anatomical studies show that neurons in the ventral NAC project to the
VTA, which sends dopaminergic projections back to a more dorsal region
of the NAC, and so on. This back-andforth communication continues,
connecting increasingly dorsal regions of the striatum, all the way up
to the cau­ date nucleus and putamen. Belin and Everitt found that bi­
lateral infusions of a dopamine antagonist into the dorsal striatum of
rats suppressed responding to a light that had been associated with
infusions of cocaine, but that unilateral infusions had no effect. They
also found that a unilateral lesion of the NAC had no effect on
responding. However, they found that a lesion of the NAC on one side of
the brain combined with infusion of a dopamine antagonist into the
dorsal striatum on the other side of the brain suppressed re­ sponding to
the light. (See Figure 19.3.) Further support for the critical role of
the dorsal striatum in automatic, habitual, or compulsive behaviors was
provided by a study with rats that found that infusion of a dopamine
antagonist into the dorsal striatum suppressed lever presses that had
been re­ inforced by the illumination of a light that had been paired
with intravenous injections of cocaine (Vanderschuren et al., 2005).
These results suggest that the control of compulsive drug-taking
behavior is established by interactions between the ventral and dorsal
striatum that are mediated by dopa­ minergic connections between these
regions and the VTA. Functional-imaging studies by Volkow and her col­
leagues (reviewed by Volkow et al., 2011) provide evidence that
substance abuse involves the dorsal striatum in hu­ mans, as well as in
other animals. The investigators found that when people who abuse
cocaine are given an injection of methylphenidate (a drug with effects
like those of co­ caine or amphetamine), they show a much smaller release
of

dopamine in the NAC or dorsal striatum than do nonusers. However, when
this group of people was shown a video of people smoking cocaine, they
showed an increased release of dopamine in the dorsal striatum. This
means that the re­ sponse to the drug itself is diminished in people who
abuse the drug, but the response to cues associated with the drug is
augmented---in the dorsal striatum. (See Figure 19.4.)

smoking, sniffing, or injecting it). Eventually, these behaviors become
habitual, and the impulse to perform them becomes difficult to resist.
The early reinforcing effects that take place in the ventral striatum
(namely, in the NAC) encourage drug-taking behavior, but the changes
that make the behav­ iors become habitual involve the dorsal striatum. As
we saw in Chapter 8, an important role of the dorsal striatum is es­
tablishment of automatic behaviors---the type of behaviors that are
impaired in people with Parkinson's disease, which is caused by
disruption of dopaminergic input to this region. Studies with monkeys
performing a response reinforced by infusion of cocaine over a long
period of time show a pro­ gression of neural changes, beginning in the
ventral striatum (in the NAC) and continuing upward to the dorsal stria­
tum as the behavior becomes more automatic and habitual (Letchworth et
al., 2001; Porrino et al., 2004, 2007).

Substance Abuse 611

Altogether, the release of dopamine in the NAC leads to acquisition of
the drug-taking behavior, but changes in the dorsal striatum are
responsible for the establishment of the compulsive drug-taking habit.
In addition, in indi­ viduals who abuse the drug, dopamine is released in
the dorsal striatum not by the drug itself but by stimuli associ­ ated
with procuring and taking the drug, including places where the drug was
taken and people with whom it was taken. So when people first take a
drug of abuse, they ex­ perience pleasurable effects. If they continue to
take the drug, their compulsion to take the drug is not motivated by the
pleasurable effects, but by drug-related cues that give rise to the urge
to perform drug-seeking behaviors. As Volkow and her colleagues note,
individuals who abuse substances are aroused and motivated when they are
seeking a drug but are withdrawn and apathetic when they are in a
drug-free environment, engaged in activities not related to drug taking.
Dopamine Receptors The alterations that occur in the NAC and later in
the dorsal striatum include changes in dopamine receptors on the medium
spiny neurons, which are the source of axons that project from both of
these re­ gions to other parts of the brain. Increases are seen in do­
pamine D1 receptors, which cause excitation and facilitate behavior, and
decreases are seen in dopamine D2 receptors, which cause inhibition and
suppress behavior. A study by Witten and colleagues (2010) found that
one of the neural changes in the NAC caused by cocaine intake involves
ace­ tylcholinergic interneurons. ACh neurons comprise less than 1
percent of the neurons in the NAC, but these neu­ rons have a powerful
effect on the activity of the medium spiny neurons located there. Witten
and colleagues found that cocaine increased the firing of the
interneurons, and that inhibiting the firing of these neurons by
optogenetic methods blocked the reinforcing effect of cocaine. Role of
the Prefrontal Cortex Most people who try drugs like cocaine or
oxycodone do not progress to substance abuse (Volkow & Li, 2005). The
likelihood of developing substance abuse is a function of genetic
factors, age (ado­ lescents are most vulnerable), and environmental
factors (such as access to drugs and the occurrence of stressful life
events). The role of genetic factors is discussed in an up­ coming module
of this chapter. The role of the prefrontal cortex in judgment, risk tak­
ing, and control of inappropriate behaviors may explain why adolescents
are much more vulnerable to developing substance abuse than are adults.
Adolescence is a time of rapid and profound maturational change in the
brain--- particularly in the prefrontal cortex. Before these circuits
reach their adult form, adolescents are more likely to dis­ play
increased levels of impulsive, novelty-driven, risky behavior, including
experimentation with alcohol, nicotine,

M19_CARL0287_13_GE_C19.indd 611

and illicit drugs. Substance abuse in adults most often be­ gins with
drug use in adolescence or young adulthood. Approximately 50 percent of
cases of substance abuse begin between the ages of 15 and 18, and very
few begin after age 20. In addition, early onset of drug-taking is
associated with more severe substance abuse and a greater likelihood of
abusing multiple substances (Chambers et al., 2003). In fact, Tarter and
colleagues (2003) found that 10- to 12-year-old boys who scored the
lowest on tests of behavioral inhibi­ tion had an increased risk of
developing substance abuse by age 19. Some regions of the prefrontal
cortex have inhibi­ tory connections with the striatum, and increased
activity of these regions is correlated with resistance to substance
abuse. Presumably, the increased vulnerability of adoles­ cents to
substance abuse is related to the relative immatu­ rity of inhibitory
mechanisms of their prefrontal cortex. The final development of neural
circuits involved in behavioral control and judgment, along with the
maturity that comes from increased experience, apparently helps people
emerg­ ing from adolescence to resist the temptation to abuse drugs.
People with a long history of substance abuse not only show the same
deficits on tasks that involve the prefrontal cortex as do people with
lesions of this region, they also show structural abnormalities of this
region. For example, Franklin and colleagues (2002) reported an average
decrease of 5--11 percent in the gray matter of various regions of the
prefrontal cortex of people who abused cocaine. Thompson and colleagues
(2004) found decreases in the gray matter volume of the cingulate cortex
and limbic cortex of people who abused methamphetamine, and Ersche and
colleagues (2011) found similar decreases in the brains of people who
abused cocaine. De Ruiter and colleagues (2011) found evi­ dence of loss
of behavioral control caused by decreased ac­ tivation of the dorsomedial
PFC in both heavy smokers and pathological gamblers, which supports the
assertion of some investigators that pathological gambling should be
regarded as a form of addiction (Thomas et al., 2013). Zhang and col­
leagues (2011) found decreased gray matter in the prefron­ tal cortex
that was proportional to the amount of people's lifetime tobacco use.
The results of these studies do not per­ mit us to determine whether
abnormalities in the prefron­ tal cortex predispose people to develop
substance abuse or whether drug taking causes these abnormalities (or
both). As we saw in Chapter 17, the negative and cogni­ tive symptoms of
schizophrenia appear to be a result of hypofrontality---decreased
activity of the prefrontal cortex. These symptoms are very similar to
those that accompany long-term substance abuse. In fact, studies have
shown a high level of comorbidity of schizophrenia and substance abuse.
(Comorbidity refers to the simultaneous presence of two or more
disorders in the same person.) For example, up to half of all people
with schizophrenia have a substance abuse disorder (of alcohol or
illicit drugs), and 70--90 percent are nicotine dependent (Brady &
Sinha, 2005). In fact, in the

role in control of sleep stages

Prevalence of schzophrenia during follow-up (percent)

United States, smokers with psychiatric disorders, who con­ stitute
approximately 7 percent of the population, consume 34 percent of all
cigarettes (Dani & Harris, 2005). In support of the association between
mental disorders (including sub­ stance use disorders) and
hypofrontality, Mathalon and col­ leagues (2003) found that prefrontal
gray matter volumes were 10.1 percent lower in patients with alcohol
abuse, 9.0 percent lower in patients with schizophrenia, and 15.6 per­
cent lower in patients with both disorders. (See Figure 19.5.) Weiser
and colleagues (2004) administered a smoking questionnaire to a random
sample of adolescent military recruits each year. Over a 4- to 16-year
follow-up period, they found that, compared with nonsmokers, the preva­
lence of hospitalization for schizophrenia was 2.3 times higher in
recruits who smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day. (See Figure 19.6.)
These results suggest that abnor­ malities in the prefrontal cortex may
be a common factor in schizophrenia and some forms of substance use.
Again, research has not yet determined whether preexisting ab­
normalities increase the risk of these disorders or whether the
disorders cause the abnormalities.

and food-seeking behavior. Orexin is synthesized in neurons in the
lateral hypothalamus and released in many parts of the brain, including
those that play a role in reinforcement, such as the VTA, NAC, and
dorsal striatum. Administration of reinforcing drugs or presentation of
stimuli associated with them activates orexinergic neurons, and infusion
of orexin into the VTA reinstates drug seeking that was previously
extinguished. (Relapse---resumption of drug seeking---is discussed later
in this chapter.) In addition, infusing a drug that blocks orexin
receptors into the VTA also blocks cocaine seeking elicited by
drug-related cues and prevents the learn­ ing of a conditioned place
preference---preference for a place where a reinforcing drug was
previously administered (Aston-Jones et al., 2009; Kenney, 2011; Scharf
et al., 2010). The second peptide, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH),
is also synthesized in the lateral hypothalamus, and as we saw in
Chapter 12, stimulates hunger and re­ duces metabolic rate. MCH receptors
are found in several places in the brain, including the NAC, where they
are found on neurons that also contain DA receptors. Chung and
colleagues (2009) found that stimulating both DA receptors and MCH
receptors increased firing of NAC neurons, and that administering a drug
that blocks MCH receptors decreased the effectiveness of cocaine or
cocainerelated cues to alter the animals' behavior. A targeted mu­ tation
against the MCH receptor gene had the same effect. Cippitelli and
colleagues (2010) found that MCH played a similar role in alcohol
intake.

Substance Abuse 613

Negative Reinforcement LO 19.2 Explain how negative reinforcement can
contribute to substance abuse through physical dependence, craving, and
relapse. Have you ever had a headache, muscle ache, or other in­ jury or
illness that caused you pain or made you uncom­ fortable? How did you
change your behavior to reduce the pain or discomfort? Maybe you took a
pain reliever for your headache or illness, or got a massage for your
sore muscle. If whatever you did worked to alleviate the pain, your
decision to do it would certainly be reinforced. A behavior that turns
off (or reduces) an aversive stimulus will be reinforced. This
phenomenon is known as negative reinforcement. For example, many newer
cars use a noise to let drivers or passengers know that their seat belts
aren't fastened. When the seat belt is fastened, the noise ceases. The
unpleasant noise (the aversive stimulus) is terminated when the seat
belt is buckled (the response), so the response is reinforced. Negative
reinforcement should not be confused with punishment. Both phenomena
involve aversive stimuli, but negative reinforcement makes a behavioral
response more likely, while punishment makes it less likely. In the
context of behavior, positive means adding something to the learn­ ing
environment and negative means taking something away. Reinforcement
means increasing the likelihood of a behavior occurring in the future,
and punishment means decreasing the likelihood of a behavior occurring
in the fu­ ture. (See Table 19.3.) Negative reinforcement could explain
the acquisition of chronic drug use under some conditions. If a stressed
person is suffering from some unpleasant feelings and then takes a drug
that eliminates these feelings, the person's drug-taking behavior is
likely to be reinforced. For exam­ ple, alcohol can relieve feelings of
anxiety. A person who finds him- or herself in a situation that arouses
anxiety might find that having a drink or two makes them feel much
better. In fact, people often anticipate this effect and begin drinking
before the situation actually occurs. PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE People who
abuse a drug of­ ten become physically dependent on the drug; that is,
they show tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. As we saw in

Chapter 4, tolerance is the decreased sensitivity to a drug that comes
from its continued use; the user must take larger and larger amounts of
the drug for it to be effective. Once a person has taken a drug
regularly enough to develop toler­ ance, that person will generally
exhibit withdrawal symp­ toms if they stop taking the drug. Withdrawal
symptoms are primarily the opposite of the effects of the drug itself.
For example, the effects of heroin---euphoria, constipation, and
relaxation---lead to the withdrawal effects of dysphoria, diarrhea, and
agitation. Tolerance Most investigators believe that tolerance is
produced by the body's attempt to compensate for the un­ usual condition
of repeated presence of a drug in the body. The drug disturbs normal
homeostatic mechanisms in the brain, and in reaction these mechanisms
begins to produce effects opposite to those of the drug, partially
compensating for the disturbance. Because of these compensatory mecha­
nisms, the user must take increasing amounts of the drug to achieve the
effects that were produced when they first started taking the drug.
These mechanisms also account for the symptoms of withdrawal: When the
person stops taking the drug, the compensatory mechanisms make
themselves felt, unopposed by the action of the drug. Withdrawal
Although positive reinforcement seems to be what provokes drug taking in
the first place, reduction of withdrawal effects could certainly play a
role in main­ taining someone's pattern of repeated drug use. The with­
drawal effects are unpleasant, but as soon as the person takes some of
the drug, these effects go away, producing negative reinforcement and
contributing to continued use of the drug.

Why do people crave drugs? Why does crav­ ing occur even after a long
period of abstinence? Even after going for months or years without
taking a drug, a person who previously abused a drug might sometimes
experience intense craving that leads to relapse. Taking a drug over an
extended period of time must produce some long-lasting changes in the
brain that increase a person's likelihood of relapsing. Understanding
this process might help clinicians to devise therapies that will assist
people in reducing their drug dependence. CRAVING

RELAPSE One of the ways in which craving has been in­ vestigated in
laboratory animals is through the reinstatement model of drug seeking.
Animals are first trained to make a response (for example, pressing a
lever) that is reinforced by intravenous injections of a drug such as
cocaine. Next, the response is extinguished by providing injections of a
saline solution rather than the drug. Once the animal has stopped
responding, the experimenter administers a "free" injection of the drug
(drug reinstatement procedure) or presents a stimulus that has been
associated with the drug (cue rein­ statement procedure). In response to
these stimuli, the ani­ mals begin responding at the lever once more
(Kalivas et al., 2006). Presumably, this kind of relapse (reinstatement
of a previously extinguished response) is a good model for the craving
that motivates drug-seeking behavior in a person who has chronically
used the drug. (See Figure 19.7.)

Extinction To understand the process of reinstatement (and the craving
that underlies it), let's first consider what happens during extinction.
As we saw in Chapter 11, ex­ tinction is a form of learning. An animal
does not forget to make a particular response; it learns not to make it.
The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) plays a critical role in this
process. For example, lesions of the vmPFC impair the extinction of a
conditioned emotional re­ sponse, that stimulation of this region
inhibits conditioned emotional responses, and that extinction training
activates neurons located there. Studies with rats indicate that
different regions of the prefrontal cortex exert facilitatory and
inhibitory effects on drug-related responding by means of excitatory and
inhibitory connections with the brain's reinforcement sys­ tem. These
effects appear to be responsible for extinction

The graph shows the acquisition of lever pressing for injections of a
reinforcing drug during the self-administration phase and the extinction

shot of the drug or presentation of a cue associated with the drug
during acquisition will reinstate responding. Source: Based on data from

A taste of food can provoke hunger, which is why we refer to tidbits we
eat before a meal as "appetizers." For a person with a history of
substance abuse, a small dose of the drug has similar effects: It
increases craving, or "appetite," for the drug. In addition, through the
process of classical conditioning, stimuli that have been associated
with drugs in the past can also elicit craving. For example, someone who
is physically dependent on alcohol and sees a liquor bottle is likely to
feel the urge to take a drink. In the past, agencies that sponsored
anti-drug programs sometimes prepared posters illustrating the dangers
of substance abuse that featured drug paraphernalia: syringes, needles,
piles of white powder, and so on. Possibly, these posters did succeed in
reminding people who did not use drugs that they should avoid them. But
we do know that their effect on people who were trying not to use drugs
was ex­ actly the opposite of what was intended. As we saw in the case at
the beginning of this chapter, John saw a poster that pictured drug
paraphernalia, and this sight provoked an urge to take the drug again.
For this reason, this strategy is no longer recommended in campaigns
against drug abuse.

and reinstatement. Peters and colleagues (2008) found that stimulation
of the vmPFC with an infusion of AMPA, a glutamate agonist, blocked
reinstatement of responding normally produced by a free shot of cocaine
or the presen­ tation of a stimulus associated with cocaine
reinforcement. That is, activation of the vmPFC inhibited responding.
McFarland and colleagues (2003) found that reinstatement of lever
pressing for infusions of cocaine was abolished by injecting a GABA
agonist into the dorsal anterior cin­ gulate cortex (dACC), a region of
the dorsal PFC that has excitatory connections with the NAC. Inhibiting
the dACC prevented the reinstatement of the response. These results
indicate that the dACC plays a role in craving and the vmPFC plays a
role in its suppression. Volkow and colleagues (1992) found that during
ab­ stinence, the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex of people who
abused cocaine was lower than that of noncocaine-using participants. In
addition, when people who use cocaine are performing tasks that normally
activate the prefrontal cortex, their medial prefrontal cortex is less
activated than that of control participants, and they per­ form more
poorly on the tasks (Bolla et al., 2004; Garavan & Stout, 2005). In
fact, Bolla and colleagues found that the amount of activation of the
medial prefrontal cortex was inversely related to the amount of cocaine
that the people normally took each week: The lower the brain activity,
the more cocaine the person took. (See Figure 19.8.) Stress As we have
just seen, the presence of drug-related stimuli can trigger craving and
drug-seeking behavior. In addition, clinicians have long observed that

situations can cause relapse. These effects have been ob­ served in rats
that had previously learned to self-administer cocaine or heroin. For
example, Covington and Miczek (2001) paired naïve rats with rats that
had been trained to be­ come dominant. After being defeated by the
dominant rats, the socially stressed rats became more sensitive to the
ef­ fects of cocaine and showed bingeing---self-administration of larger
amounts of the drug. Kosten and colleagues (2000) showed that stress
that occurs early in life can have longlasting effects on drug-taking
behavior. They stressed infant rats by isolating them from their mother
and littermates for 1 hour per day for 8 days. When these rats were
given the

opportunity in adulthood to access cocaine, they readily acquired the
habit and took more of the drug than did con­ trol rats that had not been
stressed. (See Figure 19.9.) An important link between stressful
experiences and drug craving is provided by corticotropin-releasing
hormone, or CRH. (This peptide is also referred to as
corticotropinreleasing factor, or CRF.) As we saw in Chapter 18, CRH
plays an important role in development of adverse effects on health
produced by stress and on the development of anxiety disorders. Just as
administration of a drug or exposure to stimuli previously associated
with drug-taking behavior can cause relapse, so can stressful
experiences (Shalev et al., 2010). For example, administration of CRH
can reinstate drug-taking behavior, and administration of a drug that
blocks CRH receptors can reduce the likelihood of relapse from drugs or
drug cues. CRH receptors in the VTA appear to be particularly important.
For example, infusion of CRH into the VTA causes relapse, and infusion
of a CRH receptor antagonist prevents reinstatement of drug-taking by a
stressful stimulus (Wang et al., 2007).

Module Review: Common Features of Substance Abuse Positive Reinforcement
LO 19.1

Describe the neural mechanisms of positive reinforcement that all drugs
of abuse share.

Positive reinforcement occurs when a behavior is regu­ larly followed by
an appetitive stimulus---one that an organism will approach. Drugs of
abuse produce posi­ tive reinforcement; they reinforce drug-taking
behavior. Laboratory animals will learn to make responses that result in
the delivery of these drugs. The faster a drug

M19_CARL0287_13_GE_C19.indd 615

produces its effects, the more quickly physical depen­ dence will be
established. All drugs that produce posi­ tive reinforcement stimulate
the release of dopamine in the NAC, a structure that plays an important
role in reinforcement. Neural changes that begin in the VTA and NAC
eventually involve the dorsal striatum, which plays a critical role in
operant conditioning. Orexin and MCH also play a role in the
establishment of drug-taking behavior. The activity of inhibitory
circuits in the pre­ frontal cortex promotes resistance to substance
abuse.

616 Chapter 19

Negative Reinforcement LO 19.2

Explain how negative reinforcement can contribute to substance abuse
through physical dependence, craving, and relapse.

Negative reinforcement occurs when a behavior is followed by the
reduction or termination of an aver­ sive stimulus and can be responsible
for initiating or maintaining drug use. The reduction of unpleasant
withdrawal symptoms due to physical dependence by a dose of the drug
undoubtedly plays a role in maintaining drug use, but it is not the sole
cause of craving. Craving---the urge to take a drug upon which one has
become physically dependent---cannot be completely explained by
withdrawal symptoms, because it can occur

Genetic Factors Not everyone is equally likely to abuse drugs. Many peo­
ple drink alcohol moderately, and the majority of people who use drugs
such as cocaine and heroin use them with­ out becoming physically
dependent on them. Evidence indicates that both genetic and
environmental factors play a role in determining a person's likelihood
of consum­ ing drugs and of that use escalating to substance abuse. In
addition, there are both general factors (such as likeli­ hood of taking
and abusing any of a number of drugs) and specific factors (such as
likelihood of taking and abusing a particular drug). Tsuang and
colleagues (1998) studied 3,372 pairs of twin brothers to estimate the
genetic contributions to substance abuse. They found strong general
genetic and environmental factors: Abusing any category of drug was
associated with abusing drugs in all other categories: seda­ tives,
stimulants, opiates, marijuana, and psychedelics. Abuse of marijuana was
especially influenced by family environmental factors. Abuse of every
category except psychedelics was influenced by genetic factors specific
to that category. Abuse of heroin had a particularly strong unique
genetic factor. Another study of twin brothers found a strong common
genetic factor for the use of all cat­ egories of drugs and that shared
environmental factors had a stronger effect on use than on abuse
(Kendler et al., 2003). Additional research sampling pairs of
monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, biological siblings, and adoptive
siblings confirmed the important role of genetic factors in problem use
of drugs and alcohol among adolescents (Rhee et al.,

M19_CARL0287_13_GE_C19.indd 616

even after a person has refrained from taking the drug for a long time.
In laboratory animals a "free" shot of cocaine or presentation of
stimuli previously associated with cocaine reinstates drug-seeking
behavior as a model of relapse. The vmPFC plays an inhibitory role in
reinstate­ ment, and the dACC plays a facilitatory role. Long-term
substance abuse is associated with decreased activity of the prefrontal
cortex and decreased volume of prefrontal gray matter, which may impair
people's judgment and ability to inhibit inappropriate responses, such
as fur­ ther drug taking. Stressful stimuli---even those that occur early
in life---increase susceptibility to substance abuse. Release of CRH in
the VTA plays an important role in this process.

2003). In other words, environment plays a strong role in influencing a
person to try a drug and perhaps continue to use it recreationally, but
genetics plays a stronger role in determining whether the person's use
then develops into substance abuse. Goldman and colleagues (2005)
reviewed twin studies hat attempted to measure the heritability of
various types of substance abuse and compulsive behaviors. As you will
see in Figure 19.10, the authors included pathologi­ cal gambling.
Gyollai and colleagues (2014) conducted a review of research on the
genetic contributions specific to problem and pathological gambling. The
authors reported significant hereditary contributions to gambling based
on twin studies and involvement of the dopaminergic and

serotonergic systems based on genetic association studies. While the
following module will explore genetic contri­ butions to abuse of
alcohol, nicotine, and stimulants such as cocaine, research on some
other forms of compulsive behavior suggest similar genetic
contributions.

Alcohol LO 19.3 Describe the role of genetic factors in alcohol abuse.
The genetic basis of alcohol abuse has received more atten­ tion than
abuse of other drugs. Alcohol consumption is not distributed equally
across the population; in the United States, 10 percent of the people
drink 50 percent of the alco­ hol (Heckler, 1983). Many twin and adoption
studies con­ firm that the primary reason for this disparity is genetic.
A susceptibility to alcohol abuse could conceivably be caused by
differences in the ability to digest or metabolize alcohol or by
differences in the structure or biochemistry of the brain. There is
evidence that variability in the genes responsible for the production of
alcohol-metabolizing enzymes play a role in susceptibility to alcohol
abuse. A particular variant of this gene, which is especially preva­ lent
in eastern Asia, is responsible for a reaction to alcohol intake that
most people find aversive and that discourages further drinking (Goldman
et al., 2005). (See Figure 19.11.)

However, most investigators believe that differences in brain
physiology---for example, brain changes that control sensitivity to the
reinforcing effects of drugs or sensitivity to various environmental
stressors---are more likely to play a role. For example, increased
sensitivity to environmental stressors might encourage the use of
alcohol as a means to reduce stress-related anxiety.

Nicotine LO 19.4 Describe the role of genetic factors in nicotine abuse.
Investigators have also focused on the possibility that sus­ ceptibility
to substance abuse may involve differences in functions of specific
neurotransmitter systems. Nicotinic ACh receptors that contain the a5
subunit, found on neu­ rons in the medial habenula, play a role in
inhibiting the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Genetic studies found
that a particular allele of the gene responsible for the production of
this receptor is associated with increased susceptibility to nicotine
abuse and consequent development of lung cancer (Bierut, 2008). A study
by Kuryatov and colleagues (2011) found that the presence of this allele
reduces the sensitivity of the a5 ACh receptors and the inhibitory
effect of large doses of nicotine. The result would be increased
suscepti­ bility to the reinforcing effects of nicotine.

Figure 19.11 Genetic Factors and Alcohol Metabolism (a) There are two
steps in the breakdown of alcohol; inactivity of aldehyde dehydrogenase
results in the accumulation of a toxic intermediate product
(acetaldehyde) that makes people feel ill and avoid alcohol. (b) Each
person has two chromosomes with the gene for aldehyde dehydrogenase. Two
copies (homozygous) of the active form of the gene results in normal
metabolism of alcohol. Two copies of the inactive form of the gene

metabolism. Source: Based on Meyer, J. S., & Quenzer, L. F. (2005).

Stimulants LO 19.5 Describe the role of genetic factors in stimulant
abuse. The heritability of cocaine abuse is thought to explain the
majority of risk for cocaine abuse (reviewed by Pierce et al., 2018).
Renthal and colleagues (2009) performed a genome-wide analysis of the
effects of cocaine on genetic material in the mouse DNA. They found that
cocaine turned on hundreds of genes, many of which were al­ ready known
to be involved in the behavioral effects of the drug. One of their most
interesting discoveries was that cocaine turns on the genes that produce
sirtuins,

proteins that play important regulatory roles in cells. They also found
that a sirtuin agonist increased the reinforcing effects of cocaine and
that a sirtuin antagonist decreased it. As other investigators have
noted, their approach holds promise for discovering the molecular
biology of drugs of abuse and identifying potential treatments for
people who abuse them. Other research has focused on epigenetic changes
as­ sociated with cocaine abuse. Cocaine abuse may produce epigenetic
changes in gene expression that can be trans­ mitted to offspring. The
mechanisms of these changes also provide possible intervention targets
for treating cocaine abuse (Pierce et al., 2018).

Module Review: Genetic Factors Alcohol LO 19.3

Stimulants Describe the role of genetic factors in alcohol abuse.

While both environmental and genetic factors influence the likelihood of
developing substance abuse disorders, twin studies support a specific
genetic contribution to maintaining substance use. Some individual genes
have been shown to affect abuse of particular drugs. For example,
variations in the genes for aldehyde dehydro­ genase play a role in
susceptibility to alcohol abuse.

Nicotine LO 19.4

Describe the role of genetic factors in nicotine abuse.

LO 19.5

Describe the role of genetic factors in stimulant abuse.

Genes that produce sirtuins modify responsiveness to the abuse potential
of cocaine. Cocaine abuse may produce epigenetic changes that can be
trans­mitted to offspring.

Thought Question Can you think of any genetic factors besides the ones
de­ scribed in the previous module that might affect a per­ son's
susceptibility to drug abuse? For example, what kinds of individual
differences might affect the likelihood that a person tries a drug,
likes the effects of the drug, and does not go on to use a drug
repeatedly?

Variations in the gene for the a5 ACh receptor affect the likelihood of
nicotine abuse.

Brain Mechanisms Associated with Commonly Abused Drugs People abuse an
enormous variety of drugs, including alcohol, barbiturates, opiates,
tobacco, amphetamine, cocaine, cannabis, designer drugs, hallucinogens
such as LSD and PCP, and volatile solvents such as glues, gasoline,
ether, and nitrous oxide. We will restrict our discussion to the most
important of these drugs in terms of popu­ larity and potential for
abuse. Some drugs, such as caf­ feine, are both popular and reinforcing,
but because they do not normally cause intoxication, impair health, or
in­ terfere with productivity, they will not be discussed here.

M19_CARL0287_13_GE_C19.indd 618

(Chapter 4 does discuss the behavioral effects and site of action of
caffeine.) This chapter will not include informa­ tion about the wide
variety of hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD or PCP. Although some people
enjoy the effects of hallucinogens, other people find them frightening,
and LSD use does not normally lead to abuse. Animals do not readily
self-administer hallucinogens, and there is little evidence of physical
dependence, even with repeated use. PCP (phencyclidine) acts as an
indirect antagonist at the NMDA receptor, which means that its effects
overlap with those of alcohol. Rather than including a separate section
on this drug, we have chosen to say more about alcohol, which is abused
far more than any of the hallucinogenic drugs. This module will describe
some of the effects and brain-based mechanisms associated with the abuse
of opiates, stimulants, nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis.

Substance Abuse 619

Opiates LO 19.6 Describe roles of reinforcement and physical dependence
in opiate abuse. Opium, derived from the opium poppy, has been eaten and
smoked for centuries. Many prescription pain reliev­ ers (such as
OxyContin, described in the case study at the beginning of this chapter)
contain synthetic opiates, and many designer drugs are synthetic opiates
(such as the failed batch created in the case study at the beginning of
Chapter 5). Opiate abuse has several high personal and social costs. Not
only is opiate abuse (of either illicit forms such as heroin, or misuse
of prescription drugs) il­ legal, but due to tolerance, a person must
take increasing amounts of the drug to achieve a "high." The habit be­
comes more and more expensive, and some people may re­ sort to crime to
obtain enough money to support escalating use of the drug. Many opiates
can be taken intravenously using needles; and at present, a substantial
percentage of people who inject drugs such as heroin have been exposed
to hepatitis or HIV via contaminated syringes. If a preg­ nant woman
becomes physically dependent on opiates, the fetus will also become
dependent on the drug, which eas­ ily crosses the placental barrier. A
newborn must be given opiates immediately after birth and then weaned
off the drug with gradually decreasing doses to prevent or reduce
withdrawal symptoms. The uncertainty about the strength of a given batch
of synthetic opiates makes it possible for DESCRIPTION

a user to receive an unusually large dose of the drug, with possibly
fatal consequences. And some of the substances sometimes used to dilute
opiates are themselves toxic. REINFORCEMENT As we saw earlier,
laboratory ani­ mals will self-administer opiates. When an opiate is
admin­ istered systemically, it stimulates opiate receptors located on
neurons in various parts of the brain and produces a variety of effects,
including analgesia, hypothermia (low­ ering of body temperature),
sedation, and reinforcement. Opiate receptors in the periaqueductal gray
matter are pri­ marily responsible for the analgesia, those in the
preoptic area are responsible for the hypothermia, and those in the
mesencephalic reticular formation are responsible for the sedation. As
we shall see, opiate receptors in the VTA and the NAC appear to play a
role in the reinforcing effects of opiates. (See Figure 19.12.) As we
saw in Chapter 4, there are three major types of opiate receptors: µ
(mu), d (delta), and κ(kappa). Evidence suggests that µ receptors and d
receptors are responsible for reinforcement and analgesia and that
stimulation of κ receptors produces aversive effects. Evidence for the
role of µ receptors comes from a study by Matthes and col­ leagues
(1996), who performed a targeted mutation against the gene responsible
for production of the µ opiate recep­ tor in mice. These animals, when
they grew up, were com­ pletely insensitive to the reinforcing or
analgesic effects of morphine, and they showed no signs of withdrawal
symp­ toms after having been given increasing doses of morphine for 6
days. (See Figure 19.13.)

Figure 19.12 Opiate Effects Opiate receptors in the nucleus accumbens
and ventral tegmental area are involved in reinforcing effects of
opiates. Receptors in the preoptic area are involved in hypothermia.
Receptors in the periaqueductal gray matter are primarily responsible
for analgesia, and receptors in the reticular formation are responsible
for sedation.

found that the level of dopamine in the NAC increased by 150--300
percent while a rat was pressing a lever that deliv­ ered intravenous
injections of heroin. Rats will also press a lever that delivers
injections of an opiate directly into the VTA (Devine & Wise, 1994) or
the NAC (Goeders et al., 1984). In other words, injections of opiates
into both ends of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system are reinforcing.
The release of endogenous opioids may even play a role in the
reinforcing effects of some drugs. Studies have shown that
administration of naloxone (a drug that blocks opiate receptors) reduces
the reinforcing effects of alcohol in both humans and laboratory
animals. In fact, the use of opiate blockers is an approved treatment
for alcohol abuse. PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE Several studies have investi­
gated the neural systems that are responsible for the devel­ opment of
tolerance and subsequent withdrawal effects of opiates. Maldonado and
colleagues (1992) made rats physi­ cally dependent on morphine and then
injected naloxone into various regions of the brain to determine whether
the sudden blocking of opiate receptors would stimulate symptoms of
withdrawal. This technique---administering a drug of abuse for a
prolonged interval and then blocking its effects with an antagonist---is
referred to as antagonist-precipitated withdrawal. The investigators
found that the most sensitive site was the locus coeruleus, followed by
the periaqueductal gray matter. Injection of naloxone into the amygdala
produced a weak withdrawal syndrome. Using a similar technique (first
infusing morphine into various regions of the brain and then
precipitating withdrawal by giving the animals an injection of
naloxone), Bozarth (1994) confirmed the role of the locus coeruleus and
the periaqueductal gray matter in the produc­ tion of withdrawal
symptoms. A single dose of an opiate de­ creases the firing rate of
neurons in the locus coeruleus, but if the drug is administered
chronically, the firing rate will re­ turn to normal. Then, if an opiate
antagonist is administered (to precipitate withdrawal symptoms), the
firing rate of these neurons increases dramatically, which increases the
release of norepinephrine in the regions that receive projections from
this nucleus (Koob, 1996; Nestler, 1996). In addition, lesions of the
locus coeruleus reduce the severity of antagonistprecipitated withdrawal
symptoms (Maldonado & Koob, 1993). A microdialysis study by Aghajanian
and colleagues (1994) found that antagonist-precipitated withdrawal
caused an increase in the level of glutamate, the major excitatory
neurotransmitter, in the locus coeruleus.

LO 19.7 Describe the role of reinforcement in stimulant abuse. Cocaine
and amphetamine have similar behavioral effects, because both act as
potent dopamine agonists. However, their sites of action are different.
Cocaine binds with and

deactivates the dopamine transporter proteins, blocking the reuptake of
dopamine after it is released by the terminal but­ tons. Amphetamine also
inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, but its most important effect is to
directly stimulate the re­ lease of dopamine from terminal buttons.
Methamphetamine is chemically related to amphetamine but is considerably
more potent. Freebase cocaine (or crack cocaine), a particularly potent
form of the drug, is smoked and enters the blood supply of the lungs and
reaches the brain very quickly. Because its effects are so potent and so
rapid, it is probably the most effective reinforcer of all available
drugs. DESCRIPTION When people take cocaine, they become euphoric,
active, and talkative. They say that they feel powerful and alert. When
people abuse the drug, obtain­ ing it becomes an obsession to which they
devote more and more time and money. Laboratory animals, which will
quickly learn to self-administer cocaine intravenously, also act excited
and show intense exploratory activity. Af­ ter receiving the drug for a
day or two, rats start showing stereotyped movements, such as grooming,
head bobbing, and persistent locomotion (Geary, 1987). One of the
alarming effects of cocaine and amphet­ amine seen in people who abuse
these drugs regularly is psychotic behavior: hallucinations, delusions
of persecu­ tion, mood disturbances, and repetitive behaviors. These
symptoms so closely resemble positive symptoms of schizophrenia that
even a trained mental health profes­ sional cannot distinguish them
unless he or she knows about the person's history of substance abuse.
However, these symptoms decrease when people stop taking the drug. As we
saw in Chapter 17, the fact that these symp­ toms are provoked by
dopamine agonists and reduced by drugs that block dopamine receptors
suggests that overac­ tivity of dopaminergic synapses is responsible for
the posi­ tive symptoms of schizophrenia. Some evidence suggests that the
use of stimulant drugs may have adverse long-term effects on the brain.
For exam­ ple, in a PET study, McCann and colleagues (1998) discov­ ered
that people with a history of methamphetamine abuse showed a decrease in
the numbers of dopamine transport­ ers in the caudate nucleus and
putamen, despite the fact that they had abstained from the drug for
approximately 3 years. The decreased number of dopamine transporters
suggests that the number of dopaminergic terminals in these regions is
diminished. As the authors noted, these people might have an increased
risk of Parkinson's disease as they get older. (See Figure 19.14.)
Studies with labora­ tory animals have also found that methamphetamine
can damage terminals of serotonergic axons and trigger death of neurons
through apoptosis in the cerebral cortex, stria­ tum, and hippocampus
(Cadet et al., 2003). REINFORCEMENT If rats or monkeys are given continu­

cocaine, they can self-inject so much cocaine that they die. As a
result, researchers who study this drug must limit animals' access to
the drug. As we have seen, the mesolim­ bic dopamine system plays an
essential role in all forms of reinforcement, except perhaps for the
reinforcement that is mediated by direct stimulation of opiate
receptors. Many studies have shown that intravenous injections of
cocaine and amphetamine increase the concentration of dopamine in the
NAC, as measured by microdialysis. For example, Figure 19.15 shows data
collected by Di Ciano and col­ leagues (1995) in a study with rats that
learned to press a lever that delivered intravenous injections of
cocaine or amphetamine. The colored bars at the base of the graphs
indicate the animals' responses, and the line graphs indi­ cate the level
of dopamine in the NAC.

Nicotine LO 19.8 Describe the roles of reinforcement and physical
dependence in nicotine abuse. Although its use is common, nicotine is a
drug of abuse, and it accounts for more deaths than the other drugs de­
scribed so far in this chapter. DESCRIPTION The combination of nicotine
and other substances in tobacco smoke is carcinogenic and leads to
cancer of the lungs, mouth, throat, and esophagus. Ap­ proximately
one-third of the adult population of the world smokes, and smoking is
one of the few causes of death that is rising in developing countries.
The World Health Orga­ nization estimates that 50 percent of the people
who begin to smoke as adolescents and continue smoking through­ out their
lives will die from smoking-related diseases.

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in developed
countries (Dani & Harris, 2005). In the United States alone, tobacco
abuse kills more than 430,000 people each year (Chou & Narasimhan,
2005). Worldwide, stroke is the second leading cause of death and lung
cancer is the fifth (Lozano et al., 2013). Both of these causes of death
are negatively influenced by smoking. Smoking by preg­ nant women also
has negative effects on the health of their fetuses---potentially worse
than those of cocaine (Slotkin, 1998). Increased use of electronic
cigarettes and devices

M19_CARL0287_13_GE_C19.indd 622

to vaporize nicotine (vaping) presents new challenges to understanding
nicotine abuse (Chapman et al., 2014). While these routes of
administration reduce exposure to the harmful substances in combustible
cigarettes, their use is also associated with negative effects to the
respira­ tory, digestive, and nervous systems (Chen, 2013; Hua et al.,
2013). The abuse potential of nicotine should not be underes­ timated;
many people continue to smoke even when doing so causes serious health
problems. For example, Sigmund Freud, whose theory of psychoanalysis
stressed the impor­ tance of insight in changing one's behavior, was
unable to stop smoking even after most of his jaw had been removed
because of the cancer that this habit had caused (Brecher, 1972). He
suffered severe pain and, as a physician, realized that he should have
stopped smoking. He did not, and can­ cer finally killed him.
REINFORCEMENT Nicotine has a very high abuse po­ tential. In a review of
the literature, Stolerman and Jarvis (1995) note that smokers tend to
smoke regularly or not at all; few can smoke just a little. Nineteen out
of 20 smokers smoke every day, and only 60 out of 3,500 smokers ques­
tioned smoke fewer than five cigarettes per day. Forty per­ cent of
people continue to smoke after having their larynx removed (which is
usually performed to treat throat can­ cer). More than 50 percent of
heart attack survivors con­ tinue to smoke, and about 50 percent of
people continue to smoke after surgery for lung cancer. Of those who
attempt to quit smoking by enrolling in a special program, 20 percent
manage to abstain for 1 year. The record is much poorer for those who
try to quit on their own: One-third manage to stop for 1 day, one-fourth
abstain for 1 week, but only 4 percent manage to abstain for 6 months.
Ours is not the only species willing to self-administer nicotine; so
will laboratory animals (Donny et al., 1995). Nicotine stimulates
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It also increases the activity of
dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic system (Mereu et al., 1987) and
causes dopa­ mine to be released in the NAC (Damsma et al., 1989). Figure
19.16 demonstrates the effects of two injections of nicotine or saline
on the extracellular dopamine level of the NAC, measured by
microdialysis. Injection of a nicotinic agonist directly into the VTA
will reinforce a conditioned place preference (Museo & Wise, 1994).
Conversely, injection of a nicotinic antagonist into the VTA will block
the ability of nicotine to cause the release of dopamine in the nucleus
accumbens and reduce the reinforcing effect of intravenous injections of
nicotine (Corrigall et al., 1994; Gotti et al., 2010). But although nic­
otinic receptors are found in both the VTA and the NAC, Corrigall and
colleagues found that injections of a nicotinic antagonist in the NAC
have no effect on reinforcement. Consistent with these findings, Nisell
and colleagues (1994)

found that infusion of a nicotinic antagonist into the VTA will prevent
an intravenous injection of nicotine from trig­ gering the release of
dopamine in the NAC. Infusion of the antagonist into the NAC will not
have this effect. The rein­ forcing effect of nicotine appears to be
caused by activation of nicotinic receptors in the VTA. Researchers have
discovered a pathway in the brain that inhibits the reinforcing effects
of nicotine. Neurons in the medial habenula, a region of the midbrain,
contain a special type of nicotinic ACh receptor that includes an a5
subunit. The neurons that contain these receptors send their axons to
the interpeduncular nucleus, located in the midline of the midbrain,
caudal to the medial habenula. This pathway appears to be part of a
system that inhibits the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Fowler and
colleagues (2011) prepared a targeted mutation against the gene
responsible for synthesis of a5 ACh receptors in the me­ dial habenula of
mice. They found that the knockout increased self-administration of high
doses of nicotine. They also found that the procedure decreased the
ability of nicotine to activate the interpeduncular nucleus, and that
disruption of activity in this nucleus increased nicotine
self-administration. The medial habenula-interpeduncular nucleus circuit
appears to protect the animals (and presum­ ably, our own species)
against intake of large quantities of nicotine. A control mouse will
increase its response rate when the amount of nicotine contained in each
injection increases---up to a point, that is. Eventually, larger injec­
tions will suppress the animal's response rate so that it will not
receive too much nicotine. But if a5 ACh receptors in the habenula are
deactivated, this inhibitory effect does not occur. (See Figure 19.17.)

Role of Cannabinoid Receptors Studies have found that the endogenous
cannabinoids play a role in the reinforcing effects of nicotine.
Rimonabant, a drug that blocks cannabinoid CB1 receptors, reduces
nicotine self-administration and nicotine-seeking behavior in rats
(Cohen et al., 2005), apparently by reducing the release of dopamine in
the NAC (De Vries & Schof­ felmeer, 2005). By blocking CB1 receptors,
rimonabant decreases the reinforcing effects of nicotine. As we saw in
Chapter 12, rimonabant was used for antiobesity therapy for a short time
but was withdrawn from the market because of dangerous side effects.
Clinical tri­ als have found that rimonabant appears to help prevent
relapse in people who are trying to quit smoking, but it is not approved
for this purpose, either. However, the effects of the drug in humans and
laboratory animals suggest that craving for nicotine, like the craving
for food, is enhanced by the release of endocannabinoids in the brain.
PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE The nicotinic ACh receptor exists in three states.
When a burst of ACh is released by an acetylcholinergic terminal button,
the receptors open briefly, permitting the entry of calcium. (Most nico­
tinic receptors serve as heteroreceptors on terminal but­ tons that
release another neurotransmitter. The entry of calcium stimulates the
release of that neurotransmit­ ter.) Within a few milliseconds, the
enzyme AChE has destroyed the acetylcholine, and the receptors either
close again or enter a desensitized state, during which they bind with,
but do not react to, ACh. Normally, few

27/11/21 10:57 AM

624 Chapter 19 nicotinic receptors enter the desensitized state.
However, when a person smokes, the level of nicotine in the brain rises
slowly and stays steady for a prolonged period be­ cause nicotine, unlike
ACh, is not destroyed by AChE. At first, nicotinic receptors are
activated, but the sustained low levels of the drug convert many
nicotinic receptors to the desensitized state. Nicotine has dual effects
on nicotinic receptors: activation and then desensitization. In
addition, probably in response to desensitization, with repeated use of
the drug the number of nicotinic recep­ tors increases (Dani & De Biasi,
2001). Many smokers report that their first cigarette in the morning
brings the most pleasure, presumably because the period of abstinence
during the night has allowed many of their nicotinic receptors to enter
the closed state and become sensitized again. The first dose of nicotine
in the morning activates these receptors and has a reinforc­ ing effect.
After that, a large proportion of the smoker's nicotinic receptors
become desensitized again; as a conse­ quence, most smokers say that they
smoke less for plea­ sure than to relax and gain relief from nervousness
and craving. If smokers abstain for a few weeks, the number of nicotinic
receptors in their brains returns to normal. However, as the high rate
of relapse indicates, craving continues, which means that other changes
in the brain must have occurred. Cessation of smoking after long-term
use causes with­ drawal symptoms, including anxiety, restlessness, insom­
nia, and inability to concentrate (Hughes et al., 1989). Like the
withdrawal symptoms of other drugs, these symptoms may increase the
likelihood of relapse, but they do not ex­ plain why people become
dependent to the drug in the first place. The case of patient N.
demonstrates an unusual exception to this phenomenon.

Patient N. is a \[38-year-old man who\] started smoking at the age of
14. At the time of his stroke, he was smoking more than 40 unfiltered
cigarettes per day and was enjoying smoking very much. . . . \[H\]e used
to experience frequent urges to smoke, especially upon waking, after
eating, when he drank coffee or alcohol, and when he was around other
people who were smoking. He often found it difficult to refrain from
smoking in situations where it was inappropriate, e.g., at work or when
he was sick. He was aware of the health risks of smoking before his
stroke but was not particularly concerned about those risks. Before his
stroke, he had never tried to stop smoking, and he had had no intention
of doing so. N. smoked his last cigarette on the evening before his
stroke. When asked about his reason for quitting smoking, he stated
simply, "I forgot that I was a smoker." When asked to elaborate, he said
that he did not forget the fact that he was a smoker but rather that "my
body forgot the urge to smoke." He felt no urge to smoke during his
hospital stay,

M19_CARL0287_13_GE_C19.indd 624

As Naqvi and colleagues (2007) report, patient N. sus­ tained a stroke
that damaged his insula. In fact, several other patients with insular
damage had the same experi­ ence. Naqvi and colleagues identified 19
cigarette smok­ ers with damage to the insula and 50 smokers with brain
damage that spared this region. Of the 19 patients who had damage to the
insula, 12 "quit smoking easily, immedi­ ately, without relapse, and
without persistence of the urge to smoke" (Naqvi et al., 2007, p. 531).
One patient with in­ sula damage quit smoking but still reported feeling
an urge to smoke. Figure 19.18 shows computer-generated images

even though he had the opportunity to go outside to smoke. His wife was
surprised by the fact that he did not want to smoke in the hospital,
given the degree of his prior craving. N. recalled how his roommate in
the hospital would frequently go outside to smoke and that he was so
disgusted by the smell upon his roommate's return that he asked to
change rooms. He volunteered that smoking in his dreams, which used to
be pleasurable before his stroke, was now disgusting. N. stated that,
although he ultimately came to believe that his stroke was caused in
some way by smoking, suffering a stroke was not the reason why he quit.
In fact, he did not recall ever making any effort to stop smoking.
Instead, it seemed to him that he had spontaneously lost all interest in
smoking. When asked whether his stroke might have destroyed some part of
his brain . . . that made him want to smoke, he agreed that this was
likely to have been the case (Naqvi et al., 2007, p. 534).

of brain damage that showed a statistically significant cor­ relation
with disruption of smoking. As you can see, the in­ sula, which is
colored red, showed the highest association with cessation of smoking.
Other studies have corroborated the report by Naqvi and colleagues
(Hefzy et al., 2011). In addition, Forget and colleagues (2010) found
that infusion of an inhibitory drug into the insula of rats reduced the
re­ inforcing effects of nicotine. (See Figure 19.19.) Zhang and
colleagues (2011) found decreased gray matter in the frontal cortex of
smokers, which may be at least partly responsible for the difficulty
that smokers have in breaking their habit. These investigators also
found that the insula was larger in smokers, which is consis­ tent with
the apparent role of the insula in nicotine addiction. One of the
several deterrents to cessation of smok­ ing is the fact that overeating
and weight gain frequently occur when people stop smoking. As mentioned
earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 12, eating and a reduction in
metabolic rate are stimulated by the release of MCH and orexin in the
brain. Jo and colleagues (2005) found that nicotine inhibits MCH
neurons, suppressing appe­ tite. When people try to quit smoking, they
are often dis­ couraged by the fact that the absence of nicotine in their
brains releases their MCH neurons from this inhibition, increasing their
appetite. Nicotine also stimulates the release of orexin, which, as we
saw earlier in this chapter, is involved in drug-seeking behavior (Huang
et al., 2011).

Figure 19.19 Effects of Inactivation of the Insula on Reinstatement of
Drug-Seeking Behavior in Rats

behavior was extinguished. The graph shows that inactivation of the

Orexin is released in many parts of the brain, but one re­ gion may play
an especially important role in smoking: the insula. Hollander and
colleagues (2008) found that infusion of a drug into the insula that
blocks orexin re­ ceptors decreased the responding of rats for injections
of nicotine.

Alcohol LO 19.9 Describe the roles of reinforcement and physical
dependence in alcohol abuse. Alcohol has enormous costs to society. A
large percentage of deaths and injuries caused by motor vehicle
accidents are related to alcohol use, and alcohol contributes to vio­
lence and aggression. People who abuse alcohol may lose their jobs,
their homes, and their families; many die of cir­ rhosis of the liver,
exposure, or diseases caused by poor living conditions and injury or
neglect of their bodies. Understanding the physiological and behavioral
effects of this drug is an important issue. At low doses, alcohol
produces mild eu­ phoria and has an anxiolytic effect---that is, it
reduces the discomfort of anxiety. At higher doses, it produces incoor­
dination and sedation. In studies with laboratory animals, the
anxiolytic effects manifest themselves as a release from the punishing
effects of aversive stimuli. For example, if an animal is given electric
shocks whenever it makes a partic­ ular response (say, one that obtains
food or water), it will stop doing so. However, if it is then given some
alcohol, it will begin making the response again (Koob et al., 1984).
This phenomenon explains why people often do things they normally would
not when they have had too much to drink; the alcohol removes the
inhibitory effect of social controls on their behavior. Alcohol has two
major sites of action in the nervous system, acting as an indirect
antagonist at NMDA receptors and as an indirect agonist at GABAA
receptors (Chandler et al., 1998). That is, alcohol enhances the action
of GABA at GABAA receptors and interferes with the transmission of
glutamate at NMDA receptors. (See Figure 19.20.) As we saw in Chapter
13, NMDA receptors are in­ volved in long-term potentiation, a phenomenon
that plays an important role in learning. Alcohol, which antago­ nizes
the action of glutamate at NMDA receptors, disrupts long-term
potentiation and interferes with the spatial re­ ceptive fields of place
cells in the hippocampus (Givens & McMahon, 1995; Matthews et al.,
1996). Presumably, this effect at least partly accounts for the
deleterious effects of alcohol on memory and other cognitive functions.
The second site of action of alcohol is the GABAA receptor. Alcohol
binds with one of the many binding sites on this receptor and increases
the effectiveness of GABA in opening the chloride channel and producing

inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Proctor and col­ leagues (1992)
recorded the activity of single neurons in the cerebral cortex of slices
of rat brains. They found that the presence of alcohol significantly
increased the post­ synaptic response produced by the action of GABA at
the GABAA receptor. As we saw in Chapter 4, the anxiolytic effect of the
benzodiazepines is caused by their action as indirect agonists at the
GABAA receptor. Because alcohol has this effect also, we can surmise
that the anxiolytic ef­ fect of alcohol is a result of this action of the
drug. The sedative effect of alcohol also appears to be exerted at the
GABAA receptor. Suzdak and colleagues (1986) discov­ ered a drug
(Ro15-4513) that reverses alcohol intoxica­ tion by blocking the alcohol
binding site on this receptor. Although the behavioral effects of
alcohol are mediated by their action on GABAA receptors and NMDA recep­
tors, high doses of alcohol have other, potentially fatal effects on all
cells of the body, including destabilization of cell membranes. As you
have read previously, prenatal exposure to alcohol can have effects on
the developing nervous system. Ikonomidou and colleagues (2000) found
that exposure of the immature rat brain to alcohol triggered widespread
cell death through apoptosis. The investiga­ tors exposed immature rats
to alcohol at different times during the period of brain growth and
found that differ­ ent regions were vulnerable to the effects of the
alcohol at different times. Apparently, both of alcohol's actions at
GABA and glutamate receptors trigger apoptosis. To con­ firm this
mechanism, Ikonomidou and colleagues found that administration of a
GABAA agonist (phenobarbital, a barbiturate) or an NMDA antagonist
(MK-801) to 7-dayold rats caused brain damage by means of apoptosis.

REINFORCEMENT Alcohol produces both positive and negative reinforcement.
The positive reinforcement mani­ fests itself as mild euphoria. As we saw
earlier, negative reinforcement is caused by the termination of an
aversive stimulus. If a person feels anxious and uncomfortable, then an
anxiolytic drug that relieves this discomfort provides at least a
temporary escape from an unpleasant situation. The negative
reinforcement provided by the anxio­ lytic effect of alcohol is probably
not enough to explain the drug's abuse potential. Other drugs, such as
the ben­ zodiazepines (for example, Valium or Ativan), are even more
potent anxiolytics than alcohol, yet such drugs are abused less often.
It is probably the unique combination

Substance Abuse 627

Withdrawal from long-term alcohol intake (like that of heroin, cocaine,
amphetamine, and nicotine) decreases the activity of mesolimbic neu­ rons
and their release of dopamine in the NAC (Diana et al., 1993). If an
indirect antagonist for NMDA receptors is then administered, dopamine
secretion in the NAC re­ covers. The evidence suggests the following
sequence of events: Some of the acute effects of a single dose of alco­
hol are caused by the antagonistic effect of the drug on NMDA receptors.
Long-term suppression of NMDA re­ ceptors causes upregulation---a
compensatory increase in the sensitivity of the receptors. Then, when
alcohol intake suddenly ceases, the increased activity of NMDA receptors
inhibits the activity of ventral tegmental neurons and the release of
dopamine in the NAC. PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE

the dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic system and increases the
release of dopamine in the NAC as mea­ sured by microdialysis (Gessa et
al., 1985; Imperato & Di Chiara, 1986). The release of dopamine appears
to be re­ lated to the positive reinforcement that alcohol can produce.
An injection of a dopamine antagonist directly into the NAC decreases
alcohol intake in rats (Samson et al., 1993), as does the injection of a
drug into the VTA that decreases the activity of the dopaminergic
neurons there (Hodge et al., 1993). In a double-blind study, Enggasser
and de Wit (2001) found that haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug that
blocks DA receptors, decreased the amount of alcohol that participants
subsequently drank. Presumably, the drug re­ duced the reinforcing effect
of the alcohol. In addition, in­ dividuals who normally feel stimulated
and euphoric after having a drink reported a reduction in these effects
after taking haloperidol. Opiate receptors appear to be involved in a
reinforce­ ment mechanism that does not directly involve dopami­ nergic
neurons. The reinforcing effect of alcohol is at least partly caused by
its ability to trigger the release of the endogenous opioids. Several
studies have shown that the opiate receptor blockers such as naloxone
block the rein­ forcing effects of alcohol in a variety of species,
includ­ ing rats, monkeys, and humans (Altschuler et al., 1980; Davidson
et al., 1996; Reid, 1996). In addition, endogenous opioids may play a
role in alcohol craving. Heinz and colleagues (2005) found that 1 to 3
weeks of abstinence increased the number of µ opiate receptors in the
NAC. The greater the number of receptors, the more intense the craving
was. Presumably, the increased number of µ re­ ceptors increased the
effects of endogenous opiates on the brain and served as a contributing
factor to the craving for alcohol. (See Figure 19.22.)

Although the effects of opiate withdrawal are often exaggerated, those
produced by barbiturate or alcohol withdrawal are serious and can even
be fatal. The in­ creased sensitivity of NMDA receptors as they rebound
from the suppressive effect of alcohol can trigger sei­ zures that are
considered to be a medical emergency and are usually treated with
benzodiazepines. Confirming the cause of these reactions, Liljequist
(1991) found that seizures caused by alcohol withdrawal could be
prevented by giving mice a drug that blocks NMDA receptors.

LO 19.10 Describe the role of reinforcement in cannabis abuse. Another
drug that people regularly self-administer is d9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
or THC, the psychoactive com­ pound found in marijuana. THC is produced
by the mari­ juana plant, or it can be created synthetically. Synthetic
cannabinoids such as K2 or Spice were implicated in nearly 30,000
emergency room visits in 2010, doubling the number from 2001 (Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2018.). Synthetic
cannabinoids were made illegal in the United States in 2012. The
percentage of Americans responding to a national survey of marijuana use
in their lifetime (45 percent), past year (16 percent), and past month
(10 percent) all increased from 2017 to 2018, with marijuana use making
up the large majority of all illicit drug use in the United States
(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2018). As
you learned in Chapter 4, the site of action of the endogenous
cannabinoids in the brain is the CB1 receptor. The endogenous ligands
for the CB1 recep­ tor, anandamide and 2-AG, are lipids. Administration
of a drug that blocks CB1 receptors abolishes the "high" pro­ duced by
smoking marijuana (Huestis et al., 2001). As we saw in Chapter 4, the
hippocampus contains a large concentration of CB1 receptors. Marijuana
produces memory impairment. Evidence indicates that the drug does so by
disrupting the normal functions of the hippocampus, which plays such an
important role in memory. Pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the
hippocampus release endoge­ nous cannabinoids, which provide a retrograde
signal that inhibits GABAergic neurons that normally inhibit them. In
this way the release of endogenous cannabinoids facilitates the activity
of CA1 pyramidal cells and facilitates longterm potentiation (Kunos &
Batkai, 2001). We might expect that facilitating long-term poten­ tiation
in the hippocampus would enhance its memory functions. However, the
reverse is true; Hampson and Deadwyler (2000) found that the effects of
cannabinoids on a spatial memory task were similar to those produced by
hippocampal lesions. Thus, excessive activation of CB1 re­ ceptors in
field CA1 appears to interfere with normal func­ tioning of the
hippocampal formation. DESCRIPTION

REINFORCEMENT THC, like other drugs that are abused, has a stimulating
effect on dopaminergic neu­ rons. Chen and colleagues (1990) injected
rats with low doses of THC and measured the release of dopamine in the
NAC by means of microdialysis. Sure enough, they found that the
injections caused the release of dopamine. (See Figure 19.23.) Chen and
colleagues (1993) found that local injections of small amounts of THC
into the VTA had no effect on the release of dopamine in the NAC.
However,

injection of THC into the NAC did cause dopamine release there. THC
appears to act directly on dopaminergic termi­ nal buttons---presumably
on presynaptic heteroreceptors, where it increases the release of
dopamine. A variety of laboratory animals, including mice, rats, and
monkeys, will self-administer drugs that stimulate CB1 receptors,
including THC (Maldonado & Rodriguez de Fonseca, 2002). A targeted
mutation that blocks the production of CB1 receptors abolishes the
reinforcing ef­ fect not only of cannabinoids but also of morphine and
heroin (Cossu et al., 2001). This mutation also decreases the
reinforcing effects of alcohol and the acquisition of selfadministration
of cocaine (Houchi et al., 2005; Soria et al., 2005). In addition,
rimonabant, the CB1 receptor antagonist, decreases the reinforcing
effects of nicotine. The primary reinforcing component of marijuana,
THC, is one of approximately 70 different chemicals produced only by the
cannabis plant. Another chemical, cannabidiol (CBD), plays an entirely
different role. Unlike THC, which produces anxiety and psychotic-like
behavior in large doses, CBD has antianxiety and antipsychotic effects.
THC is a par­ tial agonist of cannabinoid receptors, whereas CBD is an
antagonist. Also unlike THC, CBD does not produce psycho­ tropic effects:
It is not reinforcing, and it does not produce a "high." In recent
years, levels of THC in marijuana have in­ creased greatly, while levels
of CBD have decreased. During the past decade, the numbers of people who
seek treatment for cannabis abuse has also increased (Morgan et al.,
2010). Morgan and her colleagues (2010) recruited 94 people who used
marijuana regularly for a study on the effects of THC and CBD. The
investigators measured the concentra­ tion of THC and CBD in a sample of
their marijuana and

customary marijuana with low levels of CBD and high levels of THC paid
more attention to photographs of cannabis-related stimuli and said that
they liked them better than those smoking their customary marijuana with
higher levels of CBD. Both groups gave high ratings to food-related
photographs, so CBD had no effect on their interest in food. (See Figure
19.24.) A study by Ren and colleagues (2009) found that an injection of
CBD reduced heroin-seeking behavior in rats, even up to 2 weeks later,
which indicates that the effects of this drug are not limited to
marijuana. CBD did not affect the animals' intake of her­ oin, but it did
decrease the reinforcing effect of stimuli that had previously been
associated with heroin.

Module Review: Brain Mechanisms Associated with Commonly Abused Drugs
Opiates LO 19.6

Describe roles of reinforcement and physical dependence in opiate abuse.

Opiates produce their effects as agonists at opiate recep­ tors. Opiate
receptors in the periaqueductal gray matter are responsible for the
analgesia, those in the preoptic area for the hypothermia, those in the
mesencephalic re­ ticular formation for the sedation, and those in the
VTA and NAC at least partly for the reinforcement. A targeted mutation
in mice indicates that µ opiate receptors are re­ sponsible for
analgesia, reinforcement, and withdrawal symptoms. The release of the
endogenous opioids may play a role in the reinforcing effects of natural
stimuli or even other drugs such as alcohol. The symptoms that are
produced by antagonist-precipitated withdrawal from opiates can be
elicited by injecting naloxone into the peri­ aqueductal gray matter and
the locus coeruleus, which implicates these structures in these
symptoms.

Stimulants LO 19.7

Describe the role of reinforcement in stimulant abuse.

Cocaine inhibits the reuptake of dopamine by terminal buttons, and
amphetamine causes the dopamine trans­ porters in terminal buttons to run
in reverse, releasing dopamine from terminal buttons. Besides producing

M19_CARL0287_13_GE_C19.indd 629

alertness, activation, and positive reinforcement, cocaine and
amphetamine can produce psychotic symptoms that resemble positive
symptoms of schizophrenia. The rein­ forcing effects of cocaine and
amphetamine are mediated by an increase in dopamine in the NAC. Chronic
meth­ amphetamine abuse is associated with reduced numbers of
dopaminergic axons and terminals in the striatum (revealed as a decrease
in the numbers of dopamine transporters located there).

Nicotine LO 19.8

Describe the roles of reinforcement and physical dependence in nicotine
abuse.

Nicotine does not cause intoxication and is readily available and legal.
The craving for nicotine is ex­ tremely motivating. Nicotine stimulates
the release of DA from mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons, and injec­ tion
of nicotine into the VTA is reinforcing. CB1 recep­ tors are involved in
the reinforcing effect of nicotine as well. Nicotine excites nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors but also desensitizes them, which leads to
withdrawal effects. The activation of nicotinic receptors on presyn­
aptic terminal buttons in the VTA also produces longterm potentiation.
Damage to the insula is associated with cessation of smoking, which
suggests that this re­ gion plays a role in the maintenance of smoking.
Sup­ pression of its activity with inhibitory drugs reduces

27/11/21 10:57 AM

630 Chapter 19

nicotine intake in laboratory animals. Nicotine stimula­ tion of the
release of GABA in the lateral hypothalamus decreases the activity of
MCH neurons and reduces food intake, which explains why cessation of
smoking often leads to weight gain. Infusion of an orexin antagonist in
the insula suppresses nicotine intake. Activity of a circuit from the
medial habenula to the interpeduncular nucleus does the same. This
effect depends on the pres­ ence of neurons with α5 ACh receptors in the
habenula.

Alcohol LO 19.9

Describe the roles of reinforcement and physical dependence in alcohol
abuse.

Alcohol has positively reinforcing effects and, through its anxiolytic
action, has negatively reinforcing effects as well. It serves as an
indirect antagonist at NMDA receptors and as an indirect agonist at GABA
A recep­ tors. It stimulates the release of dopamine in the NAC.
Withdrawal from long-term alcohol abuse can lead to seizures, an effect
that seems to be caused by compensa­ tory upregulation of NMDA receptors.
Release of endog­ enous opioids also plays a role in the reinforcing
effects of alcohol. Increases in the numbers of µ opiate receptors
during abstinence from alcohol may intensify craving.

Treatment for Substance Abuse There are many reasons for engaging in
research on the neu­ roscience of substance abuse, including an academic
interest in the nature of reinforcement and the pharmacology of psy­
choactive drugs. But most researchers hope that the results of their
research will contribute to the development of ways to treat
and---better yet---prevent substance abuse. The in­ cidence of substance
abuse is high and research has not yet solved the problem. However,
progress is being made. A variety of therapeutic interventions have been
developed. When selecting a therapeutic intervention, important
considerations are to determine whether the intervention is supported by
research demonstrating effi­ cacy and to assess the quality and quantity
of the research supporting the treatment. Strategies, such as
contingency management (a form of behavioral intervention using vouchers
or rewards for reduced substance use), cogni­ tive therapies, family
therapies, agonist replacement for opiates and nicotine, and opiate
antagonists for alcohol paired with behavioral interventions, are
supported by research as effective treatments for substance abuse
(Carroll & Onken, 2014; Carroll & Rounsaville, 2014).

M19_CARL0287_13_GE_C19.indd 630

Cannabis LO 19.10 Describe the role of reinforcement in cannabis abuse.
The active ingredient in cannabis, THC, stimulates recep­ tors whose
natural ligand is anandamide. THC, like other drugs of abuse, stimulates
the release of dopamine in the NAC. The CB1 receptor is responsible for
the physiologi­ cal and behavioral effects of THC and the endogenous
cannabinoids. A targeted mutation against the CB1 recep­ tor reduces the
reinforcing effect of alcohol, cocaine, and the opiates as well as that
of the cannabinoids. Blocking CB1 receptors also decreases the
reinforcing effects of nic­ otine. Cannabinoids produce memory deficits
by acting on inhibitory GABAergic neurons in the CA1 field of the
hippocampus.

Thought Question Although executives of tobacco companies used to in­
sist that cigarettes were not addictive and asserted that people smoked
simply because of the pleasure the act gave them, research indicates
that nicotine is indeed a potent drug of abuse. Why do you think it took
so long to recognize this fact?

Despite development of a wide range of interventions, successful
treatment of substance abuse is challenging. Approximately 40--60
percent of individuals are abstinent one year after a substance abuse
intervention (McLellan et al., 2000). It is important to also keep in
mind that people have different goals for treatment, ranging from
complete absti­ nence to reduced use of a drug. The remainder of this
module will include summaries of some of the empirically supported
interventions for substance abuse that are known to interact with brain
mechanisms responsible for substance abuse. This is not an exhaustive
list, and research is underway to develop new and potentially more
effective treatments.

Opiates LO 19.11 Summarize effective treatments for opiate abuse. One
treatment for opiate abuse is methadone maintenance. Methadone is a
potent opiate, just like morphine or heroin. If it were available in a
form suitable for injection, it would be abused. (Methadone clinics
control their stock of metha­ done carefully to prevent it from being
stolen and sold.) Methadone maintenance programs administer the drug to
their patients in an oral form, which they must consume in

the presence of the personnel supervising this procedure. Because the
oral route of administration increases the opiate level in the brain
slowly, the drug does not produce a high, the way an injection of
opiates will. In addition, because methadone is long lasting, the
patient's opiate receptors re­ main occupied for a long time, which means
that an injection of heroin has little effect. However, a very large
dose of heroin will still produce a "rush," so the method is not
foolproof. A newer drug, buprenorphine, shows promise of being an even
better therapeutic agent for opiate abuse treat­ ment than methadone
(Vocci et al., 2005). Buprenorphine is a partial agonist for the µ
opiate receptor. A partial agonist is a drug that has a high affinity
for a particular receptor but activates that receptor less than the
normal ligand does. This action reduces the effects of a receptor ligand
in regions of high concentration and increases it in regions of low
concentration, as shown in Figure 17.13. Buprenorphine blocks the
effects of opiates and itself produces only a weak opiate effect. Unlike
methadone, it has little value on the illicit drug market. A randomized
placebo-controlled trial compared the effectiveness of bu­ prenorphine
and buprenorphine plus naloxone in people recovering from opiate abuse
(Fudala et al., 2003). People in the two drug-treatment groups reported
less craving than those in the control group. The proportion of people
who continued to be abstinent was 17.8 percent for peo­ ple treated with
buprenorphine, 20.7 percent for people treated with the combination of
the two drugs, and only 5.8 percent for people receiving a placebo. (See
Figure 19.25.) After 1 month, all participants were given buprenorphine
plus naloxone for 11 months. The percentage of people who abstained
(indicated by the absence of opiates in urine samples) ranged from 35.2
to 67.4 percent at various times during the 11-month period. A major
advantage of buprenorphine, besides its effi­ cacy, is the fact that it
can be used in office-based treatment. The addition of a small dose of
naloxone ensures that the combination drug has no abuse potential---and
will, in fact, cause withdrawal symptoms if it is used by a person who
is currently abusing an opiate. The combination of bu­ prenorphine and
naloxone is sold as Suboxone or Zubsolv.

As we have seen, opiate receptor blockers such as naloxone and
naltrexone interfere with the action of opi­ ates. Emergency rooms always
have one of these drugs available to treat patients who have taken an
overdose of heroin, and many lives have been saved by these means. But
although an opiate antagonist will block the effects of heroin, the
research reviewed earlier in this chapter sug­ gests that it should
increase the craving for heroin. A variety of medications may be used to
treat the symp­ toms of opiate withdrawal and reduce the likelihood of re­
lapse. Table 19.4 lists several different types of medications,
including alpha 2-adrenergic agonists and loperamide, and the withdrawal
symptoms they treat. The α2-adrenergic agonists help reduce withdrawal
symptoms related to over­ activity of the autonomic nervous system in
opiate with­ drawal. Loperamide (Imodium) is a μ opioid agonist that is
often used for its effects in the digestive system to slow gut motility
and treat diarrhea. There has been growing con­ cern that loperamide can
cross the blood--brain barrier and produce euphoric reinforcing effects
at high doses. Cases of substituting high doses of loperamide for other
opiates

al., 2017; MacDonald et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2017). Use of kratom
(Mitragyna speciosa), a plant from Southeast Asia, has also received
attention as a potential opiate abuse treatment strategy. Kratom is used
recreation­ ally and as an opiate substitute. The plant contains psy­
choactive compounds, including Mitragynine (MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine
(7-HMG). MG and 7-HMG have multiple mechanisms of action, including
serving as partial agonists at the μ opioid receptor. Researchers have
begun to study these compounds to better understand how kra­ tom produces
its effects. Using a self-administration model with rats, MG was not
reinforcing while 7-HMG was. Blocking the μ opioid receptor with a
selective antagonist prevented the reinforcing effects of 7-HMG. MG
reduced self-administration of morphine in the rats, while 7-HMG
increased it (Hemby et al., 2018). Future research may sup­ port the use
of kratom, or some of the compounds found in the plant, in opiate
substitution strategies to treat opiate abuse.

Stimulants LO 19.12 Summarize effective treatments for stimulant abuse.
As we saw earlier, the reinforcing effects of cocaine and amphetamine
are primarily a result of the sharply in­ creased levels of dopamine that
these drugs produce in the NAC. Drugs that block dopamine receptors
certainly block the reinforcing effects of cocaine and amphetamine, but
they also produce dysphoria and anhedonia. People will not tolerate the
unpleasant feelings these drugs produce, so they are not useful
treatments for cocaine and amphet­ amine abuse. Drugs that stimulate
dopamine receptors can reduce a person's dependence on cocaine or
amphetamine, but these drugs have just as much abuse potential as the
drugs they replace and have the same deleterious effects on health. An
interesting approach to reduce cocaine abuse was suggested by a study by
Carrera and colleagues (1995), who conjugated cocaine to a foreign
protein and managed to stimulate rats' immune systems to develop
antibodies to co­ caine. The antibodies bound with molecules of cocaine
and prevented them from crossing the blood--brain barrier. As a
consequence, these "cocaine-immunized" rats were less sensitive to the
activating effects of cocaine, and brain lev­ els of cocaine in these
animals were lower after an injection of cocaine. Since this study was
conducted, animal studies with vaccines against cocaine, heroin,
methamphetamine, and nicotine have been carried out, and several human
clini­ cal trials with vaccines for cocaine and nicotine have taken

M19_CARL0287_13_GE_C19.indd 632

place (Bremer et al., 2017; Cerny & Cerny, 2009; Carroll et al., 2011;
Hicks et al., 2011; Stowe et al., 2011). The results of these animal
studies and human trials are promising, and more extensive human trials
are in progress. Theoretically, at least, treatment of substance abuse
with immunotherapy should interfere only with the action of an abused
drug and not with the normal operations of people's reinforcement
mechanisms. The treatment should not decrease a person's ability to
experience normal pleasure. One potential limita­ tion of this strategy
is the specificity of the antibodies. For example, if an antibody were
specific to cocaine, it might not block transport of methamphetamine
across the blood-- brain barrier, allowing an individual to achieve
reinforcing effects of a related, but not identical, drug molecule.

Nicotine LO 19.13 Summarize effective treatments for nicotine abuse. A
treatment similar to methadone maintenance has been used successfully as
an adjunct to treatment for nicotine abuse. Chewing gum and transdermal
patches that release nicotine are available for smoking-cessation
treatment. Both methods maintain a sufficiently high level of nico­ tine
in the brain to decrease a person's craving for nico­ tine. Once the
behavioral habit of smoking has subsided, the dose of nicotine can be
decreased to wean the person from the drug. Carefully controlled studies
have shown that nicotine maintenance therapy, and not administration of
a placebo, is useful in treatment for nicotine dependence (Raupach & van
Schayck, 2011). However, nicotine mainte­ nance therapy is most effective
if it is part of a counseling program. One of the limitations of a
smoking cessation interven­ tion that includes only nicotine maintenance
is that this procedure does not provide an important non-nicotine
component of smoking: the sensations produced by the ac­ tion of
cigarette smoke on the airways. As we saw earlier in this chapter,
stimuli associated with the administration of drugs of abuse play an
important role in sustaining sub­ stance abuse. Smokers who rate the
pleasurability of puffs of normal and denicotinized cigarettes within 7
seconds, which is less time than it takes for nicotine to leave the
lungs, enter the blood, and reach the brain, reported that puffing
denicotinized cigarettes produced equally strong feelings of euphoria
and satisfaction and reductions in the urge to smoke. Furthermore,
blocking the sensations of cigarette smoke on the airways by first
inhaling a local anesthetic diminishes smoking satisfaction.
Denicotinized cigarettes are not a completely adequate substitute for
nor­ mal cigarettes, because nicotine itself, not just the other

M19_CARL0287_13_GE_C19.indd 633

drug serves as a partial agonist for the nicotinic receptor, just as
buprenorphine serves as a partial agonist for the µ opiate receptor. As
a partial nicotinic agonist, varenicline maintains a moderate level of
activation of nicotinic recep­ tors but prevents high levels of nicotine
from providing ex­ cessive levels of stimulation. Figure 19.26 shows the
effects of treatment with varenicline and bupropion on continu­ ous
abstinence rates of smokers enrolled in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study (Nides et al., 2006). By the end of the 52-week
treatment program, 14.4 percent of the smokers treated with varenicline
were still abstinent, compared with 6.3 percent and 4.9 percent of the
smokers who received bupropion and placebo, respectively. Other clinical
trials have reported increased rates of quitting smoking up to a year
after starting treatment with vareni­ cline (compared to placebo) among
smokers that sought a gradual reduction approach to smoking (Ebbert et
al., 2015), and up to 4 years among smokers prescribed var­ enicline
compared to a nicotine replacement group (Taylor et al., 2017).

Alcohol LO 19.14

Summarize effective treatments for alcohol abuse.

As mentioned earlier, several studies have shown that opi­ ate
antagonists decrease the reinforcing value of alcohol in a variety of
species, including our own. This finding sug­ gests that the reinforcing
effect of alcohol---at least in part--- is produced by the secretion of
endogenous opioids and the activation of opiate receptors in the brain.
A study by Davidson and colleagues (1996) illustrates this effect. The
investigators arranged a double-blind, placebo-controlled

components of smoke, makes an important contribution to the sensations
felt in the airways. In fact, trimethaphan, a drug that blocks nicotinic
receptors but does not cross the blood--brain barrier, decreases the
sensory effects of smok­ ing and reduces satisfaction. Because
trimethaphan does not interfere with the effects of nicotine on the
brain, this finding indicates that the central effects of nicotine are
not sufficient by themselves to maintain nicotine abuse. Instead, the
combination of an immediate cue from the sensory effects of components
of cigarette smoke on the airways and a more delayed, and more
continuous, effect of nicotine on the brain serves to make smoking so
difficult to stop (Naqvi & Bechara, 2005; Rose, 2006). Non-combustible
methods of nicotine delivery were ini­ tially developed as a nicotine
replacement strategy for smok­ ers and appear to help with cigarette
smoking cessation (Levy et al., 2017). However, as new nicotine delivery
systems such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) that vaporize a
nicotinecontaining liquid for inhalation have become more widely
adopted, particularly by young people, concern about their potential for
abuse has grown. Some researchers have sought to determine whether
unique abuse potential may exist for e-cigarettes. In rodents, the
nicotine-containing liquid used in e-cigarettes is self-administered
similarly to pure nicotine. The nicotine in the liquid binds to the same
sites as the nico­ tine in cigarettes (LeSage et al., 2016). However, the
smoking behavior associated with e-cigarettes appears to be different
from cigarette smoking behavior, which can be an important variable in
designing interventions. St. Helen and colleagues (2017) analyzed video
recordings of people using e-cigarettes. They found that e-cigarette
users often administered more consistent, lower doses of nicotine
compared to the shorter duration, larger doses of nicotine typically
delivered from smoking a cigarette. As we saw earlier in this chapter,
studies with labo­ ratory animals have found that the endogenous canna­
binoids are involved in the reinforcing effects of nicotine as well as
those of marijuana. A clinical trial reported that rimonabant, a CB1
receptor antagonist, was effective in helping smokers to quit their
habit (Henningfield et al., 2005). One significant benefit of the drug
was a decrease in the weight gain that typically accompanies cessation
of smoking and often discourages people who are trying to quit. As we
saw in Chapter 12, the endocannabinoids stim­ ulate eating, apparently by
increasing the release of MCH and orexin. Blocking CB1 receptors
abolishes this effect and helps to counteract the effects of withdrawal
from nicotine on these neurons. But the problem with rimonabant is that
some clinical trials have found that the drug can cause anx­ iety and
depression, which provoked the withdrawal of its approval as an
antiobesity medication. Another drug, varenicline, has been approved for
ther­ apeutic use to treat nicotine dependence. Varenicline was developed
especially as a treatment for nicotine abuse. The

Brain Stimulation LO 19.15 Describe the implications for brain
stimulation treatments in substance abuse. A novel approach to substance
abuse is currently being investigated. As we saw in Chapters 16, 17, and
18, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been shown to have thera­ peutic
effects on the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, depression, anxiety
disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. A review by Luigjes and
colleagues (2011) re­ ported that seven animal studies have investigated
the ef­ fectiveness of DBS of the NAC, subthalamic nucleus (STN), dorsal
striatum, habenula, medial PFC, and hypothalamus.

study with 16 college-age men and women to investigate the effects of
naltrexone on social drinkers. None of the participants were abusing
alcohol, and pregnancy tests en­ sured that the women were not pregnant.
They gathered around a table in a local restaurant/bar for three 2-hour
drinking sessions, 2 weeks apart. For several days before the meeting,
they swallowed capsules that contained either naltrexone or an inert
placebo. The results showed that naltrexone increased the amount of time
to take the first sip and to take a second drink and that the blood
alcohol levels of the naltrexone-treated participants were lower at the
end of the session. In general, the people who had taken naltrexone
found that their drinks did not taste very good---in fact, some of them
asked for a different drink after taking the first sip. These results
are consistent with reports of the effec­ tiveness of naltrexone as an
adjunct to programs designed to treat alcohol abuse. For example,
O'Brien and colleagues (1996) reported the results of two long-term
programs using naltrexone along with more traditional behavioral
treatments. Both programs found that administration of naltrexone
significantly increased the likelihood of suc­ cess. As Figure 19.27
shows, naltrexone decreased the par­ ticipants' craving for alcohol and
increased the number of participants who abstained from alcohol.
Currently, many treatment programs are using a sustained-release form of
naltrexone to help treat alcohol abuse, and results with the drug have
been encouraging (Gastfriend, 2011). Another drug has shown promise for
treatment of alcohol abuse. As we saw earlier in this chapter, alcohol
serves as an indirect antagonist at the NMDA receptor. Acamprosate, an
NMDA-receptor antagonist that has been used in Europe to treat seizure
disorders, was tested for its ability to stop seizures induced by
withdrawal from alco­ hol. The researchers discovered that the drug had
an un­ expected benefit: Patients who received the drug were less likely
to start drinking again (Wickelgren, 1998). Several double-blind studies
have confirmed the therapeutic ben­ efits of acamprosate, but these
benefits appear to be modest (Rösner et al., 2010).

Eleven studies with human participants have targeted the NAC or the STN
with DBS. So far, the authors report, the NAC appears to be the most
promising target. For exam­ ple, Mantione and colleagues (2010) used DBS
to stimulate the NAC of a 47-year-old man who smoked. The investi­ gators
reported that the man effortlessly stopped smoking and lost weight (he
was obese). Subsequent DBS studies with human participants have reported
reduced use or craving for alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, and opioids
(Coles et al., 2018). Deep brain stimulation is not a procedure to take
lightly. It involves brain surgery, which runs a risk of com­ plications
such as hemorrhage and infection. Of course, substance abuse itself
presents significant health risks, in­ cluding death from infections or
lung cancer, so each case

requires an analysis of the potential risks and benefits. In any event,
the use of DBS is currently experimental, and we must consider the
strong possibility that such a dra­ matic procedure will produce placebo
effects. (Yes, surgical procedures are susceptible to placebo effects.)
A less inva­ sive procedure, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), is
also being investigated as a treatment for substance abuse.

For example, Amiaz and colleagues (2009) applied TMS over the left
dorsolateral PFC of people who smoked. The treatment reduced tobacco use
(verified by urinalysis), but the therapeutic effects eventually
diminished over time. A later review of TMS studies revealed beneficial
effects of TMS on reducing use or craving of alcohol, nicotine, co­
caine, methamphetamine, and heroin (Coles et al., 2018).

Module Review: Treatment for Substance Abuse Opiates LO 19.11 Summarize
effective treatments for opiate abuse. Methadone maintenance treats
physical dependence on opiates with an opiate that does not produce
euphoric ef­ fects when administered orally, but reduces withdrawal
symptoms. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist for the µ opiate receptor,
reduces craving for opiates.

Stimulants LO 19.12 Summarize effective treatments for stimulant abuse.
The development of antibodies to cocaine and nicotine in humans and to
several other drugs in rats creates the pos­ sibility that people may
someday be immunized against drugs of abuse, preventing the entry of the
drugs into the brain.

Nicotine LO 19.13 Summarize effective treatments for nicotine abuse.
Nicotine-containing gum and transdermal patches help smokers to reduce
withdrawal symptoms of nicotine. However, sensations from the airways
produced by the presence of cigarette smoke play an important role in
nicotine abuse, and oral and transdermal nicotine admin­ istration do not
provide these sensations. Rimonabant, a CB1 receptor antagonist, aids in
smoking cessation and reduces the likelihood of weight gain, but it may
produce

adverse emotional effects. Bupropion, an antidepressant drug, has also
been shown to help smokers stop their habit. Varenicline, a partial
agonist for the nicotinic re­ ceptor, may be even more effective.

Alcohol LO 19.14 Summarize effective treatments for alcohol abuse. The
most effective pharmacological adjuncts to treat­ ment for alcohol abuse
appear to be opiate antagonists that reduce the drug's reinforcing
effects. Acamprosate, an NMDA-receptor antagonist, appears to facilitate
treat­ ment of alcohol abuse as well.

Brain Stimulation LO 19.15 Describe the implications for brain
stimulation treatments in substance abuse. Deep brain stimulation of the
NAC and STN and TMS of the prefrontal cortex shows promise as a
treatment for substance abuse.

Thought Question A friend has recently asked you for advice about
helping a family member who is interested in treatment for alco­ hol
abuse. Your friend is curious about how some of the pharmacological
