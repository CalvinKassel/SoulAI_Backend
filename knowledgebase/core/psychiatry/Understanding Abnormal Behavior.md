Multipath Model of Mental Disorders The multipath model describes how
four major dimensions---biological, psychological, social, and
sociocultural---contribute to the development of mental disorders. It
operates under several assumptions: • No one theoretical perspective is
adequate to explain the complexity of the human condition and the
development of mental disorders. • There are multiple pathways and
causes to any single disorder. It is a statistical rarity to find a
disorder due to only one cause. • Not all dimensions contribute equally
to a disorder. • It is guided by the state of research and scientific
findings as to the relative merits of a proposed cause. • The multipath
model is an integrative and interactive one. It acknowledges that
factors may combine in complex and reciprocal ways so that people
exposed to the same factors may not develop the same disorder and that
different individuals exposed to different factors may develop a similar
mental disorder.

bnormal behaviors both fascinate and are of concern to scientists and
the general public. Why people exhibit abnormal behaviors, how they
express their disturbances, and how such behaviors can be prevented and
treated are questions that continue to intrigue us. We now know that all
human beings are touched in one way or another by mental disturbance in
their lives, either directly through their own struggles to deal with
mental disorders or indirectly through affected friends or relatives.
Over the years, major research discoveries in genetics, neurobiology,
and psychology have made unprecedented contributions to our
understanding of abnormal behaviors. This is clearly evident in the
Human Genome Project, where scientists have mapped the location of all
genes in the human nucleus. The hope among mental health professionals
is that the "map of life" will allow for increased understanding of
mental disorders and their subsequent treatments. In addition to this
tremendous biological breakthrough, we also know that psychological
forms of intervention are effective in treating abnormal behaviors. The
move to identify empirically supported treatments has taken the
profession by storm. Finally, research has revealed the great cultural
variations in abnormal behaviors and what other cultures consider
effective treatments. In the Ninth Edition of our book, we examine all
of these areas. In writing and revising this book, we have sought to
engage students in the exciting process of understanding abnormal
behavior and the ways that mental health professionals study and attempt
to treat it. In pursuing this goal, we have been guided by three major
objectives: • To provide students with scholarship of the highest
quality, • To offer an evenhanded treatment of abnormal psychology as
both a scientific and a clinical endeavor, giving students the
opportunity to explore topics thoroughly and responsibly, and • To make
our book inviting and stimulating to a wide range of students. In each
edition, we have strived to achieve these objectives, working with
comments from many students and instructors and our own work in
teaching, research, and practice. The Ninth Edition, we believe, builds
on the achievements of previous editions and surpasses them.

Our Approach

x vi

We take an eclectic, multicultural approach to the field, drawing on
important contributions from various disciplines and theoretical
stances. The text covers the major categories of disorders listed in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), but
it is not a mechanistic reiteration of DSM. We believe that different
combinations of life experiences and constitutional factors influence
behavioral disorders, and we project this view throughout the text.
These combinations of factors are demonstrated in our multipath model,
which is a way of looking at the causes of disorders new to the Ninth
Edition. There are several elements to our multipath model. First, the
contributors to mental disorders are divided into four dimensions:
biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural. Second, factors in
the four dimensions can interact and influence each other in any
direction. Third,

PR EFA CE

different combinations within the four dimensions may cause abnormal
behaviors. For instance, assume that a person has severe depression.
That depression may be caused primarily by a single factor (e.g., death
of a loved one) or by an interaction of factors at different dimensions
(e.g., caused by child abuse occurring in early life and stressors in
adulthood). Thus, a disorder such as depression may be caused by
different factors and different combination of factors. Fourth, many
disorders appear to be heterogeneous in nature. Therefore, there may be
different types or versions of a disorder (a spectrum of the disorder).
Finally, different disorders may be caused by similar factors. For
example, anxiety as well as depression may be caused by child abuse and
interpersonal stress. In fact, anxiety and depression often occur
concurrently in people. Sociocultural factors, including cultural norms,
values, and expectations, are given special attention. Because we are
convinced that cross-cultural comparisons of abnormal behavior and
treatment methods can greatly enhance our understanding of disorders,
cultural and gender phenomena are emphasized. Indeed, Understanding
Abnormal Behavior was the first textbook on abnormal psychology to
integrate and emphasize the role of multicultural factors, and although
many texts have since followed our lead, the Ninth Edition continues to
provide the most extensive coverage and integration of multicultural
models, explanations, and concepts available. Not only do we discuss how
changing demographics have increased the importance of multicultural
psychology, but we also introduce multicultural models of
psychopathology in the opening chapters. As with other models of
psychopathology (such as psychoanalytic, cognitive, behavioral,
biological), we address multicultural issues throughout the text
whenever research findings and theoretical formulations allow. For
example, cultural factors as they affect assessment, classification, and
treatment of various mental disorders are presented to students. Such an
approach adds richness to our understanding of mental disorders. As
psychologists (and professors), we know that learning is enhanced
whenever material is presented in a lively and engaging manner. We
achieve these qualities in part by providing case vignettes and clients'
descriptions of their experiences to complement and illustrate
research-based explanations. Our goal is to encourage students to think
critically rather than merely assimilate a collection of facts and
theories. As a result, we hope that students will develop an
appreciation of the study of abnormal behavior.

Special Features The Ninth Edition includes a number of new features as
well as features that were popularized in earlier editions and, in some
cases, have been revised and enhanced. These features are aimed at
aiding students in organizing and integrating the material in each
chapter. • As previously noted, our new multipath model provides a
framework through which students can understand mental disorders. The
model is introduced in Chapter 2 and applied throughout the book. • New
and updated Critical Thinking boxes provide factual evidence and
thoughtprovoking questions that raise key issues in research, examine
widely held assumptions about abnormal behavior, or challenge the
student's own understanding of the text material. • New Controversy
boxes deal with controversial issues with wide implications for our
society. These boxes stimulate critical thinking, evoke alternative
views, provoke discussion, and draw students into issues that help them
better explore the wider meaning of abnormal behavior in our society. •
New and updated Myth and Reality discussions challenge the many myths
and false beliefs that have surrounded the field of abnormal behavior
and also helps students realize that beliefs, some of which may appear
to be "common sense," must be checked against scientific facts and
knowledge.

PRE FAC E

• New Did You Know? margin boxes found throughout the book provide
fascinating, at-a-glance research-based tidbits for students. • New
Implications sections end each chapter, synthesizing the multipath model
implications of the chapter material. • Chapter outlines and Focus
Questions, appearing in the first pages of every chapter, provide a
framework and stimulate active learning---with questions in mind,
students begin thinking about the concepts they are about to explore
within the chapter. • Integrated chapter Summaries keyed to the Focus
Questions provide students with a concise recap of the chapter's most
important concepts and with tentative answers to the chapter opener's
Focus Questions. • New and updated case studies and examples make issues
of mental health and mental disorders "come to life" for students and
instructors. Many of the cases are taken from actual clinical files, and
all are clearly designated within the text's design. • Streamlined
disorder charts provide snapshots of disorders in an easy-to-read
format. • Key terms are highlighted in the text and appear in the
margins.

New and Updated Coverage of the Ninth Edition Our foremost objective in
preparing this edition was to update thoroughly and present the latest
trends in research and clinical thinking. This has led to updated
coverage of dozens of topics throughout the text, including the
following: • The growing ethnic and cultural diversity in the United
States and its implications for mental health research, theory, and
practice. • Expanded and balanced coverage of the biological perspective
and the latest research strategies and findings on genetic factors in
mental disorders. • Integrated coverage of the growing prevalence of
psychoactive drug use in U.S. society. • New developments concerning the
implications of managed health care on mental health services and the
use of evidence-based treatments. • Research findings concerning the
rates of each mental disorder and the prevalence of disorders according
to gender, ethnicity, and age. • Updated suicide coverage. • Coverage of
date rape and reasons for why men rape. • Expanded coverage on eating
disorders and obesity. • Expanded coverage of learning disorders. •
Identification of psychotherapies and treatments that are likely to
increase or decrease in use in the future. • Ethical and legal issues
raised by recent cases involving insanity pleas, courtroom testimony by
psychologists, and assisted suicide. • Integrated coverage of
culture-specific therapeutic strategies for treating African American,
Asian American, Latino American, and Native American clients. The design
of the book has been revamped to present the content in the clearest,
most accessible way. As in the previous edition, the Ninth Edition
contains an abundance of tables, illustrations, figures, and photographs
that graphically show research data, illustrate comparisons and
contrasts, and enhance the understanding of concepts or controversies in
the field. In addition to updating the book's coverage, its look, and
its special features, we have maintained a streamlined organization of
the book, as described next.

P REFA C E

Organization of the Text To make covering the book's contents over the
course of a quarter or semester more manageable, the text is seventeen
chapters long, in keeping with feedback from users of the book.
Long-time users of our text will immediately notice that we continue to
offer features that have been helpful, that we continue to have a
chapter on eating disorders (Chapter 16), and that we provide coverage
of mental retardation in the chapter on childhood disorders (Chapter
15). In addition, all of the chapters have been thoroughly revised and
updated with an eye toward balancing research findings with clinical
implications. Chapters 1 through 4 provide a context for viewing
abnormal behavior and treatment by introducing students to definitions
of abnormal behavior and historical perspectives (Chapter 1), the key
theoretical perspectives used to explain deviant behavior (Chapter 2),
methods of assessment and classification (Chapter 3), and the research
process involved in the study of abnormal behavior (Chapter 4).
Especially noteworthy is our new multipath model discussion found in
Chapter 2. The bulk of the text, Chapters 5 through 16, presents the
major disorders covered in DSM-IV-TR. In each chapter, disorders are
viewed through a multipath perspective that focuses on symptoms,
etiology, and treatment. Our disorders charts include not only the
definitions of disorders but also their prevalence, onset, and course,
so, at a glance, students are able to gain an important overview of the
disorders. Highlights of the coverage in this part of the book include
an entire chapter devoted to suicide (Chapter 12), which was deemed
important because of its increasing visibility in the mental health
professions and our society. In addition, major contemporary issues
involving the right to die, assisted suicide, and our aging population
have thrust it into the public limelight as well. This chapter presents
information on the reasons for suicide and also on its moral, legal, and
ethical implications. Chapter 16 still provides thorough coverage of
eating disorders and now includes an expanded discussion of obesity and
its possible inclusion in DSM-V. Research now links eating disorders to
situational factors, biological proclivity, and other interlocking
mental disorders. The fact that the majority of those who suffer from
eating disorders are women is also a powerful statement of how the
images society portrays to them may result in unhealthy behaviors.
Chapter 17 concludes the book with a look at the legal and ethical
issues in psychopathology, including topics such as the insanity
defense, patients' rights, confidentiality, and mental health practices
in general. In our earlier edition, a separate chapter was devoted to
therapy, but we have chosen to discuss treatment approaches in each of
the chapters on disorders instead, allowing students closure in covering
particular disorders. The therapeutic intervention chapter from previous
editions is still available online for those instructors who would like
to use it. The text is therefore manageable for a one-semester class.
While research findings and knowledge in the field of psychopathology
have grown considerably, we have tried to provide the most important and
significant developments in the field without sacrificing the scholarly
and comprehensive nature of the book.

n April 16, 2007, college student Seung Hui Cho used two semiautomatic
handguns on the Virginia Tech campus to kill twenty-seven students and
ﬁve faculty members, wound twenty-ﬁve others, and commit suicide with a
shot to his head. The incident was the deadliest mass shooting in modern
U.S. history and left many grief-stricken, horriﬁed, and bafﬂed at Cho's
actions. To the public, the mass killings immediately brought to mind
the 1999 Columbine High School massacre in which Eric Harris and Dylan
Klebold killed twelve students and one teacher before committing
suicide. The Virginia Tech rampage began in the early morning hours,
when Cho shot a female student and male resident assistant in a
dormitory. Approximately two hours later, he went to Norris Hall, where
classes were in session, and chained shut the building doors to prevent
easy escape. There he ﬁred some 174 rounds, killing and wounding many
students and professors as he moved from classroom to classroom. While
the second attack lasted only nine minutes, to those trapped in the
building, it must have seemed like an eternity. Chaos ensued as students
ﬂed for their lives. Some jumped from second-story windows to escape,
and others attempted to barricade the classroom doors. There were
multiple reports of heroic actions by professors and students to save
others, but it often resulted in their own deaths (summarized from the
Virginia Tech Review Panel, August 2007).

CRITICAL THINKING I Have It, Too: The Medical Student Syndrome 28

In an attempt to make sense out of an apparently "senseless" act, many
questions were asked. What could have motivated Cho to carry out such a
heinous deed and take so many innocent lives? Why did he commit suicide?
Was he deranged, a psychopathic killer, or high on drugs? Were there
warning signs that he was homicidal or suicidal? Did he suffer from a
mental disorder? Would therapy or medication have helped him? Did his
race, culture, and immigration status play any role in his actions?

FOCUSQUESTIONS

1 What is abnormal psychology? 2 What criteria are used to determine
normal or abnormal behaviors?

3 How do context and cultural differences affect deﬁnitions of
abnormality?

4 How common are mental disorders?

1 6 How have explanations of abnormal behavior changed over time?

7 What were early viewpoints on the causes of mental disorders?

8 What are some contemporary trends in abnormal psychology?

5 What are some common misconceptions about the mentally disturbed?

These questions are extremely difficult to answer for a number of
reasons. First, we do not know enough about the causes of abnormal
behavior and especially mental disorders to arrive at a definitive
answer. It appears that psychopathology, or abnormal behavior, is not
the result of any singular cause but an interaction of many factors.
Most mental disorders have multiple contributors, a fact that we discuss
in the next chapter. Second, Cho is no longer alive so that we could
ascertain his state of mind. As a result, we must rely on secondary
sources such as health or school records, observations by peers, family,
and acquaintances, and any other available data (suicide notes, essays,
pictures, and media communications) to construct a portrait of his state
of mind. Sad to say, the Virginia Tech massacre illustrates how complex
the study of abnormal psychology becomes in real life. In a sense, the
purpose of this book, Understanding Abnormal Behavior, is to help you
answer such questions. To do so, however, requires us first to examine
some basic aspects of the study of abnormal behavior, including some of
its history and emerging changes in the field. Periodically, we use the
Cho case to illustrate the many complex interacting mental health issues
in the field.

SEUNG HUI CHO PHOTO SENT TO NBC ON DAY OF THE MASSACRE Was Cho mentally
disturbed? At college, he became known as the "question mark kid"
because he would only put down a question mark for his name. He would
not respond when greeted, sat for hours in his dorm room staring out the
window, and referred to an imaginary girlfriend by the name of "Jelly,"
a supermodel who lived in outer space. At one time, he informed a
roommate that he was vacationing with Vladimir Putin, the president of
Russia.

The Concerns of Abnormal Psychology Abnormal psychology is the
scientific study whose objectives are to describe, explain, predict, and
control behaviors that are considered strange or unusual. Its subject
matter ranges from the bizarre and spectacular to the more
commonplace---from the violent homicides, suicides, and "perverted"
sexual acts that are widely reported by the news media to such
unsensational (but more prevalent) behaviors as depression, ulcers, and
anxiety about examinations.

Describing Abnormal Behavior The description of a particular case of
abnormal behavior must be based on systematic observations by an
attentive professional. These observations, usually paired with the
results of the person's psychological history, become the raw material
for a psychodiagnosis, an attempt to describe, assess, and
systematically draw inferences about an individual's psychological
disorder.

For example, Cho was taken to a mental health agency in Virginia, where
a psychiatric evaluation was undertaken. Because we have limited access
to these records, the precise nature of the therapist's observations is
tentative. Usually, however, mental status exams are conducted by mental
health professionals to ascertain the degree to which clients are in
contact with reality, whether they suffer from hallucinations or
delusions, and whether they are potentially dangerous. Based on clinical
observations, analysis of his history, and possibly psychological
testing, the therapist concluded that Cho was of "imminent danger to
self or others," "mentally ill," and in need of hospitalization. The
precise psychiatric diagnosis is unknown because of confidentiality
laws. Unfortunately, instead of commitment to a mental institution, a
court magistrate ordered only outpatient treatment. As we now know, Cho
never complied with the order to seek therapy.

Explaining Abnormal Behavior

Did You Know?

C

ho's behavior motivated his mother to seek help from churches in
northern Virginia. One Presbyterian congregation felt that Cho was
afﬂicted by a demonic power and needed spiritual deliverance. Others
speculated that Cho was the epitome of evil. Although claiming that he
was possessed by supernatural forces might appear far-fetched, such
explanations of bizarre behavior were once common.

To explain abnormal behavior, the psychologist must identify its causes
and determine how they led to the described behavior. This information,
in turn, bears heavily on how a program of treatment is chosen. One
popular explanation of Cho's behavior was that he was high on drugs. An
autopsy, however, revealed no evidence of alcohol or drugs present in
his system. Nevertheless, Cho's background suggests many other possible
causes for his rampage: • As a child, Cho was described by family
members as mute, cold, and shy. His mother speculated that he was
"autistic," a condition associated with social isolation, delayed
speech, and repetitive behavior and believed to have a strong
constitutional component. Some relatives say that he was different from
birth and suggest that his problem was biological in nature. • Cho was
often the subject of teasing and cruel taunts by classmates, probably
because of his unusual behaviors. He was often bullied, called names,
mocked, and told to "go back to China." Although he seldom showed anger,
rumors abounded that he kept a "hit list" of students he wanted to kill.
Could such malicious actions from peers account for his homicidal and
suicidal actions? • Cho was a twenty-three-year-old South Korean citizen
with U.S. permanent resident status in Virginia. He immigrated to this
country at age eight with his parents and sister. Some believe he never
adequately adjusted to his new life in the United States and encountered
culture conflicts. He felt isolated, alone, and alienated from others.
Unable or unwilling to make connections with people, Cho had difficulty
distinguishing between fantasy and reality. • Cho came from a very poor
background and lived in a three-room basement with his family in Korea.
His father was a self-employed secondhand bookstore owner who made
little money and moved his family to the United States to improve their
financial state. Cho appeared very self-conscious about being poor and
resented "rich kids," materialism, and hedonism. His writings and video
recordings sent to NBC News contained extremely hostile statements
toward those "with money." In these snippets of Cho's life, it is clear
that many explanations for his rampage could be offered. There was
something biologically wrong with him from birth; he could not tolerate
the merciless teasing and bullying; his alienation from a new culture
created social isolation and resentment; and his poverty made him
envious and angry toward more affluent students. Depending on your
viewpoint, some explanations may appear more valid than others. As we
will see in the next chapter, no one explanation is sufficient to
explain the complexity of the human condition; normal and abnormal
behaviors result from a combination of factors.

Predicting Abnormal Behavior If a therapist can correctly identify the
source of a client's difficulty, he or she should be able to predict the
kinds of problems the client will face during therapy and the symptoms
the client will display. Many believe that there was sufficient evidence
to predict that Cho was likely to take the lives of others and his own
based on a number of reported events:

The Concerns of Abnormal Psychology

INTERVENING THROUGH THERAPY Group therapy is a widely used form of
treatment for many problems, especially those involving interpersonal
relationships. In this group session, participants are learning to
develop new and adaptive social skills in coping with social problems
rather than relying on alcohol or drugs to escape the stresses of life.

• Cho was involved in three stalking incidents on the Virginia Tech
campus. All three involved female students in whom he developed brief
but intense interest. His contacts were made through instant messaging
on his computer. He sent them annoying messages, made an uninvited
appearance at one student's dorm room, and left graffiti on her bulletin
board. Cho was warned by campus police to cease his unwarranted contacts
with them. He apparently acceded to their warnings. • Several professors
reported that Cho was menacing, had a mean streak, and that his writings
were often intimidating, obscene, and violent. His writings, they
contend, "dripped with anger," were graphic and disturbing, and
possessed macabre violence. One professor became so fearful for her own
safety and that of others that she reported Cho to the student affairs
office, the dean's office, and campus police. Each unit responded that
nothing could be done if Cho made no overt threats against others. In
light of these reports, why was Cho allowed to stay on campus? Why was
he allowed to purchase firearms despite having a diagnosed mental
condition? Why did mental health professionals not intervene more
quickly? There appear to be several reasons. First, civil commitment, or
involuntary hospitalization/confinement, represents an extreme decision
that has major implications for an individual's civil liberties. Our
legal system operates under the assumption that people are innocent
until proven guilty. Locking someone up before they commit a dangerous
act potentially violates a person's civil rights. Second, although this
particular therapist proved to be correct in declaring Cho dangerous,
clinicians are notoriously inaccurate in predicting dangerousness.
Research shows that mental health professionals do a poor job of
predicting future violence; they tend to greatly overpredict it
(Buchanan, 1997).

Controlling Abnormal Behavior Abnormal behavior may be controlled
through therapy, which is a program of systematic intervention whose
purpose is to modify a client's behavioral, affective (emotional),
and/or cognitive state. For example, many therapists wonder whether Cho
could have been helped and the mass killings prevented if he had been
forced into treatment. Allowing Cho an opportunity to get in touch with
and to vent his anger would reduce his chances of doing harm to others.
Some mental health professionals might also recommend family therapy or
social skills training. Some might even recommend hospitalization, which
unfortunately was recommended but not done.

1.1

THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONS Clinical Psychology

Clinical psychology is the professional ﬁeld concerned with the study,
assessment, treatment, and prevention of abnormal behavior in disturbed
individuals. A clinical psychologist must hold a Ph.D. degree from a
university or a Psy.D. (doctor of psychology) degree, a more
practitioner-oriented degree granted by several institutions. Their
training includes course work in psychopathology, personality,
diagnosis, psychological testing, psychotherapy, and human physiology.
Apart from these and other course requirements, there are two additional
requirements for the Ph.D. degree: students are required to complete a
doctoral dissertation and usually a one-year internship. Clinical
psychologists work in a variety of settings, but most commonly they
provide therapy to clients in hospitals and clinics and in private
practice. Some choose to work in academic settings in which they can
concentrate on teaching and research. Other clinical psychologists are
hired by government or private organizations to do research.

Counseling Psychology

To a great extent, a description of clinical psychology applies to
counseling psychology as well. The academic and internship requirements
are similar, but the emphasis differs. Whereas clinical psychologists
are trained to work speciﬁcally with a disturbed client population,
counseling psychologists are usually more immediately concerned with the
study of life problems in relatively normal people. Furthermore,
counseling psychologists are more likely to be found in educational
settings than in hospitals and clinics.

Marriage and Family Counseling

A specialty in marriage and family counseling has recently emerged, with
its own professional organizations, journals, and state licensing
requirements. Marriage and family counselors have varied professional
backgrounds, but their training usually includes a master's degree in
counseling and many hours of supervised clinical experience.

Mental Health Counseling

As of this writing, mental health counselors are recognized and licensed
for clinical/counseling practice in 49 states. They work in a variety of
settings, receive intensive training in personal, emotional, vocational,
and human development, and have their own professional association.
Mental health counselors must meet many hours of supervised clinical
experience and possess master's degrees in counseling.

Psychiatry

Psychiatrists hold M.D. degrees. Their education includes the four years
of medical school required for that degree, along with an additional
three or four years of training in psychiatry. Of all the specialists
involved in mental health care, only psychiatrists can prescribe drugs
in the treatment of mental disorders.

Psychoanalysis

Psychoanalysis has been associated with medicine and psychiatry because
its founder, Sigmund Freud, and his major disciples were physicians. But
Freud was quite adamant in stating that one need not be medically
trained to be a good psychoanalyst. Nevertheless, most psychoanalysts
hold either an M.D. or a Ph.D. degree. In addition, psychoanalysts
receive intensive training in the theory and practice of psychoanalysis
at an institute devoted to the ﬁeld. This training includes the
individual's own analysis by an experienced analyst.

Psychiatric Social Work

Those entering psychiatric social work are trained in a school of social
work, usually in a two-year graduate program leading to a master's
degree. Included in this program is a one-year internship in a
social-service agency, sometimes a mental health center. Some social
workers go on to earn the D.S.W. (doctor of social work) degree.
Traditionally, psychiatric social workers work in family counseling
services or community agencies, where they specialize in intake
(assessment and screening of clients), take psychiatric histories, and
deal with other agencies.

School Psychology

School psychology is the ﬁeld of study concerned with the processes of
cognitive and emotional development of students in educational settings.
Thus it focuses on the processes of learning, remembering, and thinking
and on human development as it applies to the educational process. A
school psychologist may hold either a master's or a doctoral degree.
They are often employed by school districts to help with assessment and
testing and with the treatment of learning difﬁculties.

Determining Abnormality

7

Those who see Cho's condition as caused by a chemical imbalance might
rely on a primarily biological means of intervention and prescribe
medication, such as antipsychotic drugs. As we shall shortly see, the
treatment for abnormal behavior generally follows from its explanation.
Just as there are many ways to explain abnormal behaviors, there are
many proposed ways of conducting therapy and an equal number of
professional helpers offering their services. Along with the demand for
mental health treatment, the numbers and types of qualified helping
professionals have grown. In the past, mental health services were
controlled primarily by psychiatrists, psychologists, and psychiatric
social workers. The list of acceptable (licensed) providers in different
fields has expanded rapidly. Table 1.1 lists the qualifications,
training, and workplace settings of various mental health professionals.
As you can see, students desiring to enter practice can choose from a
variety of professional careers.

Determining Abnormality Implicit in our discussion so far is the one
overriding concern of abnormal psychology: abnormal behavior itself. But
what exactly is abnormal behavior, and how do psychologists define a
mental disorder? The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000a), the most
widely used classification system of mental disorders, defines abnormal
behavior as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological
syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated
with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e.,
impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a
significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an
important loss of freedom. (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a,
p. xxxi)

This definition is quite broad and raises many questions. First, when is
a syndrome or group of behaviors significant enough to have meaning?
From early descriptions of Cho in elementary school, his behavioral
patterns were noticed but not considered significant (that is, not
associated with pathology). He was a good student in math and English,
quiet in classes, but not disliked or feared by classmates. Some
teachers would even view him as a model example of compliant and
appropriate classroom behavior. It was only much later that Cho's
withdrawn behaviors became pronounced. Second, what constitutes "present
distress" and "painful symptoms"? We have limited access to psychiatric
records, but there is little evidence that Cho was anxious or depressed.
Some say that the fact that he took his own life indicates that he was
depressed. However, as we will see in a later chapter, the relationship
of suicide to depression is a mixed one. Certainly, however, we can
speculate that his intense anger might be distressful to him. Yet is it
possible to have a mental disorder without any subjective discomfort
(unhappiness, distress, anxiety, and so forth)? For example, people who
commit antisocial acts such as rape, murder, or robbery may not feel
remorseful; rather, they may be quite contented with their acts. Third,
what criteria do we use in ascertaining an "increased risk of suffering
death, pain, disability," and loss of freedom? Again, it is obvious to
us that Cho met this criterion firmly because he killed himself. But
Cho's action was an extreme one, far outside normative standards. How
would this last criterion apply to someone with, for example, a phobia?
One could certainly make a strong case that "loss of freedom" applied; a
person with a phobia about crossing bridges would be severely restricted
in travel. Yet if people have only a mild phobia of snakes and seldom
place themselves in an environment with them, there would be minimal
restrictions on their lives. Despite problems in defining abnormal
behavior, practitioners tend to agree that it represents behavior that
departs from some norm and that harms the affected individual or others.
Nearly all definitions of abnormal behavior use some form of statistical

abnormal behavior a clinically signiﬁcant behavioral or psychological
syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated
with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e.,
impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a

important loss of freedom

average to gauge deviations from normative standards. Four major means
of judging psychopathology include distress, deviance (bizarreness),
dysfunction (inefficiency in behavioral, affective, and/or cognitive
domains), and dangerousness.

Distress

Did You Know?

D

uring the Victorian era, women wore six to eight layers to conceal their
bodies from the neck down. Exposing an ankle was roughly equivalent to
going topless at the beach today. Taboos against publicly recognizing
sexuality dictated that words avoid any sexual connotation. Victorians
said "limb" instead of "leg" because the word leg was considered erotic.
Even pianos and tables were said to have limbs. People who did not
adhere to these codes of conduct were considered immoral.

Most people who seek the help of therapists are suffering physical or
psychological distress. Many physical reactions stem from a strong
psychological component; among them are disorders such as asthma,
hypertension, and ulcers, as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue,
nausea, pain, and heart palpitations. Distress can also be manifested in
extreme or prolonged emotional reactions, of which anxiety and
depression are the most prevalent and common. Of course, it is normal
for a person to feel depressed after suffering a loss or a
disappointment. But if the reaction is so intense, exaggerated, and
prolonged that it interferes with the person's capacity to function
adequately, it is likely to be considered abnormal.

Deviance Deviance is most closely related to using a statistical
average. Statistical criteria equate normality with those behaviors that
occur most frequently in the population. Abnormality is therefore
defined in terms of those behaviors that occur least frequently. Bizarre
or unusual behavior is an abnormal deviation from an accepted standard
of behavior (such as an antisocial act) or a false perception of reality
(such as a hallucination or delusion). This criterion can be extremely
subjective; it depends on the individual being diagnosed, on the
diagnostician, and on the particular cultural context. Certain sexual
behaviors, delinquency, and homicide are examples of acts that our
society considers abnormal. But social norms are far from static, and
behavioral standards cannot be considered absolute. Changes in our
attitudes toward human sexuality provide a prime example. Many American
magazines and films now openly exhibit the naked human body, and topless
and bottomless nightclub entertainment is hardly newsworthy. Various sex
acts are explicitly portrayed in NC-17-rated movies, and women are freer
to question traditional sex roles and to act more assertively in
initiating sex. Such changes in behavior make it difficult to subscribe
to absolute standards of normality. Nevertheless, some behaviors can
usually be judged abnormal in most situations. Among these are severe
disorientation, hallucinations, and delusions. Disorientation is
confusion with regard to identity, place, or time. People who are
disoriented may not know who they are, where they are, or what
historical era they are living in. Hallucinations are false
impressions---either pleasant or unpleasant---that involve the senses.
People who have hallucinations may hear, feel, or see things that are
not really there, such as voices accusing them of vile deeds, insects
crawling on their bodies, or monstrous apparitions. Delusions are false
beliefs steadfastly held by the individual despite contradictory
objective evidence. A delusion of grandeur is a belief that one is an
exalted personage, such as Jesus Christ or Joan of Arc; a delusion of
persecution is a belief that one is controlled by others or is the
victim of a conspiracy.

Dysfunction SOCIETAL NORMS AND DEVIANCE Societal norms often affect our
deﬁnitions of normality and abnormality. When social norms begin to
change, standards used to judge behaviors or roles also shift. Here we
see four male nurses in an overwhelmingly female occupation. In the
past, being a male nurse would have brought on stereotypes about their
masculinity. Role reversals in employment, hobbies, sports, and other
activities are becoming more acceptable over time.

In everyday life, people are expected to fulfill various roles---as
students or teachers; as workers and caretakers; as parents, lovers, and
marital partners. Emotional problems sometimes interfere with the
performance of these roles, and the resulting role dysfunction may be
used as an indicator of abnormality. Thus one way to assess dysfunction
is to compare an individual's performance with the requirements of a
role. Another related way to assess dysfunction is to compare an
individual's performance with his or her potential. For example,

Contextual and Cultural Limitations in Deﬁning Abnormal Behavior

an individual with an IQ score of 150 who is failing in school can be
labeled inefficient. (The label underachiever is often hung on students
who possess high intelligence but obtain poor grades in school.)
Similarly, a productive worker who suddenly becomes unproductive may be
experiencing emotional stress. The major weakness of this approach is
that it is difficult to accurately assess potential. How do we know
whether a person is performing at his or her peak? To answer such
questions, psychologists, educators, and the business sector have relied
heavily on testing. Tests of specific abilities and intelligence are
attempts to assess potential and to predict performance in schools or
jobs.

Dangerousness Predicting the dangerousness of clients to themselves and
others has become an inescapable part of clinical practice
(Haggard-Grann, 2007). Ever since the California Supreme Court ruled in
1976 (Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, 1976) that
therapists have a responsibility to assess dangerousness of clients (to
themselves and others) and to protect the intended victim, psychologists
have attempted to devise risk-assessment procedures and to ascertain
what actions a therapist must take to comply with "a duty to protect."
Certainly, the case of Cho represents a graphic example of the need for
mental health professionals to accurately assess violence risk. Yet, as
we shall see in a later chapter, this is a tall order. Despite the fear
of violence in persons suffering from a mental disorder, it is a
statistical rarity (Corrigan & Watson, 2005). Further, predicting
dangerousness is not easy, and there is no clear-cut criterion
correlated with it. One of the strongest risk factors, for example, is
previous violent behavior (such as suicide attempts and physical
assaults). Yet, as we know, Cho evidenced neither of these in his
history.

Contextual and Cultural Limitations in Deﬁning Abnormal Behavior Nearly
all criteria used to define abnormality use a statistical deviation from
some normative standard. Doing so, however, presents many problems. One
problem mentioned previously is that statistical criteria are static and
fail to take into account differences in place, time, and community
standards. Another is that statistical criteria do not provide any basis
for distinguishing between desirable and undesirable deviations from the
norm. An IQ score of 100 is considered normal or average. But what
constitutes an abnormal deviation from this average? More important, is
abnormality defined in only one direction or in both? An IQ score of 55
is considered abnormal by most people, but should people with IQ scores
of 145 or higher also be considered abnormal? How does one evaluate such
personality traits as assertiveness and dependence in terms of
statistical criteria? Two other central problems also arise. First,
people who strike out in new directions---artistically, politically, or
intellectually---may be seen as candidates for psychotherapy simply
because they do not conform to normative behavior. Second, statistical
criteria may "define" quite widely distributed but undesirable
characteristics, such as anxiety, as normal. Many psychological tests
and much diagnosis and classification of behavior disorders are based in
part on statistical criteria. Perhaps one of the strongest criticisms of
abnormality definitions comes from the multicultural perspective. If
deviations from the majority are considered abnormal, then many ethnic
and racial minorities who show strong subcultural differences from the
majority must be classified as abnormal. When we use a statistical
definition, the dominant or most influential group generally determines
what constitutes normality and abnormality. Multiculturalists contend
that all behaviors, whether normal or abnormal, originate from a
cultural context. Psychologists are increasingly recognizing that this
is an inescapable conclusion and that culture plays a major role in our
understanding of human behavior. But what is culture? There are many
definitions of "culture." For our purposes, culture is "shared learned
behavior which is transmitted from one generation to another for
purposes of individual and societal growth, adjustment, and adaptation:
culture is represented externally as artifacts, roles, and

DETERMINING WHAT'S ABNORMAL By most people's standards, the fullbody
tattoos of these three men would probably be considered unusual at best
and bizarre at worst. Yet despite the way their bodies appear, these
three openly and proudly display them at the National Tattoo Convention.
Such individuals may be very "normal" and functional in their work and
personal lives. This leads to an important question: What constitutes
abnormal behavior and how do we recognize it?

institutions, and it is represented internally as values, beliefs,
attitudes, epistemology, consciousness and biological functioning"
(Marsella, 1988, pp. 8--9). Three important points should be
emphasized: 1. Culture is not synonymous with race or ethnic group.
Jewish, Polish, Irish, and Italian Americans represent diverse ethnic
groups whose individual members may share a common racial
classification. Yet their cultural contexts may differ substantially
from one another. Likewise, an Irish American and an Italian American,
despite their different ethnic heritages, may share the same cultural
context. 2. Every society or group that shares and transmits behaviors
to its members possesses a culture. European Americans, African
Americans, Latino/Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders,
Native Americans, and other social groups within the United States have
cultures. A strong argument can be made that hearing impaired or deaf
people also possess a culture (Olkin, 1999) and that "signing"
represents a language. 3. Culture is a powerful determinant of
worldviews (Sue & Sue, 2008a). It affects how we define normal and
abnormal behaviors and how we treat disorders encountered by members of
that culture. Even racial or ethnic groups that possess many
similarities may have quite different cultural constellations.

cultural universality

the assumption that a ﬁxed set of mental disorders exists whose obvious
manifestations cut across cultures the belief that lifestyles, cultural
values, and worldviews affect the expression and determination of
deviant behavior

cultural relativism

These three points give rise to a major problem: one group's definition
of mental illness may not be shared by another. This contradicts the
traditional view of abnormal psychology, which is based on cultural
universality---the assumption that a fixed set of mental disorders
exists whose obvious manifestations cut across cultures (Kim & Berry,
1993; McGoldrick, Giordano, & Garcia-Preto, 2005). This psychiatric
tradition dates back to Emil Kraepelin (discussed later in this
chapter), who believed that depression, sociopathic behavior, and
especially schizophrenia were universal disorders that appeared in all
cultures and societies. Early research supported the belief that these
disorders occurred worldwide, had similar processes, and were more
similar than dissimilar (Howard, 1992). From this flowed the belief that
a disorder such as depression is similar in origin, process, and
manifestation in all societies, such as Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
As a result, no modifications in diagnosis and treatment need be made;
western concepts of normality and abnormality can be considered
universal and equally applicable across cultures. In contrast to the
traditional view of cultural universality has been cultural relativism,
the belief that lifestyles, cultural values, and worldviews affect the
expression and determination of deviant behavior. This concept arose
from the anthropological

Contextual and Cultural Limitations in Deﬁning Abnormal Behavior

CULTURAL RELATIVISM Cultural differences often lead to misunderstandings
and misinterpretations. In a society that values technological
conveniences and clothing that comes from the runways of modern fashion,
the lifestyles and cultural values of others may be perceived as
strange. The Amish, for example, continue to rely on traditional modes
of transportation (horse and buggy). And women in both the Amish and
Islamic cultures wear simple, concealing clothing; in their
circumstances, dressing in any other way would be considered deviant.
Swimsuits and revealing clothes are not allowed in sunbathing or
swimming.

tradition and emphasized the importance of culture and diversity in the
manifestation of abnormal symptoms. For example, a body of research
supports the conclusion that acting-out behaviors (aggressive acts,
antisocial behaviors, and so forth) associated with mental disorders are
much higher in the United States than in Asia and that even Asian
Americans in the United States are less likely to express symptoms via
acting out (Asian American Federation of New York, 2003; Sue & Sue,
2008a; Yang & WonPat-Borja, 2007). Researchers have proposed that Asian
cultural values (restraint of feelings, emphasis on self-control, and
need for subtlety in approaching problems) all contribute to this
restraint. Proponents of cultural relativism also point out that
cultures vary in what they consider to be normal or abnormal behavior.
In some societies and cultural groups, hallucinating (having false
sensory impressions) is considered normal in specific situations. Yet in
the United States, hallucinating is generally perceived to be a
manifestation of a disorder. Which view is correct? Should the criteria
used to determine normality and abnormality be based on cultural
universality or cultural relativism? Few mental health professionals
today embrace the extreme of either position, although most gravitate
toward one or the other. Proponents of cultural universality focus on
the disorder and minimize cultural factors, and proponents of cultural
relativism focus on the culture and on how the disorder is manifested
within it. Both views have validity. It is naive to believe that no
disorders cut across different cultures and share universal
characteristics. For example, even though hallucinating may be viewed as
normal in some cultures, proponents of cultural universality argue that
it still represents a breakdown in biological-cognitive processes.
Likewise, it is equally naive to believe that mental disorders and how
they are manifested are unaffected by cultural values and lifestyle
characteristics of a society (APA, 2000a). A third point to consider is
that some common disorders, such as depression, are manifested similarly
in different cultures. A more fruitful approach to studying
multicultural criteria of abnormality is to explore two questions: •
What is universal in human behavior that is also relevant to
understanding psychopathology? • What is the relationship between
cultural norms, values, and attitudes and the incidence and
manifestation of behavior disorders? These are important questions that
we hope you will ask as we continue our journey into the field of
abnormal psychology. In Chapter 2, we try to address these questions by
presenting a multipath model that takes into consideration biological,
psychological, social, and sociocultural dimensions in understanding the
complexity of the human condition.

controversy

Is Mental Illness a Myth and a Political Construction?

I

n my opinion, mental illness is a myth. People we label "mentally ill"
are not sick, and involuntary mental hospitalization is not treatment.
It is punishment. . . . The fact that mental illness designates a
deviation from an ethical rule of conduct, and that such rules vary
widely, explains why upper-middle-class psychiatrists can so easily ﬁnd
evidence of "mental illness" in lower-class individuals; and why so many
prominent persons in the past ﬁfty years or so have been diagnosed by
their enemies as suffering from some types of insanity. Barry Goldwater
was called a paranoid schizophrenic . . . Woodrow Wilson a neurotic . .
. Jesus Christ, according to two psychiatrists . . . was a born
degenerate with a ﬁxed delusion system. (Szasz, 1970, pp. 167--168)

In a radical departure from conventional beliefs, psychiatrist Thomas
Szasz (1987) has asserted that mental illness is a myth, a ﬁctional
creation by society used to control and change people. According to
Szasz, people may suffer from "problems in living," not from "mental
illness." His argument stems from three beliefs: 1. that abnormal
behavior is so labeled because it is different, not necessarily because
it is a reﬂection of "illness" 2. that unusual belief systems are not
necessarily wrong 3. that abnormal behavior is frequently a reﬂection of
something wrong with society rather than with the individual

According to Szasz, individuals are labeled "mentally ill" because their
behaviors violate the social order and their beliefs challenge the
prevailing wisdom of the times. Szasz ﬁnds the concept of mental illness
to be dangerous and a form of social control used by those in power.
Hitler branded Jews as abnormal. Political dissidents in many countries,
including both China and the former Soviet Union, have often been cast
as mentally ill. And the history of slavery indicates that African
Americans who tried to escape their white masters were often labeled as
suffering from drapetomania, deﬁned as a sickness that makes the person
desire freedom. Few mental health professionals would take the extreme
position advocated by Szasz, but his arguments highlight an important
area of concern. Those who diagnose behavior as abnormal must be
sensitive to individual value systems, societal norms and values, and
potential sociopolitical ramiﬁcations. For Further Consideration 1. What
do you think of Szasz's position? 2. Can you think of examples in which
psychiatric diagnosis may reﬂect differences in culture or political
beliefs?

The Frequency and Burden of Mental Disorders

the percentage of people in a population who suffer from a disorder at a
given point in time

prevalence

lifetime prevalence the total proportion of people in the population who
have ever had a disorder in their lives incidence the onset or
occurrence of a given disorder over some period of time

A student once asked one of the authors, "How crazy is this nation?"
This question, put in somewhat more scientific terms, has occupied
psychologists for some time. Psychiatric epidemiology provides insights
into factors that contribute to the occurrence of specific mental
disorders. To address this question, some terms need to be clarified.
The prevalence of a disorder indicates the percentage of people in a
population who suffer from a disorder at a given point in time; lifetime
prevalence refers to the total proportion of people in the population
who have ever had a disorder in their lives. Incidence refers to the
onset or occurrence of a given disorder over some period of time. From
this information, we can find out how frequently or infrequently various
disturbances occur in the population. We can also consider how the
prevalence of disorders varies by ethnicity, gender, and age and whether
current mental health practices are sufficient and effective. Two of the
most recent, thorough, and comprehensive studies of the incidence of
mental disorders in the U.S. adult population (eighteen years and older)
were conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH, 1985)
and the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Study (NCS-R; Kessler,
Berglund, et al., 2005; Kessler, Chiu, et al., 2005). The NIMH
epidemiological study included a large sample of approximately 20,000
persons, while the NCS-R interviewed 9,282 people in their homes. Both
used categories in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American
Psychiatric Association in the construction of the research instruments.
In the NCS-R study, lifetime prevalence rates for the following were
found: anxiety disorders, 28.8 percent; mood disorders, 20.8 percent;
impulse-control disorders, 24.8 percent; and substance use disorders,
14.6 percent. Lifetime prevalence rates across all four mental disorders
were 46.4 percent.

The Frequency and Burden of Mental Disorders

Percent of group

In the NIMH study, researchers found that although men and women are
equally likely to suffer from mental disorders, they differ in the kinds
of disorders they experience. For example, alcohol abuse or dependence
occurs in 24 percent of men but in only 4 percent of women; drug abuse
is more likely to occur in men; and depression and anxiety are more
likely to occur in women. Age was also an important factor. Alcoholism
and depression are most prominent in the twenty-five- to
forty-four-year-old age group; drug dependence in the eighteen- to
twenty-four-year-old age group; and cognitive impairment in people age
sixty-five and older. Phobias, however, were equally represented at all
ages. Studies on even the young (children and adolescents) suggest that
nearly 17 percent suffer from a serious disorder (Kessler et al., 1994;
Regier et al., 1993). Figure 1.1 summarizes the rates of psychiatric
disorders in various demographic categories. The cost and burden of
mental disorders to our nation are indeed a major source of concern. The
recognition of this problem was the impetus for Mental Health: A Report
of the Surgeon General (U.S. Surgeon General, 1999) and Achieving the
Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America (President's New
Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003), two comprehensive reports on
the state of mental health in our nation. Their conclusions were very
troubling: (1) at least 30 percent of the nation's adults suffer from a
diagnosable mental disorder; (2) 20 percent of children show signs of a
diagnosable disorder in the course of a year; and (3) by the year 2020,
neuropsychiatric disorders in children will increase by 50 percent and
become one of the five most common forms of disability. To indicate the
profound impact mental disorders have on

our health and productivity (lost years of healthy life due to
disability and premature death; DHHS, 1999), mental illness ranked
higher than cancer and all other malignant diseases! More frightening,
however, is the point strongly made in the Surgeon General's report that
many more people suffer from "mental health problems" that do not meet
the criteria for a mental disorder. These problems, the report observes,
may be equally debilitating unless adequately treated. These
epidemiological findings are troubling, to say the least. Clearly,
mental disturbances are widespread, and many persons are currently
suffering from them. What is more troubling is that two-thirds of all
people suffering from diagnosable mental disorders are not receiving or
seeking mental health services (President's New Freedom Commission on
Mental Health, 2003). In addition, spending on mental health services
continues to decline.

Stereotypes About the Mentally Disturbed Americans tend to be suspicious
of people with mental disorders. Are most of them really maniacs who at
any moment may be seized by uncontrollable urges to murder, rape, or
maim? Such portrayals seem to emerge from the news media and the
entertainment industry, but they are rarely accurate. Indeed, the
Virginia Tech incident must be seen in the context of realistic facts;
Cho's actions are a statistical anomaly. Violence in people suffering
from a mental disorder is a rarity (Corrigan & Watson, 2005; Grann &
Langstrom, 2007). People with mental disturbances are subject to rampant
stereotyping and popular misconceptions. It is worthwhile at this point
to dispel the most common of these misconceptions or myths. INCIDENCE OF
ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR By all appearances, this photo seems to depict a
well-functioning group of Columbia University college graduates from
many facets of life. Yet studies reveal that approximately one in three
persons suffers from at least one mental disorder.

Myth vs Reality Myth: Mentally disturbed people can always be recognized
by their deviant abnormal behavior. Reality: Mentally disturbed people
are not always distinguishable from others on the basis of consistently
unusual behavior. Even in an outpatient clinic or a psychiatric ward,
distinguishing patients from staff on the basis of behavior alone is
often difﬁcult. There are two main reasons for this difﬁculty. First, as
already noted, no sharp dividing line usually exists between "normal"
and "abnormal" behaviors. Second, even when people are suffering from
some form of emotional disturbance, that experience may not always be
detectable in their behavior. Myth: The mentally disturbed have
inherited their disorders. If one member of a family has an emotional
breakdown, other members will probably suffer a similar fate.

Stereotypes About the Mentally Disturbed

15

Reality: The belief that insanity runs in certain families has caused
misery and undue anxiety for many people. Heredity does play a role in
some mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and depression, certain
types of mental retardation, and bipolar disorders. However, evidence
suggests that even though heredity may predispose an individual to
certain disorders, environmental factors are also extremely important.
This has led many mental health professionals to posit a biopsychosocial
model of mental disorders in which disorders are the result of an
interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors. Myth:
Mentally disturbed people can never be cured and will never be able to
function normally or hold jobs in the community. Reality: This erroneous
belief has caused great distress to many people who have at some time
been labeled mentally ill. Former mental patients have endured social
discrimination and have been denied employment because of the public
perception that "once insane, always insane." Unfortunately, this myth
may keep former mental patients or those currently experiencing
emotional problems from seeking help. Nearly three-fourths of clients
who are hospitalized with severe disorders will improve and go on to
lead productive lives. Many recovered mental patients make excellent
employees, and employers frequently report that they outperform other
workers in attendance and punctuality. Myth: People become mentally
disturbed because they are weak willed. To avoid emotional disorders or
cure oneself of them, one need only exercise will power. Reality: These
statements show a lack of understanding regarding the nature of mental
disorders. Needing help to resolve difﬁculties does not indicate a lack
of will power. In fact, recognizing one's own need for help may be a
sign of strength rather than a sign of weakness. Many problems stem from
situations that are not under the individual's immediate control, such
as the death of a loved one or the loss of a job. Other problems stem
from lifelong patterns of faulty learning; it is naive to expect that a
simple exercise of will can override years of experience. Myth: Mental
illness is always a deﬁcit, and the person suffering from it can never
contribute anything of worth until cured.

F

amous people who have recovered from mental disorders include President
Abraham Lincoln; 60 Minutes news anchor Mike Wallace; writer Art
Buchwald; former vice president Al Gore's wife, Tipper Gore; and talk
show host Rosie O'Donnell.

Reality: Many persons who suffered from mental illness were never
"cured," but they nevertheless made great contributions to humanity.
Ernest Hemingway, who was one of the great writers of our time and who
won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1954, suffered from lifelong
depression, alcoholism, and frequent hospitalizations. The famous Dutch
painter Vincent van Gogh produced great works of art despite the fact
that he was severely disturbed. Not only did he lead an unhappy and
tortured life, but he also frequently heard voices, and he cut off a
piece of his left ear as a gift to a prostitute. Others, such as Pablo
Picasso and Edgar Allan Poe, contributed major works to humanity while
seriously disturbed. The point of these examples is not to illustrate
that madness and genius go hand in hand but that many who are less
severely disturbed can continue to lead productive and worthwhile lives.
The fact that people suffer from psychological problems does not mean
that their ideas and contributions are less worthy of consideration.
Myth: Mentally disturbed people are unstable and potentially dangerous.
Reality: This misconception has been perpetuated by the mass media. Many
murderers featured on television are labeled "psychopathic," and the
news media concentrate on the occasional mental patient who kills. But
the thousands of mental patients who do not commit crimes, do not harm
others, and do not get into trouble with the law are not news. According
to the Surgeon General's report (DHHS, 1999), there is a small elevation
of risk of violence, especially among individuals with dual diagnosis
(suffering from a mental disorder and substance abuse), but the risk is
minimal (Eronen, Angermeyer, & Schulze, 1998; Swanson, 1994).
Unfortunately, the myth persists.

Historical Perspectives on Abnormal Behavior

S

ome historians do not believe trephining was a therapeutic intervention.
Rather, they believe it was used to remove bone splinters and blood
clots from combat blows to the head (Maher & Maher, 1985). This is
consistent with ﬁndings that most trephined skulls were those of men;
that the skulls possess fractures (suggesting a blow); and that the
holes are usually on the left (resulting from a right-handed assailant).

In this section and the next, we briefly review the historical
development of western thought concerning abnormal behavior. We must be
aware, however, that our journey is necessarily culture-bound and that
other civilizations (nonwestern) have histories of their own. Despite
this limitation, however, it is clear that many current attitudes toward
abnormal behavior, as well as modern ideas about its causes and
treatment, appear to have been influenced by early beliefs. In fact,
some psychologists contend that modern societies have, in essence,
adopted more sophisticated versions of earlier concepts. For example,
the use of electroconvulsive therapy to treat depression is in some ways
similar to ancient practices of exorcism in which the body was
physically assaulted. The Greek physician Hippocrates believed 2,500
years ago that many abnormal behaviors were caused by imbalances and
disorders in the brain and the body, a belief shared by many
contemporary psychologists. Most ideas about abnormal behavior are
firmly rooted in the system of beliefs that operate in a given society
at a given time. We have evolved a humanistic and scientific explanation
of abnormal behavior. It remains to be seen whether such an explanation
will still be thought valid in decades to come. (Much of this history
section is based on discussions of deviant behavior by Alexander &
Selesnick, 1966; Hunter & Macalpine, 1963; Neugebauer, 1979; Spanos,
1978; and Zilboorg & Henry, 1941.)

Prehistoric and Ancient Beliefs

Egyptians in which prayers, noises, emetics, ﬂogging, and starvation

exorcism

Prehistoric societies some half a million years ago did not distinguish
sharply between mental and physical disorders. Abnormal behaviors, from
simple headaches to convulsive attacks, were attributed to evil spirits
that inhabited or controlled the afflicted person's body. According to
historians, these ancient peoples attributed many forms of illness to
demonic possession, sorcery, or the behest of an offended ancestral
spirit. Within this system of belief, called demonology, the victim was
usually held at least partly responsible for the misfortune. It has been
suggested that Stone Age cave dwellers may have treated behavior
disorders with a surgical method called trephining, in which part of the
skull was chipped away to provide an opening through which the evil
spirit could escape. People may have believed that when the evil spirit
left, the person would return to his or her normal state. Surprisingly,
some trephined skulls have been found to have healed over, indicating
that some patients survived this extremely crude operation. Another
treatment method used by the early Greeks, Chinese, Hebrews, and
Egyptians was exorcism. In an exorcism, elaborate prayers, noises,
emetics (drugs that induce vomiting), and extreme measures such as
flogging and starvation were used to cast evil spirits out of an
afflicted person's body.

Naturalistic Explanations (Greco-Roman Thought) With the flowering of
Greek civilization and its continuation into the era of Roman rule (500
b.c.--a.d. 500), naturalistic explanations gradually became distinct
from supernatural ones. Early thinkers, such as Hippocrates (460--370
b.c.), a physician who is often called the father of medicine, actively
questioned prevailing superstitious beliefs and proposed much more
rational and scientific explanations for mental disorders.

Historical Perspectives on Abnormal Behavior

17

Naturalistic explanations relied heavily on observations that form the
foundation of the scientific method. Their explanations denied the
intervention of demons in the development of abnormality and instead
stressed organic causes. Because of these factors, the treatment they
prescribed for mental disorders tended to be more humane than previous
treatments. Hippocrates believed that, because the brain was the central
organ of intellectual activity, deviant behavior was caused by brain
pathology---that is, a dysfunction or disease of the brain. He also
considered heredity and environment important factors in
psychopathology. He classified mental illnesses into three
categories---mania, melancholia, and phrenitis (brain fever)---and for
each category gave detailed clinical descriptions of such disorders as
paranoia, alcoholic delirium, and epilepsy. Many of his descriptions of
symptoms are still used today, eloquent testimony to his keen powers of
observation. To treat melancholia, Hippocrates recommended tranquility,
moderate exercise, a careful diet, abstinence from sexual activity, and,
if necessary, bloodletting. His belief in environmental influences on
behavior sometimes led him to separate disturbed patients from their
families. He seems to have gained insight into a theory popular among
psychologists today: that the family constellation often fosters deviant
behavior in its own members. Other thinkers who contributed to the
organic explanation of behavior were the philosopher Plato and the Greek
physician Galen, who practiced in Rome. Plato (429--347 b.c.) carried on
the thinking of Hippocrates; he insisted that the mentally disturbed
were the responsibility of the family and should not be punished for
their behavior. Galen (a.d. 129--199) made major contributions through
his scientific examination of the nervous system and his explanation of
the role of the brain and central nervous system in mental functioning.
His greatest contribution may have been his codification of all European
medical knowledge from Hippocrates' time to his own.

Reversion to Supernatural Explanations (the Middle Ages) With the
collapse of the Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity, rational and
scientific thought gave way to a reemphasis on the supernatural.
Religious dogma included the beliefs that nature was a reflection of
divine will and beyond human reason and that earthly life was a prelude
to the "true" life (after death). Scientific inquiry---attempts to
understand, classify, explain, and control nature---was less important
than accepting nature as a manifestation of God's will. The Dark Ages
(Fifth Through Tenth Centuries) Early Christianity did little to promote
science and in many ways actively discouraged it. The church demanded
uncompromising adherence to its tenets. Christian fervor brought with it
the concepts of heresy and punishment; certain truths were deemed
sacred, and those who challenged them were denounced as heretics.
Scientific thought that was in conflict with church doctrine was not
tolerated. Because of this atmosphere, rationalism and scholarly
scientific works went underground for many years, preserved mainly by
Arab scholars and European monks. Natural and supernatural explanations
of illness were fused. People came to believe that many illnesses were
the result of supernatural forces, although they had natural causes. In
many cases, the mentally ill were treated gently and with compassion in
monasteries and at shrines, where they were prayed over and allowed to
rest. In other cases, treatment could be quite brutal, especially if
illnesses were believed to be due to God's wrath. Because illness was
then perceived to be punishment for sin, the sick person was assumed to
be guilty of wrongdoing, and relief could come only through atonement or
repentance. During this period, treatment of the mentally ill sometimes
consisted of torturous exorcistic procedures seen as appropriate to
combat Satan and eject him from the possessed person's body. Prayers,
curses, obscene epithets, and the sprinkling of holy water---as well as
such drastic and painful "therapy" as flogging, starving,

CASTING OUT THE CAUSE OF ABNORMALITY During the Middle Ages, people
suffering from mental disorders were often perceived as being victims of
a demonic possession. The most prevalent form of treatment was exorcism,
usually conducted by religious leaders who used prayers, incantations,
and sometimes torturous physical techniques to cast the evil spirit from
the bodies of the afﬂicted.

humane treatments that Hippocrates had advocated centuries earlier were
challenged severely. A time of trouble for everyone, the Dark Ages were
especially bleak for the mentally ill.

lthough the practice of exorcism is ancient, it is still recognized in
Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox, and some Protestant sects. The Church of

persons are not considered evil in themselves, so exorcism is seen as
treatment rather than punishment.

group hysteria in which a great many people exhibit similar symptoms
that have no apparent physical cause

mass madness

Mass Madness (Thirteenth Century) Belief in the power of the
supernatural became so prevalent and intense that it frequently affected
whole populations. Beginning in Italy early in the thirteenth century,
large numbers of people were affected by various forms of mass madness,
or group hysteria, in which a great many people exhibit similar symptoms
that have no apparent physical cause. One of the better known
manifestations of this disorder was tarantism, a dance mania
characterized by wild raving, jumping, dancing, and convulsions. The
hysteria was most prevalent during the height of the summer and was
attributed to the sting of a tarantula. A victim would leap up and run
out into the street or marketplace, jumping and raving, to be joined by
others who believed that they had also been bitten. The mania soon
spread throughout the rest of Europe, where it became known as Saint
Vitus' Dance. Another form of mass madness was lycanthropy, a mental
disorder in which victims imagine themselves to be wolves and imitate
wolves' actions. (Motion pictures about werewolves---people who assume
the physical characteristics of wolves during the full moon---are modern
reflections of this delusion.) How can these phenomena be explained?
Stress and fear are often associated with outbreaks of mass hysteria.
During the thirteenth century, for example, there was enormous social
unrest. The bubonic plague had destroyed one-third of the population of
Europe. War, famine, and pestilence were rampant, and the social order
of the times was crumbling. Witchcraft (Fifteenth Through Seventeenth
Centuries) During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the authority
of the church was increasingly challenged by social and religious
reformers. Reformers such as Martin Luther attacked the corruption and
abuses of the clergy, precipitating the Protestant Reformation of the
sixteenth century. Church officials viewed such protests as
insurrections that threatened their power. According to the church,
Satan himself fostered these attacks.

Historical Perspectives on Abnormal Behavior

19

By doing battle with Satan and with people supposedly influenced or
possessed by Satan, the church actively endorsed an already popular
belief in demonic possession and witches. To counter the threat, Pope
Innocent VIII issued a papal bull (decree) in 1484 calling on the clergy
to identify and exterminate witches. This resulted in the 1486
publication of the extremely influential Malleus Maleficarum (The
Witch's Hammer). The mere existence of this document acted to confirm
the existence of witches, and it also outlined means of detecting them.
For example, red spots on the skin (birthmarks) were supposedly made by
the claw of the devil in sealing a blood pact and thus were damning
evidence of a contract with Satan. Such birth defects as clubfoot and
cleft palate also aroused suspicion. The church initially recognized two
forms of demonic possession: unwilling and willing. God let the devil
seize an unwilling victim as punishment for a sinful life. A willing
person, who made a blood pact with the devil in exchange for
supernatural powers, was able to assume animal form and cause disasters
such as floods, pestilence, storms, crop failures, and sexual impotence.
Although unwilling victims of possession at first received more
sympathetic treatment than that given those who willingly conspired with
the devil, this distinction soon evaporated. People whose actions were
interpreted as peculiar were often suspected of witchcraft. It was
acceptable to use torture to obtain confessions from suspected witches,
and many victims confessed because they preferred death to prolonged
agony. Thousands of innocent men, women, and even children were
beheaded, burned alive, or mutilated. Witch hunts occurred in both
colonial America and in Europe. The witchcraft trials of 1692 in Salem,
Massachusetts, were infamous. Authorities there acted on statements
taken from children who may have been influenced by the sensational
stories told by an old West Indian servant. Several hundred people were
accused, many were imprisoned and tortured, and twenty were killed. It
has been estimated that some twenty thousand people (mainly women) were
killed as witches in Scotland alone and that more than one hundred
thousand throughout Europe were executed as witches from the middle of
the fifteenth to the end of the seventeenth century. It would seem
reasonable to assume that the mentally ill would be especially prone to
being perceived as witches. Indeed, most psychiatric historians argue
that mental disorders were at the roots of witchcraft persecutions
(Alexander & Selesnick, 1966; Deutsch, 1949; Zilboorg & Henry, 1941).
Support for the belief that many accused witches were mentally ill was
based on the following evidence: (1) some witches claimed that they
could do impossible acts (such as fly and cause floods) and thus must
have been deluded (schizophrenic); (2) they participated in sabbats
(nocturnal orgies) and must have been psychopaths or nymphomaniacs; (3)
they evidenced localized sensitivity to pain in various parts of their
bodies and must have been hysterics; and (4) they evidenced symptoms
associated with high suggestibility, delusions, or hallucinations.
Spanos (1978), however, in a comprehensive critical analysis, concluded
that very little support could be found to indicate that accused witches
were mentally ill. Indeed, the lines of evidence just mentioned either
have no basis in fact or were misinterpreted. Sabbats, for example, seem
to have existed only in the imaginations of the witch hunters. Claims of
supernatural powers were obtained from the accused only after prolonged
and painful torture, and trickery was often used to diminish body
sensitivity. It appears that, although some accused witches may have
been mentally ill, most were normal (Schoeneman, 1984).

The Rise of Humanism (the Renaissance) A resurgence of rational and
scientific inquiry during the Renaissance (fourteenth through sixteenth
centuries) led to great advances in science and humanism, a
philosophical movement that emphasizes human welfare and the worth and
uniqueness

of the individual. Until this time, most asylums were at best custodial
centers in which the mentally disturbed were chained, caged, starved,
whipped, and even exhibited to the public for a small fee, much like
animals in a zoo. But the new way of thinking held that if people were
"mentally ill" and not possessed, then they should be treated as though
they were sick. A number of new methods for treating the mentally ill
reflected this humanistic spirit. In 1563, Johann Weyer (1515--1588), a
German physician, published a revolutionary book that challenged the
foundation of ideas about witchcraft. Weyer asserted that many people
who were tortured, imprisoned, and burned as witches were mentally
disturbed, not possessed by demons. The emotional agonies he was made to
endure for committing this heresy are well documented. His book was
severely criticized and banned by both church and state, but it proved
to be a forerunner of the humanitarian perspective on mental illness.
Others eventually followed his lead.

DOROTHEA DIX (1802--1887) During a time when women were discouraged from
political participation, Dorothea Dix, a New England schoolteacher,
worked tirelessly as a social reformer to improve the deplorable
conditions in which the mentally ill were forced to live.

moral treatment movement

movement instituted by Philippe Pinel that resulted in a shift to more
humane treatment of the mentally disturbed

The Reform Movement (Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries) In France,
Philippe Pinel (1745--1826), a physician, was put in charge of La
Bicêtre, a hospital for insane men in Paris. Pinel instituted what came
to be known as the moral treatment movement---a shift to more humane
treatment of the mentally disturbed. He ordered that inmates' chains be
removed, replaced dungeons with sunny rooms, encouraged exercise
outdoors on hospital grounds, and treated patients with kindness and
reason. Surprising many disbelievers, the freed patients did not become
violent; instead, this humane treatment seemed to foster recovery and
improve behavior. Pinel later instituted similar, equally successful
reforms at La Salpêtrière, a large mental hospital for women in Paris.
In England, William Tuke (1732--1822), a prominent Quaker tea merchant,
established a retreat at York for the "moral treatment" of mental
patients. At this pleasant country estate, the patients worked, prayed,
rested, and talked out their problems---all in an atmosphere of kindness
quite unlike that of the lunatic asylums of the time. In the United
States, three individuals---Benjamin Rush, Dorothea Dix, and Clifford
Beers---made important contributions to the moral treatment movement.
Benjamin Rush (1745--1813), widely acclaimed as the father of U.S.
psychiatry, attempted to train physicians to treat mental patients and
to introduce more humane treatment policies into mental hospitals. He
insisted that patients be accorded respect and dignity and that they be
gainfully employed while hospitalized, an idea that anticipated the
modern concept of work therapy. Yet Rush was not unaffected by the
established practices and beliefs of his times: his theories were
influenced by astrology, and his remedies included bloodletting and
purgatives. Dorothea Dix (1802--1887), a New England schoolteacher, was
the preeminent American social reformer of the nineteenth century. While
teaching Sunday school to female prisoners, she became familiar with the
deplorable conditions in which jailed mental patients were forced to
live. (Prisons and poorhouses were commonly used to incarcerate these
patients.) For the next forty years, Dix worked tirelessly for the
mentally ill. She campaigned for reform legislation and funds to
establish suitable mental hospitals and asylums. She raised millions of
dollars, established more than thirty modern mental hospitals, and
greatly improved conditions in countless others. But the struggle for
reform was far from over. Although the large hospitals that replaced
jails and poorhouses had better physical facilities, the humanistic,
personal concern of the moral treatment movement was lacking. That
movement was given further impetus in 1908 with the publication of A
Mind That Found Itself, a book by Clifford Beers (1876--1943) about his
own mental collapse. His book describes the terrible treatment he and
other patients experienced in three mental institutions, where they were
beaten, choked, spat on,

Causes: Early Viewpoints

21

and restrained with straitjackets. His vivid account aroused great
public sympathy and attracted the interest and support of the
psychiatric establishment, including such eminent figures as
psychologist-philosopher William James. Beers founded the National
Committee for Mental Hygiene (forerunner of the National Mental Health
Association, now known as Mental Health America), an organization
dedicated to educating the public about mental illness and about the
need to treat the mentally ill rather than punish them for their unusual
behaviors. It would be naive to believe that these reforms have totally
eliminated inhumane treatment of the mentally disturbed. Books such as
Mary Jane Ward's The Snake Pit (1946) and films such as Frederick
Wiseman's Titicut Follies (1967) were historically important in
documenting the harsh treatment of mental patients. Even the severest
critic of the mental health system, however, would have to admit that
conditions and treatment for the mentally ill have improved in this
century.

Causes: Early Viewpoints Paralleling the rise of humanism in the
treatment of mental illness was an inquiry into its causes. Two schools
of thought emerged. The organic, or biological, viewpoint holds that
mental disorders are the result of physiological damage or disease; the
psychological viewpoint stresses an emotional basis for mental illness.
It is important to note that most people were not extreme adherents of
one or the other. Rather, they tended to combine elements of both. In
the next chapter, we introduce a multipath model that provides an
overarching umbrella to understand the multifactorial nature of mental
disorders.

The Biological Viewpoint Hippocrates' suggestion of an organic
explanation for abnormal behavior was ignored during the Middle Ages but
revived after the Renaissance. Not until the nineteenth century,
however, did the biological or organic view---the belief that mental
disorders have a physical or physiological basis---become important. The
ideas of Wilhelm Griesinger (1817--1868), a German psychiatrist who
believed that all mental disorders had physiological causes, received
considerable attention. Emil Kraepelin (1856--1926), a follower of
Griesinger, observed that certain symptoms tend to occur regularly in
clusters, called syndromes. Kraepelin believed that each cluster of
symptoms represented a mental disorder with its own unique---and clearly
specifiable---cause, course, and outcome. He attributed all disorders to
one of four organic causes: metabolic disturbance, endocrine difficulty,
brain disease, or heredity. In his Textbook of Psychiatry (1883/1923),
Kraepelin outlined a system for classifying mental illnesses on the
basis of their organic causes. That system was the original basis for
the diagnostic categories in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM), the classification system of the American
Psychiatric Association. The acceptance of an organic or biological
cause for mental disorders was accelerated by medical breakthroughs in
the study of the nervous system. The effects of brain disorders, such as
cerebral arteriosclerosis, mental retardation, and senile psychoses, led
many scientists to suspect or advocate organic factors as the sole cause
of all mental illness. And, as we will see in Chapter 2, the drug
revolution of the 1950s made medication available for almost every
disorder. The issues of the therapeutic effectiveness of these drugs and
of how they work, however, are still hotly debated today. The biological
viewpoint gained even greater strength with the discovery of the organic
basis of general paresis, a progressively degenerative and irreversible
physical and mental disorder (paresis is syphilis of the brain). Several
breakthroughs had led scientists to suspect that the deterioration of
mental and physical abilities exhibited by certain mental patients might
actually be caused by an organic disease. The work of Louis Pasteur
(1822--1895) established the germ

theory of disease (invasion of the body by parasitic microorganisms).
Then, in 1897, Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840--1902), a German
neurologist, inoculated paretic patients with pus from syphilitic sores;
when the patients failed to develop the secondary symptoms of syphilis,
Krafft-Ebing concluded that the patients had been previously infected by
that disease. Finally, in 1905, a German zoologist, Fritz Schaudinn
(1871--1906), isolated the microorganism that causes syphilis and thus
paresis. These discoveries convinced many scientists that every mental
disorder might eventually be linked to an organic cause.

The Psychological Viewpoint Some scientists noted, however, that certain
types of emotional disorders were not associated with any organic
disease in the patient. Such observations led to the psychological
view---the belief that mental disorders are caused by psychological and
emotional factors rather than organic or biological ones. For example,
the inability to attain personal goals and resolve interpersonal
conflicts could lead to intense feelings of frustration, depression,
failure, and anger and to consequent disturbed behavior. EMIL KRAEPELIN
(1856--1926) In an 1883 publication, psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin
proposed that mental disorders could be directly linked to organic brain
disorders and further proposed a diagnostic classiﬁcation system for all
disorders.

Mesmerism and Hypnotism The unique and exotic techniques of Friedrich
Anton Mesmer (1734--1815), an Austrian physician who practiced in Paris,
presented an early challenge to the biological point of view. Mesmer
developed a highly controversial treatment that came to be called
mesmerism and that was the forerunner of the modern practice of
hypnotism. Mesmer performed his most miraculous cures in the treatment
of hysteria--- the appearance of symptoms such as blindness, deafness,
loss of bodily feeling, and paralysis that seem to have no organic
basis. According to Mesmer, hysteria was a manifestation of the body's
need to redistribute the magnetic fluid that determined a person's
mental and physical health. His techniques for curing this illness
involved inducing a sleeplike state, during which his patients became
highly susceptible to suggestion. During this state, their symptoms
often disappeared. Mesmer's dramatic and theatrical techniques earned
him censure, as well as fame. A committee of prominent thinkers,
including U.S. ambassador to France Benjamin Franklin, investigated
Mesmer and declared him a fraud. He was finally forced to leave Paris.
Although Mesmer's basic assumptions were discredited, the power of
suggestion proved to be a strong therapeutic technique in the treatment
of hysteria. The cures he effected stimulated scientific interest in,
and much bitter debate about, the psychological view. The Nancy School
About ten years after Mesmer died, a number of researchers began to
experiment actively with hypnosis. Among them was Jean-Martin Charcot
(1825--1893), a neurosurgeon at La Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris and the
leading neurologist of his time. His initial experiments with hypnosis
led him to abandon it in favor of more traditional methods of treating
hysteria, which he claimed was caused by organic damage to the nervous
system. Other experimenters had more positive results using hypnosis,
however, which persuaded Charcot to try it again. His subsequent use of
the technique in the study of hysteria did much to legitimize the
application of hypnosis in medicine. Charcot's conversion was most
influenced by two physicians practicing in the city of Nancy, in eastern
France. First working separately and then together, Ambroise-Auguste
Liébeault (1823--1904) and Hippolyte-Marie Bernheim (1840-- 1919)
hypothesized that hysteria was a form of self-hypnosis. The results they
obtained in treating patients attracted other scientists, who
collectively became known as the "Nancy School." In treating hysterical
patients under hypnosis, they were often able to remove symptoms of
paralysis, deafness, blindness, and anesthesia. They were also able to
produce these symptoms in normal persons through hypnosis. Their work
demonstrated impressively that suggestion could

Contemporary Trends in Abnormal Psychology

23

cause certain forms of mental illness; that is, that symptoms of mental
and physical disorders could have a psychological rather than an organic
explanation. This conclusion represented a major breakthrough in the
conceptualization of mental disorders. Breuer and Freud The idea that
psychological processes could produce mental and physical disturbances
began to gain credence among several physicians who were using hypnosis.
Among them was the Viennese doctor Josef Breuer (1842--1925). He
discovered accidentally that, after one of his female patients spoke
quite freely about her past traumatic experiences while in a trance,
many of her symptoms abated or disappeared. He achieved even greater
success when the patient recalled previously forgotten memories and
relived their emotional aspects. This latter technique became known as
the cathartic method, a therapeutic use of verbal expression to release
pent-up emotional conflicts. It foreshadowed psychoanalysis, whose
founder, Sigmund Freud (1856--1939), was influenced by Charcot and was a
colleague of Breuer's. Freud's theories have had a great and lasting
influence in the field of abnormal psychology. Behaviorism Whereas
psychoanalysis offered an intrapsychic explanation of abnormal behavior,
another viewpoint that emerged during the latter part of this period was
more firmly rooted in laboratory science: behaviorism. The behavioristic
perspective stressed the importance of directly observable behaviors and
the conditions or stimuli that evoked, reinforced, and extinguished
them. As we will see in Chapter 2, behaviorism not only offered an
alternative explanation of the development of both normal and abnormal
behavior but also demonstrated a high degree of success in treating
maladaptive behaviors.

Contemporary Trends in Abnormal Psychology

ANTON MESMER (1734--1815) Mesmer's techniques for treating hysteria by
inducing a sleeplike state in which his patients were highly susceptible
to suggestion was a forerunner of modern hypnotism. Though highly
controversial and ultimately discredited, Mesmer's efforts stimulated
inquiry into psychological and emotional factors, rather than biological
factors, as causes of mental disorders.

Earlier, we made the statement that our current explanations of abnormal
behavior have been heavily influenced by the beliefs of the past. Much
has changed, however, in our understanding and treatment of
psychopathological disorders. Twentieth-century views of abnormality
continue to evolve in the twenty-first century as they incorporate the
effects of several major events and trends in the field: (1) the drug
revolution in psychiatry, (2) the push by psychologists for prescription
privileges, (3) the development of managed health care, (4) an increased
appreciation for research in abnormal psychology, and (5) the influence
of multicultural psychology.

The Drug Revolution in Psychiatry Many mental health professionals
consider the introduction of psychiatric drugs in the 1950s as one of
the great medical advances of the twentieth century (Lickey & Gordon,
1991; Nemeroff, 1998; Norfleet, 2002). Although some might find such a
statement excessive, it is difficult to overemphasize the impact that
drug therapy has had. It started in 1949 when an Australian
psychiatrist, John F. J. Cade, reported on his successful experiments
with lithium in radically calming manic patients who had been
hospitalized for years. Several years later, French psychiatrists Jean
Delay and Pierre Deniker discovered that the drug chlorpromazine (brand
name, Thorazine) was extremely effective in treating agitated
schizophrenics. Within a matter of years, drugs were developed to treat
disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, phobias,
obsessive-compulsive disorders, and anxiety. Large classes of drugs were
developed for depression (antidepressant drugs), anxiety (antianxiety
drugs), and grossly impaired thinking (antipsychotic drugs). These drugs
were considered revolutionary because they rapidly and dramatically
decreased or eliminated troublesome symptoms experienced by patients. As
a result, other forms of therapy became available to the mentally ill,

were shortened and were more cost effective than prolonged
hospitalizations. In addition, they were allowed to return home while
receiving treatment. The new drug therapies were credited with the
depopulation of mental hospitals, often referred to as
deinstitutionalization, which we discuss in more detail in Chapter 17.
This decline can be attributed not to a decrease in new admissions but
rather to shorter stays and earlier releases (Lickey & Gordon, 1991;
Manderscheid & Sonnenschein, 1992; NIMH, 1995). To handle the large
number of patients returning to the community, outpatient treatment
became the primary mode of service for the severely disturbed. In
addition to changing the way therapy was dispensed, the introduction of
psychiatric drugs revived strong belief in the biological bases of
mental disorders (Fox & Sammons, 1998).

The Push by Psychologists for Prescription Privileges One of the major
distinguishing features between psychiatrists and psychologists has been
the right to prescribe medication. Should psychologists have a legal
right to prescribe medication? Within the mental health field, the
opposing answers to this question have been extremely divisive (Albee,
2002; Caccavale, 2002; Hayes & Chang, 2002). Psychologists have
increasingly exerted pressure on state legislatures to allow them to
prescribe medication in treating the mentally disturbed. They have
argued that such a move would be cost effective and benefit the American
public by containing escalating health care costs (Wedding, 1995). Even
though surveys suggest that most nonmedical mental health organizations
favor prescription privileges for psychologists, and even though current
statutes have never stipulated that only physicians can prescribe
medication, the American Medical Association has adamantly opposed any
such move. Although a good part of this stance may be due to
psychiatry's fears of economic losses and the blurring of boundaries
between professions, other reasons are cited as well. The medical
establishment has argued that granting such privileges could endanger
the public because psychologists lack medical training and the expertise
to recognize medical risks and potential drug-interaction effects
(Tatman et al., 1997). Proponents of prescription privileges, on the
other hand, present compelling reasons for approval (Foxhall, 2001;
Gutierrez & Silk, 1998): (1) studies reveal that psychologists would be
more cautious than psychiatrists in prescribing medication, (2) it is a
logical extension of the psychologist's role, (3) psychologists are
equally if not better trained to understand mind-body relationships than
their psychiatric counterparts, and (4) psychologists wishing to
prescribe would be required to pass a rigorous psychopharmacology
curriculum. As of this writing, several states have passed legislation
allowing psychologists to prescribe medication, and statutes are being
considered in others.

The Development of Managed Health Care

managed health care

the industrialization of health care, whereby large organizations in the
private sector control the delivery of services

Managed health care refers to the industrialization of health care,
whereby large organizations in the private sector control the delivery
of services. In the past, psychotherapy was carried out primarily by
individuals in solo offices or in small-group practices. Some clients
paid for services out of their own pockets. Others had health plans that
covered treatment, generally with minimal restrictions on the number of
sessions the client could attend and usually with reimbursable treatment
for a broad array of "psychological problems." The fees, number of
sessions, and types of treatment were determined by the mental health
practitioner. When mental health costs rapidly escalated in the 1980s,
attempts were made to contain costs via managed health care or some form
of health care reform (Cummings, 1995; Hall, 1995; Sammons, 2004). This
industrialization of health care has brought about major changes in the
mental health professions: • Business interests are exerting increasing
control over psychotherapy by determining reimbursable diagnoses,
limiting the number of sessions psychologists may offer clients, and
imposing other such restrictions.

Contemporary Trends in Abnormal Psychology

• Current business practices are depressing the income of practitioners.
Some organizations prefer hiring therapists with master's degrees rather
than those with doctoral degrees, or they reimburse at rates below those
set by the therapist. • Psychologists are being asked to justify the use
of their therapies on the basis of whether they are empirically
based---that is, established treatments with research support. This last
point is especially important. For example, if research reveals that
cognitive-behavioral forms of treatment are more successful than
psychodynamic approaches for a certain form of phobia, then therapy
using the latter approach might be denied by the insurance carrier.
These trends have alarmed many psychologists, who fear that decisions
will be made not so much for health reasons but for business ones, that
the need for doctoral-level practitioners will decrease, and that the
livelihood of clinicians will be threatened. Although no one can say
with certainty whether these fears will be realized, recent studies
suggest that managed care policies are not based on scientific
foundations and that patients are being deprived of adequately skilled
treatment on a massive scale (Holloway, 2004; Scribner, 2001; Seligman &
Levant, 1998). As a result, lawsuits against major health-care plans
over accountability, patient access, and both patient and provider
rights threaten to change the managed care landscape (Holloway, 2004). A
number of class-action lawsuits against some of the nation's largest
managed care providers have accused them of conspiring to reduce and
delay payments to physicians.

An Increased Appreciation for Research Breakthroughs in neuroanatomy,
identification of the role that neurotransmitters play in mental
disorders, and increasing interest in exploring evidence-based forms of
psychotherapy have produced another contemporary trend: a heightened
appreciation for the role of research in the study of abnormal behavior.
The success of psychopharmacology spawned renewed interest and research
into brain-behavior relationships (DHHS, 1999). Indeed, more and more
researchers are now exploring the biological bases (chemical and
structural) of abnormal behavior. Within recent years, biological
factors have been associated with many psychological disorders, such as
depression, suicide, schizophrenia, learning disabilities, alcoholism,
and Alzheimer's disease (Dick & Rose, 2002; Hollon, Thase, & Markowitz,
2002). Currently, researchers are seeking insights into the most
effective means of understanding and treating specific disorders through
studies comparing the effectiveness of drug treatment with that of
cognitive treatment and through the development of empirically based
treatments (Chambless, 1993; Nathan, 1998). The move toward empirically
based treatments is one of the most visible aspects of the profession's
use of research to determine the most effective forms of therapy for
various disorders (Norcross, 2004; Wampold, Lichtenberg, & Waehler,
2002). The early work by the Division of Clinical Psychology Task Force
(Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures,
1995) listed treatments for various disorders as to their effectiveness;
the list can be found at www.apa.org/divisions/div12/rev_est/
index.html. Although the move to evidence-based practice is accepted by
the profession as important, it is not without controversy. Some claim
that the call for empirically based treatments is biased against certain
theoretical orientations (for example, humanistic-existential,
psychodynamic). For example, studies reveal that 60 to 80 percent of
those treatments identified as most effective are cognitive-behavioral
treatments (Norcross, 2004). Others assert that evidence-based practice
is too restrictive and does not recognize clinical intuition and the
dynamic basis of therapy. Further, the majority of disorders identified
are those that can be easily measured and have a discrete but narrow
symptom cluster, such as phobias. What about disorders that are more
global and less susceptible to precise description,

the fact that minorities now constitute an increasing proportion of the

such as alienation in life, feelings of meaninglessness, and so on
(Messer, 2001)? Lastly, as noted earlier, some fear that managed care
companies will use this information to place more restrictions on types
of treatments they are willing to reimburse.

The Inﬂuence of Multicultural Psychology

multicultural psychology

an approach that stresses the importance of culture, race, ethnicity,
gender, age, socioeconomic class, and other similar factors in its
effort to understand and treat abnormal behavior

We are fast becoming a multicultural, multiracial, and multilingual
society (see Figure 1.2). The U.S. Census reveals that within several
decades, racial and ethnic minorities will become a numerical majority
(Sue & Sue, 2008a). These changes have been referred to as "the
diversification of the United States" or, literally, the "changing
complexion of society." Much of this change is fueled by two major
trends in the United States: (1) the increased immigration of visible
racial and ethnic minorities and (2) the differential birthrates among
the various racial and ethnic groups in our society. The "diversity
index," which measures the probability of selecting two randomly chosen
individuals from different parts of the country who differ from each
other in race or ethnicity, stands at 49. In other words, there is
nearly a 50 percent chance that these two individuals would be of a
different race or ethnicity. Nowhere is the explosive growth of
minorities more noticeable than in our public schools, where students of
color now make up 45 percent of those attending. Diversity has had a
major impact on the mental health profession, creating a new field of
study called multicultural psychology. As noted earlier in the chapter,
the multicultural approach stresses the importance of culture, race,
ethnicity, gender, age, socioeconomic class, and other similar factors
in its effort to understand and treat abnormal behavior. There is now
recognition that mental health professionals need to (1) increase their
cultural sensitivity, (2) acquire knowledge of the worldviews and
lifestyles of a culturally diverse population, and (3) develop
culturally relevant therapy approaches in working with different groups
(American Psychological Association, 2003; Sue & Sue, 2008a). Although
issues of race, culture, ethnicity, and gender have traditionally been
ignored or distorted in the mental health literature, these forces are
now increasingly recognized as powerful influences on many aspects of
normal and abnormal human development. Four primary dimensions related
to cultural diversity---social conditioning, cultural values and
influence, sociopolitical influences, and bias in diagnosis---seem to
explain how cultural forces exert their influence. Social Conditioning
How we are raised, what values are instilled in us, and how we are
expected to behave in fulfilling our roles seem to have a major effect
on the type of disorder we are most likely to exhibit. Traditionally in
our culture men have been raised to fulfill the masculine role, to be
independent, assertive, courageous, active, unsentimental, and
objective. Women, in contrast, have been raised to be dependent,

Contemporary Trends in Abnormal Psychology

helpful, fragile, self-deprecating, conforming, empathetic, and
emotional. Some mental health professionals believe that, as a result,
women are more likely to internalize their conflicts (resulting in
anxiety and depression), whereas men are more likely to externalize and
act out (resulting in drug or alcohol abuse and dependence). Although
gender roles have begun to change, their effects continue to be widely
felt. Cultural Values and Inﬂuences Mental health professionals now
recognize that types of mental disorders differ from country to country
and that major differences in cultural traditions among various racial
and ethnic minority groups in the United States may influence their
susceptibility to certain emotional disorders. In 1994, the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric
Association) acknowledged the existence of "culture-bound" syndromes in
other societies. Among Hispanic/Latino Americans and Asian Americans,
experiencing physical complaints is a common and culturally accepted
means of expressing psychological and emotional stress (Santiago-Rivera,
Arredondo, & Gallardo-Cooper, 2002; Yang & WonPat-Borja, 2007). People
with these cultural backgrounds believe that physical problems cause
emotional disturbances and that the emotional disturbances will
disappear as soon as appropriate treatment for the physical illness is
instituted. In addition, mental illness among Asians is seen as a source
of shame and disgrace, although physical illness is acceptable. Asian
values also emphasize restraint of strong feelings. Thus, when stress is
encountered, the mental health professional is likely to hear complaints
involving headaches, fatigue, restlessness, and disturbances of sleep
and appetite.

Did You Know? • Minorities form a majority in onethird of the most
populous U.S. counties. • Over 50 percent of California's population is
composed of minority groups. • 30 percent of New York City residents
were born in other countries. • 70 percent of the population of the
District of Columbia is African American. • 37 percent of the population
of San Francisco is Asian American/ Paciﬁc Islander. • 67 percent of the
population of Detroit is African American. • 67 percent of the
population of Miami is Latino/Hispanic American.

Sociopolitical Inﬂuences In response to a history of prejudice,
discrimination, and racism, many minorities have adopted various
behaviors (in particular, behaviors toward whites) that have proved
important for survival in a racist society (Ridley, 1995; Sue & Sue,
2008a). Mental health professionals may define these behaviors as
abnormal and deviant, yet from the minority group perspective, such
behaviors may function as healthy survival mechanisms. Early personality
studies of African Americans concluded that, as a group, they tend to
appear more "suspicious," "mistrustful," and "paranoid" than their white
counterparts. But are African Americans inherently pathological, as
studies suggest, or are they making healthy responses? Members of
minority groups who have been victims of discrimination and oppression
in a society not yet free of racism have good reason to be suspicious
and distrustful of white society. The "paranoid orientation" may reflect
not only survival skills but also accurate reality testing. We are
pointing out that certain behaviors and characteristics need to be
evaluated not only by an absolute standard but also by the
sociopolitical context in which they arise. Bias in Diagnosis
Epidemiological studies reporting the distribution and types of mental
disorders that occur in the population may be prone to bias on the part
of the clinician and researcher. The mental health professional is not
immune to inheriting the prejudicial attitudes, biases, and stereotypes
of the larger society. Even the most enlightened and well-intentioned
mental health professional may be the victim of race, gender, and social
class bias. One source of bias is the tendency to overpathologize---to
exaggerate the severity of disorders---among clients from particular
socioeconomic, racial, or ethnic groups whose cultural values or
lifestyles differ markedly from the clinician's own. The
overpathologizing of disorders has been found to occur in evaluation of
African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and women (Lopez & Hernandez,
1987; Sue & Sue, 2003). It is clear that one of the most powerful
emerging trends in the mental health field is the increased interest,
appreciation, and respect for multicultural psychology. Understanding
abnormal behavior requires a realistic appraisal of the cultural context
in which behavior occurs and an understanding of how culture influences
the manifestations of

AGE BIAS In making diagnoses and conducting research, clinicians and
researchers must be careful to avoid age bias, as well as race, gender,
and social class biases. Japanese mountaineer Yuichiro Miura set a
record by becoming the oldest man to climb Mount Everest. He was 70
years old and put to shame many climbers decades younger who could not
complete the trek.

I Have It, Too: The Medical Student Syndrome

T

o be human is to encounter difﬁculties and problems in life. A course in
abnormal psychology dwells on human problems---many of them familiar. As
a result, we may be prone to the medical student syndrome: reading about
a disorder may lead us to suspect that we have the disorder or that a
friend or relative has it when indeed that is not the case. This
reaction to the study of abnormal behavior is a common one, and one we
must all guard against. When reading about physical disorders and
listening to lecturers describe illnesses, some medical students begin
to imagine that they themselves have one disorder or another. "Diarrhea?
Fatigue? Trouble sleeping? That's me!" In this way, a cluster of
symptoms---no matter how mild or how brieﬂy experienced---can lead some
people to suspect that they are very sick. Students who take a course
that examines psychopathology may be equally prone to believe that they
have a mental disorder that is described in their text. It is possible,
of course, that some students do suffer from disorders and would beneﬁt
from counseling or therapy. Most, however, are merely experiencing an
exaggerated sense of their susceptibility to disorders. Two inﬂuences in
particular may make us susceptible to these imagined disorders. One is
the universality of the human experience. All of us have experienced
misfortunes

in life. We can all remember and relate to feelings of anxiety,
unhappiness, guilt, lack of self-conﬁdence, and even thoughts of
suicide. In most cases, however, these feelings are normal reactions to
stressful situations, not symptoms of disease. Depression following the
loss of a loved one or anxiety before giving a speech to a large
audience may be perfectly normal and appropriate. Another inﬂuence is
our tendency to compare our own functioning with our perceptions of how
other people are functioning. The outward behaviors of fellow students
may lead us to conclude that they experience few difﬁculties in life,
are self-assured and conﬁdent, and are invulnerable to mental
disturbance. If we were privy to their inner thoughts and feelings,
however, we might be surprised to ﬁnd that they share our apprehension
and insecurities. If you see yourself anywhere in the pages of this
book, we hope you will take the time to discuss your feelings with a
friend or with one of your professors. You may be responding to
pressures that you have not encountered before---a heavy course load,
for example---and to which you have not yet adjusted. Other people can
help point out these pressures to you. If your discussion supports your
suspicion that you have a problem, however, then by all means consider
getting help from your campus counseling and/or health clinic.

abnormality. This recognition led the American Psychological Association
to adopt "Guidelines on Multicultural Education, Training, Research,
Practice, and Organizational Change for Psychologists" (APA, 2003). It
states explicitly that the guidelines "reflect the continuing evolution
of the study of psychology, changes in society at large, and emerging
data about the different needs of particular individuals and groups
historically marginalized or disenfranchised within and by psychology
based on their ethnic/racial heritage and social group identity or
membership" (p. 277).

I M P L I C AT I O N S

As you can see, the study of abnormal psychology is not only complex but
also heavily influenced by the tenor of the times. As we begin our
journey into attempts to explain the causes of certain disorders, we
encourage you not to become rigidly locked into one system or model. It
is our contention that no one model is equally applicable to all
situations, problems, and populations. All have something of worth to
add. And, in reality, few contemporary psychologists or psychiatrists
take the extreme of adhering to just one position. Indeed, most
psychologists believe that mental illness probably springs from a
combination of not only biological and psychological factors but
societal and environmental influences as well. It would be a serious
oversight to neglect the powerful impact on mental health of family
upbringing and influence, the stresses of modern society (unemployment,
poverty, loss of a loved one, adapting to technological change, and so
on), experiences of oppression (prejudice, discrimination,
stereotyping), effects of natural disasters (earthquakes, floods,
hurricanes), human-made conflicts such as wars, and our current battle
against terrorism. In the next chapter, we present a multipath model to
explain the complex interacting biological, psychological, social, and
sociocultural factors that must all be considered in explaining and
treating mental disorders.

Summary 1. What is abnormal psychology? ■ Abnormal psychology is the
scientific study whose objectives are to describe, explain, predict, and
control behaviors that are considered strange or unusual. 2. What
criteria are used to determine normal or abnormal behaviors? ■ Nearly
all definitions include statistical deviation from some normative
standard. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-IV-TR) definition is used by most mental health practitioners. Thus
abnormality is determined by four criteria: distress, deviance,
dysfunction, and dangerousness. 3. How do context and cultural
differences affect definitions of abnormality? ■ Criteria used to define
normality or abnormality must

be considered in light of community standards and changes over time.
What is considered acceptable behavior in urban environments, for
example, may not be considered acceptable in rural communities. With the
increasing diversity in our society, we have also become very sensitive
to how culture and unique group characteristics affect the definition of
psychopathology as well. 4. How common are mental disorders? ■ Over the
course of a lifetime, approximately 30 percent of people suffer from
mental health problems in the United States, and the human and economic
costs are enormous. In addition, two-thirds of all people suffering from
diagnosable mental disorders are not receiving or seeking mental health
services. 5. What are some common misconceptions about the mentally
disturbed? ■ Unfortunately, many myths and stereotypes have emerged
regarding people who suffer from mental disorders. Beliefs that mental
disorders are inherited, incurable, and the result of a weak will and
that those who suffer from them will never contribute to society have
caused undue worry and harm to many. The reality is that most people who
have suffered from mental disorders improve, are little different from
ourselves, and go on to lead normal productive lives. 6. How have
explanations of abnormal behavior changed over time? ■ Ancient peoples
believed in demonology and attributed abnormal behaviors to evil spirits
that inhabited the victim's body. Treatments consisted of trephining,
exorcism, and bodily assaults.

■ Rational

and scientific explanations of abnormality emerged during the
Greco-Roman era. Especially influential was the thinking of Hippocrates,
who believed that abnormal behavior was due to organic, or biological,
causes, such as a dysfunction or disease of the brain. Treatment became
more humane. ■ With the collapse of the Roman Empire and the increased
influence of the church and its emphasis on divine will and the
hereafter, rationalist thought was suppressed, and belief in the
supernatural again flourished. During the Middle Ages, famine,
pestilence, and dynastic wars caused enormous social upheaval. Forms of
mass hysteria affected groups of people. In the fifteenth century, some
of those killed in churchendorsed witch hunts were people we would today
call mentally ill. ■ The

Renaissance brought a return to rational and scientific inquiry, along
with a heightened interest in humanitarian methods of treating the
mentally ill. The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a period
characterized by reform movements.

7.  What were early viewpoints on the causes of mental disorders? ■ In
    the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, major medical breakthroughs
    fostered a belief in the biological roots of mental illness. An
    especially important discovery of this period was the microorganism
    that causes general paresis. Scientists believed that they would
    eventually find organic causes for all mental disorders. ■
    Mesmerism, and later hypnosis, supported another view, however. The
    uncovering of a relationship between hypnosis and hysteria
    corroborated the belief that psychological processes could produce
    emotional disturbances.
8.  What are some contemporary trends in abnormal psychology? ■ Five
    contemporary developments have had a major

influence in the mental health professions: (1) the drug revolution in
psychiatry, which not only allowed many of the more severely disturbed
to be treated outside of a hospital setting but also lent credence to
the biological viewpoint, (2) the push by psychologists for prescription
privileges, (3) the development of managed health care, (4) an increased
appreciation for research in abnormal psychology, and (5) the influence
of multicultural psychology.

teve V., a twenty-one-year-old college student, had been suffering from
a crippling bout of depression. Eighteen months earlier, Steve's friend,
Linda, had broken off their relationship. However, Steve's long
psychiatric history had begun well before he ﬁrst sought help from the
university's psychological services center. Steve had been in and out of
psychotherapy since kindergarten and had been hospitalized twice for
depression when he was in high school. His case records, nearly two
inches thick, contained a number of diagnoses, including labels such as
schizoid personality disorder, schizophrenia (paranoid type), and
bipolar mood disorder. Although his present therapist did not ﬁnd these
labels particularly helpful, Steve's clinical history did provide some
clues to the causes of his problems. Steve V. was born in a suburb of
San Francisco, the only child of an extremely wealthy couple. His
father, who is of Scottish descent, was a prominent businessman who
worked long hours and traveled frequently. On those rare occasions when
he was home, Mr. V. was often preoccupied with business matters and held
himself aloof from his son. The few interactions they had were
characterized by his constant ridicule and criticism of Steve. Mr. V.
was disappointed that his son seemed so timid, weak, and withdrawn.
Steve was extremely bright and did well in school, but Mr. V. felt that
he lacked the "toughness" needed to prosper in today's world. Once, when
Steve was about ten, he came home from school with a bloody nose, crying
and complaining of being picked on by his schoolmates. His father showed
no sympathy; instead, he berated Steve for losing the ﬁght. His father
was fond of quoting the famous Green Bay Packers coach, Vince Lombardi,
"Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing!" In his father's
presence, Steve usually felt worthless, humiliated, and fearful of doing
or saying the wrong thing. Mrs. V. was very active in civic and social
affairs, and she, too, spent relatively little time with her son.
Although she treated Steve more warmly and lovingly than his

father did, she seldom came to Steve's defense when Mr. V. bullied him.
She generally allowed her husband to make family decisions. In reality,
Mrs. V. was quite lonely. She felt abandoned by Mr. V. and harbored a
deep resentment toward him, which she was frightened to express. When
Steve was a child, his mother had often allowed him to sleep in her bed
when her husband was away on business trips. She usually dressed
minimally on these occasions and was very demonstrative---holding,
stroking, and kissing Steve. This behavior had continued until Steve was
twelve, when his mother abruptly refused to let Steve into her bed. The
sudden withdrawal of this privilege had confused and angered Steve, who
was not certain what he had done wrong. He knew, though, that his mother
had been quite upset when she awoke one night to ﬁnd him masturbating
next to her. Most of the time, Steve's parents seemed to live separately
from each other and from their son. Steve was raised, in effect, by a
non-English-speaking maid whose idea of caring for him was to lock him
in his room during the day. He rarely had playmates his own age. His
birthdays were celebrated with a cake, but the only celebrants were
Steve and his mother. By age ten, Steve had learned to keep himself
occupied by playing "mind games," letting his imagination carry him off
on ﬂights of fantasy. He frequently imagined himself as a powerful
ﬁgure---Superman or Batman. His fantasies were often extremely violent,
and his foes were vanquished only after much blood had been spilled. As
Steve grew older, his fantasies and heroes became increasingly menacing
and evil. When he was ﬁfteen, he obtained a pornographic video that he
watched repeatedly in his room. Often, Steve would masturbate as he
watched scenes of women being sexually violated. The more violent the
acts against women, the more aroused he became. Steve now recalls that
he spent much of his spare time between the ages of ﬁfteen and seventeen
watching X-rated videos or violent movies, his favorite being The Texas
Chainsaw Massacre, in which a madman saws and hacks women to pieces.
Steve always identiﬁed with the character perpetrating the outrage; at
times, he imagined his parents as the victims. At about age sixteen,
Steve became convinced that external forces were controlling his mind
and behavior and were drawing him into his fantasies. He was often ﬁlled
with guilt and anxiety after one of his mind games. Although he was
strongly attracted to his fantasy world, he also felt that something was
wrong with it and with him. After seeing the movie The Exorcist, he
became convinced that he was possessed by the devil. Up until this time,
Steve had been quiet and withdrawn. In kindergarten the school
psychologist had described his condition as "autistic-like" because
Steve seldom spoke, seemed unresponsive to the environment, and was
socially isolated. With the development of his interest in the occult
and in demonic possession, however, he became

31

outgoing, ﬂamboyant, and even exhibitionistic. Against his will, Steve
was hospitalized twice by his parents with diagnoses of bipolar
affective disorder and schizophrenia in remission. Mr. V. often
suggested that Steve had inherited "bad genes" from his wife's side of
the family because one of Mrs. V's brothers had suffered from a history
of mental illness.

What do you make of Steve? He certainly fulfills our criteria as someone
suffering from a mental disorder. Yet how do we make sense of his
bizarre behaviors, thoughts, and feelings? Where do they come from? Is
Steve correct in his belief that he is possessed by evil spirits? Is his
father correct in suggesting that "bad genes" caused his disorder? What
role did his upbringing, isolation, and bullying from his father play in
the development of his problems? These complex questions lead us into a
very important aspect of abnormal psychology: the etiology, or causes,
of disorders.

One-Dimensional Models of Mental Disorders

etiology

causes of disorders

In the previous chapter, we described how the rise of humanism
influenced society's attitude toward mental disorders. As rational
thought replaced superstition in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, the mentally disturbed were increasingly regarded as
unfortunate human beings who deserved humane treatment, not as monsters
inhabited by the devil. This humanistic view gave rise, in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, to two different schools of
thought about the causes of mental disorders. According to one group of
thinkers, mental disorders are caused primarily by biological problems,
and the disturbed individual is displaying symptoms of physical disease
or damage. The second group of theorists believed that abnormal behavior
is essentially psychosocial, rooted not in cells and tissues but in the
invisible complexities of the human mind or in stressful environmental
forces. Today we realize that these two perspectives are overly
simplistic because they (1) set up a false "either/or" dichotomy between
nature and nurture, (2) fail to recognize the reciprocal influences of
one on the other, and (3) mask the importance of acknowledging the
biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural dimensions in the
origin of mental disorders. In this chapter, we propose a multipath
model for explaining abnormal behavior that integrates these four major
dimensions. Before we begin, however, let's look at how one-dimensional
models have traditionally explained Steve's psychopathology. •
Biological Explanations Adherents to the biological perspective would
say that Steve's mental disorders are caused by some form of biological
malfunctioning. Steve's problems reside in a possible genetic
predisposition to mental disorders, an imbalance of brain chemistry, or,
perhaps, in structural abnormalities in his neurological makeup. The
fact that he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and a bipolar affective
disorder (both disorders that have an increased probability of being
present in blood relatives) seems to support such an explanation.
Although biological explanations acknowledge that environmental
influences are important, they are seen as secondary in the
manifestation of psychopathology. • Psychological Explanations From a
psychological perspective, there are a variety of ways to explain
Steve's behavior. Psychodynamic explanations would stress that Steve's
problems reside in his early childhood experiences, his inability to
confront his own intense feelings of hostility toward his father (fears
of castration), and his unresolved sexual longing toward his mother.
Behavioral explanations would trace the roots of Steve's problems to his
behavioral repertoire. Many of the behaviors he has learned are
inappropriate, and his

One-Dimensional Models of Mental Disorders

33

repertoire lacks useful, productive behaviors. Other explanations might
stress the development of irrational beliefs and Steve's distorted
thinking that leads to his "mind games" (misinterpretations of reality).
• Social Explanations From a social or social-relational perspective,
Steve's problem resides in the family system, which is therefore the
primary unit of analysis. Although Steve is manifesting the disorders,
his father and mother are also suffering, and their pathological
symptoms are reflected in Steve. As long as Steve is the "identified
patient" and is seen as "the problem," Mr. and Mrs. V. can continue in
their mutual self-deception that all is well between them. It is obvious
that the relationships between Steve and his father, between Steve and
his mother, and between his father and his mother are unhealthy. The
constant bullying of Steve by his father and the lack of support by his
mother are the primary culprits. • Sociocultural Explanations The
societal and cultural context in which Steve's problems arise must be
considered in understanding his dilemma. He is a white European American
of Scottish descent, born to a wealthy family in the upper socioeconomic
class. He is a male, raised in a cultural context that values individual
achievement and competitiveness. One might argue, for example, that
Steve's father values American individualistic competitiveness and
achievement in the extreme. He has succeeded by his own efforts, but
unfortunately, his success has come at the emotional cost of his family.
Further, because Steve does not live up to these benchmarks of
masculinity, he is considered a failure by his father. To truly
understand Steve, we must recognize that multicultural variables---race,
ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, and so
on---are powerful factors. As such, they influence the types of
sociocultural stressors Steve is likely to experience and the ways in
which he will manifest disorders.

Using Models to Describe Psychopathology As evidenced by the preceding
analysis of Steve, all four explanations seem to contain kernels of
truth. But which is more accurate? Does accepting the validity of one
perspective preempt the applicability of another? Is it possible that
combinations of biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural
factors all interact and contribute to Steve's mental disorder? To
answer these questions, let's first examine how scientists use analogies
to discuss a phenomenon that is difficult to describe or explain. A
diagnosis such as "schizophrenia," for example, is generally inferred
and made more understandable by likening the phenomenon to something
more concrete. A model is an analogy that scientists often use to
describe a phenomenon or process that they cannot directly observe. In
using an analogy, the scientist borrows terms, concepts, or principles
from one field and applies them to another, as when a physician
describes the eye as a "camera." Psychologists have used models
extensively to help conceptualize the causes of abnormal behavior, to
ask probing questions, to determine relevant information and data, and
to interpret data. For example, when psychologists refer to people as
"patients" or speak of deviant behavior as "mental illness," they are
borrowing the terminology of medicine and applying a medical model of
abnormal behavior. They may also describe certain external symptoms
(such as snake phobia or motor tics) as being visible signs of deep
underlying conflict. Again, the medical analogy is clear: just as
fevers, rashes, perspiration, or infections may be symptoms of a
bacterial or viral invasion of the body, bizarre behavior may be a
symptom of a mind "invaded" by unresolved conflicts. Psychologists use a
variety of such models, each embodying a particular theoretical
approach. Hence we tend to use the terms model, theory, viewpoint, and
perspective somewhat interchangeably. Most theorists realize that the
models they construct will be limited and will not correspond in every
respect to the phenomena they are studying (Brooks-Harris, 2008).
Because of the complexity of human behavior and our relatively shallow
understanding of it, psychologists do not expect to develop the
definitive model.

Rather, they use the models to visualize psychopathology as if it truly
worked in the manner described. Models of psychopathology, whether they
are biological, psychological, or multicultural, enable us to organize
and make sense of the complexity of data related to the disturbance
being studied. Models, however, can foster a one-dimensional and linear
explanation of a mental disorder that limits the ability to consider
other perspectives. If, for example, we use a psychological explanation
of Steve's behavior and consider his problems to be rooted in
unconscious incestuous desires for his mother and ambivalent
competitiveness toward his father (a psychodynamic explanation), we may
unintentionally ignore all research findings pointing to powerful
biological causes of certain disorders such as schizophrenia and
depression.

A Multipath Model of Mental Disorders

multipath model a model of models that provides an organizational
framework for understanding the numerous causes of mental disorders, the
complexity of their interacting components, and the need to view
disorders from a holistic framework

Nearly all texts on abnormal psychology expose students to a variety of
theories that purport to explain mental disorders. For example, students
may hear of how researchers have made breakthroughs in the genetics of a
disorder, how the unconscious mind may influence one's behaviors, why
irrational thoughts or distorted thinking lead to pathology, or how
learned inappropriate behaviors may be culprits. Because psychologists
may favor one model over another, textbooks have typically presented
different theories as if each alone can explain a disorder or as if each
has equal validity. Research shows, however, that disorders are caused
by factors that cross various theories. For instance, in the case of
Steve V., genetics and brain functioning (a biological perspective) may
interact with ways of thinking (a cognitive perspective) in a given
cultural group (a sociocultural perspective) to produce abnormal
behavior. What, then, is the "best" way to conceptualize the causes of
mental disorders? We propose an integrative and interacting multipath
model as a way of viewing disorders and their causes. The multipath
model is not a theory but a way of looking at the variety and complexity
of contributors to mental disorders. In some respects it is a metamodel,
a model of models that provides an organizational framework for
understanding the numerous causes of mental disorders, the complexity of
their interacting components, and the need to view disorders from a
holistic framework. The multipath model operates under several
assumptions: (1) No one theoretical perspective is adequate to explain
the complexity of the human condition and the development of mental
disorders. (2) There are multiple pathways to and causes of any single
disorder. It is a statistical rarity to find a disorder due to only one
cause. (3) Explanations of abnormal behavior must consider biological,
psychological, social, and sociocultural elements. (4) Not all
dimensions contribute equally to a disorder. The model is guided by the
state of research and scientific findings as to the relative merits of a
proposed cause. In some cases, greater support for a biological
perspective, for example, may be present, but this may evolve as
research enlightens us about the contributions of other factors. (5) The
multipath model is an integrative and interactive one. It acknowledges
that factors may combine in complex and reciprocal ways so that people
exposed to the same factors may not develop the same disorder and that
different individuals exposed to different factors may develop a similar
mental disorder. Let's look at how the multipath model operates under
these assumptions. First, the etiology of mental disorders can be
subsumed under four dimensions, as shown in Figure 2.1: • Dimension One:
Biological Factors This dimension includes genetics, brain anatomy,
biochemical imbalances, central nervous system functioning, autonomic
nervous system reactivity, and so forth. • Dimension Two: Psychological
Factors This dimension includes personality, cognition, emotions,
learning, stress coping, self-esteem, self-efficacy, values,
developmental history, and so forth.

factors found to be important in explaining abnormal behavior.

• Dimension Three: Social Factors This dimension includes family,
relationships, social support, belonging, love, marital status,
community, and so forth. • Dimension Four: Sociocultural Factors This
dimension includes race, gender, sexual orientation, religion,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, culture, and so forth. These four
dimensions vary in whether a micro (narrow and within the person) or
macro (broad and outside of the person) approach is taken. Within each
dimension, how the multiplicity of factors are organized to explain
abnormal behavior depends on a particular theoretical perspective.
First, let's take the psychological dimension as an example.
Psychodynamic theories might emphasize the importance of childhood
experiences in the formation of abnormal behavior; learning theories
would emphasize learning and personality; and cognitive theories would
emphasize cognition and thinking. Thus it is possible to have
considerable differences even within a categorical dimension. Likewise,
we note that some theories can be categorized in more than one
dimension. TheoDIMENSION 1 ries of stress, for example, could be seen as
falling Biological under the psychological or the social dimension. It
is therefore best to view these four dimensions as having permeable
boundaries with considerable overlap. Second, factors in the four
dimensions can interDIMENSION 4 DIMENSION 2 Sociocultural Psychological
act and influence each other in any direction. For example, research
shows that brain functioning affects behaviors. However, research also
demonstrates that engaging in certain behaviors can affect brain
functioning. We also know that sociocultural factors can influence
biological factors (an example DIMENSION 3 Social of a macro-level
variable influencing a micro-level variable). The actual situation is
much more complex because the interaction of factors may involve all
four dimensions, as noted in Figure 2.2. FIGURE THE FOUR DIMENSIONS AND

THE NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS THAT MAY LEAD TO PARTICULAR DISORDERS The
dimensions shown are examples only because any of them can serve to
inﬂuence a particular disorder.

instance, let's assume that a woman suffers from severe depression. Her
depression may be caused by a single factor (e.g., the death of a loved
one) or by an interaction of factors in different dimensions (e.g.,
child abuse occurring in early life and stressors in adulthood). Thus a
disorder such as depression may be caused by a single factor or by
different combinations of factors, as noted in Figure 2.3. Fourth, many
disorders appear to be heterogeneous in nature. Therefore, there may be
different types or versions of a disorder (or a spectrum of the
disorder). For example, schizophrenia appears to be composed of a group
of different but related disorders. Likewise, there may be different
types of depression that are caused by different factors. For example,
severe cases of depression seem to have a stronger genetic basis than
less severe cases. Finally, different disorders may be caused by similar
factors. For example, anxiety, as well as depression, may be caused by
child abuse and interpersonal stress. In fact, anxiety and depression
often occur concurrently in people. It can be seen that finding causes
of abnormal behavior is complex. Although a multipath model helps to
conceptualize the complexities, the reality is that our research is
currently insufficient to precisely link different dimensions of
analysis for most disorders. By proposing a multipath model, we do not
imply that disorders can be caused by any events or by random events.
Rather, certain combinations of factors increase the likelihood of
disorders. These factors often occur in different dimensions. They
account for commonalities as well as uniqueness in disorders. That is,
they can help predict the occurrence and nonoccurrence of disorders and
provide insight into means of controlling disorders. Our task is to
identify linkages in different dimensions and the meaningfulness of the
linkages in explaining and controlling abnormal behaviors. The multipath
model is similar to other multifactor approaches that involve
biopsychosocial factors and their interaction, such as the
diathesis-stress model, which we discuss later (Meehl, 1970; Rosenthal,
1970). However, the model allows for even greater complexity in
conceptualizing the etiology of disorders. To aid in understanding more
thoroughly the contributions of each of the four dimensions, we discuss
them in the following sections.

Dimension One: Biological Factors Modern biological explanations of
normal and abnormal behavior continue to share certain assumptions: (1)
The things that make people who they are---their physical features,
susceptibility to diseases, temperaments, and ways of dealing with
stress--- are embedded in the genetic material of their cells. (2) Human
thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are associated with nerve cell
activities of the brain and spinal cord. (3) A change in thoughts,
emotions, or behaviors will be associated with a change in activity or
structure (or both) of the brain. (4) Mental disorders are highly
correlated with some form of brain or other organ dysfunction. (5)
Mental disorders can be treated by drugs or somatic intervention
(Cottone, 1992; Kolb, Gibb, & Robinson, 2003; Strohman, 2001; U.S.
Surgeon General, 1999). Biological models have been heavily influenced
by the neurosciences, a group of subfields that focus on brain
structure, function, and disorder. Understanding biological

Dimension One: Biological Factors

37

explanations of human behavior requires knowledge about the structure
and function of the central nervous system (composed of the brain and
spinal cord). Especially important is knowledge about how the brain is
organized, how it works, and, particularly, the chemical reactions that
enhance or diminish normal brain actions.

Myth vs Reality Myth: We should attempt to clearly identify those
disorders that have a biological base and those that do not. Disorders
that are shown to originate from biological causes warrant exclusive
biological interventions. Disorders that are caused psychologically
should be treated through psychological means. Reality: Although it is
important to identify biological and psychological correlates of
psychopathology, this dichotomous and simplistic thinking is unfortunate
and has served to hinder integrated approaches to explaining and
treating mental disorders. We now realize, for example, that gene
activity and changes in biology are inﬂuenced by the psychological
environment and vice versa. The relationship between the biological and
psychological makeup of people is complex and interrelated (Plomin &
McGufﬁn, 2003). DSM-IV-TR, for example, states explicitly that the
mind-body dualism is a false one. There is much that is
biological/physical in "mental disorders" and much that is mental in
"physical disorders."

The Human Brain The brain is composed of billions of neurons, or nerve
cells that transmit messages throughout the body. The brain is
responsible for three very important and highly complicated functions.
It receives information from the outside world, it uses the information
to decide on a course of action, and it implements decisions by
commanding muscles to move and glands to secrete. Weighing approximately
three pounds, this relatively small organ continues to amaze and mystify
biological researchers. The brain is separated into two hemispheres. A
disturbance in either one (such as by a tumor or by electrical
stimulation with electrodes) may produce specific sensory or motor
effects. Each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body. For
example, paralysis on the left side of the body indicates a dysfunction
in the right hemisphere. In addition, the right hemisphere is associated
with visual-spatial abilities and emotional behavior. The left
hemisphere controls the language functions for nearly all right-handed
people and for most left-handed ones. Viewed in cross-section, the brain
has three parts: forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Although each part
is vital for functioning and survival, the forebrain is probably the
most relevant to a discussion of abnormality. The Forebrain The
forebrain probably controls all the higher mental functions associated
with human consciousness, learning, speech, thought, and memory. Within
the forebrain are the thalamus, hypothalamus, reticular activating
system, limbic system, and cerebrum (see Figure 2.4). The specific
functions of these structures are still being debated, but we can
discuss their more general functions with some confidence. The thalamus
appears to serve as a "relay station," transmitting nerve impulses from
one part of the brain to another. The hypothalamus ("under the
thalamus") regulates bodily drives, such as hunger, thirst, and sex, and
body conditions, such as temperature and hormone balance. The limbic
system is involved in experiencing and expressing emotions and
motivation---pleasure, fear, aggressiveness, sexual arousal, and pain.
The largest structure in the brain is the cerebrum, with its most
visible part, the cerebral cortex, covering the midbrain and thalamus.
The Midbrain and Hindbrain The midbrain and hindbrain also have distinct
functions: • The midbrain is involved in vision and hearing and---along
with the hindbrain---in the control of sleep, alertness, and pain.
Mental health professionals are especially interested in the midbrain's
role in manufacturing chemicals---serotonin, norepinephrine, and
dopamine---that have been implicated in certain mental disorders.

n 2007, a thirty-eight-year-old man, mute and unconscious for ﬁve years
due to a severe head injury, regained consciousness via electrical brain
stimulation. Neuroscientists implanted two wire electrodes in his
thalamus and passed a mild current through his brain. When the current
was turned on, neuronal ﬁring increased in the intact pathways, leading
to increased arousal and awakening. Unfortunately, when the current was
turned off, the patient relapsed. Nevertheless, this procedure shows
promise for treatment of brain injuries (Carey, 2007).

• The hindbrain also manufactures serotonin. The hindbrain appears to
control functions such as heart rate, sleep, and respiration. The
reticular formation, a network of nerve fibers that controls bodily
states such as sleep, alertness, and attention, starts in the hindbrain
and threads its way into the midbrain. Because the brain controls all
aspects of human functioning, it is not difficult to conclude that
damage or interruption of normal brain function and activity could lead
to observable mental disorders. There are, of course, many biological
causes for psychological disorders. Damage to the nervous system is one:
As Fritz Schaudinn demonstrated (see Chapter 1), general paresis results
from brain damage caused by parasitic microorganisms. Tumors, strokes,
excessive intake of alcohol or drugs, and external trauma (such as a
blow to the head) have also been linked to cognitive, emotional, and
behavioral disorders.

Biochemical Theories Two specific biological sources---body chemistry
and heredity---have given rise to important biological theories of
psychopathology. The basic premise of biochemical theories is that
chemical imbalances underlie mental disorders. This premise relies on
the fact that most physiological and mental processes, from sleeping and
digestion to reading and thinking, involve chemical actions within the
body. Support for the biochemical theories has been found in research
into anxiety disorders, mood disorders (both depression and bipolar
disorder), Alzheimer's disease, autism, dyslexia, and schizophrenia
(Andreasen, 2005; Lickey & Gordon, 1991; Plomin, Owen, & McGuffin,
1994). Some researchers have even claimed that our gene pool affects
such characteristics as alienation, leadership, career choice, risk
aversion, religious conviction, and pessimism (Colt & Hollister, 1998).
To see how biochemical imbalances in the brain can result in abnormal
behavior, we need to understand how messages in the brain are
transmitted from nerve cell to nerve cell. Nerve cells (neurons) vary in
function throughout the brain and may appear different, but they all
share certain characteristics. Each neuron possesses a cell membrane
that separates it from the outside environment and regulates the
chemical contents within it. On one end of the cell body are dendrites,
numerous short rootlike structures whose function is to receive signals
from other neurons. At the other end is an axon, a much longer extension
that sends signals to other neurons, some a considerable distance away.
Under an electron microscope, dendrites can be distinguished by their
many short branches (see Figure 2.5).

Dimension One: Biological Factors

Messages travel through the brain by electrical impulses via neurons: an
incoming message is received by a neuron's dendrites and is sent down
the axon to bulblike swellings called axon terminals, usually located
near dendrites of another neuron. Note that neurons do not touch one
another. A minute gap (the synapse) exists between the axon of the
sending neuron and the dendrites of the receiving neuron (see Figure
2.6). The electrical impulse crosses the synapse when the axon releases
chemical substances called neurotransmitters. When the neurotransmitters
reach the dendrites of the receiving neuron, they attach themselves to
receptors and, if their "shapes" correspond, bind with them (see Figure
2.7). The binding of transmitters to receptors in the neuron triggers
either a synaptic excitation (encouragement to produce other nerve
impulses) or synaptic inhibition (a state preventing production of nerve
impulses). The human body has many different chemical transmitters, and
their effect on neurons varies (see Table 2.1). An imbalance of certain
neurotransmitters in the brain is believed to be implicated in mental
disorders. As discussed in Chapter 1, the search for chemical causes and
cures for mental problems accelerated tremendously in the early 1950s
with the discovery of psychoactive drugs. Since that time, three
convincing lines of evidence have contributed to the search for
biochemical causes and cures:

receptors (a structural explanation) or that their receptors may be
supersensitive to dopamine. The effect of drug therapy on receptor sites
has been shown with other disorders. Drugs used to treat depression
alter norepinephrine and serotonin sensitivity and receptivity at the
receptor sites. Drugs used in the treatment of anxiety affect receptor
reactivity to GABA. Research into biochemical mechanisms holds great
promise for our understanding and treatment of mental disorders. It
appears unlikely, however, that biochemistry alone can provide
completely satisfactory explanations of the biological bases of abnormal
behavior. Researchers should instead expect to find hundreds---or
perhaps even thousands--- of pieces in the biological puzzle.

Genetic Explanations Research strongly indicates that genetic makeup
plays an important role in the development of certain abnormal
conditions. There is strong Synapse evidence that autonomic nervous
system (ANS) reactivity is inherited in human beings; that is, a person
may be born with an ANS that makes an unusually strong response to
stimuli (Andreasen, 2005; Baker & Binding Clark, 1990). Other studies
(Carey & DiLalla, 1994; Cloninger, et al. 1986; Gatz, 1990; Plomin et
al., 1994) implicate heredity as a causal factor in alcoholism,
schizophrenia, and depression. To show that a particular disorder is
inherited, however, researchers must demonstrate Receptor sites
Nonbinding that it could not be caused by environmental factors alone,
that closer genetic relationships produce greater similarity of the
disorder in human Dendrite beings, and that people with these problems
have similar biological and behavioral patterns (Siegel, 1990).
Biological inheritance is transmitted by genes. A person's genetic

Interaction between the genotype Neurotransmitters are released into the
synapse and and the environment results in the person's phenotype, or

example, characteristics such as eye color are deterinto the receptor

other physical characteristics, such as height, are determined partly by
the genetic code and partly by environmental factors. Adults who were
undernourished as children will be shorter than the height they were
genetically capable of reaching, but even the most effective nutrition
would not have caused them to grow taller than their "programmed" height
limit. Perhaps the greatest breakthrough in our attempt to understand
the impact of genes on human life comes from the accomplishments of the
Human Genome Project (HGP). In June 2000, it was announced that the
locations of all genes had been mapped in the nucleus of a human cell,
and approximately a year later researchers also completed its sequencing
(the order of the DNA chemical subunits in each cell). Often referred to
as the "map of life" or the "total body manual," the HGP was successful
in creating a basic blueprint of the entire genetic material found in
each cell of the body. The human genome is composed of all the genetic

organism and is the most complex makeup instruction manual ever
conceived on how the body works. Many scientists believe that the

MAJOR NEUROTRANSMITTERS AND THEIR EFFECTS NEUROTRANSMITTER

SOURCE AND FUNCTION

Acetylcholine (ACH)

One of the most widespread neurotransmitters. Occurs in systems that
control the muscles and in circuits related to attention and memory.
Reduction in levels associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Dopamine

Concentrated in small areas of the brain, one of which is involved in
the control of the muscles. In excess, dopamine can cause
hallucinations. Associated with schizophrenia.

Endorphins

Found in the brain and spinal cord. Suppresses pain.

Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)

Widely distributed in the brain. Works against other neurotransmitters,
particularly dopamine.

Norepinephrine

Occurs widely in the central nervous system. Regulates moods and may
increase arousal and alertness. Often associated with mood disorders and
eating disorders.

Serotonin

Occurs in the brain. Works more or less in opposition to norepinephrine,
suppressing activity and causing sleep. Linked with anxiety disorders,
mood disorders, and eating disorders.

degeneration of the nervous system. The genes associated with hereditary
diseases such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, neurofibromatosis,
and retinoblastoma have been identified as well. Proponents of the HGP
speculate that findings may offer a way of understanding the causes,
prevention, and treatment for many types of sleep disorders, addictions,
obesity, cancer, heart disease, and sickle cell anemia (Netting, 2001).
Already, a new field called pharmacogenomics, the science of
understanding the correlation between a patient's genetic makeup and his
or her response to drug treatment, has drug manufacturers poised to
develop more effective pharmacological treatments.

Biology-Based Treatment Techniques Biological or somatic treatment
techniques use physical means to alter the patient's physiological state
and hence his or her psychological state (Andreasen, 2005; Kolb et al.,
2003; Miller & Keller, 2000). As our understanding of human physiology
and brain functioning has increased, so has our ability to provide more
effective biologically based therapies for the mentally ill (U.S.
Surgeon General, 1999). Psychopharmacology Psychopharmacology is the
study of the effects of drugs on the mind and on behavior; it is also
known as medication or drug therapy. Medication is now widely used
throughout the United States: more mental patients receive drug therapy
than receive all other forms of therapy combined (Levinthal, 2005). The
four large classes of medication are (1) antianxiety drugs (or minor
tranquilizers), (2) antipsychotic drugs (or major tranquilizers), (3)
antidepressant drugs (which relieve depression by elevating one's mood),
and (4) antimanic drugs (such as lithium). Many of these drugs are
discussed more thoroughly in the context of specific disorders in
forthcoming chapters. Antianxiety drugs (minor tranquilizers) such as
propanediols (meprobamate compounds) and benzodiazepines are the
preferred medications to calm and reduce anxiety in people. Researchers
first developed meprobamate (the generic name of Miltown and Equanil)
for use as a muscle relaxant and anxiety reducer. Within a few years, it
was being prescribed for patients who complained of anxiety and
nervousness or who had psychosomatic problems. Soon other drugs, such as
the benzodiazepines (Librium and Valium), also entered the market.
Studies suggest that the benzodiazepines work by binding to specific
receptor sites at the synapses and blocking transmission (Hayward,
Wardie, & Higgitt, 1989).

Although antianxiety medications reduce anxiety in patients, they have
minimal impact on the hallucinations and distorted thinking of highly
agitated patients and patients with schizophrenia. In 1950, a synthetic
antipsychotic drug (major tranquilizer) was developed in France called
chlorpromazine (the generic name of Thorazine). It had an unexpected
tranquilizing effect that decreased patients' interest in the events
around them and significantly reduced psychotic symptoms (believed to be
a biochemical effect of blocking dopamine receptors). Within less than a
year after its introduction, some 2 million patients used Thorazine.
Thereafter, a number of other major tranquilizers were developed, mainly
for patients with schizophrenia. Antidepressant drugs help individuals
feel less depressed. Three large classes of the medication compounds
have been identified: monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclics, and
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (a type of tricyclic). Monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are antidepressant compounds that are
believed to correct the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain. They
block the action of monoamine oxidase, thereby preventing the breakdown
of norepinephrine and serotonin. More frequently used in cases of
depression are the tricyclics, antidepressant compounds that relieve
symptoms of depression and seem to work like the MAOIs but produce fewer
of the side effects associated with prolonged drug use. The medication
imipramine, a tricyclic, has been at least as effective as psychotherapy
in relieving the symptoms of depression (Elkin et al., 1995).
Increasingly, however, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
have become the preferred choice for treating depression. They work by
inhibiting the central nervous system's neuronal uptake of serotonin---a
mechanism that appears to be extremely effective for treating unipolar
depression (Seligman & Levant, 1998). SSRIs include the drugs Prozac
(fluoxetine hydrochloride), Paxil (paroxetine), and Zoloft (sertraline).
Antimanic drugs such as lithium are mood-controlling medications that
have been very effective in treating bipolar disorders, especially mania
(Klerman et al., 1994). About 70 to 80 percent of manic states can be
controlled by lithium, and it also controls depressive episodes. How
lithium works remains highly speculative. One hypothesis is that it
limits the availability of serotonin and norepinephrine at the synapses
and produces an effect opposite from that of antidepressants. Yet
lithium's ability to relieve depression appears to contradict this
explanation. Other speculations involve electrolyte changes in the body,
which alter neurotransmission in some manner. The use of antidepressant,
antianxiety, antipsychotic, and antimanic drugs has greatly changed
therapy. Patients who take them report that they feel better, that
symptoms decline, and that overall functioning improves. Long periods of
hospitalization are no longer needed in most cases, and patients are
more amenable to other forms of treatment, such as psychotherapy.
Remember, however, that medications do not cure mental disorders. Some
would characterize their use as "control measures," somewhat better than
traditional hospitalization, "straitjackets," or "padded cells."
Furthermore, medications seem to be most effective in treating "active"
symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and aggression and much less
effective with "passive" symptoms such as withdrawal, poor interpersonal
relationships, and feelings of alienation. Medication does not help
patients improve their living skills. Electroconvulsive Therapy Besides
medication, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be used to treat certain
mental disorders. ECT is the application of electric voltage to the
brain to induce convulsions. The patient lies on a padded bed or couch
and is injected with a muscle relaxant to minimize the chance of
self-injury during the convulsions. Evidence suggests that the treatment
is particularly useful for endogenous cases of depression---those in
which some internal cause can be determined (Klerman et al., 1994; see
also Chapter 11, this volume). But how ECT acts to improve depression is
still unclear. Despite its success, the use of ECT has declined
significantly since the 1960s and 1970s because of potential permanent
damage to the brain and the ethical objections raised by detractors.

Psychosurgery During the 1940s and 1950s, psychosurgery---brain surgery
performed for the purpose of correcting a severe mental
disorder---became increasingly popular. The treatment was used most
often with patients suffering from schizophrenia and severe depression,
although many who had personality and anxiety disorders also underwent
psychosurgery. Critics of psychosurgical procedures have raised both
scientific and ethical objections.

Multipath Implications of Biological Explanations In keeping with our
multipath model, we believe that the majority of human diseases are
multidimensional and multifactorial, caused by many genes interacting in
a cellular environment of hormones, electrical signals, and nutrient
supplies, as well as in our physical, psychological, social, and
cultural environments. If the majority of mental disorders are indeed
multifactorial, then any single gene or group of genes has small
effects, not large ones. Our multipath model places in context our wider
view of the etiology of mental disorders. First, most biological
explanations implicitly assume a correspondence between organic
dysfunction and mental dysfunction, with only a minimal impact from
environmental, social, or cultural influences. They are one-dimensional
and linear (that is, unidirectional rather than bidirectional). Muscular
dystrophy, for example, was found to be traceable to a single gene. Such
a relationship is often cited as evidence not only of the power of
biology but also that disorders are the result of a one-way cause-effect
direction. A one-to-one correspondence such as this one, however, is a
rarity in behavioral genetics. Such diseases account for only 2 percent
of the disease load, whereas disorders associated with the genes for
bipolar disorders, cancers, and heart disease together make up 70
percent of the disease load (Strohman, 2001). Second, mental health
researchers have increasingly come to reject a simple linear explanation
of genetic determinism: that bad biology leads to a mental disorder, or
the simple model of "one gene for one disease" (Strohman, 2001). Rather,
disorders are seen as the result of complex interactive and oftentimes
reciprocal processes. Such an early formulation is the diathesis-stress
theory originally proposed by Meehl (1962) and developed further by
Rosenthal (1970). The diathesis-stress theory holds that it is not a
particular abnormality that is inherited but rather a predisposition to
develop illness (diathesis). Certain environmental forces, called
stressors, may activate the predisposition, resulting in a disorder.
Alternatively, in a benign and supportive environment, the abnormality
may never materialize. Third, gene-environment interactions appear much
more complex than having a "predisposition" to develop a disorder.
Research reveals that certain genes or gene combinations may actually
promote an environment likely to elicit stressors that negatively affect
the individual (Plomin & McGuffin, 2003; Silberg et al., 1999). In other
words, in addition to conveying a predisposition for a disorder such as
depression, genes may also predispose a person to seek out situations
that will place them at high risk of experiencing stressors that trigger
depression. Adolescent girls prone to depression, for example, may
actually seek out situations that promote mood disorders (such as
selecting unstable boyfriends who increase the probability of breakups).
Fourth, studies reveal that different forms of the same genes, called
alleles, and critical developmental periods in the life of an individual
may determine whether, when, how, and what mental disturbances develop.
In one longitudinal study of children from age five through their
mid-twenties, researchers assessed multiple variables such as abuse,
stressful life events, and depression (Caspi et al., 2003). They
measured a particular gene, the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), in
each of the participants. They identified three groups of people: (1)
those with two short alleles, (2) those with two long alleles, and (3)
those with one short and one long allele. Children with the two short
alleles and with one short and one long allele who had been mistreated
were more likely to experience depression as adults. However, those with
the same gene combinations who had not been abused as children were less
likely to develop

s it possible that what you eat can change your genes? Some scientists
believe that when our ancestors changed their diets (primarily fruit and
nuts) to heavy starch consumption (cereals such as wheat and barley) our
brains eventually swelled to three times the size of chimpanzees' and
separated us from the lower primates. The breakdown of starches to sugar
provided neural tissue with energy that changed the human genome. You
are what you eat! (N. Wade, 2007).

depression. Additionally, those with the long-long combination, even
when mistreated, were also less likely to develop depression. A review
of studies on affective and anxiety disorders is not only consistent
with these findings but also suggests strongly that gene-environment
interactions that occur at early critical periods can set the stage for
later behavioral phenotypes (Leonardo & Hen, 2006). It is clear that
simply having a specific gene and encountering environmental stressors
is not enough to predict the manifestation of a mental disorder. Rather,
the configuration of the gene, the specific stressors, and the times at
which they occur (critical periods) play important roles. Fifth,
accumulating evidence strongly suggests that biochemical changes, brain
activity, and even structural neurological circuitry often occur because
of environmental influence (Gottsman & Gould, 2003; Leonardo & Hen,
2006). We know, for example, that stress-produced fear and anger cause
the secretion of adrenaline and noradrenalin. Similarly, schizophrenia,
rather than resulting from the presence of such chemicals as dopamine,
could cause the secretion of excess amounts of the chemicals in persons
with the disorder. Through brain imaging studies we also know that
psychotherapeutic interventions have been found to "normalize" brain
circuitry in people suffering from depression (Leuchter et al., 2002),
obsessive-compulsive disorders (Baxter et al., 1992), phobias (Paquette
et al., 2003), and tolerance of pain (Petrovic, Kalso, Peterson, &
Ingvar, 2002). In conclusion, although biology influences the
development of mental disorders, an equally powerful reciprocal
influence on brain activity, brain circuitry, and biochemical
production/inhibition is exerted by the environment as well.

he importance of early childhood experiences, the role of the
unconscious, and the use of insight continue to inﬂuence the mental
health practice. One study revealed that 18 percent of clinical
psychologists, 12 percent of counseling psychologists, 35 percent of
psychiatrists, 33 percent of social workers, and 11 percent of
counselors describe their orientation as "psychoanalytic/psychodynamic"
(Prochaska & Norcross, 1999).

Figure 2.1 lists a number of psychological factors that have been shown
to be important in the etiology of mental disorders. Especially
important for the psychological dimension are conflicts in the mind,
emotions, learned behavior, and cognitions in personality formation.
Like many biological explanations, psychological theories can also be
prone to viewing normal and abnormal human development in a linear and
one-dimensional fashion. They can also suffer from tunnel vision in
explaining mental disorders as arising from psychological rather than
biological, social, or sociocultural factors. Interestingly,
psychological explanations of abnormal behavior vary considerably
depending on the psychologist's theoretical orientation. For example, in
our chapter-opening case, Steve's therapist might stress his client's
intrapsychic conflicts and the need to resolve and control extreme
feelings of rage and hostility toward authority figures. Other
psychologists might concentrate on his social isolation, being cared for
by a caretaker who spoke no English and who would send him to his room
when he misbehaved. As a result, Steve had few role models from whom to
learn appropriate social skills that would lead to successful
interpersonal relationships. Other theorists might conjecture that Steve
crafted a fantasy world from his violent videos (his source of reality)
because of infrequent checks and balances from his primary caretaker or
parents. As a result, not only is the content of his thoughts
irrational, but his thinking process has also become distorted. In this
section, we briefly describe four major psychological perspectives in
explaining abnormal behavior: psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, and
existentialhumanistic. We then apply a multipath analysis to these four
approaches.

Psychodynamic Models Psychodynamic models of abnormal behavior have two
main distinguishing features. First, they view disorders as the result
of childhood trauma or anxieties. Second, they hold that many of these
childhood-based anxieties operate unconsciously; because experiences are
too threatening for the adult to face, they are repressed through mental
defense mechanisms---ego-protection strategies that shelter the
individual from anxiety, operate unconsciously, and distort reality. As
a result, people exhibit symptoms that they are unable to understand
because they are manifestations of the unconscious conflicts. The early
development of psychodynamic theory

Dimension Two: Psychological Factors

45

is credited to Sigmund Freud (1938, 1949). Freud was convinced that
powerful mental processes could remain hidden from consciousness and
could cause abnormal behaviors. He believed that the therapist's role
was to help the patient achieve insight into these unconscious
processes. Personality Structure Freud believed that personality is
composed of three major components---the id, the ego, and the
superego---and that all behavior is a product of their interaction. The
id is the original component of the personality; it is present at birth,
and from it the ego and superego eventually develop. The id operates
from the pleasure principle---the impulsive, pleasure-seeking aspect of
our being---and it seeks immediate gratification of instinctual needs,
regardless of moral or realistic concerns. In contrast, the ego
represents the realistic and rational part of the mind. It is influenced
by the reality principle---an awareness of the demands of the
environment and of the need to adjust behavior to meet these demands.
The ego's decisions are dictated by realistic considerations rather than
by moral judgments. Moral judgments and moralistic considerations are
the domain of the superego. The superego is composed of the conscience,
which instills guilt feelings about engaging in immoral or unethical
behavior, and the ego ideal, which rewards altruistic or moral behavior
with feelings of pride. The energy system from which the personality
operates occurs through the interplay of instincts. Instincts give rise
to our thoughts and actions and fuel their expression. Freud emphasized
sex (libido) and aggression as the dominant human instincts because he
recognized that the society in which he lived placed strong prohibitions
on these drives and that, as a result, people were taught to inhibit
them. A profound need to express one's instincts is often frightening
and can lead a person to deny their existence. Most impulses are hidden
from one's consciousness; they nonetheless determine human actions.
Psychosexual Stages According to psychodynamic theory, human personality
develops through a sequence of five psychosexual stages, each of which
brings a unique challenge. If unfavorable circumstances prevail, the
personality may be drastically affected. Because Freud stressed the
importance of early childhood experiences, he saw the human personality
as largely determined in the first five years of life---during the oral
(first year of life), anal (around the second year of life), and phallic
(beginning around the third or fourth years of life) stages. The last
two psychosexual stages are the latency (approximately six to twelve
years of age) and genital (beginning in puberty) stages. The importance
of each psychosexual stage for later development lies in whether
fixation occurs during that stage. Fixation is the arresting of
emotional development at a particular psychosexual stage. According to
the psychodynamic model, each stage is characterized by distinct traits
and, should fixation occur, by distinct conflicts. Traditional
Psychodynamic Therapy Psychoanalytic therapy, or psychoanalysis, has
three main goals: (1) uncovering repressed material, (2) helping clients
achieve insight into their inner motivations and desires, and (3)
resolving childhood conflicts that affect current relationships.
Psychoanalysts traditionally use four methods to achieve their
therapeutic goals: free association, dream analysis, analysis of
resistance, and analysis of transference. • In free association, the
patient says whatever comes to mind, regardless of how illogical or
embarrassing it may seem, for the purpose of revealing the contents of
the patient's unconscious. Psychoanalysts believe the material that
surfaces in this process is determined by the patient's psychic makeup
and can provide understanding of the patient's conflicts, unconscious
processes, and personality dynamics. • Dream analysis is a therapeutic
technique that depends on interpretation of hidden meanings in dreams.
Psychoanalysts believe that when people sleep, defenses and inhibitions
of the ego weaken, allowing unacceptable motives and feelings to
surface. The therapist's job is to uncover the disguised symbolic
meanings and let the patient achieve insight into the anxiety-provoking
implications.

SIGMUND FREUD (1856--1939) Freud began his career as a neurologist. He
became increasingly intrigued with the relationship between illness and
mental processes and ultimately developed psychoanalysis, a therapy in
which unconscious conﬂicts are aired so that the patient can become
aware of and understand his or her problems.

PSYCHOSEXUAL STAGES During the oral stage, the ﬁrst stage of
psychosexual development, the infant not only receives nourishment but
also derives pleasure from sucking and being close to its mother. Later,
during the anal stage, toilet training can be a time of intense
emotional conﬂict between parent and child, or it can be a time of
cooperation.

• Analysis of resistance---a process in which the patient unconsciously
attempts to impede the analysis by preventing the exposure of repressed
material---is employed to interpret and uncover the repressed material.
In free association, for example, the patient may suddenly change the
subject, lose his or her train of thought, go blank, or become silent.
The therapist can make use of properly interpreted instances of
resistance to show the patient that repressed material is coming close
to the surface and to suggest means of uncovering it. • In transference
the patient reenacts early conflicts by carrying over and applying to
the analyst feelings and attitudes that the patient had toward
significant others--- primarily parents---in the past. Working through
transference is considered therapeutic.

Contemporary Psychodynamic Theories Freud's psychoanalytic approach
attracted many followers. Some of Freud's disciples, however, came to
disagree with his insistence that the sex instinct is the major
determinant of behavior. Many of his most gifted adherents broke away
from him and formulated psychological models of their own. The major
differences between the various postFreudian theories and psychoanalysis
lie in the emphasis that the former placed on five areas: freedom of
choice and future goals, ego autonomy, social forces, object relations
(past interpersonal relations), and treatment of seriously disturbed
people. Some of these major theorists and their contributions are
outlined in Table 2.2. Today, very few psychodynamic therapists practice
traditional psychoanalysis. Most are more active in their sessions,
restrict the number of sessions they have with clients, place greater
emphasis on current rather than past factors, and seem to have adopted a
number of client-centered techniques in their practice (Nystul, 2003).

Criticisms of Psychodynamic Models Psychodynamic theory has strongly
affected the field of psychology, and psychoanalysis and its variations
are widely employed. Nonetheless, three major criticisms are often
leveled at psychodynamic theory and treatment (Joseph, 1991). First, the
empirical procedures by which Freud validated his hypotheses have grave
shortcomings. His observations about human behavior were often made
under uncontrolled conditions and relied heavily on case studies. He
also used his own self-analysis as a basis for formulating theory. His
patients, from whom he drew conclusions about universal aspects of
personality dynamics and behavior, tended to represent a narrow spectrum
of one society. Second, his theory of female sexuality and personality
has drawn heavy criticism from feminists. Phallic-stage dynamics, penis
envy, unfavorable comparisons of the clitoris to the penis, the woman's
need for a male child as a penis substitute, and the belief that
penetration is necessary for a woman's sexual satisfaction all rest on
assumptions that are biologically questionable and that fail to consider
social forces that shape women's behavior. A third criticism of
psychoanalysis is that it cannot be applied to a wide range of disturbed
people. Research studies have shown that psychoanalytic therapy is best
suited to well-educated people of

CONTRIBUTIONS OF POST-FREUDIANS AND PSYCHOANALYTIC THERAPISTS
Traditional psychoanalytic theory has changed over the years due to the
work of post-Freudians and others. Although most of the individuals
listed here accept many of the basic tenets of the theory, they have
stressed different aspects of the human condition. Some differences are
listed below. 1. Freedom of choice and future goals People are not just
mechanistic beings. They have a high degree of free choice and are
motivated toward future goals. Alfred Adler (1870--1937) Stressed that
people are not passive victims of biology, instincts, or unconscious
forces. Stressed freedom of choice and goals directed by means of social
drives. Carl Jung (1875--1965) Believed in the collective unconscious as
the foundation of creative functioning. Believed that humans were goal
directed and future oriented. 2. Ego autonomy The ego is an autonomous
entity and can operate independently from the id. It is creative,
forward moving, and capable of continual growth. Anna Freud (1895--1982)
Emphasized the role, operation, and importance of the ego. Believed ego
is an autonomous component of the personality and not at the mercy of
the id. Erik Erikson (1902--1994) Perhaps the most inﬂuential of the ego
theorists. Formulated stages of ego development from infancy to late
adulthood---one of the ﬁrst true developmental theorists. Considered
personality to be ﬂexible and capable of growth and change throughout
the adult years. 3. Social forces Interpersonal relationships are of
primary importance in our psychological development. Especially
inﬂuential are our primary social relationships. Karen Horney
(1885--1952) Often considered one of the ﬁrst feminist psychologists who
rejected Freud's notion of penis envy. Stressed that behavior disorders
are due to disturbed interpersonal childhood relationships.

Harry Stack Sullivan (1892--1949) Major contribution was his
interpersonal theory of psychological disorders. Believed that the
individual's psychological functions could be understood only in the
context of his or her social relationships. 4. Object relations The
technical term object relations is roughly equivalent to "past
interpersonal relations." It refers to how people develop patterns of
living from their early relations with signiﬁcant others. Heinz Kohut
(1913--1981) Felt it was especially important to study the mother-child
relationship. Known for his work on the narcissistic personality. Otto
Kernberg (1928-- ) Known especially for his studies of the borderline
personality. Especially interested in understanding how clients seem to
have difﬁculty in forming stable relationships because of pathological
objects in the past. 5. Treatment of the seriously disturbed Freud
believed that psychoanalysis could not be used with very seriously
disturbed individuals because they were "analytically unﬁt." By this he
meant that they did not have sufﬁcient contact with reality to beneﬁt
from insight. Hyman Spotnitz (1908-- ) Demonstrated that modern
psychoanalysis could be used with severely disturbed clients. Associated
with new treatment techniques that do not require clients to be
intellectually capable of understanding interpretations. Techniques
provide feedback that helps client resolve conﬂicts by experiencing them
rather than understanding them.

the middle and upper socioeconomic classes who exhibit anxiety disorders
rather than psychotic behavior (Corey, 2005). It is more limited in
therapeutic value with people of lower socioeconomic levels and with
people who are less verbal, less intelligent, and more severely
disturbed (Sloane, Staples, Cristol, Yorkston, & Whipple, 1975).

Behavioral Models The behavioral models of psychopathology are concerned
with the role of learning in abnormal behavior. The differences among
them lie mainly in their explanations of how learning occurs (Corey,
2005; Kottler, 2002). The three learning paradigms are classical
conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning.

IVAN PAVLOV (1849--1936) A Russian physiologist, Pavlov discovered the
associative learning process we know as classical conditioning while he
was studying salivation in dogs. Pavlov won the Nobel Prize in
physiology and medicine in 1904 for his work on the principal digestive
glands.

is provided (left drawing). With his laboratory dogs, Ivan Pavlov paired
the ringing of a bell with the presentation of food (middle drawing).
Eventually, the dogs would salivate to the ringing of the bell alone,
when no food was near (right drawing).

The Classical Conditioning Paradigm Early in the twentieth century, Ivan
Pavlov (1849--1936), a Russian physiologist, discovered a process known
as classical conditioning, in which responses to new stimuli are learned
through association. This process involves involuntary responses (such
as reflexes, emotional reactions, and sexual arousal), which are
controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Pavlov was measuring dogs'
salivation as part of a study of their digestive processes when he
noticed that the dogs began to salivate at the sight of an assistant
carrying their food. This response puzzled Pavlov and led to his
formulation of classical conditioning. He reasoned that food is an
unconditioned stimulus (UCS), which, in the mouth, automatically elicits
salivation; this salivation is an unlearned or unconditioned response
(UCR) to the food. Pavlov then presented a previously neutral stimulus
(one, such as the sound of a bell, that does not initially elicit
salivation) to the dogs just before presenting the food. He found that,
after a number of repetitions, the sound of the bell alone elicited
salivation. This learning process is based on association: the neutral
stimulus (the bell) acquires some of the properties of the unconditioned
stimulus (the food) when they are repeatedly paired. When the bell alone
can provoke the salivation, it becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS). The
salivation elicited by the bell is a conditioned response (CR)---a
learned response to a previously neutral stimulus. Each time the
conditioned stimulus is paired with the unconditioned stimulus, the
conditioned response is said to be reinforced, or strengthened. Pavlov's
conditioning process is illustrated in Figure 2.8. Classical
Conditioning in Psychopathology John B. Watson (1878--1958) is credited
with recognizing the importance of associative learning in the
explanation of abnormal behavior. In a classic and oft-cited experiment,
Watson (Watson & Rayner, 1920), using classical conditioning principles,
was able to demonstrate that

OPERANT CONDITIONING IN THE CLASSROOM In operant conditioning, positive
consequences increases the likelihood and frequency of a desired
response. This is particularly important in teaching young children that
appropriate behavior will be rewarded and inappropriate behavior will be
punished. These ﬁrst graders are being treated to a petting zoo for good
behavior maintained in the classroom. The reward is changed on a monthly
basis.

the acquisition of a phobia (an exaggerated, seemingly illogical fear of
a particular object or class of objects) could be explained by classical
conditioning. In fact, classical conditioning has provided explanations
not only for the acquisition of phobias but also for certain unusual
sexual attractions and other extreme emotional reactions. Yet the
passive nature of associative learning limited its usefulness as an
explanatory and treatment tool. Most human behavior, both normal and
abnormal, tends to be much more active and voluntary. To explain how
these behaviors are acquired or eliminated necessitates an understanding
of operant conditioning. The Operant Conditioning Paradigm An operant
behavior is a voluntary and controllable behavior, such as walking or
thinking, that "operates" on an individual's environment. In an
extremely warm room, for example, you would have difficulty consciously
controlling your sweating---"willing" your body not to perspire. You
could, however, simply walk out of the uncomfortably warm room---an
operant behavior. Most human behavior is operant in nature. Edward
Thorndike (1874--1949) first formulated the concept of operant
conditioning, which he called instrumental conditioning. This theory of
learning holds that behaviors are controlled by the consequences that
follow them. Some fifty years later, B. F. Skinner (1904--1990)
developed Thorndike's work and made the concept of reinforcement
central. Operant conditioning differs from classical conditioning in two
primary ways. First, classical conditioning is linked to the development
of involuntary behaviors, such as fear responses, whereas operant
conditioning is related to voluntary behaviors. Second, behaviors based
on classical conditioning are controlled by stimuli, or events preceding
the response: salivation occurs only when it is preceded by a UCS (food
in the mouth) or a CS (the thought of a sizzling, juicy steak covered
with mushrooms, for example). In operant conditioning, however,
behaviors are controlled by reinforcers---consequences that influence
the frequency or magnitude of the event they follow. Positive
consequences increase the likelihood and frequency of a response. But
when the consequences are negative, the behavior is less likely to be
repeated. Operant Conditioning in Psychopathology Studies have
demonstrated a relationship between environmental reinforcers and
certain abnormal behaviors. For example, self-injurious behavior, such
as head banging, is a dramatic form of psychopathology that is often
reported in psychotic, autistic, and mentally retarded children. It has
been hypothesized that some forms of head banging may be linked to

B. F. SKINNER (1904--1990) Skinner was a leader in the ﬁeld of
behaviorism. His research and work in operant conditioning started a
revolution in applying the principles of learning to the psychology of
human behavior. He was also a social philosopher, and many of his ideas
fueled debate about the nature of the human condition. These ideas were
expressed in his books Walden II and Beyond Freedom and Dignity.

reinforcing features in the environment, as when parents distract the
child by giving him or her candy (Corey, 2005; Sommers-Flanagan &
Sommers-Flanagan, 2004). It has also been found that self-injurious
behaviors, hallucinations, and delusional statements can be developed
and maintained through reinforcement. Likewise, some forms of alcohol or
substance abuse may be due to the initial pleasurable feelings and
lowered anxieties people experience (Carey & Carey, 1995). Although
positive reinforcement can account for some forms of self-injurious or
other undesirable behaviors, in some instances other variables seem more
important. Negative reinforcement (the removal of an aversive stimulus),
for example, can also strengthen and maintain unhealthy behaviors.
Consider a student who has enrolled in a class in which the instructor
requires oral reports. The thought of doing an oral presentation in
front of a class produces anxiety, sweating, an upset stomach, and
trembling in the student. Having these feelings is aversive. To stop the
unpleasant reaction, the student switches to another section in which
the instructor does not require oral presentations. The student's
behavior is reinforced by escape from aversive feelings, and such
avoidant responses to situations involving "stage fright" will increase
in frequency.

Myth vs Reality Myth: Behavioral approaches assume that people are
completely the products of their conditioning histories, that they are
passive participants in the developmental process, and that they have
little free will. These approaches deny the importance of "mental life"
in people. They seem more focused on behaviors and seem to believe
people are mechanistic and robotic in their actions. Reality: Whereas
early behaviorism, under the inﬂuence of John B. Watson (and to some
extent B. F. Skinner), saw people as primarily the products of their
conditioning histories and felt that speculating about the "inner life"
of a person was unscientiﬁc, such rigid concepts have given way to a
more holistic and integrated interpretation of the learning process.
Behaviorally oriented mental health professionals are now very much
involved in understanding how the internal mental life of the person
affects the acquisition and treatment of certain disorders. They now
acknowledge that people are not passive beings and have increasingly
moved toward using social modeling and cognitive processes to supplement
the principles of both classical and operant learning models.

The Observational Learning Paradigm The traditional behavioral theories
of learning---classical conditioning and operant conditioning---require
that the individual actually perform behaviors to learn them.
Observational learning theory suggests that an individual can acquire
new behaviors simply by watching other people perform them (Bandura,
1997; Cormier & Cormier, 1998). The process of learning by observing
models (and later imitating them) is called vicarious conditioning or
modeling. Direct and tangible reinforcement (such as giving praise or
other rewards) for imitation of the model is not necessary, although
reinforcers are necessary to maintain behaviors learned in this manner.
Observational learning can involve both respondent and operant
behaviors, and its discovery has had such an impact in psychology that
it has been proposed as a third form of learning. observational learning

Observational Learning in Psychopathology Models that attribute
psychopathology to observational learning assume---as do those that
emphasize classical and operant conditioning---that abnormal behaviors
are learned in the same manner as normal behaviors. More specifically,
the assumption is that exposure to disturbed models is likely to produce
disturbed behaviors (James & Gilliland, 2003). For example, when monkeys
watched other monkeys respond with fear to an unfamiliar object, they
learned to respond in a similar manner (Cook, Hodes, & Lang, 1986).

Criticisms of the Behavioral Models Behavioral approaches to
psychopathology have had a tremendous impact in the areas of etiology
and treatment, and they are a strong force in psychology today.
Opponents of the behavioral orientation, however, point out that it
often neglects or places a low importance on the inner determinants of
behavior. They criticize the behaviorists' extension to human beings of
results obtained from animal studies. Some also charge that because of
its lack of attention to human values in relation to behavior, the
behaviorist perspective is mechanistic, viewing people as "empty
organisms." This specific criticism is less applicable to proponents of
modeling.

Cognitive Models Cognitive models are based on the assumption that
conscious thought mediates, or modifies, an individual's emotional state
and/or behavior in response to a stimulus. According to these models,
people actually create their own problems (and symptoms) by the ways
they interpret events and situations. For example, one person who fails
to be hired for a job may become depressed, blaming himself or herself
for the failure. Another might become only mildly irritated, believing
that failure to get the job had nothing to do with personal inadequacy.
How does it happen that events (not being hired for a job) are identical
for both people but the responses are very different? Cognitive theories
argue that modifying thoughts and feelings is essential to changing
behavior. How people label a situation and how they interpret events
profoundly affect their emotional reactions and behaviors. How a person
interprets events is a function of his or her schema---a set of
underlying assumptions heavily influenced by a person's experiences,
values, and perceived capabilities. Cognitive psychologists usually
search for the causes of psychopathology in one of two processes: in
actual irrational and maladaptive assumptions and thoughts or in
distortions of the actual thought process. Irrational and Maladaptive
Assumptions and Thoughts Almost all cognitive theorists stress that
disturbed individuals have both irrational and maladaptive thoughts
(Beck, 1997; Ellis, 1997). Aaron Beck (1921-- ) and Albert Ellis
(1913--2007) are cognitive psychologists who explain psychological
problems as produced by

LEARNING BY OBSERVING Observational learning is based on the theory that
behavior can be learned by observing it. Although much has been made of
the relationship between violence and aggression viewed on television
and in movies and violent behavior in real life, observational learning
can have positive beneﬁts as well.

irrational thought patterns that stem from the individual's belief
system. Unpleasant emotional responses that lead to anger, unhappiness,
depression, fear, and anxiety result from one's thoughts about an event
rather than from the event itself. These irrational thoughts have been
conditioned through early childhood, but we also add to the difficulty
by reinstilling these false beliefs in ourselves by autosuggestion and
self-repetition. Although being accepted and loved by everyone is
desirable, it is an unrealistic and irrational idea, and as such it
creates dysfunctional feelings and behaviors. Consider a student who
becomes depressed after an unsuccessful date. An appropriate emotional
response in such an unsuccessful dating situation might be frustration
and temporary disappointment. A more severe depression will develop only
if the student adds irrational thoughts, such as "Because this person
turned me down, I am worthless.. . . I will never succeed with anyone of
the opposite sex.. . . I am a total failure." Distortions of Thought
Processes The study of cognitions as a cause of psychopathology has led
many therapists to concentrate on the process (as opposed to the
content) of thinking that characterizes both normal and abnormal
individuals. Ellis (1997) described the process by which an individual
acquires irrational thoughts through interactions with significant
others, and he called it the A-B-C theory of personality. A is an event,
a fact, or the individual's behavior or attitude. C is the person's
emotional or behavioral reaction. The activating event A never causes
the emotional or behavioral consequence C. Instead, B, the person's
beliefs about A, causes C. Think back to the two job hunters. Job hunter
1, whose activating event A was being turned down for the position, may
think to himself (irrational beliefs B), "How awful to be rejected! I
must be worthless. I'm no good." Thus he may become depressed and
withdraw (emotional and behavioral consequence C). Job hunter 2, on the
other hand, reacts to the activating event A by saying (rational beliefs
B), "How unfortunate to get rejected. It's frustrating and irritating.
I'll have to try harder" (healthy consequence C). The two sets of
assumptions and expectations are very different. Job hunter 1 blamed
himself and was overcome with feelings of worthlessness; job hunter 2
recognized that not every person is right for every job (or vice versa)
and left the situation with self-esteem intact. Job hunter 1 interprets
the rejection as "awful and catastrophic" and, as a result, reacts with
depression and may cease looking for a job. Job hunter 2 does not
interpret the rejection personally, reacts with annoyance, and redoubles
her efforts to seek employment. Figure 2.9 illustrates the A-B-C
relationship and suggests a possible path for a cognitive approach to
treatment. FIGURE

THEORY OF PERSONALITY The development of emotional and behavioral
problems is often linked to a dysfunctional thinking process. The
cognitive psychologist is likely to attack these problematic beliefs
using a rational intervention process, resulting in a change in beliefs
and feelings.

Dimension Two: Psychological Factors

Cognitive Approaches to Therapy Certain commonalities characterize
almost all cognitive approaches to psychotherapy. These have been
summarized by Beck and Weishaar (1989): Cognitive therapy consists of
highly specific learning experiences designed to teach patients (1) to
monitor their negative, automatic thoughts (cognitions); (2) to
recognize the connections between cognition, affect, and behavior; (3)
to examine the evidence for and against distorted automatic thoughts;
(4) to substitute more reality-oriented interpretations for these biased
cognitions; and (5) to learn to identify and alter the beliefs that
predispose them to distort their experiences. (p. 308)

Criticisms of the Cognitive Models Some behaviorists remain quite
skeptical of the cognitive schools. Just before his death, B. F. Skinner
(1990) warned that cognitions are not observable phenomena and cannot
form the foundations of empiricism. In this context, he echoed the
historical beliefs of John B. Watson, who stated that the science of
psychology was observable behaviors, not "mentalistic concepts."
Although Watson's reference was to the intrapsychic dynamics of the mind
postulated by Freud, Watson might have viewed cognitions in the same
manner. Cognitive theories have also been attacked by more
humanistically oriented psychologists who believe that human behavior is
more than thoughts and beliefs (Corey, 2005). They object to the
mechanistic manner by which human beings are reduced to the sum of their
cognitive parts. Do thoughts and beliefs really cause disturbances, or
do the disturbances themselves distort thinking? Criticisms have also
been leveled at the therapeutic approach taken by cognitive therapists.
The nature of the approach makes the therapist a teacher, expert, and
authority figure. The therapist is quite direct and confrontive in
identifying and attacking irrational beliefs and processes. In such
interactions, clients can readily be intimidated into acquiescing to the
therapist's power and authority. Thus the therapist may misidentify the
client's disorder, and the client may be hesitant to challenge the
therapist's beliefs.

Humanistic and Existential Models Attempting to describe
humanistic-existential approaches to the development of mental disorders
is a major challenge. In many respects, humanistic approaches are
philosophical in nature, deal with values, speak to the nature of the
human condition, decry the use of diagnostic labels, and prefer a
holistic view of the person. For example, humanists would describe Steve
(in the chapter-opening case) as a flesh-and-blood person, alive,
organic, and moving, with thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Diagnostic
labels would be objectionable and serve only to pigeonhole people and
act as barriers to the development of a therapeutic relationship.
Understanding the subjective world of Steve's experience, a humanist
might say that it appears that he is feeling trapped, immobilized, and
lonely and that he is externalizing his problems. In this way Steve may
be evading responsibility for making his own choices and may be
protecting himself by staying in the safe, known environment of his
"illness." According to the humanist perspective, Steve needs to realize
that he is responsible for his own actions, that he cannot find his
identity in others, and that his life is not predetermined. The
humanistic and existential approaches evolved as a reaction to the
determinism of early models of psychopathology. For example, many
psychologists were disturbed that Freudian theory did not focus on the
inner world of the client but rather categorized the client according to
a set of preconceived diagnoses (May, 1967). They described clients in
terms of blocked instinctual forces and psychic complexes that made them
victims of some mechanistic and deterministic personality structure.
Similarly, cognitive-behavioral schools of thought seemed to describe
human beings as "learned responses," "automatic beings," and
"deterministic creatures" who were victims of their conditioning
histories. Although the humanistic and existential perspectives
represent many schools of thought, they nevertheless share a set of
assumptions that distinguishes them from other approaches. The first of
these assumptions is that people's realities are products of unique
experiences and perceptions of the world. Moreover, a person's

53

54

C H A P T E R 2 • M O D E L S O F A B N O R M A L B E H AV I O R

subjective universe---how he or she construes events---is more important
than the events themselves. Hence, to understand why people behave as
they do, psychologists must reconstruct the world from an individual's
vantage point. Second, humanistic-existential theorists assume that
individuals have the ability to make free choices and are responsible
for their own decisions. Third, they believe in the "wholeness" or
integrity of the person and view as pointless all attempts to reduce
human beings to a set of formulas, to explain them simply by measuring
responses to certain stimuli. And fourth, they assume that people have
the ability to become what they want, to fulfill their capacities, and
to lead the lives best suited to them.

self-concept

The Humanistic Perspective One of the major contributions of the
humanistic perspective is its positive view of the individual. Carl
Rogers (1902--1987) is perhaps the best known of the humanistic
psychologists. Rogers's theory of personality (1959; 1961) reflects his
concern with human welfare and his deep conviction that humanity is
basically "good," forward moving, and trustworthy. The Actualizing
Tendency Instead of concentrating exclusively on behavior disorders, the
humanistic approach is concerned with helping people actualize their
potential and with bettering the state of humanity. Humanistic
psychological theory is based on the idea that people are motivated not
only to satisfy their biological needs (for food, warmth, and sex) but
also to cultivate, maintain, and enhance the self. The self is one's
image of oneself, the part one refers to as "I" or "me." The
quintessence of this view is the concept of self-actualization---a term
popularized by Abraham Maslow (1954)---which is an inherent tendency to
strive toward the realization of one's full potential. The actualizing
tendency can be viewed as fulfilling a grand design or a genetic
blueprint. This thrust of life that pushes people forward is manifested
in such qualities as curiosity, creativity, and joy of discovery. How
one views the self, how others relate to the self, and what values are
attached to the self all contribute to one's self-concept---the
individual's assessment of his or her own value and worth. Development
of Abnormal Behavior Rogers believed that if people were left
unencumbered by societal restrictions and were allowed to grow and
develop freely, the result would be fully functioning people. In such a
case, the self-concept and the actualizing tendency would be considered
congruent. However, society frequently imposes conditions of worth on
its members, standards by which people determine whether they have
worth. These standards are transmitted via conditional positive regard.
That is, significant others (such as parents, peers, friends, and
spouse) in a person's life accept some but not all of that person's
actions, feelings, and attitudes. The person's self-concept becomes
defined as having worth only when others approve. But this reliance on
others forces the individual to develop a distorted self-concept that is
inconsistent with his or her self-actualizing potential, inhibiting that
person from being self-actualized. A state of disharmony or incongruence
is said to exist between the person's inherent potential and his or her
self-concept (as determined by significant others). This state of
incongruence forms the basis of abnormal behavior. Rogers believed that
fully functioning people have been allowed to grow toward their
potential. The environmental condition most suitable for this growth is
called unconditional positive regard (Rogers, 1951). In essence, people
who are significant figures in someone's life value and respect that
person as a person. Giving unconditional positive regard is valuing and
loving regardless of behavior. People may disapprove of someone's
actions, but they still respect, love, and care for that someone.
Person-Centered Therapy The assumption that humans need unconditional
positive regard has many implications for child rearing and
psychotherapy. For parents, it means creating an open and accepting
environment for the child. For the therapist, it means fostering
conditions that allow clients to grow and fulfill their potential; this
approach has become known as nondirective or person-centered therapy.
Rogers emphasized that therapists' attitudes are more important than
specific counseling techniques. The therapist needs to have a strong
positive regard for the client's ability to deal constructively with all
aspects of life. The more willing the therapist is to rely

Dimension Two: Psychological Factors

55

on the client's strengths and potential, the more likely it is that the
client will discover such strengths and potential. The therapist cannot
help the client by explaining the client's behavior or by prescribing
actions to follow. Therapeutic techniques involve expressing and
communicating respect, understanding, and acceptance. The Existential
Perspective The existential approach is really not a systematized school
of thought but a set of attitudes. It shares with humanistic psychology
an emphasis on individual uniqueness, a quest for meaning in life and
for freedom and responsibility, a phenomenological approach
(understanding the person's subjective world of experience) to
understanding the person, and a belief that the individual has positive
attributes that will eventually be expressed unless they are distorted
by the environment. The existential and humanistic approaches differ in
several dimensions: 1. Existentialism is less optimistic than humanism;
it focuses on the irrationality, difficulties, and suffering all humans
encounter in life. Although humanism allows the clear possibility of
self-fulfillment and freedom, existentialism deals with human alienation
from the social and spiritual structures that no longer provide meaning
in an increasingly technological and impersonal world. 2. Both
approaches stress phenomenology---the attempt to understand people's
subjective world of experience. Humanistic therapists attempt to
reconstruct the subjective world of their clients through empathy.
Existentialists believe that the individual must be viewed within the
context of the human condition and that moral, philosophical, and
ethical considerations are part of that context. 3. They differ in their
views on responsibility. Humanism stresses individual responsibility:
the individual is ultimately responsible for what he or she becomes in
this life. Existentialism stresses not only individual responsibility
but also responsibility to others. Self-fulfillment is not enough.
Criticisms of the Humanistic and Existential Approaches Criticisms of
the humanistic and existential approaches point to their "fuzzy,"
ambiguous, and nebulous nature and to the restricted population in which
these approaches can be applied. Although these phenomenological
approaches have been extremely creative in describing the human
condition, they have been less successful in constructing theory.
Moreover, they are not suited to scientific or experimental
investigation. The emphasis on subjective understanding rather than
prediction and control, on intuition and empathy rather than objective
investigation, and on the individual rather than the more general
category all tend to hinder empirical study. Carl Rogers has certainly
expressed many of his ideas as researchable propositions, but it is
difficult to verify scientifically the humanistic concept of people as
rational, inherently good, and moving toward self-fulfillment. The
existential perspective can be similarly criticized for its lack of
scientific grounding because of its reliance on the unique subjective
experiences of individuals to describe the inner world. Such data are
difficult to quantify and test. Nevertheless, the existential concepts
of freedom, choice, responsibility, being, and nonbeing have had a
profound influence on contemporary thought beyond the field of
psychology. Another major criticism leveled at the humanistic and
existential approaches is that they do not work well with severely
disturbed clients. They seem to be most effective with intelligent,
well-educated, and relatively "normal" individuals who may be suffering
adjustment difficulties. This limitation, along with the occasional
vagueness of humanistic and existential thought, has hindered broad
application of these ideas to abnormal psychology.

Multipath Implications of Psychological Explanations All the
psychological theories discussed have both strengths and weaknesses; no
one of them can claim to tell "the whole truth." Each model---whether
psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, or
existential-humanistic---represents different views of pathology. Each
details a different perspective from which to interpret reality, the
nature of people, the origin of disorders, standards used for judging
normality and abnormality, and the therapeutic cure. Each model has
devout supporters.

CARL ROGERS (1902--1987) Rogers believed that people need both positive
regard from others and positive selfregard. According to Rogers, when
positive regard is given unconditionally, a person can develop freely
and become self-actualized.

a set of attitudes that has many commonalities with humanism but is less
optimistic, focusing (1) on human alienation in an increasingly
technological and impersonal world, (2) on the individual in the context
of the human condition, and (3) on responsibility to others, as well as
to oneself

C H A P T E R 2 • M O D E L S O F A B N O R M A L B E H AV I O R

The multipath model would suggest that we can best understand abnormal
behavior only by evidence-based integration of the various approaches.
It is possible that the models of psychopathology are describing the
same phenomena but from different vantage points. Many models of
psychopathology focus on one aspect of the human condition to the
exclusion of others, overlooking the person as a "total package" and
resulting in a distorted view. Some models emphasize the importance of
history (psychodynamic), some of feeling (humanistic-existential), some
of thinking (cognitive), and still others of behaving (behavioral). A
truly comprehensive model of human behavior, normal and abnormal, must
address the possibility that people are all of these---biological,
historical, feeling, thinking, and behaving beings---and probably much
more: social, cultural, spiritual, and political ones as well.

Dimension Three: Social Factors Almost all theories of psychopathology
discussed so far focus on the individual and less so on the social
environment. They have been negligent in addressing such important
aspects of our lives as relationships with people and how such factors
as family, social support, love, community, and belonging affect the
manifestation and expression of behavior disorders. It is clear that we
are social beings and that our relationships can influence the
development, manifestation, and/or amelioration of mental disorders.

Social Relational Models Studies support the conclusion that social
isolation and lack of emotional support and intimacy are correlated with
depression, lower stress tolerance, and low selfesteem (McIntosh, 1991;
Paykel et al., 2003). On the other hand, people with rich relationships
and social networks have been found to live longer, are less prone to
commit suicide, are less likely to develop psychiatric disorders such as
depression and alcoholism, enjoy better physical health, recover quicker
after an illness, and are generally happier and more optimistic (Berkman
& Syme, 1979; House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988; Leserman et al., 2000;
Segrin et al., 2003). Social relationships are important in places of
employment, churches, neighborhoods, schools, and communities, and
especially as they relate to family relationships. For example, Steve V.
can be seen as a product of a dysfunctional family, a person who was
never nurtured nor loved by his parents. Social-relational explanations
of abnormal behavior make several important assumptions (Johnson &
Johnson, 2003): (1) healthy relationships are important for human
development and functioning; (2) these relationships provide many
intangible healthy benefits (social support, love, compassion, trust,
faith, sense of belonging, resistance to stress, etc.); and (3) when
relationships prove dysfunctional or are absent, the individual may be
subject to mental disturbances. Treatment of socially produced disorders
is most effective by improving interpersonal relationships of clients
through a systemic approach.

Family, Couples, and Group Perspectives

model that assumes that the behavior of one family member directly
affects the entire family system

family systems model

In contrast to traditional psychological models, social-relational
models emphasize how other people, especially significant others,
influence our behavior. This viewpoint holds that all people are
enmeshed in a network of interdependent roles, statuses, values, and
norms. One of these, the family systems model, assumes that the behavior
of one family member directly affects the entire family system.
Correspondingly, people typically behave in ways that reflect family
influences (both healthy and unhealthy responding). We can identify
three distinct characteristics of the family systems approach (Corey,
2005). First, personality development is ruled largely by the attributes
of the family, especially by the way parents behave toward and around
their children. Second, abnormal behavior in the individual is usually a
reflection or "symptom" of unhealthy family dynamics and, more
specifically, of poor communication among family members. Third, the
therapist must focus on the family system, not

Dimension Three: Social Factors

57

solely on the individual, and must strive to involve the entire family
in therapy. As a result, the locus of disorder is seen to reside not
within the individual but within the family system.

Social-Relational Treatment Approaches The family systems model has
spawned a number of treatment approaches. One group emphasizes the
importance of clear and direct communications for healthy family system
development (Satir, 1967, 1983; Satir & Bitter, 1991). Virginia Satir's
conjoint family therapeutic approach stresses the importance of teaching
message-sending and message-receiving skills to family members. Like
other family therapists, Satir believes that the identified patient is
really a reflection of the family system gone awry. Strategic family
approaches (Haley, 1963, 1987) deal with power struggles that occur
among family members by attempting to shift the balance to a more
healthy distribution. Structural family approaches (Minuchin, 1974)
attempt to reorganize family members because they are either too
involved or too little involved with one another. All of these
approaches focus on communication, balancing power relationships among
family members, and the need to restructure the troubled family system.
Couples therapy includes both marital relationships and intimate
relationships between unmarried partners. It is a treatment aimed at
helping couples understand and clarify their communications, role
relationships, unfulfilled needs, and unrealistic or unmet expectations.
Couples therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment for those
who find that the quality of their relationship needs improvement
(Nichols & Schwartz, 2005). Another form of social-relational treatment
is group therapy. Unlike couples and family therapy, members of the
group are initially strangers. Group members may, however, share various
characteristics. Groups may be formed to treat older clients, unemployed
workers, or pregnant women; to treat clients with similar psychological
disturbances; or to treat people with similar therapeutic goals. Most
group therapies focus on interrelationships and the dynamics of
interaction among members. Despite their wide diversity, successful
groups and group approaches share several features that promote change
in clients (Corey, 2004; Kottler & Brown, 1992; Yalom, 1970): (1) The
group experience allows each client to become involved in a social
situation and to see how his or her behavior affects others. (2) The
therapist can see how clients actually respond in a real-life social and
interpersonal context. (3) Group members can develop new communication
skills, social skills, and insights. (4) Groups often help members feel
less isolated and less fearful about their problems. (5) Groups can
provide members with strong social and emotional support. The feelings
of intimacy, belonging, protection, and trust (which members may not be
able to experience outside the group) can be a powerful motivation to
confront one's problems and seek to overcome them.

Criticisms of Social-Relational Models There is no denying that we are
social creatures, and by concentrating on this aspect of human behavior,
the social-relational models have added an important social dimension to
our understanding of abnormal behavior. Research on the effects of
family and couples therapy has been consistent in pointing to the value
of therapy compared with no-treatment and alternative-treatment control
groups. However, research studies have generally not been rigorous in
design; they often lacked appropriate control groups, follow-up periods
of outcome, or good measures of outcome (Alexander, Holtzworth-Munroe, &
Jameson, 1994). Further, considerable evidence exists that couples,
marital, and family therapy operate under culture-bound definitions (Sue
& Sue, 2008a). Other critics have voiced concern that family systems
models may have unpleasant consequences. Too often, psychologists have
pointed an accusing finger at the parents of children who suffer from
certain disorders, despite an abundance of evidence that parental
influence may not be a factor in those disorders. The parents are then
burdened with unnecessary guilt over a situation they could not have
otherwise controlled.

FAMILY DYNAMICS AND POSITIVE SELFIMAGE Family interaction patterns can
exert tremendous inﬂuence on a child's personality development,
determining the child's sense of self-worth and the acquisition of
appropriate social skills. This picture shows a Hispanic family
preparing dinner together. Notice the attentiveness and obvious
expressions of joy by the parents toward their children (communicating a
sense of importance to them) and how every family member is actively
involved in their respective roles (emphasizing family cohesion and
belonging).

Dimension Four: Sociocultural Factors Sociocultural perspectives
emphasize the importance of considering race, ethnicity, gender, sexual
orientation, religious preference, socioeconomic status, physical
disabilities, and other such factors in explaining mental disorders.
Research consistently reveals that belonging to specific
sociodemographic groups influences the manifestation of behavior
disorders and may subject members to unique stressors not experienced by
other groups (Ponterotto, Utsey, & Pedersen, 2006; Sue & Sue, 2008a).
The importance of the sociocultural dimension is clearly evident in
DSM-IV-TR, in which Appendix I lists twenty-five culture-bound
syndromes. These are disorders generally limited to a specific society
or cultural group. For example, taijin kyofusho is a culture-specific
disorder (not seen in the United States but in Japan) in which the
individual fears that his or her body parts or function are offensive to
other people because of appearance, odor, or movements. Ataque de
nervios is reported among Latinos from the Caribbean and includes
symptoms of uncontrollable shouting, seizure-like episodes, trembling,
and crying. It is clear that people's cultural experiences are important
factors in the manifestation of mental disorders (Sue & Sue, 2008a). We
briefly discuss three major sociocultural factors to illustrate their
importance in understanding psychopathology: gender, socioeconomic
class, and race/ethnicity.

Gender Factors Women are consistently subjected to greater stressors
than their male counterparts (Spradlin & Parsons, 2008). They carry more
of the domestic burden, more responsibility for child care, and more
responsibility for social and interpersonal relationships. This is true
even if they are employed full time outside of the home (Morales &
Sheafor, 2004). The National Academies (National Academy of Sciences,
National Academy of Engineering, & Institute of Medicine, 2006) describe
the plight of women in the United States to be: (1) predominantly
employed in low-wage, traditional female occupations; (2) subjected to
sexual harassment (81 percent of eighth through eleventh graders, 30
percent of undergraduates, and 40 percent of graduate students); (3)
paid less than their male counterparts in similar jobs; (4) given less
recognition, encouragement, and approval in classrooms than their male
counterparts; (5) more likely to live in poverty; (6) faced with more
barriers to their career choices; and (7) faced with greater
discrimination and victimization.

MULTICULTURAL PERSPECTIVES Multicultural models of human behavior regard
race, culture, and ethnicity as central to the understanding of
normality and abnormality. In China, children are taught to value group
harmony over individual competitiveness. In contrast, in the United
States, individual efforts and privacy such as working alone are valued.
Note the common use of cubicles in work settings to separate people from
one another.

The importance of gender in understanding psychopathology is clearly
seen in rates of depression among women. Up to 7 million women currently
suffer from depression, which is twice the number for men (Schwartzman &
Glaus, 2000). Rather than a narrow explanation (biological or
psychological alone), it is highly probable that many factors
contribute. Further, women are placed in an unenviable position of
fulfilling stereotyped feminine social roles defined by our society. In
our chapter on eating disorders, we discuss more fully how stereotyped
standards of beauty in advertisements and the mass media can affect the
health and self-esteem of girls and women. Body dissatisfaction, eating
disorders, and depression are all significantly related to sociocultural
standards.

Socioeconomic Class Social class and "classicism" are two frequently
overlooked sociodemographic factors in psychology and mental health
(Smith, 2006). Lower socioeconomic class is related to lower sense of
self-control, poorer physical health, and higher incidence of depression
(Chen, Mathews, & Boyce, 2002; Liu et al., 2004). Increasingly,
psychologists are beginning to appreciate how poverty subjects the poor
to increased stressors. The person's life is characterized by low wages,
unemployment, underemployment, lack of savings, little property
ownership, and lack of food reserves (Sue & Sue, 2008a). Meeting even
the most basic needs of food and shelter becomes a major challenge. In
such circumstances, the poor are likely to experience feelings of
hopelessness, helplessness, dependence, and inferiority. Considerable
bias against the poor is well documented in the literature (American
Psychological Association Task Force on Socioeconomic Status, 2006). As
a group, they are more likely to be oppressed and harmed. For example,
they are more likely to be perceived unfavorably than middle- or
upper-class persons, to be considered less worthy, to be stereotyped as
less capable for jobs, and to be socially isolated. Low socioeconomic
class is also associated with (1) exposure to stressors that undermine
mental and physical health, (2) receiving less desirable forms of
therapeutic treatment, and (3) clinician biases in assessment,
diagnosis, and treatment that work to the detriment of those in poverty.

Race/Ethnicity: Multicultural Models of Psychopathology Early attempts
to explain differences between various minority groups and their white
counterparts tended to adopt one of two models. The first, the
inferiority model, contends that racial and ethnic minorities are
inferior in some respect to the majority population. For example, this
model attributes low academic achievement and higher unemployment rates
among African Americans and

Problems in Using Racial and Ethnic Group References

A

frican American, American Indian, Asian American, and Hispanic American
have emerged as commonly used terms to refer to four recognized racial
and ethnic minority groups in the United States. These terms, however,
are not without controversy, nor are they universally accepted by those
who are classiﬁed as belonging to the group. This task has been made
even more difﬁcult with changes in the 2000 U.S. Census that allow
sixty-three possible racial categories. Because we refer to racial and
ethnic groups throughout our text, we want to avoid potential confusion
by clarifying some problematic issues. 1. Terms may be accepted in some
regions but not in others, and some generations will prefer one term
over another. For example, we use the term Hispanic to refer to
individuals with ancestry from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, El Salvador,
the Dominican Republic, and other Latin American countries (Sue & Sue,
2008a). Some individuals, however, prefer to be called Latinos or La
Raza (the race). Some younger ethnically conscious Hispanics with roots
in Mexico may refer to themselves as Chicanos, a statement

deﬁcit model

contemporary attempt to explain differences in minority groups that
suggests that behaviors be evaluated from the perspective of a group's
value system, as well as by other standards used in determining
normality and abnormality

indicating racial pride and consciousness. Many older Mexican Americans,
however, consider Chicanos to be an insulting reference associated with
the uneducated and exploited farmhands of the Southwest. Those
individuals who trace their ancestry to Africa may prefer the term black
to African American. The latter term links identiﬁcation to country of
origin, whereas black is a much more political statement of identity
arising from the late 1960s. Likewise, many older individuals of Asian
ancestry prefer the term Oriental, whereas younger members prefer Asian
American, which for them reﬂects a self-identiﬁcation process rather
than an identity imposed by the larger society. 2. Racial/ethnic
references can create problems by failing to acknowledge ethnic and
cultural differences within a group, thereby submerging many groups
under one label. The term Asian American, for example, technically
encompasses between twenty-nine and thirty-two distinct identiﬁable
Asian subgroups (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese, Asian
Indian, Laotian, Cambodian,

Latinos to low intelligence (heredity). The second model---the
deprivations or deficit model---explained differences as the result of
"cultural deprivation." It implied that minority groups lacked the
"right" culture. Both models have been severely criticized as
inaccurate, biased, and unsupported in the scientific literature
(Ridley, 2005). During the late 1980s and early 1990s, a new and
conceptually different model emerged in the literature. Often referred
to as the multicultural model (or the culturally diverse model; Sue &
Sue, 2008a), the new approach emphasized that being culturally different
does not equal deviancy, pathology, or inferiority. The model recognizes
that each culture has strengths and limitations and that differences are
inevitable. Behaviors are to be evaluated from the perspective of a
group's value system, as well as by other standards used in determining
normality and abnormality (Ivey, D'Andrea, Ivey, & Simek-Morgan, 2007).
The multicultural model makes an explicit assumption that all theories
of human development arise from a particular cultural context (Ivey et
al., 2007). Thus many traditional European American models of
psychopathology are culture bound, evaluating and viewing events and
processes from a worldview not experienced or shared by other cultural
groups. For example, individualism and autonomy are highly valued in the
United States and are equated with healthy functioning. Most European
American children are raised to become increasingly independent, to be
able to make decisions on their own, and to "stand on their own two
feet." In contrast, many traditional Asians and Asian Americans place an
equally high value on "collectivity," in which the psychosocial unit of
identity is the family, not the individual. Similarly, whereas European
Americans fear the loss of "individuality," members of traditional Asian
groups fear the loss of "belonging." Given such different experiences
and values, unenlightened mental health professionals may make biased
assumptions about human behavior---assumptions that may influence their
judgments of normality and abnormality among various racial and ethnic
minorities. For example, a mental health professional who does not

etc.)---each with its own culture, language, customs, and traditions.
The same can be said of the label "Hispanic American" (Mexican American,
Puerto Rican American, Cuban American, etc.). 3. An increasing number of
people have mixed ancestry, and many of them prefer not to be identiﬁed
with one speciﬁc racial or ethnic group (Root, 1996). For the ﬁrst time
in history, the number of biracial babies is increasing at a faster rate
than the number of monoracial babies. People of mixed ancestry may
prefer to be known as biracial, biethnic, bicultural, multiethnic, or
some other term. A whole new vocabulary associated with this phenomenon
is increasingly ﬁnding its way into the social science literature,
including, for example, Afroasian, meaning people of African and Asian
heritage; Eurasian, people of mixed white European and Asian ancestry;
and Mestiza, people of Indian and Spanish ancestry. 4. Reference to
European American, white, Caucasian American, and Anglo is also ﬁlled
with controversy.

61

Anglo is perhaps least appropriate because it technically refers to
people of English descent (or, more distantly, of Germanic descent).
People who trace their ancestry to Italy, France, and the Iberian
peninsula may object to being called Anglo American. Our experience has
been that many whites in our society also react quite negatively to that
term; they prefer to refer to themselves as Irish American, Jewish
American, Italian American, and so on. The terms white and European
American are, however, gaining wider usage, the latter in part because
of the emerging trend of identifying the region or country of ancestry
for Americans. For Further Consideration 1. Given the preceding
discussion, when you think about a particular racial category, what
images come to mind? Are they accurate or stereotypes? 2. What label do

understand that Asian Americans value a collectivistic identity might
see them as overly dependent, immature, and unable to make decisions on
their own. Likewise, such a person might perceive "restraint of strong
feelings"---a valued characteristic among some Asian groups---as
evidence of being "inhibited," "unable to express emotions," or
"repressed." The multicultural model also suggests that sociocultural
stressors reside in the social system rather than within the person.
Racism, bias, discrimination, economic hardships, and cultural conflicts
are just a few of the sociopolitical realities with which racial and
ethnic minorities must contend. As a result, the role of therapist may
be better served by ameliorating oppressive or detrimental social
conditions than by attempting therapy aimed at changing the individual.
Appropriate individual therapy may, however, be directed at teaching
clients self-help skills and strategies focused on influencing their
immediate social situation.

Criticisms of the Multicultural Model In many respects, the
multicultural model operates from a relativistic framework; that is,
normal and abnormal behavior must be evaluated from a cultural
perspective. The reasoning is that behavior considered disordered in one
context---seeing a vision of a dead relative, for example---might not be
considered disordered in another time or place. As indicated in
DSM-IV-TR, some religious practices and beliefs consider it normal to
hear or see a deceased relative during bereavement. In addition, certain
groups, including some American Indian and Hispanic/Latino groups, may
perceive "hallucinations" not just as not disordered but actually as
positive events. Critics of the multicultural model argue that "a
disorder is a disorder," regardless of the cultural context in which it
is considered. For example, a person suffering from schizophrenia and
actively hallucinating is evidencing a malfunctioning of the senses
(seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not there) and a lack of
contact with reality. Regardless of whether the person judges the
occurrence to be desirable or undesirable, it nevertheless represents a
disorder (biological dysfunction), according to this viewpoint.

Did You Know?

ifferent racial groups have different rates of speciﬁc mental disorders
and manifest their psychological problems differently. Asian Americans,
for example, are more likely to somaticize (to have stomach cramps,
sleeplessness, headaches, etc.) than are their European American
counterparts when under stress.

Applying the Models of Psychopathology

A

useful learning exercise to evaluate your mastery of the various models
is to apply them to a case study. We invite you to try your hand at
explaining the behavior of Bill, a hypothetical client. Afterward, we
invite you to attempt a more integrated multipath approach to explaining
Bill's problem.

Bill was born in Indiana to extremely religious parents who raised him
in a strict moralistic manner. His father, a Baptist minister, often
told Bill and his two sisters to "keep your mind clean, heart pure, and
body in control." He forbade Bill's sisters to date while they lived at
home. Bill's own social life and contacts were extremely limited, and he
recalled how anxious he was around girls. Bill's memories of his father
included feelings of fear and intimidation. No one in the family dared
disagree with the father openly, lest they be punished and ridiculed.
The father appeared to be hardest on Bill's two sisters, especially when
they expressed any interest in boys. The arguments and conﬂicts between
father and daughters were often loud and extreme, disrupting the typical
quietness of the home. Although it was never spoken of, Bill was aware
that one of his sisters suffered from depression, as did his mother; his
sister had twice attempted suicide.

TA B L E

Bill's recollections of his mother were unclear, except that she was
always sick with what his father referred to as "the dark cloud," which
seemed to visit her periodically. His relationships with his sisters,
who were several years older, were uncomfortable. When Bill was young,
they teased him mercilessly, and when he reached adolescence, they
seemed to take sadistic delight in arousing his hormones by ﬂaunting
their partially exposed bodies. The result was that Bill became obsessed
with having sex with one of his sisters, and he tended to masturbate
compulsively. Throughout his adolescence and early adulthood he was
tortured by feelings of guilt and believed himself to be, as his father
put it, "an unclean and damned sinner." By all external standards, Bill
was a quiet and well-behaved child. He did well in school, attended
Sunday school without fail, never argued or spoke against his parents,
and seldom ventured outside of the home. Although Bill did exceptionally
well in high school, some of his teachers were concerned about his
introverted behavior and occasional bouts of depression. When they
brought Bill's depression to the attention of his father, however,
Mr. M. dismissed it as no reason to worry. Indeed, Mr. M. complimented
Bill on his good grades and unobtrusive behavior, rewarding him
occasionally with small privileges, such as a larger portion of dessert
or the choice of a TV program. To some degree of

"getting good grades" and "staying out of trouble." As a young child,
Bill had exhibited excellent artistic potential, and his teachers tried
to encourage him in that direction. In elementary school he had won
several awards for his drawings, and teachers frequently asked him to
paint murals in their classrooms or to design posters for school events.
His artistic interests continued into high school, where his art
instructor entered one of Bill's drawings in a state contest. His entry
won ﬁrst prize. Unfortunately, Mr. M. discouraged Bill from his talents
and told him that "God calls you in another direction." Attempting to
please his father, Bill became less involved in art and concentrated
more on math and science. He did very well in these subjects, obtaining
nearly straight A's in high school. When Bill entered college, his prime
objective was to remain a straight-A student. Although he had originally
loved the excitement of learning and mastering new knowledge, he became
cautious and obsessed with "safety"; he was fearful of upsetting his
father. As his string of perfect grades became longer, safety (not
risking a B grade) became more important. He began to choose safe and
easy topics for essays, to enroll in easy courses, and to take
incompletes or withdrawals when courses appeared tough. Toward the end
of his sophomore year, Bill suffered a mental breakdown characterized by
pessimism and hopelessness. He

became depressed and was subsequently hospitalized after he tried to
take his own life.

Table 2.3 summarizes the various models, and the following hints will
help you to begin this exercise: • Consider what each theory proposes as
the basis for the development of a mental disorder. • Consider the type
of data that each perspective considers most important. • Compare and
contrast the models. • Because there are eight models represented, you
might wish to do a comparison only between selected models
(psychoanalytic, humanistic, and behavioral, for example). As you
attempt to explain Bill's behavior, notice how your adoption of a
particular framework inﬂuences the type of data you consider important.
Is it possible that all the models hold some semblance of truth? Are
their positions necessarily contradictory? Is it possible to integrate
them into a uniﬁed explanation of Bill? (Again, you may wish to consult

Another criticism leveled at the multicultural model is its lack of
empirical validation concerning many of its concepts and assumptions.
The field of multicultural counseling and therapy, for example, has been
accused of not being solidly grounded in research (Ponterotto & Casas,
1991). Most of the underlying concepts of the multicultural model are
based on conceptual critiques or formulations that have not been
subjected to formal scientific testing. There is generally heavy
reliance on case studies, ethnographic analyses, and investigations of a
more qualitative type. Multicultural psychologists respond to such
criticisms by noting that they are based on a Western worldview that
emphasizes precision and empirical definitions. They point out that
there is more than one way to ask and answer questions about the human
condition.

I M P L I C AT I O N S

Each model discussed in this chapter---whether biological,
psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, existential-humanistic, family
systems, or multicultural---represents different views of pathology. In
practice, most clinicians recognize that models of psychopathology do
not completely contradict one another on every point (BrooksHarris,
2008). As the multipath model suggests, elements of various perspectives
can complement one another to produce a broad and detailed explanation
of a person's condition (Corey, 2005). In line with a more integrative
approach, the multipath model is holistic, addresses the four major
dimensions of human development, involves dynamic and interactive
factors rather than static ones, and is guided by research findings in
explaining psychopathology (Corey, 2005; Norcross & Newman, 1992;
Sommers-Flanagan & Sommers-Flanagan, 2004). Research now strongly
supports the conclusion that many factors, interacting in all sorts of
ways, contribute to disorders. Proponents of various theories have
acknowledged that factors outside of their theoretical orientation are
important. For example, psychodynamic theorists recognize the importance
of neurotransmitters even as they talk about repression and rage turned
inward in explaining depression. Current research on psychopathology has
found it necessary to use concepts such as mediators, moderators, mutual
and reciprocal influences, critical developmental time periods, multiple
and different factors leading to single disorders, single factors
leading to multiple and different disorders, heterogeneity of specific
disorders, proximal and distal causes, dimensional rather than
categorical concepts of disorders, and so forth in adequately accounting
for mental disorders. Although we know on a general level the importance
of complex interactions of factors that lead to mental disorders, our
knowledge about the dynamics and precise relationship of these
dimensions to one another is far from complete. Research linking micro
(biological) and macro (cultural) variables, for example, is
particularly difficult to find. What, if any, is the effect of a linkage
between heredity and culture on anxiety disorders? This same question
can be asked about the relationship of all four dimensions and factors
within our model. Despite these limitations, however, we believe that
the most influential theories of psychopathology will be those that
adopt a multipath approach in which factors from different approaches
are coherently linked.

Summary 1. What models of psychopathology have been used to explain
abnormal behavior? ■ One-dimensional models have been traditionally used
to explain disorders. They have become increasingly inadequate because
mental disorders are multidimensional. 2. What is the multipath model of
mental disorders? ■ The multipath model is proposed to explain the
interaction of biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural
contributors to mental disturbances. The model is not a theory but a way
of looking at the variety and complexity of contributors to mental
disorders. In some respects it is a metamodel, a model of models that
provides an organizational framework for understanding the numerous
causes of mental disorders, the complexity of their interacting
components, and the need to view disorders from a holistic framework. 3.
How much of mental disorder can be explained through our biological
makeup? ■ Biological models cite various organic causes of
psychopathology, including genetics, brain anatomy, biochemical
imbalances, central nervous system functioning, and autonomic nervous
system reactivity. A good deal of biochemical research has focused on
identifying the role of neurotransmitters in abnormal behavior.
Researchers have also found correlations between genetic inheritance and
certain psychopathologies. Mental health research reveals that a
predisposition to a disorder, not the disorder itself, may be inherited.
Gene-environment interactions are a two-way process that is reciprocal
in nature. 4. What psychological models are used to explain the etiology
of mental disorders? ■ Psychodynamic models emphasize childhood experi-

ences and the role of the unconscious in determining adult behavior. The
early development of psychodynamic theory is credited to Freud.
Psychoanalytic therapy attempts to help the patient achieve insight into
his or her unconscious. ■ Behavioral models focus on the role of
learning in abnormal behavior. The traditional behavioral models of
psychopathology hold that abnormal behaviors are acquired through
association (classical conditioning), reinforcement (operant
conditioning), or modeling. Negative emotional responses, such as
anxiety, can be learned through classical conditioning: a formerly
neutral stimulus evokes a negative response after it has been presented
along with a stimulus that already evokes that response. Negative
voluntary behaviors may be learned through operant conditioning if those
behaviors are

reinforced (rewarded) when they occur. In observational learning, a
person learns behaviors, which can be quite complex, by observing them
in other people and then imitating, or modeling, those behaviors. ■
Cognitive models are based on the assumption that

conscious thought mediates, or modifies, an individual's emotional state
and/or behavior in response to a stimulus. Cognitive therapeutic
approaches are generally aimed at normalizing the client's perception of
events. ■ The

humanistic perspective actually represents many perspectives and shares
many basic assumptions with the existential perspective. Both view an
individual's reality as a product of personal perception and experience.
Both see people as capable of making free choices and fulfilling their
potential. Both emphasize the whole person and the individual's ability
to fulfill his or her capacities.

5.  What role do social factors play in psychopathology? ■ Impairment or
    absence of social relationships have been found to be correlated
    with increased susceptibility to mental disorders. Good
    relationships seem to immunize people against stressors. ■ From the
    perspective of family systems, abnormal behavior is viewed as the
    result of distorted or faulty communication or unbalanced structural
    relationships within the family. Children who receive faulty
    messages from parents or who are subjected to structurally abnormal
    family constellations may develop behavioral and emotional problems.
    ■ Three social treatments described are family therapy, couples
    therapy, and group therapy.
6.  What sociocultural factors may play a role in the etiology of mental
    disorders? ■ Proponents of the sociocultural approach believe that
    race, culture, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious
    preference, socioeconomic status, physical disabilities, and other
    variables are powerful influences in determining how specific
    cultural groups manifest disorders, how mental health professionals
    perceive disorders, and how disorders are treated. ■ Cultural
    differences have been perceived in three ways: (1) the inferiority
    model, in which differences are attributed to the interplay of
    undesirable elements in a person's biological makeup; (2) the
    deprivation or deficit model, in which differences in traits or
    behaviors are blamed on not having the "right culture"; and

<!-- -->

(3) the multicultural model, in which differences do not necessarily
    equate with deviance.

mily was an attractive college student. Because she was having trouble
meeting interesting men, she decided to try speed dating. In speed
dating, men and women have brief conversations to see whether they can
ﬁnd someone they might like to date. Men and women are paired and
converse for a few minutes. At the end of each pairing, participants
move on to the next "date." After making a number of pairings,
participants indicate who, among those they met, they would like to meet
again. If there is a match, contact information is sent to both parties.
Emily met six men. Because she wanted to date men who were sharp-witted,
humorous, generous, and good-looking, she had to quickly assess them.
But how should she go about assessing the men? If you were in that
situation, would you base your evaluation on appearance, verbal or
non-verbal behaviors, spontaneity? How would you know whether someone
was being honest or giving you a line?

All of us have to evaluate or assess others in everyday life without
thinking much about it. When we are introduced to a new person, buy a
car from a salesperson, visit a professor's office, interview someone
for a position, or work collaboratively on a project with another
person, we have to evaluate. We have to judge whether a person is
trustworthy, honest, sincere, smart, capable, knowledgeable, likeable,
friendly, and so on. We may use different methods to assess a person,
and we may differ in our accuracy. In the mental health field,
assessment is critical. Therapists must collect information on the
well-being of individuals and organize information about a person's
condition. Among the assessment tools available to clinicians are
observations, conversations, interviews, a variety of psychological and
neurological tests, and the reports of the patient and his or her
relatives and friends. When the data gathered from all sources are
combined and analyzed, a therapist can gain a good picture of the
patient's behavior and mental state.

evaluating the mental health of people?

3 How are mental health problems categorized or classiﬁed?

As we noted in Chapter 1, the evaluation of the information leads to a
psychodiagnosis, which involves describing and drawing inferences about
an individual's psychological state. Psychodiagnosis is often an early
step in the treatment process. For many psychotherapists, it is the
basis on which a program of therapy is first formulated. To arrive at a
psychodiagnosis, the therapist attempts to obtain a clear description of
the client's behavioral patterns and to classify or group them based on
the symptom picture that emerges. In this chapter, we examine assessment
methods and clinicians' use of assessment tools. We also discuss the
most widely employed diagnostic classification system, DSM-IV-TR, as
well as objections some have made to the use of classification systems
and labeling. Because questions of reliability and validity are
essential to address in assessment tools and in any diagnostic system,
we start the chapter with a discussion of reliability and validity.

Reliability and Validity To be useful, assessment tools and
classification systems must demonstrate reliability and validity.
Reliability is the degree to which a procedure or test---such as an
evaluation tool or classification scheme---will yield the same results
repeatedly under the same circumstances. There are many types of
reliability (Robinson, Shaver, & Wrightsman, 1991). Test-retest
reliability determines whether a measure yields the same results when
given to an individual at two different points in time. For example, if
we administer a measure of anxiety to an individual in the morning and
then readminister the measure later in the day, the measure is reliable
if the results show consistency or stability (that is, if the results
are the same) from one point in time to another. Inconsistent results
may reflect real changes in the behavior of the individual and not just
a poor measure. Nevertheless, in such circumstances, there is poor
test-retest reliability. In reliability that involves internal
consistency, a measure is considered reliable if various parts of the
measure yield similar or consistent results (Kline, 2005). For example,
if responses to different items on a measure of anxiety are not related
to one another, the items are unreliable because they may be measuring
different things, not just anxiety. Finally, interrater reliability
determines consistency of responses when different judges or raters
administer the measure. For instance, imagine that two clinicians are
trained to diagnose individuals according to a certain classification
scheme. Yet one clinician diagnoses the patient's disorder as
schizophrenia and the other diagnoses mental retardation. There is a
reliability problem between the two raters. Validity is the extent to
which a test or procedure actually performs the function it was designed
to perform. If a measure that is intended to assess depression instead
assesses anxiety, the measure demonstrates poor validity for depression.
As in the case of reliability, there are several ways to determine
validity. The most important are predictive, criterion-related,
construct, and content validity. Predictive validity refers to the
ability of a test or measure to predict or foretell how a person will
behave, respond, or perform. Colleges and universities often use
applicants' high school achievement test scores to predict their future
college grades. If the test scores have good predictive validity, they
should be able to differentiate students who will perform well from
those who will perform poorly in college.

Criterion-related validity determines whether a measure is related to
the phenomenon in question. Assume, for example, that we devise a
measure that is intended to tell us whether persons recovering from
alcoholism are likely to return to drinking. If we find that those who
score high on the measure start drinking again and that those who score
low do not, then the measure is valid. Determining construct validity is
actually a series of tasks with one common theme: all are designed to
test whether a measure is related to certain phenomena that are
empirically or theoretically thought to be related to that measure.
Let's say that a researcher has developed a questionnaire to measure
anxiety. To determine construct validity, the researcher should show
that the questionnaire is correlated with other measures, such as
existing tests of anxiety. Furthermore, we would have increased
confidence that the questionnaire is measuring anxiety if it is related
to other phenomena that appear in anxious people, such as muscle
tension, sweating, tremors, and startle responses. Finally, content
validity refers to the degree to which a measure is representative of
the phenomenon being measured. For example, we know that depression
involves cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physiological features.
If a self-report measure of depression contains items that assess only
cognitive features, such as items indicating pessimism, then the measure
has poor content validity because it fails to assess three of the four
known components of the disorder. Reliability and validity are also
influenced by the conditions in which a test or measure is administered.
Standardization or standard administration requires that those who
administer a test strictly follow common rules or procedures. If an
instructor creates a tense and hostile environment for some students who
are taking final exams for a course but not for others, for example, the
students' test scores may vary simply because the instructor is not
treating all students in a similar or standard fashion. An additional
concern is the standardization sample---a group of people who have taken
the measure and whose performance can be used as a standard or norm. The
performance of another person can therefore be interpreted against this
norm. However, the standardization sample must be appropriate to the
person being evaluated. Our interpretations may not be valid if we
compare the test score of a twentyyear-old African American woman with
the scores of forty-year-old white American men in a standardization
sample.

assessment

Assessment is the process of gathering information and drawing
conclusions about the traits, skills, abilities, emotional functioning,
and psychological problems of the individual, generally for use in
developing a diagnosis. Assessment tools are necessary to the study and
practice of mental health. Without them, data could not be collected,
and psychologists could not conduct meaningful research, develop
theories, or engage in psychotherapy. Data collection necessarily
involves the use of tools to systematically record the observations,
behaviors, or self-reports of individuals. Four principal means of
assessment are available to clinicians: observations, interviews,
psychological tests and inventories, and neurological tests. In general,
assessment should be conducted using multiple methods and tests in order
to get a more accurate view of clients (Kendall, Holmbeck, & Verduin,
2004). Assessment techniques and some specific tools for conducting them
are discussed in the following pages and are summarized in Table 3.1.

Observations Observations of overt behavior provide the most basic
method of assessing abnormal behavior. Clinical observations can be
either controlled or naturalistic. Controlled (or analogue) observations
occur in a laboratory, clinic, or other contrived (artificial) setting
(Haynes, 2001). Naturalistic observations are made in a natural
setting--- a schoolroom, an office, a hospital ward, or a home---rather
than in a laboratory.

The Assessment of Abnormal Behavior

Observations can be highly structured and specific, as when an observer
notes the frequency of stuttering and the circumstances under which
stuttering occurs in a client. Sometimes clients are asked to role-play
social interactions, and these interactions are evaluated (Norton &
Hope, 2001). On other occasions, observations may be less formal and
specific, as when a clinician simply looks for any unusual behaviors on
the part of a client. In such a situation, the observations and
interpretations of the behaviors may be quite subjective in nature.
Observations of behavior are usually made in conjunction with an
interview. A trained clinical psychologist watches for external signs or
cues and expressive behaviors that may have diagnostic significance. The
client's general mode of dress (neat, conventional, sloppy, flashy),
significant scars or tattoos, and even choice of jewelry may be
correlated with personality traits or, perhaps, with disorder. Likewise,
other expressive behaviors, such as posture, facial expression, language
and verbal patterns, handwriting, and selfexpression through graphic art
may all reveal certain characteristics of the client's life. Here is an
example of some typical observations.

Case Study Margaret was a thirty-seven-year-old depressive patient who
was seen by one of the authors in a hospital psychiatric ward. She had
recently been admitted for treatment. It was obvious from a casual
glance that Margaret had not taken care of herself for weeks. Her face
and hands were dirty. Her long hair, which had originally been done up
in a bun, had shaken partially loose on one side and now hung down her
left shoulder. Her beat-up tennis shoes were only halfway on her
stockingless feet. Her disheveled appearance and her stooped body
posture would lead one to believe she was much older than she was. When
ﬁrst interviewed, Margaret sat as though she did not have the strength
to straighten her body. She avoided eye contact with the interviewer and
stared at the ﬂoor. When asked questions, she usually responded in short
phrases: "Yes," "No," "I don't know," "I don't care." There were long
pauses between the questions and her answers. Each response seemingly
took great effort on her part.

Some psychologists rely on trained raters or on parents, teachers, or
other third parties to make the observations and gather information for
assessment and evaluation. Others prefer their own observations to those
of a third party. Regardless of who conducts the observation, two
problems may occur (Sundberg, Taplin, & Tyler, 1983). First, observers
must check the validity of their own interpretations of the patient's
behaviors. This is particularly important when the patient is from a
culture different from that of the observer. Second, observers must try
to minimize the impact of their observations on the patient's behaviors.
This effort is necessary because a person who is aware of being observed
or assessed may change the way he or she usually responds, a phenomenon
known as reactivity (Kline, 2005). For example, drivers who know that
they are being observed by a police car may be extra careful in
following traffic laws.

Interviews The clinical interview is a time-honored tradition as a means
of psychological assessment. It lets the therapist observe the client
and collect data about the person's life

a change in the way a person usually responds, triggered by the person's
knowledge that he or she is being observed or assessed

NATURALISTIC VERSUS CONTROLLED OBSERVATIONS Naturalistic observations
are made in settings that occur naturally in one's environment. Here, on
the left, a female researcher is taking notes while observing children
at play in a playground in Los Angeles, California. The playground is a
natural setting for the children to play in. In this photo on the right,
a female researcher with a laptop computer is rating the behaviors in a

situation and personality. Verbal and nonverbal behaviors, as well as
the content (what the client is saying) and process (how the client is
communicating---such as with anxiety, hesitation, or anger), of
communications are important to analyze (Reiser, 1988). Depending on the
particular disciplinary training of the interviewer, the interview's
frame of reference and its emphasis may vary considerably.
Psychiatrists, being trained in medicine, are more likely to emphasize
biological or physical variables. Social workers may be more concerned
with life history data and the socioeconomic environment of the client.
Clinical psychologists may be most interested in the client's behaviors
and psychological mood. Likewise, variations in therapeutic orientation
within the discipline of psychology can affect the interview. Because of
their strong belief in the unconscious origin of behavior,
psychoanalysts may be more interested in psychodynamic processes than in
the surface content of the client's words. They are also more likely to
pay particular attention to life history variables and dreams.
Behaviorists are more likely to concentrate on current environmental
conditions related to the client's behavior. In practice, however,
mental health practitioners with different therapeutic orientations can
also exhibit a great deal of similarity in psychotherapeutic style.
Standardization and Structure As mentioned in the earlier discussion of
reliability and validity, standard administration means that common
rules or procedures must be strictly followed. Interviews can vary in
the degree to which they are structured, the manner in which they are
conducted, and the degree of freedom of response on the part of the
client. In some interviews, the client is given considerable freedom
about what to say and when to say it. The clinician does little to
interfere with conversation or to direct its flow. Psychoanalysts, who
use free association, and Rogerians, who carry on nondirective therapy,
tend to conduct highly unstructured interviews. Behaviorists tend to use
more structured interviews. The most highly structured interview is the
formal standardized interview, in which questions are usually arranged
as a checklist, complete with scales for rating answers. The interviewer
uses the checklist to ask each interviewee the same set of questions, so
that errors are minimized. Although structured interviews often do not

The Assessment of Abnormal Behavior

71

permit interviewers to probe interviewees' responses in depth, they have
the advantage of allowing consistent data to be collected across
interviewees, and they are less subject to interviewers' biases (Hill &
Lambert, 2004). A less structured but also widely used interview
procedure is the mental status examination. The intent of this
examination is to determine in a general way a client's cognitive,
psychological, and behavioral functioning by means of questions,
observations, and tasks posed to the client (Othmer & Othmer, 1994). The
clinician considers the appropriateness and quality of the client's
responses (behaviors, speech, emotions, intellectual functioning) and
then attempts to render provisional evaluations of the diagnosis,
prognosis, client dynamics, and treatment issues. Errors In the field of
mental health, straightforward questions do not always yield usable or
accurate information. Believing personal information to be private,
patients may refuse to reveal it, may distort it, or may lie about
themselves. Furthermore, many patients may be unable to articulate their
inner thoughts and feelings. Clinicians themselves may interpret
interviews in a biased or invalid manner. An interview should therefore
be considered a measurement device that is fallible and subject to error
(Wiens, 1983).

Psychological Tests and Inventories Psychological tests and inventories
are a variety of standardized instruments that have been used to assess
personality, maladaptive behavior, development of social skills,
intellectual abilities, vocational interests, and cognitive impairment.
Tests have also been developed for the purpose of understanding
personality dynamics and conflicts. They differ in form (that is, they
may be oral or written and may be administered to groups or to
individuals), structure, degree of objectivity, and content. To varying
degrees (less so in the case of projective personality tests), they
share two characteristics that involve standard administration and use
of a standardization sample. First, they provide a standard situation in
which certain kinds of responses are elicited. The same instructions are
given to all persons who take the same test, the same scoring is
applied, and similar environmental conditions are maintained to ensure
that the responses are due to each test taker's unique attributes rather
than to differences in situations. Second, by comparing an individual
test taker's responses with norms, established by the standardization
sample, the therapist can make inferences about the underlying traits of
the person. For instance, the test taker may answer "yes" to questions
such as "Is someone trying to control your mind?" more frequently than
is the norm. The therapist might infer that this pattern of response is
similar to that of individuals diagnosed with paranoia. In the remainder
of this section, we examine two general types of personality tests and
measures (projective and self-report inventories) and tests of
intelligence and cognitive impairment. It should be noted that
two-thirds of the assessments used by clinical psychologists are
evaluations of personality psychopathology and intellectual achievement.
The second most popular use of psychological testing is for
neuropsychological assessment and adaptive-functional behavior
assessment, according to half of the clinical psychologists surveyed for
their assessment practices (Camara, Nathan, & Puente, 2000). Projective
Personality Tests In a projective personality test, the test taker is
presented with ambiguous stimuli, such as inkblots, pictures, or
incomplete sentences, and asked to respond to them in some way. The
stimuli are generally novel, and the test is relatively unstructured.
Conventional or stereotyped patterns of response usually do not fit the
stimuli. The person must "project" his or her attitudes, motives, and
other personality characteristics onto the situation. The nature of the
appraisal is generally well disguised: participants are often unaware of
the true nature or purpose of the test and usually do not recognize the
significance of their responses. Based largely on a psychoanalytic
perspective, projective tests presumably tap into the individual's
unconscious needs and motivations or dynamics of perception and
motivation (Meyer et al., 2003). No matter which form of test is used,
the goal of

n order to assess whether a client is functioning and thinking
appropriately, clinicians often ask a client what time it is (or what
the date is), who the client is, and where the client currently is. In
one case, a client who was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward responded

until I have to enter the army."

projective testing is to get a multifaceted view of the total
functioning person, rather than a view of a single facet or dimension of
personality. Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach devised the Rorschach
technique for personality appraisal in 1921. A Rorschach test consists
of ten cards that display symmetrical inkblot designs. The cards are
presented one at a time to participants, who are asked (1) what they see
in the blots and (2) what characteristics of the blots make them see
that. Inkblots are considered appropriate stimuli because they are
ambiguous, are nonthreatening, and do not elicit learned responses. What
people see in the blots, whether they attend to large areas or to
details, whether they respond to color, and whether their perceptions
suggest movement are assumed to be symbolic of inner promptings,
motivations, and conflicts. Test takers react in a personal and
"unlearned" fashion because there are no right or wrong answers. The
psycholoTHE RORSCHACH TECHNIQUE Devised by Swiss psychiatrist gist then
interprets the individual's reactions. Both the basic Hermann Rorschach
in 1921, the Rorschach technique uses a premise of the Rorschach test
and the psychologist's internumber of cards, each showing a symmetrical
inkblot design pretation of the symbolism within the patient's responses
are similar to the one shown here. The earlier cards in the set strongly
psychoanalytic. For example, seeing eyes or buttocks are in black and
white; the later cards are more colorful. A may imply paranoid
tendencies; fierce animals may imply client's responses to the inkblots
are interpreted according to aggressive tendencies; blood may imply
strong uncontrolled assessment guidelines and can be compared by the
therapist with the responses that other clients have made. emotions;
food may imply dependency needs; and masks may imply avoidance of
personal exposure (Klopfer & Davidson, 1962). The single most important
rationale for using the Rorschach and other projective tests is that
they presumably provide information about personality dynamics that are
outside the conscious awareness of the test takers (Clarkin, Hurt, &
Mattis, 1999). There are actually a variety of approaches to
interpreting and scoring Rorschach responses. The most extensive and
recent is the comprehensive system of Exner (1983, 1990), whose scoring
system is based on reviews of research findings and studies of the
Rorschach technique. Exner thinks of the Rorschach technique as a
problemsolving task; test takers are presented with ambiguous stimuli
that they interpret according to their preferred mode of
perceptual-cognitive processing. Exner's system has also yielded indexes
of specific disorders such as depression, although the adequacy of the
Rorschach technique in assessing specific disorders is a matter of Did
You Know? continuing research (Ball et al., 1991). Because it relies on
research findings and he Rorschach is employed by normative data,
Exner's system has become the standard for scoring the Rorschach a
number of psychologists. In test (Weiss, 1988). one survey (Exner, 1995)
of The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) was first developed by Henry
Murray psychologists, 75 percent reported in 1935 (Murray & Morgan,
1938). It consists of thirty picture cards, each typically that they
used psychological tests depicting two human figures. Their poses and
actions are vague and ambiguous in their practice; of those who used
enough to be open to different interpretations. Some cards are
designated for specific such tests, 43 percent used the age levels or
for a single gender, and some are appropriate for all groups. Like the
Rorschach at various times. Rorschach technique, the TAT relies on
projection to tap underlying motives, drives, and personality processes.
Most clinicians agree, however, that the TAT is best when it is used to
uncover aspects of interpersonal relationships. Generally, twenty TAT
cards are shown to the participant, one at a time, with instructions to
tell a story about each picture. Typically, the tester says, "I am going
to show you some pictures. Tell me a story about what is going on in
each one, what led up to it, and what its outcome will be." The entire
story is recorded verbatim. There is usually no limit on time or the
length of the stories. A trained clinician interprets the participant's
responses, either subjectively or by using a formal scoring system. Both
interpretations usually take into account the style of the story
(length, organization, and so on); recurring themes, such as
retribution, failure, parental domination, aggression, and sexual
concerns; the outcome of the

T

The Assessment of Abnormal Behavior

story in relationship to the plot; primary and secondary identification
(the choice of hero or secondary person of importance); and the handling
of authority figures and sexual relationships. The purpose is to gain
insight into the individual's conflicts and worries, as well as clues
about his or her core personality structure. Woike and McAdams (2001)
found that the TAT is particularly valuable in ascertaining an
individual's personality and motivation. Other types of projective tests
include sentence-completion and draw-a-person tests. In the
sentence-completion test, the participant is given a list of partial
sentences and is asked to complete each of them. Typical partial
sentences are "My ambition . . . ," "My mother was always . . . ," and
"I can remember . . . ." Clinicians try to interpret the meaning of the
individual's responses. In draw-a-person tests, such as the Machover
D-A-P (Machover, 1949), the participant is actually asked to draw a
person. Then he or she may be asked to draw a person of the opposite
sex. Finally, the participant may be instructed to make up a story about
the characters that were drawn or to describe the first character's
background. Many clinicians analyze these drawings for size, position,
detail, and so on, assuming that the drawings provide diagnostic clues.
For example, persons suffering from brain impairments may draw
disproportionately large heads. The validity of such assumptions is open
to question, and well-controlled studies cast doubt on diagnostic
interpretations (Anastasi, 1982). The analysis and interpretation of
responses to projective tests are subject to wide variation. Clinicians
given the same data frequently disagree with one another about scoring.
Much of this disparity is caused by differences in clinicians'
orientations, skills, and personal styles. But, as noted earlier, the
demonstrably low reliability and validity of these instruments means
that they should be used with caution and in conjunction with other
assessment measures. And even when projective tests exhibit reliability,
they may still have low validity. For example, many clinicians agree
that certain specific responses to the Rorschach inkblots indicate
repressed anger. The fact that many clinicians agree makes the test
reliable, but those specific responses could indicate something other
than repressed anger. Illusory correlations may exist, and clinicians
may erroneously link a patient's response to the existence of a syndrome
(Chapman & Chapman, 1967). Self-Report Inventories Unlike projective
tests, self-report inventories require test takers to answer specific
written questions or to select specific responses from a list of
alternatives---usually self-descriptive statements. Participants are
asked to either agree or disagree with the statement or to indicate the
extent of their agreement or disagreement. Because a predetermined score
is assigned to each possible answer, human judgmental factors in scoring
and interpretation are minimized. In addition, participants' responses
and scores can be compared readily with a standardization sample.
Perhaps the most widely used self-report personality inventory is the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, or MMPI (Hathaway &
McKinley, 1943). The MMPI-2, a revision by Butcher and colleagues (see
Butcher, 1990; Graham, 1990; Greene, 1991), restandardized the
inventory, refined the wording of certain items, eliminated items
considered outdated, and attempted to include appropriate
representations of ethnic minority groups. The MMPI-2 consists of 567
statements; participants are asked to indicate whether each statement is
true or false as it applies to them. There is also a "cannot say"
alternative, but clients are strongly discouraged from using this
category because too many such responses can invalidate the test. The
test taker's MMPI-2 results are rated on ten clinical scales and a
number of validity scales. The ten clinical scales were originally
constructed by analyzing the responses of diagnosed psychiatric patients
(and the responses of normal participants) to the 567 test items. These
analyses allowed researchers to determine what kinds of responses each
of the various types of psychiatric patients usually made, in contrast
to those of normal individuals. The validity scales, which assess
degrees of candor, confusion, falsification, and so forth on the part of
the respondent, help the

controversy

Should the Rorschach Be Used in Making Assessments?

A

lthough the Rorschach has been widely used in clinical assessment, it
has generated considerable controversy. The controversy is over the
reliability, validity, and usefulness of the Rorschach in clinical
practice. Critics claim that the Rorschach has been overvalued because
of biased beliefs that it can be a useful tool in assessment and
treatment. Defenders of the Rorschach argue that its use for many
decades has demonstrated its usefulness and that cumulative research
clearly shows the validity of the Rorschach in making diagnoses and in
giving treatment insights. In particular, critics and supporters make
the following arguments. Critics Argue That: • A moratorium should be
placed on many applications of the Rorschach until further research
demonstrates its validity (Garb et al., 2005). • The use of the
Rorschach can make normal individuals appear psychologically disturbed
(Lilienfeld, Fowler, & Lohr, 2003). • The use of the Rorschach for
formal assessment and treatment planning can cause harm to clients
(Garb, 2003). • Training in the comprehensive system for the Rorschach
should be eliminated (Garb et al., 2005).

as that found on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
(Society for Personality Assessment, 2005). • With respect to the
Rorschach, a small group of psychologists is deciding what is scientiﬁc
and what is not and, on this basis, is urging, in effect, an end to the
teaching and use of methods that do not pass their muster (Weiner,
Spielberger, & Abeles, 2002; 2003). • The unjustiﬁed criticisms of the
Rorschach resembles the "burning of books" (Weiner et al., 2002). It is
unlikely that the debate will be settled. What would be helpful is for
critics and supporters to jointly examine studies of the Rorschach,
evaluate the adequacy of research designs and methodologies, analyze
criteria for outcomes, and try to come to some joint conclusions. In
this way, we can gain some insight into precisely in what areas
consensus and disagreement exist. The controversy, however, has been
valuable in that the two sides agree that scientiﬁc ﬁndings are critical
in the debate, that Rorschach administration needs to be standardized,
and that an assessment tool such as the Rorschach should be only one of
many that are used to render clinical diagnosis. For Further
Consideration

Supporters Argue That:

1.  Which side of the Rorschach argument makes most sense to you?

• The Rorschach has recently received a more intensive level of scrutiny
than that given any other personality test. Yet research indicates that
Rorschach validity is as good

2.  If Rorschach administration were to be standardized, what standards
    might researchers and clinicians put into practice?

clinician detect potential faking or special circumstances that may
affect the outcome of other scales (Bagby et al., 1997). Figure 3.1
shows possible responses to ten sample MMPI-2 items and the kinds of
responses that contribute to a high rating on the ten MMPI clinical
scales. A basic assumption of the original version of the MMPI was that
a person whose MMPI answers are similar to those of diagnosed patients
is likely to behave similarly to those patients. However, single-scale
interpretations are fraught with hazards. Although a person with a high
rating on Scale 6 may be labeled paranoid, this scale does not detect
many persons with paranoia. Interpretation of the MMPI-2 scales can be
quite complicated and requires special training. Generally,
multiple-scale interpretations (pattern analysis) and characteristics
associated with the patterns are examined. Although the MMPIs of clients
are subjected to pattern and statistical analyses, client responses can
also be viewed as direct communications of important content:
information about the client's symptoms, attitudes, and behaviors
(Butcher, 1995). The MMPI-2 should be used by clinicians who have
mastered its intricacies, who understand relevant statistical concepts,
and who can interpret the client's responses (Butcher, 1995; Graham,
1990; Newmark, 1985). Although labeled as a personality test, the MMPI
was constructed to assess mental disorders (Clarkin et al., 1999).
Whereas the MMPI-2 assesses a number of different personality
characteristics of a person, some self-report inventories or
questionnaires focus on only certain kinds of personality traits or
emotional problems, such as depression or anxiety.

THE TEN MMPI-2 CLINICAL SCALES AND SAMPLE MMPI-2 TEST ITEMS Shown here
are the MMPI-2 clinical scales and a few of the items that appear on
them. As an example, answering "no" or "false" (rather than "yes" or
"true") to the item "I have a good appetite" would result in a higher
scale score for hypochondriasis, depression, and hysteria.

Source: Adapted from Dahlstrom & Welsh (1965). These items from the
original MMPI remain unchanged in the MMPI-2.

For example, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is composed of
twenty-one items that measure various aspects of depression, such as
mood, appetite, functioning at work, suicidal thinking, and sleeping
patterns (Beck et al., 1961). Though widely used, personality
inventories have limitations. First, the fixed number of alternatives
can hinder individuals from presenting an accurate picture of
themselves. Being asked to answer "true" or "false" to the statement "I
am suspicious

of people" does not permit an individual to qualify the item in any way.
Second, a person may have a unique response style or response set (a
tendency to respond to test items in a certain way regardless of
content) that may distort the results. For example, many people have a
need to present themselves in a favorable light, and this can cause them
to give answers that are socially acceptable but inaccurate. Some
individuals may fake having a disorder or try to avoid appearing
deviant. Third, interpretations of responses of people from different
cultural groups may be inaccurate if norms for these groups have not
been developed. Despite these potential problems, personality
inventories are widely used. Some, such as the MMPI-2, have been
extensively researched throughout the world, and in many cases their
validity has been established. Sophisticated means have also been found
to control for response sets and for faking. For example, although
individuals can lower their psychopathology scores by trying to hide
their symptoms on the MMPI (as in trying to fake being healthy when they
are not), the MMPI has scales that can help alert clinicians to possible
faking (Bagby et al., 1997). In general, inventories are inexpensive and
more easily administered and scored than are projective tests. (In fact,
many inventories are scored and interpreted by computer.) These features
make the use of self-report inventories desirable, especially in a busy
clinic or hospital environment. Moreover, although progress has been
slow, the predictive ability and validity of personality assessment
tests have been improved. Psychometrics---psychological measurement,
which includes the measurement of knowledge, abilities, attitudes, and
personality traits---is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Further
refinement will be achieved when situational variables that help
determine behaviors can be taken into account and when fluctuations in
mood and other, more stable personality processes can be measured.

Intelligence Tests Intelligence testing is intended to obtain an
estimate of a person's current level of cognitive functioning, called
the intelligence quotient (IQ). An IQ score indicates an individual's
level of performance relative to that of other people of the same age.
As such, an IQ score is an important aid in predicting school
performance and detecting mental retardation. (Through statistical
procedures, IQ test results are converted into numbers, with 100
representing the mean, or average, score. An IQ score of about 130
indicates performance exceeding that of 95 percent of all same-age
peers.) Other functions of intelligence testing are determining
intellectual deterioration in psychotic disorders and discovering how a
person approaches a task, handles failure, and persists in or gives up
the task. The two most widely used intelligence tests are the Wechsler
scales (Wechsler, 1981) and the Stanford-Binet scales (Terman & Merrill,
1960; Thorndike, Hagen, & Sattler, 1986). The Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale (the WAIS and its revised version, WAIS-III) is
administered to persons age sixteen and older. Two other forms are
appropriate for children ages six to sixteen (the Wechsler Intelligence
Scale for Children, or WISC-III) and ages four to six (the Wechsler
Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, or WPPSI-III). The WAIS-III
consists of six verbal and five performance scales, which yield verbal
and performance IQ scores. These scores are combined to present a total
IQ score. The WAIS consists of four factors: Verbal Comprehension,
Perceptual Organization, Working Memory, and Processing Speed
(Saklofske, Hildebrand, & Gorsuch, 2000). Table 3.2 shows subtest items
similar to those used in the WAIS-III. The Stanford-Binet Intelligence
Scale is used for individuals age two and older. Much more complicated
in administration and scoring, and not standardized on an adult
population, the Stanford-Binet requires considerable skill in its use.
The test procedure is designed to establish a basal age (the participant
passes all subtests for that age) and a ceiling age (the participant
fails all subtests for that age), from which an IQ score is calculated.
In general, the WISC is preferred over the Stanford-Binet for school-age
children (La Greca & Stringer, 1985). It is easier to administer and
yields scores on different cognitive skills (such as verbal and
performance subtests). Yet the Stanford-Binet is the standard to which
other tests are compared because of its long history, careful revision,
and updating (Kline, 2005).

There are four major critiques of the use of IQ tests. First, some
investigators believe that IQ tests have been popularized as a means of
measuring innate intelligence, when in truth the tests largely reflect
cultural and social factors (Sternberg, 2005). The issue of racial
differences in innate intelligence has a long history of debate. The
publication of The Bell Curve (Herrnstein & Murray, 1994) refocused
attention on this issue. The authors of that book propose that racial
differences in IQ scores are determined by heredity and that social and
status differences between intellectually different classes are
therefore difficult to overcome (see Figure 3.2). More recently, Rushton
and Jensen (2005) also argued that racial differences in IQ scores are
determined by heredity. Critics (e.g., Nisbett, 2005; Suzuki & Aronson,
2005) have charged that the basic premises of Herrnstein and Murray's
book are faulty and that the frequent assumption that IQ tests measure
innate intelligence is false. Second, the predictive validity of IQ
tests has been criticized. That is, do IQ test scores accurately predict
the future behaviors or achievements of different cultural groups?
Proponents and critics disagree on this point (Anastasi, 1982). Third,
investigators often disagree over criterion variables (in essence, what
is actually being predicted by IQ tests). For example, two investigators
may be interested in the ability of IQ --3 --2 --1 0 1 2 3 tests to
predict future success. One may try to find a correlation Standard
deviations from the mean between test scores and grades subsequently
received in school. The other investigator may argue that grades are a
poor indicaFIGURE A BELL CURVE SHOWING STANDARD DEVIATIONS The bell
curve refers to the fact that the tor of success---that leadership
skills and the ability to work with distribution of IQ scores in a
population resembles the shape people are better indicators of success.
Fourth, some researchers have questioned whether our current of a bell,
with most scores hovering over the mean and conceptions of IQ tests and
intelligence are adequate. A number fewer scores falling in the outlying
areas of the distribution. of researchers have proposed that
intelligence is a multidimen- IQ scores are transformed so that the mean

and one that cannot be adequately assessed (about 15 IQ points above or
below the mean, or IQ scores using IQ tests, is social intelligence or

of the may be important in such areas as problem solving, adaptation to

knowledge, and the ability to use resources effectively. or below the
mean, or IQs between 70 and 130) account Sternberg (2004) finds that
intelligence can be viewed as analytical for over 95 percent of the
scores.

TESTING FOR INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING Intelligence tests can provide
valuable information about intellectual functioning and can help
psychologists assess mental retardation and intellectual deterioration.
Although many of these tests have been severely criticized as being
culturally biased, if used with care, they can be beneﬁcial tools. Here,
a three-year old child is shown taking the Stanford-Binet test. The
Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale is a standardized test that assesses
intelligence and cognitive abilities in children and adults ages two to
twenty-three.

Spanish-language version of the K-ABC is available, and norms for
African American and Hispanic children have been developed.
Interestingly, differences in performance between white and ethnic
minority children are much lower on the K-ABC than on traditional IQ
tests.

(ability to analyze and evaluate ideas, solve problems, and make
decisions), creative (going beyond what is given to generate novel and
interesting ideas), and practical (ability that individuals use to find
the best fit between themselves and the demands of the environment). The
controversies over the validity and usefulness of IQ testing may never
fully subside. Some continue to claim that IQ tests demonstrate
predictive validity for many important attributes, including future
success (Barrett & Depinet, 1991). Others maintain that such tests are
biased and limited (Helms, 1992). Reliance on IQ scores has resulted in
discriminatory actions. In California, for example, African American
children were, in the past, disproportionately assigned to classes for
the educable mentally retarded on the basis of IQ results. The
criticisms regarding cultural biases have resulted in attempts to find
more culturally appropriate tests.

The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC-II) An increasingly
popular means of evaluating the intelligence and achievement of children
ages two and a half to twelve and a half years is the Kaufman Assessment
Battery for Children (K-ABC-II). Based on theories of mental processing
developed by neuropsychologists and cognitive psychologists, the
K-ABC-II is intended for use with both general and special populations.
For example, the assessment battery has been used with children who have
hearing or speech impairments and with those who have learning
disabilities (Kaufman & Kaufman, 2004). The K-ABC can be used with
exceptional children and members of ethnic minority groups. Its
applicability to diverse groups has been attributed to measures that (1)
are less culturally dependent than those found on traditional tests and
(2) focus on the process used to solve problems rather than on the
specific content of test items. Children are administered a wide variety
of tasks, such as copying a sequence of hand movements performed by the
examiner, recalling numbers, assembling triangles to match a model, and
demonstrating reading comprehension. Their verbal performance and
nonverbal performance are then assessed. For certain language-disordered
children or those who do not speak English, nonverbal performance can be
used to estimate intellectual functioning. The K-ABC tends to have high
reliability and validity (Kaufman, Kamphaus, & Kaufman, 1985; Kaufman &
Kaufman, 2004), and it provides a comprehensive, unique, and useful
assessment tool for children (Reynolds, Kamphaus, & Rosenthal, 1989;
Vazquez-Nuttall et al., 2007). Because many of the K-ABC subscales
measure performance using social information, it may be more likely than
traditional IQ tests to assess social intelligence (Taylor, 1990). Tests
for Cognitive Impairment Clinical psychologists, especially those who
work in a hospital setting, are concerned with detecting and assessing
cognitive impairments due to brain damage. Such damage can have profound
effects both physically (e.g., motor behavior) and psychologically
(memory, attention, thinking, emotions, etc.; Gass, 2002). The use of
individual intelligence tests such as the WAIS-III can sometimes
identify such impairments. For example, a difference of twenty points
between verbal and performance scores on the WAIS-III may indicate the
possibility of brain damage. Overall, IQ scores have been found to be
significantly correlated with neuropsychological test performance
(Diaz-Asper, Schretlen, & Pearlson, 2004). Certain patterns of scores on
the individual subtests, such as those that measure verbal concept
formation or abstracting ability (comparison and comprehension), can
also reveal brain damage. Because impaired abstract thinking may be
characteristic of brain damage, a lower score on this scale (when
accompanied by other signs) must be investigated. One of the routine
means of assessing cognitive impairment is the BenderGestalt
Visual-Motor Test (Bender, 1938; Brannigan, Decker, & Madsen, 2004),
shown in Figure 3.3. Nine geometric designs, each drawn in black on a

white cardboard, are presented one at a time to the test taker, who is
asked to copy them on a piece of paper. Certain errors in the copies are
characteristic of neurological impairment. Among these are rotation of
figures, perseveration (continuation of a pattern to an exceptional
degree), fragmentation, oversimplification, inability to copy angles,
and reversals. In addition to assessing brain damage and neurological
impairment, the Bender-Gestalt is often used for the evaluation of
visual-motor maturity and for screening children for developmental
delays. The Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery, developed
by Reitan from the earlier work of Halstead, has been used successfully
to differentiate patients with brain damage from those without brain
damage and to provide valuable information about the type and location
of the damage (Boll, 1983). The full battery consists of eleven tests,
although several are often omitted. Clients are presented with a series
of tasks that assess sensorimotor, cognitive, and perceptual
functioning, including abstract concept formation, memory and attention,
and auditory perception. The full battery takes more than six hours to
administer, so it is a relatively expensive and time-consuming
assessment tool. Versions of the Halstead-Reitan Battery are available
for children age five and older (Nussbaum & Bigler, 1989), and normative
data for children have been collected. Reliability and validity of the
tests are well established (Clarkin et al., 1999). A less costly test
for cognitive impairment is the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological
Battery, which requires about two hours to administer and is more
standardized in content, administration, and scoring than is the
Halstead-Reitan Battery. Developed by C. J. Golden and colleagues
(Golden et al., 1981), this battery includes twelve scales that assess
motor functions, rhythm, tactile functions, visual functions, receptive
and expressive speech, memory, writing, intellectual processes, and
other functions. Validation data indicate that the battery is highly
successful in screening for brain damage and quite accurate in
pinpointing damaged areas (Anastasi, 1982). A children's version has
been developed (Golden, 1989). Neuropsychological tests are widely used
(Camara et al., 2000) and are effective and valid in evaluating
cognitive impairment due to brain damage. In fact, they are far more
accurate than evaluations made simply through interviews or informal
observations (Kubiszyn et al., 2000).

CT SCANS Neurological tests, such as CT scans, PET scans, and MRIs, have
dramatically improved our ability to study the brain and to assess brain
damage. Shown here on the left is a normal CT scan; on the right, a CT
scan showing the enlarged ventricles (butterﬂy shape in the center) of
an individual suffering from senile dementia.

Neurological Tests In addition to psychological tests, a variety of
neurological medical procedures are available for diagnosing cognitive
impairments due to brain damage or abnormal brain functioning. For
example, x-ray studies can often detect brain tumors. A more
sophisticated procedure, computerized axial tomography (CT) scan,
repeatedly scans different areas of the brain with beams of x-rays and,
with the assistance of a computer, produces a three-dimensional,
cross-sectional image of the structure of the brain. That image can
provide a detailed view of brain deterioration or abnormality. In
addition to the study of brain damage, CT scans have been used to study
brain tissue abnormalities among patients diagnosed with schizophrenia,
affective disorders, Alzheimer's disease, and alcoholism (Coffman,
1989). The positron emission tomography (PET) scan enables noninvasive
study of the physiological and biochemical processes of the brain,
rather than the anatomical structures seen in the CT scan. In PET scans,
a radioactive substance is injected into the patient's bloodstream. The
scanner detects the substance as it is metabolized in the brain,
yielding information about brain functioning. PET scans, like CT scans,
have been used to study a variety of mental disorders and brain
diseases. Characteristic metabolic patterns have been observed in many
of these disorders (Holcomb et al., 1989). PET scans can be combined
with information from other scans (such as CT scans) to provide
comprehensive information about the brain. An older and more widely used
means of examining the brain is the electroencephalograph (EEG).
Electrodes attached to the skull record electrical activity (brain
waves), and abnormalities in the activity can provide information about
the presence of tumors or other brain conditions. A final technique,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), creates a magnetic field around the
patient and uses radio waves to detect abnormalities. MRIs can produce
an amazingly clear crosssectional "picture" of the brain and its
tissues. Because of these PET SCANS This PET scan reveals increased
brain activity superior pictures, which are reminiscent of postmortem
brain as a function of visual stimulation. The areas in red show slices,
MRIs can often provide better images of lesions than CT the most intense
stimulation, and as you can see, the more scans can (Andreasen, 1989;
Morihisa et al., 1999). In functional complex the information being
processed, the more active magnetic resonance imaging, both the
structures and also those the brain is.

changes that occur in specific brain functions can be observed. It
provides high resolution, noninvasive views of neural activity detected
by a blood-oxygen-leveldependent signal. These neurological techniques,
coupled with psychological tests, are increasing diagnostic accuracy and
understanding of brain functioning and disorders. Some researchers
predict that in the future such techniques will allow therapists to make
more precise diagnoses and to pinpoint precise areas of the brain
affected by disorders such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases.

Myth vs Reality Myth: Psychological tests are less accurate than medical
tests because a person's psychological status is more difﬁcult to
assess. Reality: The widely held belief that medical tests are more
reliable and valid than psychological tests appears to be false. Meyer
and colleagues (2001) conducted an evaluation of the validity of
psychological and medical tests. Both kinds of tests were found to vary
in reliability and validity. However, many psychological tests were
found to be as good as or better than medical tests in detecting
conditions. For example, neuropsychological tests were as accurate as
the MRI in detecting dementia. Psychological tests are valuable tools.

The Ethics of Assessment Some people have objected to the widespread use
of tests. Issues such as the confidentiality of client records, invasion
of privacy, client welfare, cultural bias, and unethical practices have
increasingly been raised (Bersoff, 1981; Weiner, 1995). In assessing and
treating emotionally disturbed people, clinical psychologists must often
ask embarrassing questions or use tests that may be construed as
invasions of privacy. Test findings may be inaccurate, causing serious
misdiagnosis and its consequences. Note the fears and concerns over the
possible widespread use of tests to detect antibodies to the HIV virus
(AIDS) and drug abuse, as well as the use of the polygraph in job
settings. The increased role of computers in assessment has also raised
a number of issues. For decades, computers have been used to score the
test results and to provide psychological profiles of clients. More
recently, computer programs have become available to administer clinical
interviews, IQ tests, personality inventories, and projective tests.
They may also interpret responses of clients or other persons, such as
applicants for jobs, and many large testing corporations are using them
(Kline, 2005). The computers are programmed, for example, to simulate a
structured clinical interview. Individuals who are being assessed sit
before a keyboard and answer questions shown on the computer screen.
Computer assessment has some advantages over face-to-face assessment.
First, with the rising costs of mental health care, this technique can
free up the time of clinicians and other personnel who have
traditionally administered the interviews or tests. The computer can
easily perform scoring and interpretation. Second, the motivation and
attention of clients may be increased because clients often enjoy using
a computer. Third, because clinicians often differ in interviewing
styles and backgrounds, computer assessment may provide superior
standardization of procedures. But although the use of computers in
assessment is increasing, the application of computer technology remains
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) In magnetic largely in the scoring
rather than in the administration of tests resonance imaging, a magnetic
ﬁeld is created around the (Camara et al., 2000). Two important
questions remain: How patient, and radio waves are then used to produce
amazingly reliable and valid are computer assessments, and can they be a

Can We Accurately Assess the Status of Members of Different Cultural
Groups?

W

e often have a difﬁcult time evaluating the behaviors of people from
other cultures. Cultural groups differ in many aspects, including
dietary practices, type of clothing, religious rituals, and social
interactions. How do we decide whether an individual from a different
culture is behaving in a certain way because of a mental disorder or
because of cultural practices? What signs or clues indicate that someone
is truly mentally and emotionally disturbed? Can we use assessment
measures standardized in the United States with people from other
countries? Can assessment measures administered in English be applied to
those with limited English proﬁciency (Kohn & Scorcia, 2007)? These
questions are only a sampling of the kinds of issues clinicians must
consider when trying to assess members of ethnic minority groups or
individuals from different cultures. Brislin (1993) has identiﬁed
several major problems, including the equivalence of concepts and
scales. First, certain concepts may not be equivalent across cultures.
For instance, Americans living in the United States and the Baganda
living in East Africa have different concepts of intelligent behavior.
In the United States, one indicator of intelligence is quickness in
mental reasoning; among the Baganda, slow, deliberate thought is
considered a mark of intelligence. Obviously, tests of intelligence
devised in the two cultures would differ. Individuals taking the tests
could be considered intelligent on one culture's measure but not on the
other.

Second, scores on assessment instruments may not really be equivalent in
cross-cultural research. For example, many universities use the
Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT), which has a verbal and a quantitative
component, as a criterion for admissions. Do the test scores mean the
same thing for different groups in terms of assessing academic
potential, achievements, and ability to succeed? SAT scores do tend to
be moderately successful predictors of subsequent university grades. Sue
and Abe (1988), however, found that the SAT score's ability to predict
success varies according to ethnicity and the components of the SAT.
Whereas the SAT verbal component was a good predictor of university
grades for white American students, the SAT quantitative portion was a
good predictor of grades for Asian American students. Thus Asian
American and white American students with the same overall SAT scores
may receive very different grades in individual courses. Third, the
manner in which symptoms are expressed may vary from culture to culture,
and certain cultural groups may have disturbances that are speciﬁc to
those groups (Grifﬁth, Gonzalez, & Blue, 1999). For example,
culturebound syndromes, such as those shown in Table 3.3, refer to
syndromes that are often found in one cultural group but not others.
What are the implications of these ﬁndings? Should we abolish measures
of performance for members of groups that have not been part of the
standardization process? If so, how can we evaluate them? These are only
a few of the dilemmas involved in assessment.

substitute for face-to-face assessment between client and clinician? How
can standardization occur when respondents may be giving their responses
under very different settings (e.g., while simultaneously watching
television, having others "help" complete the tests, eating while
responding, and so forth)? Can security and privacy of responses be
assured when tests are completed online? Thus, although there are
advantages to computerized testing and Internet testing, a number of
problems need to be addressed (Naglieri et al., 2004). Some studies of
computer assessment have yielded encouraging results. Some findings
indicate that the assessment has good reliability and validity and that
patients have favorable views of rated computerized interviews (Strong &
Farrell, 2003). One investigation (Farrell, Stiles-Camplair, &
McCullough, 1987) evaluated the ability of a computer interview to
assess the target complaints of clients. The clients completed a
computer interview in which they were told to answer a series of
questions by pressing the appropriate keyboard selections that
corresponded to their feelings. Depending on their answers, further
programmed questions were asked to refine their responses. The
researchers also used traditional forms of assessment---clinical
interviews and psychological tests---with these clients and compared
those results with the computer interview results. The computer
interview findings generally agreed with those of the traditional
clinical interview and test results. However, most of the clients
preferred being interviewed by the clinician.

CULTURE-BOUND SYNDROMES Culture-bound syndromes are recurrent,
locality-speciﬁc patterns of aberrant behavior and troubling experience
that may or may not be classiﬁed in a particular DSM-IV-TR diagnostic
category. Many of these patterns are indigenously considered to be
illnesses or afﬂictions. The particular symptoms, course, and social
response are often inﬂuenced by local cultural factors. Among the
culture-bound syndromes that DSM-IV-TR recognizes are the following:
Ataque de nervios An idiom of distress principally reported among
Latinos from the Caribbean but recognized among many Latin American and
Latin Mediterranean groups. Commonly reported symptoms include
uncontrollable shouting, attacks of crying, trembling, heat in the chest
rising into the head, and verbal or physical aggression. Dissociative
experiences, seizure-like or fainting episodes, and suicidal gestures
are prominent in some attacks. A general feature is a sense of being out
of control. Ataques de nervios frequently occur as a direct result of a
stressful event relating to the family (such as news of the death of a
close relative). People may experience amnesia for what occurred during
the ataque de nervios, but they otherwise return rapidly to their usual
level of functioning. Koro A term that refers to an episode of sudden
and intense anxiety during which the penis (or, in females, the vulva
and nipples) recedes into the body and possibly causes death. The
syndrome is reported in South and East Asia, where it is known by a
variety of local terms. It is occasionally found in the West. Koro at
times occurs in localized epidemic form in East Asian areas. Rootwork A
set of cultural interpretations that ascribe illness to hexing,
witchcraft, sorcery, or the evil inﬂuence of another person. Symptoms
may include generalized anxiety and gastrointestinal complaints (such as
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), weakness, dizziness, the fear of being
poisoned, and sometimes fear of being killed ("voodoo death"). "Roots,"
"spells," or "hexes" can be "put" or placed on other persons, causing a
variety of emotional and psychological problems. The hexed person may
even fear death until the root has been eliminated, usually through the
work of a root doctor (a healer in this tradition), who can also be
called on to bewitch an enemy. Rootwork is found in the southern United
States among African American and European American populations and in
Caribbean societies. Shenjing shuairuo ("neurasthenia") In China, a
condition characterized by physical and mental fatigue, dizziness,
headaches, concentration difﬁculties, sleep disturbance, and memory
loss. Other symptoms include gastrointestinal problems, sexual
dysfunction, irritability, excitability, and various signs suggesting
disturbance of the autonomic nervous system. In many cases, the symptoms
would meet the criteria for a DSM-IV-TR mood or anxiety disorder.

The Classiﬁcation of Abnormal Behavior The goal of having a
classification system for abnormal behaviors is to provide distinct
categories, indicators, and nomenclature for different patterns of
behavior, thought processes, and emotional disturbances. Thus the
pattern of behavior classified as paranoid schizophrenia should be
clearly different from the pattern named borderline personality. At the
same time, the categories should be constructed in such a way as to
accommodate wide variation in these patterns. That is, the clinician
should be able to categorize paranoid schizophrenic behavior as such,
even when the patient does not show the "perfect" or "textbook" paranoid
schizophrenic pattern.

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) As discussed
in Chapter 1, toward the end of the nineteenth century, Emil Kraepelin
devised the first effective classification scheme for mental disorders.
Kraepelin held the organic view of psychopathology, and his system had a
distinctly biogenic slant. Classification was based on the patient's
symptoms, as in medicine. It was hoped that disorders (similar groups of
symptoms) would have a common etiology (cause or origin), would require
similar treatments, would respond to those treatments similarly, and
would progress similarly if left untreated.

Many of these same expectations were held for the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, based on the Kraepelinian system
and published by the American Psychiatric Association in 1952. However,
the reliability and validity of DSM were problematic. Early studies of
the DSM that compared the diagnoses of pairs of clinicians found poor
agreement (interrater reliability) between the members of each pair and
weak test-retest reliability. The greatest disagreement was found in
specific categories. As a rule, reliability was higher for broad
distinctions than for fine distinctions. A fine distinction, for
example, would focus on the precise type of personality disturbance or
disorder. Many critics of DSM questioned the validity and usefulness of
psychiatric classification (Ferster, 1965; Kanfer & Phillips, 1969;
Ullmann & Krasner, 1965). They claimed that DSM did not adequately
convey information about underlying causes, processes, treatment, and
prognosis. (A prognosis is a prediction of the future course of a
particular disorder.) The problem arose because early versions of DSM
were strongly influenced by the biological model of mental illness, in
which cause is supposed to be a basis of classification. With the
exception of the categories involving brain damage, which may parallel
diseases, most DSM categories were purely descriptive. In addition, a
prerequisite for high validity is high reliability. Because the
reliability of early versions of DSM was questionable, the validity of
the DSM was also limited (McWilliams, 2006). In view of these problems,
each subsequent version of DSM was developed to have greater reliability
and validity. In addition, DSM tried to incorporate new research
findings. Although Kraepelin's concepts still formed the basis for some
of its categories, successive versions of DSM contained substantial
revisions. For example, to improve reliability, DSM specified the exact
criteria that clinicians should use in making a diagnosis. What has also
helped to increase reliability and validity has been the development of
structured interviews (e.g., the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV) that gather information pertinent to making a DSM diagnosis
(Williams, 1999). Results of field trials indicated that good to
excellent interrater reliability could be obtained for many, but not
all, of the major classes of disorders (Williams, 1999). The American
Psychiatric Association published the latest version, DSM-IV-TR, in
2000. DSM-IV-TR provides diagnostic categories and lists criteria to
judge whether a person's symptoms and behaviors fall into the category.
It allows clinicians to examine and evaluate the individual's mental
state with regard to five factors or dimensions (called axes in the
manual). Axes I, II, and III address the individual's present mental and
medical condition. Axes IV and V provide additional information about
the person's life situation and functioning. Together, the five axes are
intended to provide comprehensive and useful information. Axis
I---Clinical Syndromes and Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of
Clinical Attention Any mental disorder listed in the manual (except
those included on Axis II) is indicated on Axis I. If an individual has
more than one mental disorder, they are all listed. The principal
disorder is listed first. Axis II---Personality Disorders and Mental
Retardation Personality disorders, as well as prominent maladaptive
personality features, are listed on Axis II. Personality disorders may
be present either alone or in combination with a mental disorder from
Axis I. If more than one personality disorder is present, they are all
listed. Also included on Axis II is mental retardation. Axis
III---General Medical Conditions Listed on Axis III are any medical
conditions that are potentially relevant to understanding and treating
the person.

Axis IV---Psychosocial and Environmental Problems These problems may
affect the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of mental disorders. For
example, a client may be experiencing the death of a family member,
social isolation, homelessness, extreme poverty, and inadequate health
services. The clinician lists these problems if they have been present
during the year preceding the current evaluation or if they occurred
before the previous year and are clearly contributory to the disorder

or have become a focus of treatment. The clinician has various
categories in which to classify the type of problems. Axis V---Global
Assessment of Functioning The clinician provides a rating of the
psychological, social, and occupational functioning of the person.
Normally, the rating is made for the level of functioning at the time of
the evaluation. The clinician uses a 100-point scale, on which 1
indicates severe impairment in functioning (for example, the individual
is in persistent danger of severely hurting him- or herself or others or
is unable to maintain minimal personal hygiene) and 100 refers to
superior functioning with no symptoms. The disorders (categories) for
Axes I and II that are included in DSM-IV-TR are shown on the inside
covers of this book. Let's look at an example of a client, as well as a
possible clinician evaluation based on the DSM-IV-TR.

Case Study Mark was a ﬁfty-six-year-old machine operator who was
referred for treatment by his supervisor. The supervisor noted that
Mark's performance at work had deteriorated in the past four months.
Mark was frequently absent from work, had difﬁculty getting along with
others, and often had a strong odor of liquor on his breath after his
lunch break. The supervisor knew that Mark was a heavy drinker and
suspected that Mark's performance was affected by alcohol consumption.
In truth, Mark could not stay away from drinking. He consumed alcohol
every day; during weekends, he averaged about sixteen ounces of Scotch
per day. Although he had been a heavy drinker for thirty years, his
consumption had increased after his wife divorced him six months
previously. She claimed she could no longer tolerate his drinking,
extreme jealousy, and unwarranted suspicions concerning her marital
ﬁdelity. Coworkers avoided Mark because he was a cold, unemotional
person who distrusted others. During interviews with the therapist, Mark
revealed very little about himself. He blamed others for his drinking
problems: if his wife had been faithful or if others were not out to get
him, he would drink less. Mark appeared to overreact to any perceived
criticisms of himself. A medical examination revealed that Mark was
developing cirrhosis of the liver as a result of his chronic and heavy
drinking.

Mark's heavy use of alcohol, which interfered with his functioning,
resulted in an alcohol abuse diagnosis on Axis I. Mark also exhibited a
personality disorder, which was diagnosed as paranoid personality on
Axis II because of his suspiciousness, hypervigilance, and other
behaviors. Cirrhosis of the liver was noted on Axis III. The clinician
noted Mark's divorce and difficulties in his job on Axis IV. Finally,
Mark was given a 54 on the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale,
used in Axis V to rate his current level of functioning, mainly because
he was exhibiting moderate difficulty at work and in his social
relationships. Mark's diagnosis, then, was as follows: • Axis
I---Clinical syndrome: alcohol abuse • Axis II---Personality disorder:
paranoid personality • Axis III---Physical disorder: cirrhosis • Axis
IV---Psychosocial and environmental problems: (1) Problems with primary
support group (divorce), (2) occupational problems • Axis V---Current

DSM-IV-TR Mental Disorders The task of making a diagnosis of mental
disorder involves classifying individuals on Axes I and II. Most
disorders found in clients are listed under either Axis I or Axis II,
but some clients may have disorders on both axes or more than one on
each axis. Table 3.4 lists the broad categories of mental disorders,
most of which are discussed in this book. It should be noted that many
individuals who have one mental disorder also suffer from another. For
example, an individual who is diagnosed with depression

DSM-IV-TR DISORDERS CATEGORIES OF DISORDERS

FEATURES

Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence

Impairment in cognitive and intellectual functioning, language or motor
deﬁciencies, disruptive behaviors, poor social skills, anxiety, eating
disorders, and so on

Delirium, Dementia, Amnestic, and Other Cognitive Disorders

Psychological or behavioral abnormality associated with a dysfunction of
the brain, including problems that arise from head injuries, ingestion
of toxic/intoxicating substances, brain degeneration or disease, and so
on

Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition

When medical conditions are causally related to a disorder, the client
is considered to have a mental disorder due to a general medical
condition. Example: hypothyroidism can be a cause of major depressive
disorder; diagnosis would be "major depressive disorder due to a general
medical condition (hypothyroidism)"

Substance-Related Disorders

Use of psychoactive substances (alcohol, cocaine, and so forth) that
continues despite problems; some disorders (anxiety or mood) occur
because of the ingestion of substances and are considered
substance-induced disorders and are listed in the section for those
disorders that share the symptoms

Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders

Marked by severe impairment in thinking and perception; speech may be
incoherent, and person often has delusions, hallucinations, and
inappropriate affect

Mood Disorders

Mood may be one of serious depression or mania; sometimes, in bipolar
conditions, both depression and mania are exhibited

Anxiety Disorders

Anxiety is predominant symptom; avoidance behaviors are usually present
(such as phobias). Individuals may exhibit obsessions (recurrent
thoughts) or compulsions (repetitive behaviors), which cause distress
when they are not performed

Somatoform Disorders

Symptoms of a physical disorder that cannot be explained by a medical
condition are usually classiﬁed as somatoform disorders. Individuals
complain of bodily dysfunctions, are preoccupied with beliefs of having
a health problem, or experience pain

may also have a second disorder such as substance abuse. Comorbidity
refers to this co-occurrence of different disorders. One large-scale
survey (Kessler, Chiu, et al., 2005) found that the rate of comorbidity
is high---60 percent of those with one disorder also had another
disorder. One possible explanation is that factors involved in one
disorder, such as stress, may influence the development of other
disorders (Krueger et al., 1998). Furthermore, after each diagnosed
disorder, clinicians can use specifiers that indicate severity and
remission status. Severity is rated as mild, moderate, or severe,
depending on the symptoms and degree of impairment. Remission refers to
a disorder in which the full criteria for making the diagnosis were met
at one time but in which the current symptoms or signs of the disorder
are only partially apparent (partial remission) or no longer remain
(full remission). Figure 3.4 shows the prevalence rate (the percentage
of the population with the disorder) of certain disorders, as determined
by a large national survey.

Evaluation of the DSM Classiﬁcation System

comorbidity co-occurrence of different disorders

Field trials or studies on the adequacy of DSM-IV-TR have been conducted
on certain diagnostic categories. One study found that symptom measures
could differentiate between clients with DSM-IV-TR anxiety and mood
disorders (Brown, Chorpita, & Barlow, 1998). Brown and colleagues (2001)
also found good to excellent reliability

DSM-IV-TR DISORDERS CATEGORIES OF DISORDERS

FEATURES

Factitious Disorders

Intentional feigning of physical or psychological symptoms; individuals
with this disorder are motivated by psychological need to assume sick
role

Dissociative Disorders

Disturbance or alteration in memory, identity, or consciousness;
individuals may not remember who they are, assume new identities, have
two or more distinct personalities, or experience feelings of
depersonalization

Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders

Two main groups of disturbances are included: paraphilias and sexual
dysfunctions. In gender identity disorders, there is a cross-gender
identiﬁcation and a desire to be the other sex, coupled with a
persistent discomfort with one's own sex

Eating Disorders

Included are refusal to maintain body weight above a minimally normal
weight and binge eating and purging

Sleep Disorders

Symptoms involve problems in initiating/maintaining sleep, excessive
sleepiness, sleep disruptions, repeated awakening associated with
frightening nightmares, sleepwalking, and so on

Impulse Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classiﬁed

A separate class of disorders involves failure to resist an impulse or
temptation to perform an act that is harmful to oneself or others;
included are disorders involving loss of impulse control over
aggression, stealing, gambling, setting ﬁres, and pulling hair

Adjustment Disorders

Characterized by marked/excessive distress or signiﬁcant impairment in
social, occupational, or academic functioning because of a recent
stressor; symptoms do not meet criteria for Axis I/II disorders and do
not include bereavement

Personality Disorders

Personality traits are inﬂexible and maladaptive and notably impair
functioning or cause subjective distress; typically involve odd or
eccentric behaviors, excessive dramatic and emotional behaviors, or
anxious and fearful behaviors

Not Otherwise Speciﬁed

These categories are intended to include disorders that do not fully
meet the criteria for a particular disorder

for the majority of DSM-IV-TR anxiety and mood disorder categories.
Factors decreasing reliability included disagreements over whether
symptoms were sufficient in number, severity, or duration to meet
DSM-IV-TR criteria. Because research findings helped shape DSM-IV-TR,
reliability and validity are stronger than in the previous versions
(Brown et al., 2001). In general, with the greater precision in
specifying the criteria for making a diagnosis and with the increased
role of research findings in defining disorders, reliability of
diagnosis of disorders is higher in DSM-IV-TR than in earlier versions
of DSM. However, increased reliability may not mean increased validity.
As one critic (Sarbin, 1997) observes, sixteenth-century witch hunters
developed explicit and reliable criteria (such as bodily abnormalities)
for determining whether a person is a witch. Nevertheless, the diagnosis
("witch") had no validity. A positive feature of DSM-IV-TR is its
emphasis on cross-cultural assessment issues compared to previous
versions. It has an introductory section that places diagnosis within a
cultural context. It provides a description of pertinent culture, age,
and gender features for each disorder, and it supplies guidelines for
addressing the cultural background of the client and the context for
evaluating the client. DSMIV-TR also contains an outline of
culture-bound syndromes, disorders unique to a particular cultural
group. (Table 3.3 describes some of these syndromes.) Many culture-bound
syndromes involve not only psychological symptoms but also bodily or
somatic symptoms (Dana, 1998); this reflects the fact that the mind-body
distinction prevalent in western societies is absent in many other
societies (Dana, 1998).

These improvements make DSM-IV-TR far more culturally sensitive than
were the previous editions. This trend might be taken even further by
incorporating into DSM another axis that specifies the extent to which
cultural factors influence the client's clinical condition (Draguns,
1996). With this addition, DSM and the assessment process could be a
great deal more appropriate for clients from different cultural
backgrounds. The next edition, DSM-V, is planned for 2010 (Shore, 2006).
Among the many criticisms of DSM are these: 1. DSM has a strong medical
orientation, even though more than one-half of the disorders are not
attributable to known or presumed organic causes and should not be
considered biological in nature (Nelson-Gray, 1991; Schacht, 1985;
Schacht & Nathan, 1977). Some psychologists see DSM's medical emphasis
in part as a response to psychiatrists' need to define abnormality more
strongly within their profession. 2. The procedures leading up to the
development of DSM-IV-TR primarily involved committees negotiating the
nomenclature rather than the use of scientifically derived data. Some
categories were created out of compromises between conflicting views or
were rooted in practical considerations, such as ease of application and
acceptability to practitioners. Thus DSM-IV-TR attempts to be
atheoretical---it lacks a scientific theory for its classification of
disorders (Follette & Houts, 1996; Sarbin, 1997). 3. Certain diagnostic
categories in DSM have been characterized as being sexist or culturally
biased. For example, specific behaviors sometimes seen among women may
be inappropriately interpreted as signs of mental disorders (D.
Franklin, 1987; Kaplan, 1983). One example is the continuing discussion
of whether to establish premenstrual dysphoric disorder as a DSM
diagnostic category. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, many times
associated with women experiencing premenstrual syndrome (PMS), has been
a hotly debated category. According to DSM-IV-TR, the symptoms include
marked changes in mood and persistent anger, depression, or anxiety,
often accompanied by complaints of breast tenderness and bodily aches.
There is often an increase in interpersonal conflicts and a marked
interference with work or social activities and relationships. These
symptoms occur in a cyclical pattern a week before menses and remit a
few days afterward. Although critics of this category acknowledge that
many women have some of these symptoms, they believe that the disorder
should be treated as a strictly physical or gynecological disorder.
Labeling it as a psychiatric disorder stigmatizes women as being
emotional and controlled by "raging hormones." In recognition of the
controversy, DSM-IV-TR considers premenstrual dysphoric disorder to be a
proposed condition requiring further study rather than a new disorder
category. 4. According to Shore (2006), the most inadequate part of DSM
has been the categories dealing with childhood disorders. DSM is

epression was recognized from the very beginning of human existence. In
the fourth century B.C., Hippocrates used the terms melancholia (black
bile) and mania (to be mad) to refer to mood disorders and mental
illness. Beginning in 1952, DSM considered psychotic depressive reaction
to be a severe disorder that lacked a precipitant. In subsequent
editions of DSM, mood disorder diagnoses were based on symptom clusters
rather than on the presence or absence of a precipitant.

An attempt to clarify the intent of DSM and respond to its critics noted
that the classification system was not intended to imply that all mental
disorders have an organic basis. Rather, the important question is
whether the DSM revised editions are a substantial improvement over past
systems. Proponents of this position believe they are, and they argue
that constructing a diagnostic classification system is an ongoing
process, requiring continual revision and improvement. The limitations
in the usefulness of DSM may therefore partly reflect holes in our
knowledge of psychopathology. Furthermore, it is highly likely that the
next version, DSM-V, will contain important modifications that consider
dimensional issues, as suggested by Shore (2006). Consistent with our
multipath model, there is increasing recognition that disorders are
multidetermined, with many factors contributing to their development
(Fauman, 2006). DSM-V will have to incorporate a wide range of factors
in the description of disorders. The debates over the usefulness of the
DSM system have been valuable in suggesting new research directions,
increasing the role of research in developing the system, and
stimulating the examination of conceptual, methodological,
philosophical, and clinical assumptions in the classification of mental
disorders. Future research, particularly research that examines the
construct validity of DSM, is essential to evaluating the usefulness of
the system. Alternatives to DSM classification are available. Goldfried
and Davison (1976) devised a behavioral classification scheme in which
deviant behaviors are classified according to the variables that are
maintaining the behaviors. For example, a child may learn to be
physically aggressive while playing football and then bring such
behavior into the classroom (inappropriate behavior). The inappropriate
behavior is classified as a stimulus control problem. Stimulus control
is defective because the behavior does not conform to the appropriate
stimulus (the child should be physically nonaggressive in the
classroom). The change of stimuli (playing field to classroom) fails to
change the child's behavior. Because this classification scheme
emphasizes the variables that maintain behavioral patterns, it lets the
therapist isolate those variables for treatment purposes (Goldfried &
Davison, 1976). Others have proposed different classification schemes
that can supplement DSMIV-TR. For example, Berenbaum and colleagues
(2003) have constructed a taxonomy of emotional disturbances. The
taxonomy divides emotional disturbances (which cut across the spectrum
of psychiatric disorders) into emotional valence disturbances, emotional
intensity/regulation disturbances, and emotional disconnections.
Finally, the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual has been proposed by a
group of psychoanalytic organizations (McWilliams, 2006). It is intended
to supplement DSM-IV-TR and to take into consideration dimensional
rather than categorical functioning and developmental processes. It is
unlikely that other diagnostic systems will gain popularity over DSM,
especially if the planned DSM-V version takes into consideration new
research findings.

Objections to Classiﬁcation and Labeling Classification schemes can be
of immense aid in categorizing disorders and in communicating
information about them and conducting research on them. They have
nevertheless been criticized because of negative consequences. 1.
Labeling a person as having a mental disorder can result in
overgeneralizations, stigmas, and stereotypes. For example, former
mental patients may have a difficult time finding employment because of
employers' fears and stereotypes about mental disorders. The American
Psychological Association (1990) has noted that stereotypes can lead to
inaccurate generalizations about individuals that are often transformed
into discriminatory behavior. It then becomes more difficult for others
to respond to the person's own particular characteristics, making
accurate, differentiated, and unique impressions less likely.

The Classiﬁcation of Abnormal Behavior

2.  A label may lead others to treat a person differently. A classic
    study by Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968) showed that responses to a
    label can cause differential treatment. They tested schoolchildren
    and then randomly assigned them to either of two groups. Teachers
    were told that tests of one group indicated that they were potential
    intellectual "bloomers" (gaining in competence and maturity); the
    other group was not given this label. After a one-year interval,
    children from both groups were retested. Children who had been
    identified as bloomers showed dramatic gains in IQ scores. How did
    this occur? Many have speculated that the label led teachers to have
    higher intellectual expectations for the bloomers and thus to treat
    them differently. Even though there was no significant difference in
    IQ levels between the two groups to begin with, differences were
    present by the end of the year. Other studies have yielded similar
    results (Rappaport & Cleary, 1980).
3.  A label may lead those who are labeled to believe that they do
    indeed possess such characteristics or may cause them to act out the
    label. Labels can become self-fulfilling prophecies. In the
    Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968) study just cited, the label not only
    caused teachers to behave differently but also may have affected the
    children. When people are constantly told that they are stupid or
    smart, they may come to believe such labels. It is reasonable to
    believe that people who ascribe certain stereotypical traits to a
    racial minority or an ethnic group will behave differently toward
    the group and will cause cognitive and behavioral changes among
    members of that group. Steele and his colleagues have also shown
    that labels and stereotypes can influence individuals not only to
    act out the stereotypes but also to devalue their personal status
    (Davies, Spencer, & Steele, 2005). For example, labeling a child as
    mentally retarded is not only demeaning but also detrimental to the
    child's self-esteem. Many people believe that mental retardation is
    a biological anomaly, a permanent disability, and a gross
    intellectual handicap. Such beliefs and the accompanying reactions
    can have a profound effect on a child's self-image.
4.  A label may not provide the precise, functional information that is
    needed. Today, many forms of managed care organizations
    (MCOs)---such as health maintenance organizations, preferred
    provider organizations, and others---are gaining popularity in the
    provision of health and mental health care (Pallack, 1995). MCOs are
    less concerned about classifying or labeling clients' mental
    disorders than about finding a more precise means of measuring
    client functioning. Given this trend, the assessment of functioning
    at work, home, school, and elsewhere may be of greater interest than
    the validity of the clinician's diagnosis of schizophrenia or
    another disorder.

We know that assessment has improved over time. Focus on reliability and
validity, increased psychometric and statistical procedures, new
technologies, and large numbers of research studies on assessment have
all served to increase our ability to evaluate human beings. In some
cases, psychological testing is as strong as medical testing in terms of
validity. However, although human beings share many psychological
characteristics, they also have unique features that pose problems in
making predictions about behaviors and means for successful treatment
and prevention. Finding shared and unique characteristics among
individuals is the critical task. Most psychologists agree that
classification of disorders in some form is important. DSM has been the
most widely used classification scheme. Although DSM has been
criticized, the fact that changes are made in response to research
findings is a positive aspect. To be more adequate, DSM needs to
incorporate multipath, dimensional, and developmental features of
disorders. It has to also consider the regrouping or separation of
disorders, depending on common or distinct characteristics.

were subsequently interpreted as manifestations of schizophrenia.

Summary 1. In attempting to make an accurate evaluation or assessment of
a person's mental health, what kinds of standards must tests or
evaluation procedures meet? ■ Assessment and classification of disorders
are essential

in the mental health field. ■ In developing assessment tools and useful
classification

schemes, researchers and clinicians have been concerned with issues
regarding reliability (stability or the degree to which a procedure or
test yields the same results repeatedly, under the same circumstances)
and validity (the extent to which a test or procedure actually performs
the function it was designed to perform). 2. What kinds of tools do
clinicians employ in evaluating the mental health of people? ■
Clinicians primarily use four methods of assessment: observations,
interviews, psychological tests and inventories, and neurological tests.
■ Observations of external signs and expressive behaviors are often made
during an interview and can have diagnostic significance. ■ Interviews,
the oldest form of psychological assessment, involve a face-to-face
conversation, after which the interviewer differentially weighs and
interprets verbal information obtained from the interviewee. ■
Psychological tests and inventories provide a more formalized means of
obtaining information. In personality testing, projective techniques, in
which the stimuli are ambiguous, or self-report inventories, in which
the stimuli are much more structured, may be used. Two of the most
widely used projective techniques are the Rorschach inkblot technique
and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). Unlike projective tests,
self-report personality inventories, such as the MMPI-2, supply the test
taker with a list of alternatives from which to select an answer.
Intelligence tests can be used to obtain an estimate of a person's
current level of cognitive functioning and to assess intellectual
deterioration. Behavioral observations of

92

how a person takes the test are additional sources of information about
personality attributes. The WAIS, Stanford-Binet, and Bender-Gestalt
tests can be used to assess brain damage. The Halstead-Reitan and
Luria-Nebraska test batteries specifically assess brain dysfunction. ■
Neurological medical procedures, including x-rays, CT

and PET scans, EEG, and MRI, have added highly important and
sophisticated means to detect brain damage. 3. How are mental health
problems categorized or classified? ■ The first edition of DSM was based
to a large extent on the biological model of mental illness and assumed
that people who were classified in a psychodiagnostic category would
show similar symptoms that stem from a common cause, that should be
treated in a certain manner, that would respond similarly, and that
would have similar prognoses. Critics questioned the reliability and
validity of earlier versions of DSM. ■ The current DSM-IV-TR contains
detailed diagnostic criteria; research findings and expert judgments
were used to help construct this latest version. As a result, its
reliability appears to be higher than that of the previous manuals.
Furthermore, data are collected on five axes so that much more
information about the patient is systematically examined. DSM is now
undergoing revisions for a forthcoming DSM-V edition. ■ General
objections to classification are based primarily on the problems
involved in labeling and the loss of information about a person when
that person is labeled or categorized. ■ A number of ethical questions
have been raised about classifying and assessing people through tests.
These include questions about confidentiality, privacy, and cultural
bias. Concerned with these issues, psychologists have sought to improve
classification and assessment procedures and to define the appropriate
conditions for testing and diagnosis.

The Scientiﬁc Method in Abnormal Psychology

A

twenty-four-year-old married Puerto Rican woman, Nayda, reported during
an initial interview that she was in "utter anguish" and incapacitated
by "epileptic ﬁts." These seizures were preceded by a strong headache
and involved a loss of consciousness and convulsions. She had been
diagnosed by a neurologist as suffering from intractable
(difﬁcult-to-treat) epilepsy. However, some symptoms appeared to be
atypical compared with those seen in epilepsy. First, when regaining
consciousness, she would sometimes not recognize her husband or children
and claim not to be Nayda. Second, during some episodes she appeared
fearful and would plead to an invisible presence to have mercy and not
to kill her. Third, Nayda would often hit herself during seizures and
burn items in the house. Her most recent seizures included
hallucinations involving blood, during which she attempted to strangle
herself with a rope. These behaviors were perplexing because she said
she loved her husband and children and did not know why she would try to
harm herself. Because of these unusual symptoms, Martinez-Taboas (2005)
entertained the possibility that the seizures were psychogenic
(psychological rather than physiological) in nature and that cultural
beliefs may have been involved.

The therapist attempted to determine whether the seizures were the
result of some type of earlier trauma such as sexual or physical abuse.
Although Nayda reported none, she told of an event that had occurred
when she was seventeen---two years before the seizures began. She
tearfully related that one night at about 2 A.M., she was awakened by
the smell of something burning. She was shocked when she saw her
grandmother's house in ﬂames (her grandmother lived in a small house in
the backyard). Strangely, she decided to go back to sleep and repeatedly
told herself, "Tomorrow I will tell my parents of the ﬁre"
(Martinez-Taboas, 2005, p. 8). A few minutes later, the rest of the
family was awakened by the smoke. Their

the grandmother had set the ﬁre to take her own life. When Nayda was

permission, hypnosis was used to further explore her reactions. When
Nayda was asked about the seizures, she responded with terror and said
"there is blood" and began to convulse on the ﬂoor. The therapist placed
his hand on Nayda's head and commanded that the seizure stop. It ended.
The inﬂuence of psychogenic factors on Nayda's seizures was clear.
Cultural Formulation From a western perspective, Nayda's symptoms of
reporting a loss of personal identity, amnesia, seizures, and
hallucinations involving blood could be indicative of dissociative,
conversion, or even delusional disorders. The therapist wanted to
investigate cultural inﬂuences as possible contributors to these
symptoms. In many Latin American countries, there is a belief in
espiritismo, in which the soul is immortal and, under certain
circumstances, can communicate with the living. In some cases, a spirit
can inhabit or possess a living person, who may display auditory and
visual hallucinations during these episodes. When Nayda was asked about
the seizures, she said that the spirit of her grandmother was not at
peace and was causing her seizures and other problems. She believed that
her not helping her grandmother during the ﬁre resulted in a disturbed
and revenge-seeking spirit. The therapist wanted to determine whether
Nayda would be open to an alternative explanation and mentioned the
possibility that her symptoms were due to the reexperiencing of
traumatic memories and guilt rather than possession. This perspective
was not accepted by Nayda, who remained convinced of her espiritismo
beliefs. Therapy Approach Although one possible therapeutic approach
might be to challenge Nayda's belief that she was responsible for her
grandmother's death and question the utility of the belief in spiritual
possession (Castro-Blanco, 2005), the therapist decided to work within
Nayda's belief system and combine it with western strategies. In the
twentytwo therapy sessions that followed, the therapist had Nayda
confront the spirit of her grandmother through the empty-chair
technique, a process by which a client has

94

The Scientiﬁc Method in Abnormal Psychology

an actual dialogue with an aspect of the self or with a signiﬁcant
other, imagined to be in the chair. Using this technique, Nayda
explained to her grandmother that she loved her children and husband and
that they needed her. Initially, the attempts were failures, and, in one
episode, the grandmother spoke through Nayda and said that Nayda would
never be free from her. In subsequent sessions, Nayda continued to
confront her guilt and fear regarding her grandmother. Cognitive therapy
was used to help Nayda develop alternative ways of thinking about her
grandmother's suicide. The family also participated in the empty-chair
technique, telling the grandmother that Nayda was not responsible for
her death. After several months of therapy, the grandmother's presence
became negligible and eventually disappeared completely. At a
twelve-month follow-up, Nayda was no longer taking medication and had
had only one brief seizure. Her depression score was within the normal
range, and her dissociative symptoms had been dramatically reduced.

This case illustrates several points that are important in research,
case formulation, and therapy. First, there is a tendency for
individuals within their own fields of study to interpret events within
a given paradigm. For example, the biological model assumes that every
disease has a specific physical cause, and little attention is placed on
psychological or environmental factors. In the case of Nayda, her
neurologist believed the seizures were due to epilepsy and had
prescribed Tegretol (an antiseizure medication) to treat the condition.
Conversely, psychological theories tend to view disorders only from a
psychological framework, placing less emphasis on biological or
sociocultural and social explanations. A cognitive-behavioral analysis
of Nayda's behaviors might focus primarily on irrational thoughts.
Therapy would involve challenging these thoughts or beliefs and
substituting more realistic ones. Etiological explanations from a
sociocultural perspective may focus only on cultural practices or
beliefs. Second, research is often conducted from a specific model with
little attention paid to other contributing factors. Recently, headlines
appeared about the discovery of an obesity gene. A few weeks later, we
were informed by another group of researchers that perceived social ties
are predictive of obesity. The reader is left with a puzzle. Is obesity
caused by a gene or by specific social patterns? We now know that the
vast majority of mental health disorders are the result of a convergence
of biological, psychological, sociocultural, and social risk factors.
Therefore, when you are exposed to mental health research, remember that
issues are best understood when a multipath model is utilized. With
Nayda, it was important to consider all possible contributors to her
problem. Seizures and symptoms reported in the case study could be the
result of biological, psychological, sociocultural, or social factors or
a combination of these influences. From a scientific perspective, we
must investigate all possible causes and consider alternative
explanations for behavior. Scientists are often described as skeptics.
Rather than accept the conclusions from a single study, scientists
demand that the results be replicated, or repeated by other researchers.
Replication reduces the chance that findings are due to experimenter
bias, methodological flaws, or sampling errors. The following findings
were initially reported as "conclusive" in the mass media. Note their
current status after further investigation: • A specific gene, the A1
allele of DRD2, plays a key role in alcoholism. Status: Subsequent
research (Comings et al., 1991; Gelernter & Kranzler, 1999) found that
the gene is present in fewer than 50 percent of people with alcoholism
and that the gene is found in individuals with other disorders and in
individuals who do not have drinking problems. The gene is neither
sufficient nor necessary for the development of alcoholism.

• In 2004, suicide rates for young people rose 14 percent. Some believe
the increase may be tied to a reduction in prescriptions for
antidepressants due to warnings placed on. Status: Needs further
research. Some research has found that the incidence of suicide attempts
in young children and adolescents was higher after antidepressant
treatment compared with no antidepressant treatment (Leckman & King,
2007). • Early trials reported computer-based scans of blood flow in the
brain to be 100 percent accurate in identifying patients with
schizophrenia. Status: Needs replication. As one researcher, Robin
Murray, points out, "Nobody has ever found a specific brain abnormality
that all schizophrenics have that nobody else has" (BBC News, 2001). •
Hyperactivity in children results from reactions to specific food groups
or food additives. Status: Probably not supported (Eigenmann &
Haenggeli, 2004). In general, experimental studies using
biological-challenge or double-blind methods (described later in this
chapter) have not documented change in behavior related to the
consumption of certain foods or additives. • The majority of sexually
abused children exhibit signs or symptoms of trauma that can be reliably
detected by experts in the field of child sexual abuse. Status: There
are no signs or symptoms that characterize the majority of abused
children; a significant number appear to be asymptomatic (Hagen, 2003).
• Traumatic memories are fixed and indelible. Status: Fifty-nine
veterans of Operation Desert Storm were interviewed about highly
traumatic combat events twenty-six months after their return from the
Gulf War. Nearly 90 percent exhibited inconsistent recall. The greater
the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, the greater the
inaccuracies (Southwick et al., 1997). As you can see, the search for
"truth" is often a long journey. Answers regarding the causes of
abnormal behavior come and go. In evaluating studies, we must consider
the adequacy of the research. As Hunsley (2007) observed, "not all
evidence is created equal" (p. 114). Some types of studies are more
likely to be accurate, reliable, and generalizable because of their
methodological or conceptual soundness. If we were to construct an
evidence hierarchy based on internal validity considerations (i.e.,
confidence that one thing causes another), expert opinion would be
placed on the lowest level of the hierarchy, followed by case studies.
Group research designs that have high internal validity and
single-participant designs would be rated higher. Systematic reviews of
well-designed studies (including meta-analyses) would occupy the highest
level of the evidence hierarchy. In this chapter, we discuss the
components of the scientific method. Understanding different research
designs and their shortcomings is necessary when evaluating reported
findings in abnormal psychology.

The Scientiﬁc Method in Clinical Research Case Study A video segment
showed a seventy-minute session in which a ten-year-old girl was begging
for her life. Candace had been wrapped in a blanket and surrounded by
four adults pressing pillows against her. She was undergoing "rebirthing
therapy." Candace was purportedly diagnosed with a reactive attachment
disorder, a condition that prevents the formation of loving
relationships. The purpose of the therapy was to enable Candace to be
"reborn" and to be able to bond with her adoptive mother. The session
involved the simulation of birth, in which the blanket represented the
womb. On the tape, Candace complains about not being able to breathe.
After being unwrapped, Candace wasn't breathing and had no pulse. The
cause of death was suffocation (Kohler, 2001). The two therapists, Julie
Ponder and Connell Watkins, were convicted of reckless child abuse. The
governor of Colorado signed a law outlawing rebirthing therapy.
(Associated Press, 2001)

Hundreds of different forms of psychotherapies exist. How can so many
different ways of conceptualizing the cause and treatment of the same
disorder be accurate? This question must be addressed if psychotherapy
is to have a scientific foundation

critical thinking

Attacks on Scientiﬁc Integrity • Dr. Andrew Mosholder, a medical
reviewer for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), stated that he
had been pressured to alter and hide information on a document submitted
to congressional investigators concerning the possible link between
antidepressant use and suicide in children (Richwine, 2004b). • An
internal GlaxoSmithKline (a pharmaceutical company) memo concerning a
study of paroxetine (an antidepressant) use in children stated, it would
be "commercially unacceptable" to admit that paroxetine did not work in
children and that the company would have to "effectively manage the
dissemination of these data in order to minimize any potential negative
impact" (Dyer, 2004, p. 1395). • The drug makers of antidepressants such
as Prozac and Paxil did not publish nearly one-third of the studies
evaluating their effectiveness. Nearly all of these had unfavorable
results. In addition, some studies with negative or questionable results
were published as if the drugs were effective (Turner et al., 2008). The
scientiﬁc method requires that researchers be committed to the search
for truth and to remain objective in the study of phenomena. When
personal beliefs, values, political position, or conﬂicts of interest
are allowed to inﬂuence our interpretation

of data, scientiﬁc integrity is threatened. The dependence on research
in making informed decisions necessitates that scientists hold and
maintain high ethical standards. Unfortunately, when ﬁnancial
considerations intersect with science, research can become the tool of
the interested party rather than a mechanism to promote the welfare of
society. Part of the problem is the vested interest that researchers
often have in the drug companies themselves. Research funding by
pharmaceutical companies rose from \$1.5 billion to \$22 billion between
1980 and 2001 (Warner & Roberts, 2004) and accounted for about 60
percent of funded studies in 2002 (Kelly et al., 2006). Equally
problematic is the increasing percentage of researchers in academic
medical centers who have ﬁnancial interests in or who receive funding
from for-proﬁt companies (Warner & Roberts, 2004). These ties with
pharmaceutical companies can produce a conﬂict of interest that
threatens scientiﬁc integrity. There is suspicion that research ﬁndings
unfavorable to "interested parties" are not being published. Researchers
may be less likely to report ﬁndings that are considered unfavorable to
their source of funding. In some cases, the publication of data is
subject to the approval of the funding source. With researchers
receiving funding from or sitting on the board of directors of
pharmaceutical companies, how can the interests of consumers be promoted
and scientiﬁc integrity be maintained?

(Melchert, 2007). Do therapists use the scientific method to determine
the validity or effectiveness of approaches they are using to treat
mental disorders? As Perez (1999, p. 206) argues, "We must decide if we
want to foster an environment in which clinicians can practice whatever
they want, even in the absence of scientific evidence that what they
practice actually works. Conversely, we may choose to protect the rights
of clients to receive the most effective treatments available." Before
employing a therapy such as rebirthing, should we know whether it has
received any validation? What do you see as the advantages and
disadvantages of requiring some type of experimental support for
different therapies? The scientific method is a method of inquiry that
provides for the systematic collection of data, controlled observation,
and the testing of hypotheses. A hypothesis is a conjectural statement
that usually describes a relationship between two variables. Different
theories may result in different hypotheses for the same phenomenon. A
theory is a group of principles and hypotheses that together explain
some aspect of a particular area of inquiry. For example, hypothesized
reasons for eating disorders have included biological or neurochemical
causes, fear of sexual maturity, societal demands for thinness in women,
and pathological family relationships. Each of these hypotheses reflects
a different theory.

Characteristics of Clinical Research Clinical research can proceed only
when the relationship expressed in a hypothesis is clearly and
systematically stated and when the variables of concern are measurable
and defined. We need to define clearly what we are studying and make
sure that the variables are measured with reliable and valid
instruments. Clinical research relies on characteristics of the
scientific method, including the potential for self-correction, the
development of hypotheses about relationships, the use of operational
definitions, consideration

of reliability and validity, the acknowledgment of base rates, and the
requirement that research findings be evaluated in terms of their
statistical significance. Potential for Self-Correction Perhaps the
unique and most general characteristic of the scientific method is its
potential for self-correction. Under ideal conditions, data and
conclusions are freely exchanged and experiments are replicable
(reproducible). Discussion, testing, and verification are encouraged,
resulting in data that are as free as possible from the scientists'
personal beliefs, perceptions, biases, values, attitudes, and emotions.
When researchers do not follow these guidelines, ethical concerns arise.
Hypothesizing Relationships Another characteristic of the scientific
method is that it attempts to identify and explain (hypothesize) the
relationship between variables. Examples of hypotheses include: "Some
seasonal forms of depression may be due to decreases in light," "Autism
(a severe disorder beginning in childhood) is the result of poor
parenting," and "Eating disorders are the result of specific family
interaction patterns."

CONTROLLED OBSERVATIONS Research on animals can provide clues to the
development of emotions in humans. Baby orangutans show empathy,
laughter, and the ability to copy facial expressions.

Operational Deﬁnitions Concrete definitions of the variables that are
being studied are called operational definitions. For example, an
operational definition of depression might involve (1) a specific
pattern of responses to a self-report depression inventory, (2) a rating
assigned by an observer using a depression checklist, or (3) laboratory
identification of specific neurochemical changes. Operational
definitions are important because they force an experimenter to clearly
define what he or she means by the variable. This allows others to agree
or disagree with the way the variable was defined. When operational
definitions of a phenomenon differ, comparing research is problematic,
and conclusions can be faulty. Let's consider the recent studies or
reports linking child sexual abuse with panic disorder, phobias,
depression, alcohol and substance abuse, multiple personality and
dissociative disorders, and bulimia and anorexia nervosa (Briere, 1992;
Pribor & Dinwiddie, 1992; Terr, 1991). Unfortunately, these studies
employ different operational definitions (Haugaard, 2000). Consider the
differences in the following definitions of child sexual abuse used in
the research literature: • Any sexual activity, overt or covert, between
a child and an adult (or older child), where the younger child's
participation is obtained through seduction or coercion. (Ratican, 1992,
p. 33) • Any self-reported contact---ranging from fondling to sexual
intercourse--- experienced by a patient on or before age eighteen and
initiated by someone five or more years senior or by a family member at
least two years senior. (Brown & Anderson, 1991, p. 56) Other
definitions of child sexual abuse include "any unwanted sexual
experience before fourteen," "any attempted or completed rape before
eighteen years," and "contact between someone under fifteen and another
person five years older" (Briere, 1992, p. 198). The use of so many
different definitions of child sexual abuse makes any general
conclusions difficult when conducting research (Mallinckrodt, McCreary,
& Robertson, 1995; Pope et al., 1994; Rind, Tromovitch, & Bauserman,
1998). Operational definitions need to be clear and precise. Research
would certainly be enhanced if there were also consistency in
definitions.

operational deﬁnitions concrete deﬁnitions of the variables that are

Reliability and Validity of Measures and Observations The scientific
method requires that the measures we use be reliable (consistent).
Reliability refers to the degree to which a measure or procedure will
yield the same results repeatedly (see Chapter 3, this volume).
Consider, for example, an individual who has been diagnosed, by means of
a questionnaire, as having an antisocial personality. If the
questionnaire is reliable, the individual should receive the same
diagnosis after filling out the questionnaire again. Results must be
consistent if we are to have any faith in them. Even if consistent
results are obtained, questions can arise over the validity of a
measure. Does the testing instrument really measure what it was
developed to

Repressed Memories: Issues and Questions

P

atricia Burgus claimed that during treatment, which included hypnosis
and hypnotic drugs, therapists had induced recovered memories of her
participation in a cannibalistic satanic cult and of her having sexually
abused her two sons (Ewing, 1998). Burgus's memories were later
determined to be false and were attributed to suggestions and techniques
used by the therapists. She was awarded \$10.6 million in damages. Pope
and Hudson (2007) do not believe that repressed memory is a
scientiﬁcally valid phenomenon but one that was "manufactured" after the
1800s. In fact, they have posted a \$1,000 reward on the Internet to
anyone who can produce a published case of the phenomenon in ﬁction or
nonﬁction prior to 1800. They argue that if "repressed memory" were
genuine, it would have been a subject of writings in the past. The ﬁrst
successful respondent will receive a check from the Biological
Psychiatry Laboratory at the McLean Hospital in Massachusetts, and the
case will be posted on the Web site. Conversely, the Recovered Memory
Project (2007) is assembling information and cases of recovered memory.
As they state on their Web site, "The purpose of this project is to
collect and disseminate information relevant to the debate over whether
traumatic events can be forgotten and then remembered later in life."
They want to assemble "evidence of \[repressed memory\] cases ignored or
overlooked by self-described skeptics of various sorts." The controversy
over the existence of "repressed memory" is especially pronounced
between experimental psychologists and clinicians (clinical
psychologists and social

workers). In one study, only 34 percent of the experimental
psychologists reported that they believed in the validity of the
phenomenon, compared with over 60 percent of the clinicians (Dammeyer,
Nightingale, & McCoy, 1997). The study also revealed some differences
among the clinicians themselves. Those with psychoanalytic,
psychodynamic, or eclectic orientations believed more strongly in
repressed memories than did those with cognitive orientations. Many
clinicians also believed that some therapeutic techniques could lead to
false memories. Cases of repressed memory have been brought up in court.
To address "junk science," the Supreme Court in 1993 set forth the
Daubert Standard, under which evidence offered by expert witnesses must
meet certain standards: (1) The theory or technique must be falsiﬁable
and testable; (2) it must have been subjected to peer review and
publication; (3) the reliability of procedures or potential error rate
should be speciﬁed; and (4) the theory or technique must be generally
accepted by the relevant scientiﬁc community (Sanders, Diamond, &
Vidmar, 2002). For Further Consideration 1. Do you believe repressed
memories are real? How would you decide whether to maintain or abandon
repressed memory as a genuine phenomenon? What would be the implications
of your decision? 2. Why are experimental psychologists more likely than
clinicians to have doubts regarding the existence of repressed memories?

measure? If we claim to have developed a test that identifies
dissociative identity disorder, we must demonstrate that it can
accomplish this task. The validity of many of the clinical tests used in
studies has not been determined. We return to this topic later in the
chapter. Base Rates A base rate is the rate of natural occurrence of a
phenomenon in the population studied. When the base rate is not known or
not considered, research findings can be misinterpreted. For example,
both unwanted sexual events and eating problems are reported by a high
percentage of females (Conners & Morse, 1993; Pope & Hudson, 1992). As a
result, clinicians may find that the majority of individuals treated for
eating problems report a history of sexual abuse. An investigator, not
recognizing that both of these conditions occur with high frequency
(have high base rates), may mistakenly conclude that one is the cause of
the other. Base rate data is helpful in interpreting phenomena such as
sexual behaviors in children. Is the presence of "sexualized" behaviors
a sign of sexual abuse or a normative type of behavior? A wide range of
sexual behaviors in 1,114 nonsexually abused children between the ages
of two and twelve were reported by primary caregivers. As the
researchers state regarding sexual touching, "Simply because a
five-year-old boy touches his genitals occasionally, even after a
weekend visit with his noncustodial parent, it does not mean he has been
sexually abused. Rather, it is a behavior that is seen in nearly
two-thirds of boys at that age" (Friedrich et al., 1998, p. 8). Base
rate data, however, provide only the context within which to

base rate the rate of natural occurrence of a phenomenon in the
population studied

evaluate behavior. Whether "normative" or low-percentage sexual
behaviors are due to abuse must be determined on an individual basis.
The importance of base rates in clinical research can be seen in the
responses of a control group to a psychotic-traits questionnaire.
Persons with severe mental disorders are believed to have "unusual"
thoughts or reactions. On one specific psychotic-traits questionnaire,
however, a large percentage of the control group gave positive answers
to the questions in Figure 4.1. Although individuals with schizophrenia
are twice as likely as normal persons to endorse such statements
(Jackson & Claridge, 1991), "normal" individuals in control groups also
report disturbing thoughts and Did You Know? urges, "paranoid ideation,"
and "magical thinking." The fact f 3,247 scientists who received funding
for studies that an individual or client reports having odd or bizarre
from the National Institute of Mental Health thoughts or being bothered
by the feeling of being watched (NIMH), less than 2 percent reported
having may, therefore, not be indicative of a disorder.

O

committed serious violations such as falsifying data or plagiarism.
However: • 15.5 percent changed the design, methodology, or results of a
study because of pressure from a funding source • 15.3 percent dropped
observations or data points in their studies from analysis because of a
"gut feeling" • 12.5 percent overlooked others' use of ﬂawed data or
questionable interpretation of data • 6 percent failed to present data
that contradicted their own previous research

Statistical Versus Clinical Signiﬁcance The scientific method also
requires that research findings be evaluated in terms of their
statistical significance---the likelihood that the relationship is not
due to chance alone. Even a statistically significant finding may have
little practical significance in a clinical setting, however. For
example, based on a study by Phillips, Van Voorhees, and Ruth (1992),
various news reports have stated that women are more likely to die the
week after their birthdays than in any other week of the year. This
finding seemed to show that psychological factors have a powerful effect
on biological processes. The study involved Source: DeVries, Martinson,
& Anderson (2006). 2,745,149 persons, and the findings were
statistically significant (not due to chance). The number of deaths for
the week after a birthday, however, was only 3.03 percent higher than
would be expected in any other week. Thus psychological factors
associated with deaths and birthdays, although statistically
significant, appear to play only a small role in deaths among women.
When evaluating research, you must determine whether the statistical
significance reported is really "clinically" significant. This problem
is most likely to occur in studies with large sample sizes.

hypothesis---is made about two variables; the independent variable is

variable are measured

The experiment is perhaps the best tool for testing cause-and-effect
relationships. In its simplest form, the experiment involves the
following: 1. An experimental hypothesis, which is the prediction
concerning how an independent variable will affect a dependent variable
in an experiment 2. An independent variable (the possible cause), which
the experimenter manipulates to determine its effect on a dependent
variable 3. A dependent variable, which is expected to change as a
result of changes in the independent variable. The experimenter is also
concerned about controlling extraneous or confounding variables (factors
other than the independent variable that may affect the dependent
variable). For example, expectancies of both the research participants
and the researchers may influence the outcome of a study. Participants
in a study may try to "help" the researcher succeed and, in so doing,
may confound the results of the study (Anderson & Strupp, 1996). If the
experimenter is effective in eliminating confounding variables in a
study, the study has high internal validity. That is, we can be
relatively certain that changes in the dependent variable are due only
to the independent variable. The experimenter is also interested in
external validity. This refers to whether the findings of a particular
study can be generalized to other groups or conditions. Let's clarify
these concepts by examining an actual research study.

Experiments

Case Study

The Experimental Group An experimental group is the group that is
subjected to the independent variable. In their study, Thom and her
colleagues (2000) created two experimental groups: one treated with
stress management training and exposure to images of dental scenes for a
single session and the other provided with medication. The psychological
treatment included cognitive, relaxation, and breathing training, which
the patients practiced daily for one week. Because the investigators
were interested in how treatment affects level of anxiety and reports of
panic, the dependent variables were measured in several ways. Pre- and
posttreatment measures were obtained for dental fear, as well as
subjective ratings for pain during the procedure. The investigators also
tabulated how many of the patients completed dental treatment with
further appointments.

The Control Group If the participants in the two experimental groups in
the study by Thom and her colleagues (2000) showed a reduction in
anxiety based on pretesting to posttesting measures, could the
researchers conclude that the treatments were effective forms of
therapy? The answer would be no, because participants may have shown
less anxiety about dental procedures merely as a result of the passage
of time or as a function of completing the assessment measures. The use
of a control group enables researchers to eliminate such possibilities.
A control group is a group that is similar in every way to the
experimental group except for the manipulation of the independent
variable. In the study by Thom and her colleagues (2000), the control
group also took the pretest measures, received dental work, and took the
posttest measures. However, those in the control group did not receive
any treatment. Because of this, we can be more certain that any
differences found between the control and experimental groups were due
to the independent variable (i.e., the treatment received). The findings
revealed that the groups treated with either psychological intervention
or antianxiety medication had significantly greater reductions on the
Dental Fear Scale and Pain Scale than the control group. However, those
treated with benzodiazepine showed a relapse following dental surgery,
whereas those who received psychological intervention showed further
improvement and continued dental treatment. Of those who completed
additional dental procedures, 70 percent had been in the psychological
intervention group, 20 percent in the antianxiety medication group, and
10 percent in the control group. Given these findings, the therapist
might tell Melinda that both treatments can reduce her dental fear but
that psychological interventions might

Percent

Melinda N., a nineteen-year-old sophomore, sought help from a university
psychology clinic for dental phobia. Her strong fear of dentists began
when she was about twelve years old. It had been suggested to her that
she might have a low pain threshold or have experienced some type of
traumatic incident during dental work. Melinda had several cavities that
were painful, so she decided to see if a therapist could offer some
help. Because she had an appointment to see the dentist the following
week, Melinda wanted something that could work quickly. The therapist
had heard that an antianxiety medication, benzodiazepine, and
psychological methods (relaxation training and changing thoughts about
the procedure) were both successful in treating dental phobia. Before
deciding which treatment to recommend, the therapist reviewed the
research literature to determine whether studies had compared the
effectiveness of these approaches. A study by Thom, Sartory, and Johren
(2000) seemed to provide some direction. In that study, ﬁfty patients
with dental phobia were assigned to either a psychological treatment, a
medication (benzodiazepine), or a no-treatment group. The psychological
treatment took only one session and involved stress management training
(relaxation exercises, visualization of dental work, and the
identiﬁcation and use of coping thoughts). The exercises learned in
therapy were to be performed at home daily for one week. Those in the
medication group received an antianxiety medication thirty minutes
before the dental procedure. Those in the control condition were told
that their surgeon specialized in patients with dental anxiety and would
treat them carefully.

relaxation, visualization, exposure, and cognitive strategies, it is
uncertain which component or components were responsible for the
outcome. If researchers wanted to further explore which of the
psychological interventions (or combination of interventions) was most
effective, how might they design a study to investigate this issue?

Myth vs Reality Myth: Increasing controls over an experiment always
results in greater generalizability of the ﬁndings. Reality: Although a
tightly controlled study increases internal validity, problems can occur
with external validity---that is, the ﬁndings may not be generalizable
to other populations because the conditions existing in an experimental
setting may not resemble those found in real-life situations. Both
internal and external validity have to be considered when designing a
study.

The Placebo Group You should note that the results of an experiment may
also be challenged for another reason. For example, what if the
participants in the treated experimental groups improved not because of
the treatment but because they had faith or an expectancy that they
would improve? Some researchers have found that if participants expect
to improve from treatment, this expectancy---rather than specific
treatment---is responsible for the outcome. One method by which to
induce an expectancy without using the specific treatment is to include
a placebo control group. The Did You Know? study by Thom and her
colleagues (2000) could have included a condition in which participants

college students are representative of "people in general," "adults," or
even "college students in general." How can we be certain that the
results obtained are generalizable?

Additional Concerns in Clinical Research

Although researchers hope to control expectations of outcome through the
use of a placebo control group, two types of problems can occur. First,
the placebo control group may also report significant improvements. In a
review of research, placebos duplicated up to 89 percent of the
improvement seen with antidepressants (Antonuccio, Burns, & Danton,
2002). This finding would make it difficult to separate treatment from
expectancy effects. Second, participants may "guess" correctly that they
are receiving a placebo, thereby reducing any expectancy effects.
Another problem associated with medication trials is that individuals
who are strong responders to placebos are often eliminated from studies,
ensuring a more favorable showing for medication (Sue & Sue, 2008b).
Experimenter or participant expectations can also influence diagnosis
and the outcome of a study. To control for experimenter expectations,
the researcher may use a blind design, in which the clinicians doing the
interviewing are not aware of the purpose of the study. A method to
reduce the impact of both experimenter and participant expectations is
the double-blind design. In this procedure, neither the individual
working directly with the participant (such as the therapist or
physician) nor the participant is aware of the experimental conditions.
The effectiveness of this design is

DOUBLE-BLIND DESIGN When researching the effects of a drug,
experimenters will often use a doubleblind design to ensure that neither
participants nor experimenter are aware of the experimental conditions.
Shown here is a prepared card of drugs that could be used in a research
study in such a way that neither patient nor doctor actually knows
whether the patient is receiving a drug or a placebo. How would you
determine whether this manipulation was successful?

dependent on whether participants are truly "blind" to the intervention,
which may not always be the case. In a randomized, double-blind study
(Margraf et al., 1991), patients with panic disorder were given one of
two antidepressants (alprazolam or imipramine) or a placebo. All of the
substances were dispensed in identical capsules. Were the patients and
physicians "blind" to the conditions? Apparently not. The great majority
of patients and physicians were able to correctly identify the
antidepressant because of physiological reactions to the medication.
Further, the physicians were able to distinguish whether the client was
taking alprazolam or imipramine based on the reactions of the patients.
These findings indicate the need to modify experimental designs so that
the degree of "blindness" is increased. Otherwise, the results may be
influenced by both client and experimenter expectations. As you can see,
researchers have a difficult time controlling extraneous or confounding
variables. External validity (the ability to generalize the results to
other settings) is also very important to determine. In the study by
Thom and her colleagues (2000), we would want to know whether
psychotherapy and benzodiazepines are also effective in reducing anxiety
in other populations and situations. Sometimes importing a therapy from
a research setting to a real-life environment is difficult. Martin
Seligman (1996) points out that research designs that produce high
internal validity (such as those that use a manual to provide therapy,
prescribe only a fixed number of sessions, and involve random assignment
of clients with a single disorder) may have problems with external
validity. "Real" therapy often does not follow treatment manuals
precisely and may not be of a fixed duration. Patients frequently have
multiple problems and are not randomly assigned to therapists in clinic
settings. Thus, in some cases, designing research with very high
internal validity may reduce the generalizability of the findings.

Correlations A correlation is the extent to which variations in one
variable are accompanied by increases or decreases in a second variable.
The variables in a correlation, unlike those in an experiment, are not
manipulated. Instead, a statistical analysis is performed to determine
whether increases in one variable are accompanied by increases or
decreases in the other. The relationship is expressed as a statistically
derived correlation coefficient, symbolized by the symbol r, which has a
numerical value between ⫺1 and ⫹1. In a positive correlation, an
increase in one variable is accompanied by an increase in

correlation the extent to which variations in one variable are
accompanied by increases or decreases in a second variable

in the other variable, there is a negative correlation. The greater the
value of r, positive or negative, the stronger the relationship. See
Figure 4.2 for examples of correlations. Correlations indicate the
degree to which two variables are related but not the reason for the
relationship. For example, the Parents Television Council (2007)
reported that during the family hour time slots (8 p.m.--9 p.m. Monday
though Saturday and 7 p.m.--9 p.m. on Sunday), nearly 50 percent of TV
programs contained violent content, with approximately 4.19 violent acts
or images per hour. Does watching aggressive fare lead to aggressive
behavior? Johnson and colleagues (2002) assessed the relationship
between the number of hours of television viewing and the number of
aggressive behaviors over a seventeen-year period. A significant
correlation was found. The greater the number of hours spent watching
television per day, the greater the number of aggressive acts (assaults
or physical fights resulting in injury; robbery, threats to injure
someone, or using a weapon to commit a crime; and aggressive acts
against another person). Of those who watched television less than one
hour per day, 5.7 percent committed a violent act; 25.3 percent of those
who watched more than three hours a day did so. The study controlled for
possible confounding variables such as childhood neglect, low family
income, unsafe neighborhoods, and psychiatric disorders. Because this
was a correlation study, the authors cautioned, "It should be noted that
a strong inference of causality cannot be made without conducting a
controlled experiment, and we cannot rule out the possibility that some
other covariates that were not controlled in the present study may have
been responsible for these associations" (Johnson et al., 2002,
p. 2470).

Researcher Allegiance: A "Wild Card" in Comparative Research?

T

he move to develop empirically supported treatments has resulted in
research that compares two or more forms of therapy to determine which
ones are the most effective for speciﬁc disorders. Although this
appeared to be a clear-cut task, reviewers became puzzled as to why the
results of comparative studies were so contradictory. In some studies,
psychodynamic therapies would be superior to behavioral therapy in
treatment outcome, and in other cases the reverse might be true. To
determine what might be producing these discrepant ﬁndings, Luborsky and
his colleagues (1999) reviewed twenty-nine studies that compared two
therapies. Of these, nine involved cognitive versus behavioral therapy,
seven involved behavioral versus psychodynamic therapy, four compared
psychodynamic with cognitive therapy, and nine examined
psychopharmacology versus psychotherapy. Because the reviewers were
suspicious that the theoretical position or "alliance" to a speciﬁc
approach by researchers in the studies might inﬂuence the outcome,
ratings of the researcher's alliance were obtained through self-ratings,
ratings by colleagues, and reprints of research. These three measures of
researcher alliance correlated .85 with the effect sizes of the
difference in treatments compared. In other words, researcher allegiance
was a very important inﬂuence. For example, behavioral researchers who
conducted studies comparing behavioral versus psychodynamic therapies
would ﬁnd that their favored

approach would be "more effective." The reverse was also true for
psychodynamic researchers. Luborsky and his colleagues (1999) speculated
about how the researcher's allegiance to a treatment might be associated
with the outcome in comparative research: 1. A less effective comparison
treatment might have been selected to be compared with the favored
treatment. 2. Research that reﬂected negatively on the researcher's
favored treatment might be shelved and not submitted for publication. 3.
The therapist or therapy that is provided for the nonfavored treatment
might differ in a way that favors the researcher's allegiance; for
example, the therapist may have less training with the treatment. 4.
Subtle reinforcements or positive expectations by the researchers might
be conveyed subtly to therapists providing the favored treatment. If the
Luborsky study is correct in ﬁnding a very strong relationship between
researcher allegiance and treatment outcome, what does this mean in
terms of the validity of research that compares several types of
treatment? Other than the preceding speculations by Luborsky and his
colleagues (1999), what additional explanations can you give for the
ﬁndings? What are different ways of identifying and minimizing research
allegiance effects?

Correlational studies cannot be used to demonstrate cause and effect. To
employ such a strategy in this case would involve randomly assigning
children to different groups to view the same content for different
hours over a period of time. This is not possible. The authors also
tried to control for other variables that might be associated with
television watching and aggression, but it is possible that other
factors may be involved. Such third-variable possibilities in
correlations are numerous. Consider the following actual observations.
What third-variable explanations can you suggest for them? • The number
of storks nesting on rooftops in certain New England communities is
positively correlated with the human birthrate. • The number of violent
crimes committed in a community is positively correlated with the number
of churches in the community. In summary, a correlation indicates the
degree to which two variables are related. It is a very important method
of scientific inquiry because there are many variables we cannot
control, such as genetic makeup, gender, and socioeconomic status.
Manipulating other variables that we might be able to control, such as
exposing a child to trauma or abuse, would be unethical. Correlations
can tell us how likely it is that two variables occur together. Even
when the variables are highly related, however, we must exercise caution
in interpreting causality. The two variables may not be causally
related, or both may be influenced by a third variable. Even if they are
causally related, the direction of causality may be unclear.

CORRELATIONAL STUDIES Identical twins\* are often used in correlational
studies to determine the inﬂuence of genetic factors. They tend to show
greater behavioral similarities than do fraternal twins or siblings.
This similarity is attributed to genetic factors. Could the way
identical twins are treated also contribute to this ﬁnding? \* These
twins are the grandsons of author David Sue.

Analogue Studies As we have noted, ethical, moral, or legal standards
may prevent researchers from devising certain studies on mental
disorders or on the effect of treatment. In other cases, studying
real-life situations is not feasible because researchers would have a
difficult time controlling all the variables. In such cases, researchers
may resort to an analogue study---an investigation that attempts to
replicate or simulate, under controlled conditions, a situation that
occurs in real life. The advantage of this type of investigation is that
it allows us to study a phenomenon using experimental designs that are
not possible with correlational studies. Here are some examples of
analogue studies: 1. To study the possible effects of a new form of
treatment on patients with anxiety disorders, the researcher may use
students who have test anxiety rather than individuals diagnosed with
anxiety disorders. 2. To test the hypothesis that human depression is
caused by continual encounters with events that one cannot control, the
researcher exposes rats to uncontrollable aversive stimuli and looks for
an increase in depressive-like behaviors (such as lack of motivation,
inability to learn, and general apathy) in the animals. 3. To test the
hypothesis that sexual sadism is influenced by watching sexually violent
films or television programs, an experimenter exposes "normal" male
participants to either violent or nonviolent sexual programs. The
participants then complete a questionnaire assessing their attitudes and
values toward women and their likelihood of engaging in violent
behaviors with women. an investigation that attempts to replicate or
simulate, under controlled conditions, a situation that occurs in real
life

Obviously, each example is only an approximation of real life. Students
with test anxiety may not be equivalent to individuals with anxiety
disorders. Findings based on rats may not be applicable to human beings.
And exposure to one violent sexual film and the use of a questionnaire
may not be sufficient to allow a researcher

CORRELATIONAL FINDINGS Social contact and support are associated with
better mental health. How would you determine the direction of the
relationship? Does friendship prevent mental disturbances or do
individuals with psychological problems have fewer friends? What other
factors might be involved to produce the relationship between mental
health and social relationships?

to draw the conclusion that sexual sadism is caused by long-term
exposure to such films. However, analogue studies can give researchers
insight into the processes that might be involved in abnormal behaviors
and treatment.

Field Studies In some cases, analogue studies would be too contrived to
be accurate representations of a real-life situation. Investigators may
then resort to a field study, in which behaviors and events are observed
and recorded in their natural environment. The participants in a field
study are most often members of a given social unit---a group, an
institution, or a community. However, the investigation may also be
limited to a single individual; single-participant studies are discussed
in the next section. Field studies sometimes employ data collection
techniques, such as questionnaires, interviews, and the analysis of
existing records, but the primary technique is observation. The
observers must be highly trained and have enough self-discipline to
avoid disrupting or modifying the behavioral processes they are
observing and recording. A field study may be used to examine mass
behavior after events of major consequence, such as wars, floods, and
earthquakes. It may also be applied to the study of personal crises, as
in military combat, major surgery, terminal disease, or the loss of
loved ones. An example of a field study is the in-person interviews
conducted in New York City after the terrorist attacks on the World
Trade Center. Nearly 11 percent of the interviewees had lost a family
member or close friend. The most frequent symptoms reported were
recurring painful memories of the event. Although 18.5 percent displayed
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, only 11.3 percent had
received any psychiatric help or were taking medications for the
symptoms (DeLisi et al., 2003). Although field studies offer a more
realistic investigative environment than other types of research, they
suffer from certain limitations. First, as with other nonexperimental
research, determining the direction of causality is difficult in field
studies because the data are correlational. Second, so many variables
are at work in real-life situations that it is impossible to
control---and sometimes even distinguish---them all. As a result, the
findings may be difficult to interpret. Third, observers can never be
absolutely sure that their presence did not influence the interactions
they observed.

FIELD STUDIES The catastrophic damage wrought by the tsunami on December
26, 2004, caused nearly 100,000 fatalities in Meulaboh, Indonesia,
alone. The majority of victims were women and children. Here, survivors
survey the ruins. Many individuals involved in or witnessing the
disaster suffered severe emotional and physical trauma. Disasters such
as this provide a unique, though unwelcome, opportunity to observe
events and reactions of individuals in the natural environment. Can
social scientists remain detached and objective when recording a tragedy
of such magnitude?

Single-Participant Studies Most scientists advocate the study of large
numbers of people to uncover the basic principles governing behavior.
This approach, called the nomothetic orientation, is concerned with
formulating general laws or principles while deemphasizing individual
variations or differences. Experiments and correlational studies are
nomothetic. Other scientists advocate the in-depth study of one person.
This approach, exemplified by the single-participant study, has been
called the idiographic orientation. There has been much debate over
which method is more fruitful in studying psychopathology. Although the
idiographic method of studying a single participant has many
limitations, especially lack of generalizability, it has proven very
valuable in applied clinical work. Furthermore, arguing over which
method is more helpful is not productive because both approaches are
needed to study abnormal behavior. The nomothetic approach seems
appropriate for laboratory scientists, whereas the idiographic approach
seems appropriate for psychotherapists, who regularly face the pressures
of treating disturbed individuals. There are two types of
single-participant studies: the case study and the singleparticipant
experiment. Both techniques may be used to examine a rare or an unusual
phenomenon, to demonstrate a novel diagnostic or treatment procedure, to
test an assumption, to generate future hypotheses on which to base
controlled research, or to collect comprehensive information to better
understand an individual. Only the singleparticipant experiment,
however, can determine cause-and-effect relationships.

The Case Study Physicians have used the case study extensively in
describing and treating medical disease. In psychology, a case study is
an intensive study of one individual that relies on clinical data, such
as observations, psychological tests, and historical and biographical
information. A case study thus lacks the control and objectivity of many
other methods and cannot be used to demonstrate cause-and-effect
relationships. It can serve as the primary source of data in cases in
which systematic experimental procedures are not feasible. Case studies
can also be helpful in determining diagnosis, characteristics, course,
and outcome of a disorder, as illustrated in the following example:

Stephen Shore, an individual diagnosed in childhood with atypical autism
(a disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and
restricted interest in activities), now serves on the Board of Directors
for the Autism Society of America. According to his mother, Stephen
developed normally during his ﬁrst year of life but stopped talking
during his second year. At the time, little was known about
autistic-like disorders. When his mother talked to Stephen, he did not
respond.

Single-Participant Studies

109

Using trial and error, she discovered that making nonsensical statements
would attract his attention. She also found that he would not imitate
her, but he acknowledged her with a glance when she made peculiar
noises. At the age of four, Stephen became fascinated with watch motors
and would take watches apart and put them back together again. He later
attributed his obsession with watches to the fact that they provided
structure. Based on his own experiences, Stephen believes that he can
offer suggestions for working with individuals who have autistic
disorders. For example, he suggests that topics such as airplanes,
astronomy, bicycles, animals, chemistry, electricity, hardware, locks,
and watches might be attractive to these children. Interactions can be
structured around speciﬁc areas of interest, such as bicycling or
computers. This allows conversation to revolve around an activity rather
than "small talk," which is difﬁcult for people with autistic disorders.
He also believes that individuals with autism can beneﬁt by being
provided with precise explanations of social interactions, as they are
often unaware of the "rules" involved (Shore, 2003).

In this case, Stephen shared his life experience, explaining how he
perceived the world and events. His account gives some clues as to the
reasons for some of the unusual behaviors shown by individuals with
autistic disorders, as well as suggested interventions. Case studies are
also useful in helping clinicians formulate hypotheses that can be
tested later in research.

The Single-Participant Experiment The single-participant experiment
differs from the case study in that the former is actually an experiment
in which some aspect of the person's own behavior is used as a control
or baseline for comparison with future behaviors. To determine the
effectiveness of a treatment, for example, the experimenter begins by
plotting a baseline to show the frequency of a behavior before
intervention. Then the treatment is introduced, and the person's
behavior is observed. If the behavior changes, the treatment is
withdrawn. If, after the withdrawal of treatment, the person's behavior
again resembles that observed during the baseline condition, we can be
fairly certain that the treatment was responsible for the behavior
changes observed earlier. In the final step, the treatment is
reinstated. A multiple-baseline study is a second type of
single-participant experimental design in which baselines on two or more
behaviors or the same behavior in two or more settings are obtained
prior to intervention. The same intervention is then introduced for one
behavior or setting, its effects observed, and then applied to the next
behavior or setting. If the behaviors change only with the intervention,
confidence is increased that the intervention caused the changed
behavior. Bock (2007) used a multiple-baseline approach to determine the
effectiveness of a training program for four children with Asperger
syndrome, a disorder characterized by the inability to develop peer
relationships and to understand social customs and by the lack of social
or emotional reciprocity. Baselines for the children's behaviors were
obtained during (1) cooperative learning activities, (2) organized
sports, and (3) lunch with peers. Very few appropriate behaviors were
found in each of these conditions. The intervention program, called
"SODA," provided rules and instructions to help the children attend to
social cues and to develop appropriate responses. The program trained
the children to reflect on their own behavior, the environment, and
other individuals using the following strategies: Stop (What is the
activity that people are engaged in?), Observe (What is he/she doing or
saying?), Deliberate (What would I like to do or say? How will others
feel or act if I do or say these things?), and Act (I plan to ... ). The
SODA strategies were applied sequentially---first to the cooperative
learning situation for a number of sessions, then to recess, and finally
to lunch. As shown in Figure 4.3, with one of the students, Bob, changes
in appropriate behaviors for each of the three conditions occurred only
after the intervention. (The same effect was observed for the other
three students.) Single-participant designs tend to be relegated to the
background because of the reliance and emphasis on research models that
involve group comparisons or hypothesis testing. Because only one
participant is used in this design, questions are raised about external
validity or the generalizability of the findings. However, the focus on
a single participant and on changes over time can be of great interest
to parents, teachers, and therapists (Morgan & Morgan, 2001).

As noted in Chapter 2, in the year 2000, the entire 3.1-billion
nucleotide basis of human DNA was identified. The focus of future
research will turn away from identifying genes to understanding how they
affect behavior. Efforts are being directed toward determining how genes
work, with the hope that this will lead to gene-based diagnoses and
treatment. For most forms of psychopathology, this approach will be most
helpful in early identification. For example, phenylketonuria (PKU), a
metabolic disorder that can produce mental retardation, is treated not
by technological methods but by altering diet to prevent damage to the
brain (Plomin & Crabbe, 2000).

Genetic linkage studies attempt to determine whether a disorder follows
a genetic pattern. If a disorder is genetically linked, individuals
closely related to the person with the disorder (who is called the
proband) should be more likely to display that disorder or a related
one. Genetic studies of psychiatric disorders often employ the following
procedure (Alexander, Lerer, & Baron, 1992): 1. The proband and his or
her family members are identified. 2. The proband is asked for the
psychiatric history of specific family members. 3. These members are
contacted and given some type of assessment to determine whether they
have the same or a related disorder. 4. Assessment of the proband and
family members may include psychological tests, brain scans, and
neuropsychological examinations.

A MULTIPLE-BASELINE STUDY The ﬁgures show the percentage of time Bob and
a non-Asperger peer spent behaving appropriately during cooperative
learning, recess, and lunch. During baseline, the percentage of time Bob
displayed appropriate behaviors in cooperative learning, recess, and
lunch was under 10 percent. With the SODA intervention, the percentage
increased to about 70 percent during cooperative learning and recess and
to more than 40 percent during lunch. At a ﬁve-month follow-up, it was
found that the gains in appropriate behaviors were maintained.

endophenotypes

This research strategy depends on the accurate diagnosis of both the
proband and the relatives. Kendler, Silberg, and colleagues (1991) have
pointed out a possible source of error in the family history interview
method, when the proband is asked whether relatives also have the same
disorder. Kendler and colleagues used this method in a study of female
twin pairs who were discordant for major depression, generalized anxiety
disorder, and alcoholism---that is, in each pair, one twin had the
disorder and the other did not. When asked whether her parents also had
the disorder, the "sick" twin was more likely than the "well" twin to
report that they did. As this study indicates, caution must be used in
employing the family history method in genetic linkage studies. An
individual's psychiatric status ("sick" or "well") may influence the
accuracy of his or her assessment of the mental health of relatives.
This bias in reporting may be reduced by using multiple informants or by
assessing the family members directly.

The Endophenotype Concept Endophenotypes are measurable characteristics
(neurochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or
neuropsychological) that can give clues regarding the specific genes
involved in disorders. Some researchers believe that differences in eye
tracking, attention and information processing deficits, and
abnormalities in brain structure may be endophenotypes for
schizophrenia. However, to qualify as an endophenotype, it must be
(Gottesman & Gould, 2003):

• associated with the disorder • heritable • manifested in an individual
regardless of whether the disorder is present • found in a higher rate
among nonaffected family members than in the general population Although
the endophenotype concept has been around for decades, it has received
increased emphasis with the advances in genetic research, brain scans,
and biochemical findings.

Other Concepts in Biological Research Iatrogenic effects are unintended
effects of therapy---such as an unintended change in behavior resulting
from a medication prescribed or a psychological technique employed by a
therapist. The therapist may not recognize the behavior change as a side
effect of the medication or technique and may treat it as a separate
disorder. For example, some have mistakenly diagnosed memory
loss---which can be a side effect of antidepressant medication---as
Alzheimer's disease or other organic conditions. THE HUMAN GENOME
PROJECT This massive undertaking Psychological interventions or
techniques can also produce involved deciphering, mapping, and
identifying DNA sequencing unexpected results. Researchers and
therapists believe that some patterns and variations in approximately
30,000 genes in cases of dissociative identity disorder may be
inadvertently human DNA. Scientists hope to determine the "message"
contained in the DNA patterns that may contribute to human produced by
hypnotism, the very method used to investigate it (Coons, 1988; Merskey,
1995; Ofshe, 1992). Hypnotism has been attributes and diseases. Such
research raises ethical, legal, and used to retrieve memories reported
by the different personalities, social concerns. and clinicians often
believe that the information obtained in this manner is accurate. The
Council on Scientific Affairs (1985), however, concluded the following
in its investigation of hypnosis: 1. Traumatic memories retrieved may
reflect an emotional reality rather than an accurate recollection. 2.
Hypnosis produces a state in which an individual is more vulnerable to
subtle cues and suggestions that often distort recollections. 3.
Hypnosis increases both accurate and inaccurate information. 4. Without
independent verification, neither the hypnotist nor the subject can
distinguish between accurate and inaccurate information. 5. Hypnosis can
"increase the subject's confidence in his memories without affecting
accuracy and . . . increase errors while also falsely increasing
confidence" (p. 1921). 6. In general, recollections obtained during
nonhypnotic recall are more accurate than those obtained during
hypnosis. These conclusions indicate the need to question the accuracy
of material obtained during a hypnotic state. Penetrance refers to the
degree to which a genetic characteristic is manifested by individuals
carrying a specific gene or genes associated with it. Complete
penetrance occurs when a carrier always manifests the characteristic
associated with the gene or genes. In mental disorders, incomplete
penetrance is the rule. Even in cases of schizophrenia, only about half
of the identical twins of the proband develop this disorder, even though
their status as identical twins means that they carry the same genes.
Pathognomonic refers to a biological or psychological symptom or
characteristic on which a diagnosis can be made. A great deal of
research has been directed to discovering a symptom that is specifically
distinctive of a disorder. Biological challenge tests are often used to
determine the effect of a substance on behavior. If we believe that a
specific additive or food is responsible for hyperactivity

change in behavior resulting from a medication prescribed or a
psychological technique employed by a therapist

in a child, we might observe the child's behavior after he or she eats
food with the additive (the "challenge" phase) and after he or she eats
food without the additive. If the additive and disruptive behaviors are
linked, the behavior should be present during the challenge phase and
absent during the other phase. We now examine the major techniques of
clinical research. They vary in their adherence to the scientific
method.

Epidemiological and Other Forms of Research In the field of abnormal and
clinical psychology, investigators may employ experimental,
correlational, case-study, or field-observation strategies in their
research. The following strategies are important sources of information
about disorders and their treatment. • Survey Research Collecting data
from all or part of a population to assess the relative prevalence,
distribution, and interrelationships of naturally occurring phenomena. •
Longitudinal Research Observing and evaluating people's behaviors over a
long period of time so that the course of a disorder or the effects of
some factor such as a prevention program can be assessed over time. •
Historical Research Reconstructing the past by reviewing and evaluating
evidence available from historical documents. • Twin Studies Focusing on
twins as a population of interest because twins are genetically similar.
Twin studies are often used to evaluate the influence of heredity and
environment. • Treatment Outcome Studies Evaluating the effectiveness of
treatment in alleviating mental disorders. Outcome is concerned with
answering the question of whether treatment is effective. • Treatment
Process Studies Analyzing how therapist, client, or situational factors
influence one another during the course of treatment. Process research
focuses on how or why treatment is effective. • Program Evaluation
Analyzing the effectiveness of an intervention or prevention program.

epidemiological research

the study of the rate and distribution of mental disorders in a
population

The reliance on experimental, correlational, and single-participant
methods varies with the research strategy. For instance, survey
researchers often collect data and then correlate certain variables,
such as social class and adjustment, to discover whether they are
related. Researchers may also combine elements of different methods in
their research. For example, an investigator conducting treatment
outcome studies may use both surveys and longitudinal studies. Surveys
are frequently used in epidemiological research, which examines the rate
and distribution of mental disorders in a population. This important
type of research is used to determine the extent of mental disturbance
found in a targeted population and the factors that influence the rate
of mental disturbance. Two terms, prevalence and incidence, are used to
describe the rates. As noted in Chapter 1, the prevalence rate tells us
the percentage of individuals in a targeted population who have a
particular disorder during a specific period of time. For example, we
might be interested in how many older adults had a spider phobia during
the previous six months (six-month prevalence rate), during the previous
year (one-year prevalence rate), or at any time during their lives
(lifetime prevalence rate). In general, shorter time periods have lower
prevalence rates. When we compare the prevalence rate of disorders cited
in studies, it is important to identify the specified time periods.
Determining the prevalence rate is vital for planning treatment services
because mental health workers need to know the percentage of people who
are likely to be afflicted with disorders. The incidence rate tells us
onset or occurrence---the number of new cases of a disorder that appear
in an identified population within a specified time period.

Ethical Issues in Research

The incidence rate is likely to be lower than the prevalence rate
because incidence involves only new cases, whereas prevalence includes
new and existing cases during the specified time period. Incidence rates
are important for examining hypotheses about the causes or origins of a
disorder. For example, if we find that new cases of a disorder are more
likely to appear in a population exposed to a particular stressor
compared with another population not exposed to the stressor, we can
hypothesize that the stress caused the disorder. Epidemiological
research, then, is important not only in describing the distribution of
disorders but also in analyzing the possible factors that contribute to
disorders.

Ethical Issues in Research Although research is primarily a scientific
endeavor, it also raises ethical issues. Consider the following
examples: 1. To study the effects of a new drug in treating
schizophrenia, a researcher needs an experimental group that receives
the drug treatment and a control group that receives no treatment. Is it
ethical to withhold treatment from a control group of individuals with
schizophrenia in order to test the effectiveness of the drug? 2. To
study the ways in which depressed individuals respond to negative
feedback, an investigator deceives people suffering from depression into
believing they performed poorly on a task. Is the deception ethical? 3.
A researcher is interested in developing a new assessment tool to
uncover personal conflicts. The assessment tool asks people to disclose
information about their sexual conduct and private thoughts and
feelings---information that may cause embarrassment and discomfort. Does
the assessment measure invade the participants' privacy? 4. A researcher
hypothesizes that people with alcoholism cannot stop drinking after
having one alcoholic drink. He arranges for patients with this disorder
to have one drink and then examines how strongly they are motivated to
have additional drinks. Is it unethical and detrimental for these
patients to be given alcohol as a part of an experiment? 5. An
investigator believes that people who are exposed to inescapable stress
are likely to develop feelings of helplessness and depression. Because
the investigator does not want to subject human beings to inescapable
stress, the experiment is conducted with dogs, which are given painful
and inescapable electric shocks. Is it ethical to cause pain to animals
as part of a study? These examples raise a number of ethical concerns
about how research is conducted and whether it has, or should have,
limits. How can the rights of human beings (or animals) be protected
without impeding valuable experimentation? There is no question that to
understand psychopathology and to devise effective treatment and
prevention, experimenters occasionally may have to devise investigations
that cause pain and involve deception. To study human behavior, pain may
be inflicted (for example, surgical implants may cause pain, or shocks
may be used to induce stress), and deception is sometimes necessary to
conceal the true nature of a study. The research must be consistent with
certain principles of conduct, however, and must be designed to protect
participants, as well as to enable researchers to contribute to the
long-term welfare of human beings (and other animals). The American
Psychological Association (APA, 2002) has adopted the principle that the
prospective scientific, applied, or educational value of proposed
research must outweigh the risk or discomfort to research participants.
APA guidelines state that participants should be fully informed of the
procedures and risks involved in the research and should give their
consent to participate. Researchers may use deception only when
alternative means are not possible, and they should provide participants
with a sufficient explanation of the study as soon as possible.
Participants should be free to withdraw from a study at any time.
Furthermore, all participants must be treated with dignity, and research
procedures must minimize pain, discomfort,

TREATING ANIMALS ETHICALLY The center and right cats have been cloned to
glow red when exposed to ultraviolet rays. Scientists believe that this
achievement could help understand and lead to cures for human genetic
diseases. Cloning raises additional ethical concerns. The APA's ethical
standards require that animals be treated "humanely" and that any
procedure that subjects them to stress or pain be carefully evaluated.
However, should we also determine whether the research can be
"justiﬁed"? And how do these standards apply to technological advances
such as cloning?

embarrassment, and so on. If undesirable consequences to participants
are found, the researcher has the responsibility to detect the extent of
these consequences and to remedy them. Finally, unless otherwise agreed
on in advance, information obtained from participants is confidential.
The American Psychological Association (1993) has also published
guidelines for those working with culturally diverse populations. The
guidelines indicate the need for researchers to (1) consider the impact
of sociopolitical factors, (2) become aware of how their own cultural
backgrounds might affect their perceptions, and (3) consider the
validity of instruments used in research in a cross-cultural context.

I M P L I C AT I O N S

Research has contributed greatly to our knowledge of mental disorders.
However, the quality of the research design influences the degree of
faith that we can have regarding the finding. It is difficult to call
clinical psychology a science when so many theoretical orientations
(over four hundred) offer differing etiologies for disorders. How can
all of these be accurate? Most theories have not been evaluated, and yet
adherents attest to the validity of their views. The number of new,
independent, and competing theories is representative of a young
science. However, the field has evolved and appears ready to move to the
next step---to strengthen the scientific foundations of clinical
psychology (Melchert, 2007). In general, the scientific method, with its
emphasis on observations, data collection, and evaluation, provides a
means by which studies can be developed that will lead to reliable and
valid conclusions. This framework is necessary if we are to move beyond
speculating about phenomena. An important but not fully accepted means
of evaluating therapies has been to identify empirically supported
therapies, which use a randomized control design to demonstrate
effectiveness. There is increasing evidence supporting the efficacy of
certain forms of therapy for specific mental disorders. Difficulties
exist in investigating disorders even when the scientific method is
used. Part of the problem has been the attempt to consider only a
specific etiological perspective when researching a disorder. In this
book, we present evidence regarding the contributions of biological,
psychological, social, and sociocultural factors in the development of
specific mental disorders. Most of the research done within each of
these perspectives disregard possible contributions from the other
areas. As we noted in our beginning case study of Nayda, problems can
occur when we adopt "theoretical blinders" and focus on a disorder from
only one perspective, be it biological, psychological, social, or
sociocultural. Recognizing that humans are

Ethical Issues in Research

115

biological, psychological, social, and cultural beings, we use the
multipath model in discussing psychopathology and remind the reader of
the importance of considering these aspects. There is a movement to
combine some of these contributing factors, such as the research by Fox
and colleagues (2005), who identified the contributions of
gene-environment interactions to behavior inhibition. We discuss this
study in greater detail in the next chapter. The scientific method, in
which a dispassionate observer makes observations and collects and
evaluates data regarding a phenomenon, may also have shortcomings. It is
becoming clear that personal biases of a researcher, either conscious or
unconscious, can influence the outcome, as illustrated by the research
on researchers' allegiances presented in the "Critical Thinking" box in
this chapter and the pressure brought by funding sources. Silverstein,
Auerbach, and Levant (2006) reject the notion that there is an
"objective reality" that can be studied without bias. Because they
believe that objectivity and neutrality are impossible, they stress the
importance of identifying one's social location, theoretical
orientation, and values in conducting scientific inquiry. Participant or
client characteristics can also affect the results of a study and have
to be considered in research designs. We must not abandon the scientific
framework but acknowledge and build into our investigation safeguards
against possible biases to ensure the reliability and validity of the
studies.

Summary 1. In what ways is the scientific method used to evaluate
psychotherapy? ■ The scientific method is a method of inquiry that pro-

vides for the systematic collection of data, controlled observation, and
the testing of hypotheses. ■ Characteristics such as the potential for
self-correction, the development of hypotheses, the use of operational
definitions, a consideration of reliability and validity, an
acknowledgment of base rates, and the requirement that research findings
be evaluated in terms of their statistical significance enable us to
have greater faith in our findings. 2. How does the use of an
experimental design differ from other ways of investigating phenomena? ■
The experiment is the most powerful research tool we have for
determining and testing cause-and-effect relationships. In its simplest
form, an experiment involves an experimental hypothesis, an independent
variable, and a dependent variable. ■ The investigator manipulates the
independent variable and measures the effect on the dependent variable.
The experimental group is the group subjected to the independent
variable. A control group is employed that is similar in every way to
the experimental group except for the manipulation of the independent
variable. ■ Additional concerns include expectancy effects on the part
of the participants and the investigator and the extent to which an
experiment has internal and external validity. 3. What are correlations,
and how are they used to indicate the degree to which two variables are
related?

■ A correlation is a measure of the degree to which two

variables are related, not what causes the relationship. It is expressed
as a correlation coefficient, a numerical value between ⫺1 and ⫹1,
symbolized by r. Correlational techniques provide less precision,
control, and generality than experiments, and they cannot be taken to
imply cause-and-effect relationships. 4. What are analogue studies, and
when is this type of investigation used? ■ In the study of abnormal
behavior, an analogue study is used to create a situation as close to
real life as possible. It permits the study of phenomena under
controlled conditions when such study might otherwise be ethically,
morally, legally, or practically impossible. The generalizability of the
findings to clinical populations has to be evaluated and cannot be
automatically assumed. 5. What are field studies, and how are they used?
■ The field study relies primarily on naturalistic observations in
real-life situations. As opposed to analogue studies, events are
observed as they naturally occur. However, a field study cannot
determine causality, and it may be difficult to sort out all the
variables involved. 6. What are the various types of single-participant
studies, and how are they used? ■ A case study is an intensive study of
one individual

that relies on clinical data, such as observations, psychological tests,
and historical and biographical information. The case study is
especially appropriate when a phenomenon is so rare that it is
impractical to try to study more than a few instances.

bution of mental disorders in a population. It can also provide insight
into what groups are at risk for mental disturbance and what factors may
influence disturbance.

■ A multiple-baseline study is a second type of single-

participant experimental design in which baselines on two or more
behaviors or the same behavior in two or more settings are obtained
prior to intervention. 7. What are some of the advantages and
shortcomings of the biological approach to understanding abnormal
behavior? ■ Biological research strategies allow us to search for
genetic factors involved in psychological disorders or to identify
biological markers or indicators of a disorder. As with any approach,
consideration of other factors may be minimized because the stress is on
the biological model. 8. What is epidemiological research, and how is it
used to determine the extent of mental disturbance in a targeted
population?

■ There is often confusion between prevalence and inci-

dence rates. Prevalence rates are comprised of new and existing cases
during a specified time period. Incidence rates are comprised of new
cases only. 9. What are some ethical concerns about how research is
conducted, and how can researchers best address these concerns? ■ Like
other tools, the scientific method is subject to misuse and
misunderstanding, both of which can give rise to moral and ethical
concerns. Such concerns have led the American Psychological Association
(APA) to develop guidelines for ethical conduct and to establish ways
for dealing with violations within the mental health professions. The
APA has also published guidelines for those working with culturally
diverse populations.

Anxiety Disorders

E

mily was hiking with her dog when another dog attacked her and bit her
on the wrist. She was terriﬁed. The wound became badly infected and very
painful, requiring medical treatment. On another occasion, her sister,
Marian, was walking in the ﬁelds when three large, growling dogs chased
her. One began tearing at her pant legs. The owner heard the commotion
and intervened before she was physically injured. Marian developed a
fear of dogs, but Emily, who suffered painful injuries, did not. (Mineka
& Zinbarg, 2006, p. 10)

Anxiety, a feeling of uneasiness or apprehension, is a fundamental human
emotion that was recognized as long as five thousand years ago. It is
common to experience anxiety. In fact, many observers regard anxiety as
a basic condition of modern existence. "Reasonable doses" of anxiety act
as a safeguard to keep us from ignoring danger, and anxiety appears to
have an adaptive function, producing bodily reactions that prepare us
for "fight or flight." These physiological responses allow us to cope
with potentially dangerous situations. In some cases, fear or anxiety
can occur even when no danger is present, resulting in an anxiety
disorder. Fear or anxiety symptoms are considered a disorder only when
they interfere with an individual's day-to-day functioning. The terms
anxiety and fear are often used interchangeably, perhaps because they
both produce the same physiological responses. However, anxiety is
anticipatory; the dreaded event or situation has not yet occurred. Fear
is the more intense emotion an individual feels when he or she is
actually faced with a threatening situation. If either fear or anxiety
becomes overwhelming, a panic attack can occur. Panic attacks are
experienced as intense fear accompanied by symptoms such as a pounding
heart, trembling, shortness of breath, or fear of losing control or
dying. Three types of panic attacks are recognized (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a): (1) Situationally bound attacks occur before or
during exposure to a feared stimulus. (2) Situationally predisposed
attacks occur usually, but not always, when encountering the feared
situation. For example, some people who have a fear of driving

may not always have a panic attack when performing this activity. (3)
Unexpected or uncued attacks occur "spontaneously" and without warning.
Panic attacks can occur in individuals with or without anxiety
disorders. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental condition in the
United States and affect about 40 million, or 18.2 percent of, adults in
a given year (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005). It is estimated that
nearly 29 percent of adults living in the United States will be affected
by an anxiety disorder sometime during their lives (Kessler, Chiu, et
al., 2005). The financial cost to the United States of anxiety disorders
is estimated to be over \$42 billion a year, with over half of these
costs due to repeated use of health care facilities (Anxiety Disorders
Association of America \[ADAA\], 2007). Gender and ethnic group
differences have been found regarding anxiety disorders that have not
been fully explained. For example, women have a significantly higher
risk of developing an anxiety disorder, whereas blacks and Hispanics are
at lower risk (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005). Anxiety disorders are
responsible for a great deal of distress and dysfunction and are often
accompanied by comorbid disorders such as depression, substance abuse,
or other anxiety disorders. The strong association between depression
and anxiety disorders suggests that they may involve different
expressions of a common vulnerability (Brown, 2007). Substance abuse
that co-occurs with anxiety disorders may be the result of individuals
attempting to manage their anxiety symptoms by "self-medicating." In
this chapter, we discuss four major groups of anxiety
disorders---phobias, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and
obsessive-compulsive disorder (shown in Table 5.1). Acute stress
disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder, which are also anxiety
disorders, are covered in Chapter 7. In order to give you an
understanding of the combination of predisposing factors that can result
in an anxiety disorder, we begin our discussion with the multipath model
we defined in Chapter 2.

Understanding Anxiety Disorders from a Multipath Perspective In the case
at the beginning of the chapter, Emily was exposed to greater trauma
when she was attacked by a dog, but it was her sister Marian who
developed an anxiety disorder. All of us have faced frightening
situations. What makes some more vulnerable to anxiety disorders than
others? In general, single etiological models, whether biological,
psychological, or sociocultural, are insufficient to explain individual
variations in response to fearful situations. A number of different
factors may play a role in the acquisition of fears or phobias,
including biological factors such as genetically based vulnerabilities
and psychological factors such as personality variables, an individual's
sense of mastery or control, or direct or indirect conditioning
experiences (Mineka & Zinbarg, 2006). In addition, cultural rules and
norms can also influence the expression of anxiety disorders. The
multipath model for anxiety disorders is shown in Figure 5.1. In the
next section we consider the biological underpinnings of anxiety
disorders, including some speculation regarding how genes exert their
influence and how the environment influences the expression of genes.

Biological Dimension Two main biological factors affect anxiety
disorders: brain structure and genetic influences.

Brain Structure The amygdala (a part of the brain involved in the
formation and memory of emotional events) plays a central role in
anxiety disorders. It alerts other brain structures, such as the
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, when a threat is present, triggering
a fear or anxiety response. There are two pathways to the amygdala. One
goes directly from the frightening sensory stimulus to the amygdala in
just a few thousandths of a second. The second and slower path travels
first to the prefrontal cortex, which evaluates the stimulus and can
override the initial fear response. For example, when passengers in an
airplane encounter turbulence, they may initially feel fear. However,
when the pilot gives a reassuring explanation for the turbulence, parts
of the prefrontal cortex reduce anxiety by acting to inhibit fear
responses from the amygdala (Sotres-Bayon, Bush, & LeDoux, 2004). In
some individuals, however, this fear network appears to be overactive,
resulting in the symptoms displayed in anxiety disorders. The use of
neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) scans
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows us to understand the brain
circuitry involved in anxiety disorders and to measure structural
characteristics of the involved brain systems. With neuroimaging, we can
determine which parts of the brain are activated or not activated when
an individual is exposed to a fearful stimulus and compare the brain
activity of people with and without anxiety disorders. Increased
reactivity in the amygdala has been observed in patients with anxiety
disorders when they are exposed to specific emotional stimuli (Stein,
Simmons, Feinstein, & Paulus, 2007). In addition, differences in the
metabolism of certain areas of the brain can be seen in individuals with
anxiety disorders even when fearful stimuli are not present.
Neuroimaging techniques also allow us to observe the effects of both
medication and psychotherapy. Medication appears to "normalize" anxiety
circuits in the brain. Interestingly, psychotherapies also produce
neurobiological changes similar to those seen with medications for
anxiety disorders (Kumari, 2006). The connections between the amygdala
and cortex allow us to speculate about why medications and psychotherapy
may both be effective in treating anxiety disorders: each may operate on
a different level of the brain. Therapy may reduce arousal by
deconditioning fear at the level of the hippocampus while also
strengthening the ability of the prefrontal cortex to inhibit fear
responses from the amygdala. Medication may directly influence or
decrease activity in the amygdala and other brain structures (Gorman et
al., 2000; see Figure 5.2).

Understanding Anxiety Disorders from a Multipath Perspective

Genetic Inﬂuences Genes appear to make a modest contribution to anxiety
disorders. Past studies have attempted to estimate the heritability of
characteristics of anxiety by examining families, siblings, and twins in
an attempt to separate out environmental and genetic contributions.
Currently, researchers are trying to identify specifically how genes
might exert their influence. As you learned in Chapter 2,
neurotransmitters are chemicals that help transmit messages in the
brain. One specific neurotransmitter, serotonin, is implicated in mood
and anxiety disorders. Consequently, a serotonin transporter gene
(5-HTTLPR) has been the focus of attention. Alleles within a gene
influence Prefrontal cortex the expression of a given genetic
characteristic and can be either long or short. Researchers have found
that short alleles in the serotonin transporter gene are Amygdala
associated with (1) a reduction in serotonin activity and (2) increased
fear and Hippocampus anxiety-related behaviors (Pezawas et al., 2005).
This means that individuals with the short allele of this gene show more

psychotherapies also affect brain functioning related to anxiety. Other
investigators (Auerbach et al., 1999) have reported that the DRD4 gene
that binds dopamine, another neurotransmitter, is also involved in
anxiety. For example, two-month-old infants with short alleles of this
gene show more distress during daily routines than do infants with long
alleles. Although this research is promising, it is probable that many
genes and interactions among genes contribute to anxiety. Even then,
these genes would indicate only a predisposition to the development of
anxiety. They do not guarantee that the characteristic will be
expressed; this depends on interactions with other genes and with the
environment (Leonardo & Hen, 2006). In addition, not all researchers
have found the same association between these genes and anxiety (Van
Gestel et al., 2002). Complicating the search for biological causes of
anxiety disorders is the finding that other neurotransmitters, such as
glutamate (GABA), are also involved in the modulation of learning and
extinction of fear in the amygdala. In fact, benzodiazepines, a class of
medications that are effective in treating anxiety disorders, exert
their influence on GABA neurotransmitters present in the amygdala
(Rauch, Shin, & Wright, 2003). Thus the search for biological factors
includes identifying genes and gene interactions, understanding the
relationship of the different brain systems, and determining which
combinations of neurotransmitters are involved in anxiety disorders.

5.2

Biological, Psychological, and Social Interactions Although the genetic
investigations cited previously have yielded important information, they
do not consider the interplay between genetic and environmental
influences. Researchers were initially puzzled by conflicting findings
involved with the short allele of the serotonin transporter genes. For
example, Auerbach et al. (2001) found that infants' fear responses
related to the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR gene were greatly reduced by
the time the infants were twelve months old. Researchers began to wonder
whether environmental factors such as parenting styles might influence
the expression of genes. It is possible that some genetic
predispositions may become "permanently" activated only when an
environment "turns them on." Characteristics such as anxiety and fear
may result from genetic and environmental influences that are encoded by
neural systems in the brain during a critical period of development
(Leonardo & Hen, 2006). Fox and colleagues (2005) wanted to determine
why only some children with the short allele 5-HTTLPR gene were shy. He
hypothesized that parental behaviors may

122

C H A P T E R 5 • ANXIETY DISORDERS

interact with a genetic predisposition and that behavioral inhibition
(for example, shyness in speaking to or approaching an unfamiliar adult
or playing with unfamiliar children) results when parents provide
deficient social support for a child with the short 5-HTTLPR allele. For
example, a mother who is "stressed" may transfer this feeling to a child
or may not provide the support needed to overcome social anxiety. Using
a longitudinal design, 153 children were observed and rated for
characteristics of behavioral inhibition at age fourteen months and
again at seven years. Mothers were assessed in terms of intimacy, social
integration, self-esteem, nurturance, and social assistance provided to
their children. DNA from each child was analyzed, and children were
divided into two groups (those with the long allele and those with the
short allele of the 5-HTTLPR gene). Fox et al. (2005) found that (1)
there was greater evidence of behavioral inhibition for children with
short alleles in families with low levels of social support and that (2)
when there were high levels of social support, children with the short
allele did not display behavioral inhibition. This means that a child
who has a genetic predisposition to be fearful may be exposed to
caregiver behaviors that provoke anxiety or fail to support the child
when anxiety is experienced, thus reinforcing the underlying neural
circuitry associated with anxiety. If, however, the child develops in a
supportive environment that encourages interaction with others, anxious
behaviors will not emerge. As Fox observed, "If you have two short
alleles of this serotonin gene, but your mom is not stressed, you will
be no more shy than your peers as a school age child. . . . But. . . .
If you are raised in a stressful environment, and you inherit the short
form of the gene, there is a higher likelihood that you will be fearful,
anxious or depressed" ("Genes and Stressed-Out Parents Lead to Shy Kids,
2007," p. 1). Gene-environment interaction has received a great deal of
recent attention and shows greater promise than single-model approaches.
However, other variables are also involved. Not all children with the
short allele develop behavioral inhibition, even in stressful family
environments, and some with long alleles are inhibited. There is support
for the view that specific genes or combinations of genes predispose an
individual to developing behavioral characteristics. Individuals without
anxiety disorders with the short allele of the serotonin transporter
5-HTTLPR gene exhibit greater amygdala neuronal activity to fearful
stimuli than do individuals who have the long allele (Pezawas et al.,
2005).

Psychological Dimension Many etiological theories of mental disorders
are psychological in nature and tend to deemphasize either biological or
social influences. Psychoanalytic theorists focus primarily on the
importance of the parent-child relationship in the development of
anxiety disorders. In this respect, anxiety disorders are considered
manifestations of problematic childhood experiences. For example,
psychoanalytic theorists believe that panic symptoms represent problems
with parents or caregivers over issues of separation, autonomy, and
managing anger (Milrod et al., 2007). Cognitive-behavioral theories
emphasize the importance of cognitive processes in the development and
maintenance of anxiety disorders, both because the individual's
attention is overly focused on the threatening stimuli and because
catastrophic or irrational thoughts reinforce the fear and anxiety
(Rinck & Becker, 2006). For example, individuals with social anxiety may
believe they are being scrutinized by others and think "Everyone in the
room is watching me. I know I am going to do something stupid!" A
personality variable, anxiety sensitivity (Reiss & McNally, 1985), may
be a risk factor for the development of anxiety disorders. Individuals
who score high in anxiety sensitivity are fearful of physiological
changes in their bodies and interpret them as signs of danger. This
characteristic may have been learned through watching parents or friends
express fears about physical sensations or witnessing a traumatic event
such as a heart attack (Schmidt, Lerew, & Jackson, 1997). Psychological
variables such as one's sense of control may also be involved in the
development of anxiety disorders. Young monkeys reared in environments
in which they could control access to water and food showed less fear
when exposed

Understanding Anxiety Disorders from a Multipath Perspective

123

to anxiety-provoking situations than did monkeys who did not have this
control. Children raised in a manner such that they develop a sense of
self-control and mastery also appear to be less vulnerable to developing
anxiety disorders (Chorpita & Barlow, 1998). Thus early experiences can
play a role in determining the vulnerability of children and need to be
considered in the cognitive theories.

Social and Sociocultural Dimensions Any etiological theory of anxiety
disorders should consider the impact of social and sociocultural factors
and stresses. Daily environmental stress is a social factor that can
produce anxiety, especially in individuals who have biological or
psychological vulnerabilities. For example, those with lower incomes
have higher rates of anxiety disorders (Kessler, Berglund, et al.,
2005). Living in poverty and in areas of urban blight likely exacerbate
both stress and CHILDREN AND SELF-CONTROL AND MASTERY Children who
develop a sense of control and mastery are less susceptible to anxiety
disorders. In this case, the anxiety. Disasters such as those associated
with child is allowed to choose her dinner from an assortment of healthy
foods and to terrorist attacks, school shootings, and natuserve herself.
Within developmental and appropriate limits, how else can choices ral
disasters such as Hurricane Katrina also and independence be encouraged
in young children? increase the rate of anxiety disorders within the
population (Palmieri, Weathers, Difede, & King, 2007; Weems et al.,
2007). How these stressors are viewed by an individual's social support
network (family, friends, and peers) can either exacerbate or mitigate
anxiety reactions (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine, 2000; Ozer, Best,
Lipsey, & Weiss, 2003). The intactness of a community or the meaning
that it ascribes to stressful events also influences reactions of the
residents. With Hurricane Katrina, anxiety was heightened because people
of color believed that failure of the federal government to respond
adequately was due to race and class bias (Bourne, Watts, Gordon, &
Figueroa-Garcia, 2006). Gender also plays a role in the development of
anxiety disorders. With the exception of obsessive-compulsive disorder,
females are more likely to suffer from anxiety disorders than males. Is
the reason biological, social, or a combination of the two?
Nolen-Hoeksema (2004) argues that women are more likely to be diagnosed
with emotional disorders due to the lack of power and status that they
contend with in society and to chronic stresses associated with poverty,
lack of respect, and limited choices. Women are also more likely to be
exposed to trauma than men; stress hormones produced by these events may
make women more vulnerable to depression and anxiety. Thus
psychological, social, and biological factors interact and result in an
overrepresentation of women with respect to anxiety disorders. Cultural
factors such as acculturation conflicts also contribute to anxiety
disorders among ethnic minorities. Among Native Americans and Asian
American undergraduate students, there is evidence of high levels of
self-reported anxiety (De Coteau, Anderson, & Hope, 2006; Okazaki et
al., 2002). Increased anxiety among some cultural groups may be due to
differing cultural standards in terms of appropriate social
interactions. In other cases, it may be the result of exposure to
discrimination and prejudice. This is especially important to determine
with marginalized groups such as those with disabilities, different
sexual orientations, or of older ages. Culture may also influence how
anxiety is expressed; for example, ataque de nervios---symptoms similar
to a panic attack but also including crying or uncontrollable
shouting---can be found among Latino groups. With the large increase in
the immigrant population, an awareness of cultural manifestations of
anxiety in the different groups is essential.

Phobias The word phobia comes from the Greek word for fear. A phobia is
a strong, persistent, and unwarranted fear of some specific object or
situation. An individual with a phobia often experiences extreme anxiety
or panic when he or she encounters the phobic stimulus. Attempts to
avoid the object or situation notably interfere with the individual's
life. Adults with this disorder realize that their fear is excessive,
although children may not. Most people with phobias also have anxiety,
mood, or substance use disorders (Hofmann, Lehman, & Barlow, 1997).
Phobias are the most common mental disorder in the United States.
Indeed, nearly anything can become the focus of intense fear. There is
even a fear of phobias called phobophobia (see Table 5.2). DSM-IV-TR

social phobias and specific phobias here and cover agoraphobia later in
the chapter.

Social Phobias Case Study In any social situation, I felt fear. I would
be anxious before I even left the house, and it would escalate as I got
closer to a college class, a party, or whatever. When I would walk into
a room full of people, I'd turn red, and it would feel like everybody's
eyes were on me. I was embarrassed to stand off in a corner by myself,
but I couldn't think of anything to say. . . . It was humiliating. . . .
I couldn't wait to get out. (National Institute of Mental Health
\[NIMH\], 2007a, p. 9)

A social phobia is an intense, excessive fear of being scrutinized in
one or more social or performance situations. Some people feel literally
sick with fear when performing activities such as eating in public,
standing in line at a ticket counter, or walking in a mall. Albert Ellis
(1913--2007), the psychologist who developed rational emotive behavior
therapy, reported that as a teenager he would wait until a movie started
before going to a seat because he was fearful about being observed by
other patrons. In social phobia, the person's fear stems from anxiety
that, when in the presence of others, he or she will perform one or more
activities in a way that is embarrassing or humiliating (Bruch, Fallon,
& Heimberg, 2003; Lipsitz, 2006). There is no such fear when the person
engages in any of these activities in private. The most common fears
seen in social phobia involve public speaking and meeting new people
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Table 5.3 shows some of the
fearful thoughts reported by patients with social phobia during social
situations. Individuals with high social anxiety tend to perceive other
people's emotions toward them as negative (Winton, Clark, & Edelmann,
1995), engage in negative self-observation and monitoring, and are alert
to "threat" cues such as signs of disapproval or criticism (Harvey,
Clark, Ehlers, & Rapee, 2000; Mogg, Philippot, & Bradley, 2004). People
with social phobias, like those with other phobias, usually realize that
their behavior and fears are irrational, but this understanding does not
reduce the distress they feel. Social phobias can be divided into three
types: 1. performance---excessive anxiety over activities such as
playing a musical instrument, public speaking, eating in a restaurant,
using public restrooms

more social or performance situations

126

C H A P T E R 5 • ANXIETY DISORDERS

2.  limited interactional---excessive fear only in specific social
    situations, such as going out on a date or interacting with an
    authority figure
3.  generalized---extreme anxiety displayed in most social situations
    About half of the individuals with social phobia have the
    generalized form (Schneier, 2006). In a sample of individuals with
    generalized social phobia, multiple social fears were present,
    including fear of public speaking, of using the toilet away from
    home, of eating or drinking in public, and of writing with someone
    watching (Kessler, Stein, & Berglund, 1998). Social phobias affect
    8.7 percent of adults in a given year. Over 48 percent, however,
    rate the severity of their phobias as "mild" (Kessler, Chiu, et al.,
    2005). Women are twice as likely as men to have this disorder;
    however, more men seek treatment (NIMH, 1999; Kessler, Berglund, et
    al., 2005). Having generalized social phobia appears to affect the
    occupational status of women. They were more likely to be employed
    in noninterpersonally oriented jobs, to be underemployed, and to
    believe that their supervisors would rate them lower in
    dependability (Bruch et al., 2003). Social phobias tend to begin
    during adolescence, and they appear to be more common in families
    who use shame as a method of control and who stress the importance
    of the opinions of others (Bruch & Heimberg, 1994). These are common
    childrearing practices in Asian families, and fear of being
    evaluated by others tends to be more common in Chinese children and
    adolescents than in western comparison groups (Dong, Yang, &
    Ollendick, 1994). Asian American undergraduate students score higher
    on measures of social anxiety but do not differ significantly on
    behavioral indices of social anxiety compared with white
    undergraduate students (Okazaki et al., 2002). And in a study of
    eighty-six American Indian adolescents, self-reports of social
    anxiety were higher than those reported in other adolescent samples
    (West & Newman, 2007). It is also important to note that social
    fears and other anxiety disorders may be expressed differently in
    other cultures. Taijin Kyofusho, for instance, is a culturally
    distinctive phobia found in Japan that is somewhat similar to social
    phobia. However, instead of a fear involving social or performance
    situations, Taijin Kyofusho is a fear of offending or embarrassing
    others, a concept consistent with Japanese cultural

PHOBIAS Coulrophobia is an abnormal or exaggerated fear of clowns,
perhaps due to their never-changing expressions from painted eyes and
smiles. Celebrities reported to have a fear of clowns include Johnny
Depp, P. Diddy, and Carol Burnett. Uma Thurman is reported to have
claustrophobia (fear of enclosed places). What do you believe may cause
these fears?

emphasis on maintaining interpersonal harmony (Okazaki, 1997; Suzuki et
al., 2003). Individuals with this disorder are fearful that their
appearance, facial expression, eye contact, body parts, or body odor are
offensive to others.

Speciﬁc Phobias A specific phobia is an extreme fear of a specific
object (such as snakes) or situation (such as being in an enclosed
place). Exposure to the stimulus nearly always produces intense anxiety
or a panic attack. DSM-IV-TR divides specific phobias into five
types: 1. Animal (such as spiders or snakes) 2. Natural environmental
(such as earthquakes, thunder, water) 3. Blood/injections or injury 4.
Situational (includes fear of traveling in cars, planes, and elevators
or fear of heights, tunnels, and bridges) 5. Other (phobic avoidance of
situations that may lead to choking, vomiting, or contracting an
illness)

PHOBIA ONSET This graph illustrates the average ages at which 370
patients said their phobias began. Animal phobias began during
childhood, whereas the onset of agoraphobia did not occur until the
individuals were in their late twenties. What do you feel accounts for
the differences reported in the age of onset?

Source: Data from Öst (1987, 1992).

The following is a report of a common specific phobia in a
twenty-six-year-old public relations executive:

Case Study If I see a spider in my house, I get out! I start shaking,
and I feel like I'm going to throw up. I get so scared, I have to bolt
across the street to drag my neighbor over to get rid of the spider.
Even after I know it's gone, I obsess for hours. I check between my
sheets 10 times before getting in bed, and I'm so creeped out that I
won't get up and go to the bathroom at night, even if my bladder feels
like it's about to burst. (Kusek, 2001, p. 183)

Specific phobias affect 19.2 million adults, or 8.7 percent, in a Did
You Know? given year in the United States alone and are twice as common
in women as in men (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005; NIMH, 2007a). Fears
or Phobias Reported by Actors The degree to which they interfere with
daily life depends on how Jennifer Aniston---Flying (Aviophobia) easy it
is to avoid the feared object or situation. These phobias Pamela
Anderson---Mirrors (Eisoptrophobia) often begin during childhood. In a
study of 370 patients with phoJohnny Depp---Clowns (Coulrophobia) bias
(Öst, 1987, 1992), retrospective data revealed that animal Uma
Thurman---Enclosed places (Claustrophia) phobias tended to have the
earliest onset (age seven), followed by Sarah Michelle
Geller---Graveyards (Coimetrophobia) blood phobia (age nine), dental
phobia (age twelve), and claustroOrlando Bloom---Pigs phobia (age
twenty). Figure 5.3 illustrates ages at which different Keanu
Reeves---Darkness (Achluophobia) phobias typically begin. Tyra
Banks---Dolphins and whales The most common childhood fears are of
spiders, the dark, Justin Timberlake---Spiders (Arachnophobia) and
snakes frightening movies, and being teased (Muris, Merckelbach, &
(Ophidiophobia) Collaris, 1997). In a sample of 160 primary-school
children, 17.6 percent met the criteria for a specific phobia (Muris &
Merckelbach, 2000). Among adolescents, the most frequently reported fear
was speaking in class, followed by speaking to strangers, heights, and
animals. Most fears did not persist (Poulton et al., 1997). Blood
phobias differ from other phobias because they are associated with a
unique physiological response: fainting in the phobic situation.
Fainting appears to result from an initial increase in autonomic arousal
followed by a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate. Nearly 70
percent of those with blood phobias report a history of fainting in the
feared situation (Antony, Brown, & Barlow, 1997). Many speciﬁc phobia an
extreme fear are severely handicapped by the phobia. They may avoid
medical examinations or of a speciﬁc object (such as snakes) or
situation (such as being in an be unable to care for an injured child or
shop at the meat counter in supermarkets enclosed place) (Hellstrom,
Fellenius, & Öst, 1996).

Etiology of Phobias How do such strong and "irrational" fears develop?
As we indicated at the beginning of the chapter, in most cases,
predisposing conditions produced by genetics, psychological, social, and
sociocultural factors play a role. In this section, we examine the
factors related to the etiology of phobias, as shown in Figure 5.4.

Did You Know? • 3.5 percent of Americans have a severe injection phobia.
• 50 percent who use medications that require self-injections are unable
to perform the injections. • Those with an injection phobia fear pain or
have unrealistic thoughts such as "the needle might break off." Source:
Mohr, Cox, & Merluzzi, 2005

Biological Dimension Some researchers (Muris et al., 2001) believe that
biological factors play a major role in the etiology of phobias. Studies
on male and female twin pairs have supported a moderate contribution
from a common genetic factor for all phobia subtypes (Hettema et al.,
2003; Kendler et al., 2001). Individuals with phobias may have more of
an innate tendency to be anxious and respond more strongly to emotional
stimuli; thus their chances of developing an anxiety disorder are
increased. Neuroimaging studies have found amygdala activation and
overactivity in social phobia and specific phobias. Overactivation of
the amygdala has also been found in nonphobic individuals during
classical conditioning experiments designed to produce fear (Rauch et
al., 2003). These biological vulnerabilities may make an individual more
susceptible to developing an anxiety disorder. A different biological
view of the development of fear reactions is that of preparedness (Ohman
& Mineka, 2001; Poulton et al., 2000; Seligman, 1971). Proponents of
this position argue that fears do not develop randomly. In particular,
they believe that it is easier for human beings to learn fears to which
we are physiologically predisposed, such as fear of heights or fear of
snakes. Such quickly aroused (or "prepared") fears may have been
necessary to the survival of pretechnological humanity. In fact,
evolutionarily prepared fears (for example, fear of fire or deep water)
may occur even without exposure to traumatic conditioning experiences
(Forsyth, Eifert, & Thompson, 1996; Muhlberger et al., 2006). Although
this is a promising area for further research, it is difficult to
believe that most phobias stem from prepared fears. Many simply do not
fit into the prepared-fear model. It would be difficult, for example, to
explain the survival value of social phobias such as fear of using
public restrooms or of eating in public, as well as many of the specific
phobias. In addition, prepared fears appear to have a variable age of
onset and are among the easiest fears to eliminate. Psychological
Dimension Different psychological theories or perspectives have been
developed to explain the development of phobias. Most acknowledge the
influence of biological factors but place the greatest emphasis on
childhood and learning experiences.

Fear or Disgust?

A

re humans' fears of animals such as spiders and rats due to the disgust
evoked rather than to a threat of physical danger? Some researchers
(Davey et al., 1998; de Jong, Vorage, & van den Hout, 2000) point out
that spiders and rats are, in general, harmless. These researchers
attribute the avoidance reaction to an inherent or "prepared" fear of
disease or contamination, not to a threat of physical danger. In an
experiment to determine whether disgust is involved in spider phobia,
Mulkens, de Jong, and Merckelbach (1996) had women with and without
spider phobias indicate their willingness to eat a cookie. An assistant
of the researchers then guided a "medium sized" spider (Tegenaria
Atrica) across the cookie. An associate then removed the spider from the
room. The researchers reasoned that if disgust is a factor, those with a
spider phobia should be more reluctant to eat the "contaminated" cookie.
Results supported

this idea: only 25 percent of women with spider phobia eventually ate
some of the cookie, compared with 70 percent of the control group
participants. In another study, men and women with spider phobia were
found to respond to spiders with a combination of fear and disgust,
although fear appeared to predominate (Tolin et al., 1997). Thorpe and
Salkovskis (1998) also report that individuals with spider phobia
associate the words legs, hairy, creepy, black, and fast with spiders.
Disgust received seventh or eighth place in a list of adjectives used to
describe spiders. For Further Consideration 1. Other insects or animals,
such as cockroaches, maggots, and slugs, also can elicit disgust. Does
the avoidance of spiders and snakes stem from fear, disgust, or both? 2.
How would you design an experiment to test this question?

Psychodynamic perspective According to the psychodynamic viewpoint,
phobias are "expressions of wishes, fears and fantasies that are
unacceptable to the patient" (Barber & Luborsky, 1991). These
unconscious conflicts are displaced (or shifted) from their original
internal source to an external object or situation. The phobia is less
threatening to the person than recognition of the underlying unconscious
impulse. A fear of knives, for example, may represent castration fears
produced by an unresolved Oedipus complex or aggressive conflicts.
People with agoraphobia--- an intense fear of being in public places
where escape or help may not be readily available---may develop their
fear of leaving home because they unconsciously fear that they may act
out unacceptable sexual desires. Therapists in the psychodynamic
tradition believe that the level of phobic fear shows the strength of
the underlying conflict. This formulation, presented by Freud in 1909,
was based on his analysis of a fear of horses displayed by a
five-year-old boy named Hans (Freud, 1909/1959). Freud believed that the
phobia represented a symptomatic or displaced fear arising from the
Oedipus complex. The hypothesized factors involved were the boy's
incestuous attraction to his mother, hostility toward his father because
of the father's sexual privileges, and castration fear (fear of
retribution by his father). Freud became convinced that these elements
were present in the phobic boy. At the age of three, Hans had displayed
an interest in his penis (which he called his "widdler"); he would
examine both animate and inanimate objects for the presence of a penis.
One day as he was fondling himself, his mother threatened to have a
physician cut off his penis (Freud, 1909/1959). Hans enjoyed having his
mother bathe him and especially wanted her to touch his penis. Freud
interpreted these events to suggest that Hans was aware of pleasurable
sensations in his penis and that he knew it could be "cut off" if he did
not behave. Wanting his mother to handle his genitals showed Hans's
increasing sexual interest in her. Hans's fear that horses would bite
him developed after he saw a horse-drawn van overturn. According to
Freud, little Hans's sexual jealousy of his father and the hostility it
aroused produced anxiety. He believed that his father could retaliate by
castrating him. This unconscious threat was so unbearable that the fear
was displaced to the idea that horses "will bite me." Freud concluded
that phobias were adaptive because they prevented the surfacing of
traumatic unconscious conflicts. The psychodynamic formulation has
little research support. According to the psychodynamic perspective, if
the phobia is only a symptom of an underlying unconscious

130

C H A P T E R 5 • ANXIETY DISORDERS

conflict, treatment directed to that symptom---the feared object or
situation---should be ineffective, leaving the patient defenseless and
subject to overwhelming anxiety or leading to the development of a new
symptom. Evidence does not support the view that eliminating the symptom
is ineffective. The psychodynamic perspective does, however, point out
the importance of early experiences to later behavior. Behavioral
perspective Behaviorists have examined four possible processes---
classical conditioning, modeling, negative information, and
cognitions---in their attempt to explain the etiology of phobias. The
specific process by which phobias develop may depend on the class of
fear. Classical conditioning perspective The view that phobias are
conditioned responses is based primarily on psychologist John Watson's
classic conditioning experiment with Little Albert. Watson caused the
infant to develop a fear of white rats by pairing a white rat with a
loud sound (Watson & Rayner, 1920/2000), demonstrating that fears can
result through classical conditioning or association. There is some
evidence that emotional reactions can be conditioned. Before undergoing
chemotherapy for breast cancer, women were given lemon-lime Kool-Aid in
a container with a bright orange lid. After repeated pairings of the
drink and the chemotherapy, the women indicated emotional distress and
nausea when presented with the container (Jacobsen et al., 1995). Many
children with severe phobias report conditioning experiences as the
cause (King, Clowes-Hollins, & Ollendick, 1997; King, Eleonora, &
Ollendick, 1998). Similarly, more adult clients attribute their phobias
to direct (classical) conditioning experiences than to any other factor
(Öst, 1987; Öst & Hugdahl, 1981). Öst and Hugdahl (1981) found that the
phobia most likely to be attributed to direct conditioning experiences
is agoraphobia, followed by claustrophobia and dental phobia. However, a
substantial percentage of surveyed patients report something other than
a direct conditioning experience as the "key" to their phobias. Also,
the classical conditioning perspective does not explain why only some
people exposed to potential conditioning experiences actually develop
phobias. Observational learning perspective Emotional conditioning can
be developed through observational learning. Participants watched a
video of a male involved in a fear conditioning experiment. The video
displayed an uncomfortable shock being delivered to the man's wrist in
response to one stimulus. The observers were told that they would
participate in a similar experiment after viewing the video. When they
were shown the same stimulus that had been associated with the shock,
the participants responded with fear. In the study, MRIs of the
participants were also taken during the conditioning experiment. They
showed activation of the amygdala, acquired through observational
learning (Olsson, Nearing, & Phelps, 2007). Fear responses in children
can result from the observation of fear displayed by a parent or friend
or on television or in the movies. However, the observational learning
perspective seems to share a problem with the classical conditioning
approach: neither, by itself, can explain why only some people develop
phobias after exposure to a vicarious experience. Negative information
perspective To determine the influence of negative
information---information that might cause someone to fear an object or
situation--- on the acquisition of nighttime fears in children,
researchers asked questions such as, "Did you see frightening things on
television about . . . ? " (Muris et al., 2001). The most common fears
included concern with intruders, imaginary creatures, frightening
dreams, animals, and frightening thoughts. Many (73.3 percent) of the
children attributed their fears to negative information acquired largely
from television. However, it is still not clear whether negative
information is sufficient to produce a phobia. Cognitive-behavioral
perspective Why do individuals with spider phobia react with such terror
at the sight of a spider? Some researchers believe cognitive distortions
and catastrophic thoughts may cause such strong fears to develop. For
example, people with spider phobia believe that spiders single them out
for attack and that they will move rapidly and aggressively toward them
(Riskind, Moore, & Bowley, 1995).

Phobias

Others report thoughts that the spider "will attack me" or "will take
revenge" (Mulkens et al., 1996). Similar negative thoughts, such as "I
will be trapped," "I will suffocate," or "I will lose control," have
been reported by individuals with claustrophobia. Removal of such
thoughts results in a dramatic decrease in fear (Shafran, Booth, &
Rachman, 1993). Studies also indicate that a person with a phobia is
more likely to overestimate the odds of an unpleasant event occurring.
Patients with acrophobia (fear of heights) overestimate not only the
probability of falling but also the probability of being injured
(Menzies & Clarke, 1995). Such studies seem to indicate that cognitions
involving catastrophic or distorted thinking may be causal or
contributing factors in phobias.

Treatment of Phobias

SPECIFIC PHOBIAS

The extreme fear of spiders is a speciﬁc

For all anxiety disorders, it is first important to rule out possible
phobia. Is this fear due to a belief that the spider is malevolent and
is planning to attack? medical or physical causes of anxiety symptoms
such as hyper- or hypothyroidism, temporal-lobe epilepsy, asthma,
cardiac arrhythmias, effects of stimulants (for example, excessive
intake of caffeine), or withdrawal from alcohol (Katon, 2006). Specific
and social phobias have been successfully treated by both behavioral
methods and medication. In some studies the two types of treatments have
been combined, although the results from combination have been mixed.
For example, individuals with generalized social phobia were treated
with either cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), fluoxetine, or both CBT
and medication. The results indicated that both treatments were equally
effective and that the combination produced no improvement in outcome
(Davidson et al., 2004). Biochemical Treatments Biochemical treatments
are predicated on the view that anxiety disorders involve
neurobiological abnormalities that can be normalized with medication.
The most commonly identified neurotransmitters thought to be involved in
anxiety reactions are norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. In
general, antidepressants can help reduce not only the extreme fear but
also the depression that often accompanies anxiety disorders. In
treating phobias, a number of medications appear to be effective. For
social phobia, both benzodiazepines (a class of antianxiety medication)
and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown
"preliminary evidence of efficacy," and benzodiazepines have been used
with some success in treating specific phobias, as well (Lader & Bond,
1998). As with most medications, side effects or negative effects can
occur. Benzodiazepines can produce dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and
paradoxical reactions such as increased talkativeness, excessive
movement, and even hostility and rage (Mancuso, Tanzi, & Gabay, 2004).
In addition, symptoms often recur if the patient stops taking the
medications (Sundel & Sundel, 1998).

Did You Know? Possible side effects of SSRIs include: • decrease in
sexual arousal and functioning • weight gain • dry mouth • memory
impairment Source: "Drugs and Talk Therapy" (2004).

Behavioral Treatments Phobias have also been successfully treated with a
variety of behavioral approaches. These approaches include: • Exposure
therapy: gradually introducing the individual to the feared situation or
object until the fear dissipates. • Systematic desensitization: similar
to exposure but with an additional response, such as relaxation, to help
combat anxiety. • Cognitive restructuring: identifying irrational or
anxiety-arousing thoughts associated with the phobia and changing them.
• Modeling therapy: demonstration of another person's successful
interactions with the feared object or situation. Most behavioral
treatments combine several techniques (Lipsitz, 2006). Exposure therapy
In exposure therapy, the patient is gradually introduced to increasingly
difficult encounters with a feared situation. For example, in
agoraphobia,

to increasingly difﬁcult encounters with a feared situation

which involves the fear of leaving the house, the therapist may first
ask the patient only to visualize or imagine the anxiety-evoking
situation. The person would eventually be asked to actually take walks
outside the home with the therapist until the fear has been eliminated.
Exposure therapy has also been used successfully to treat specific
phobias, such as social phobia (Schneier, 2006), speech anxiety (Hofmann
et al., 2004), fear of spiders (Muris, Merckelbach, & de Jong, 1995;
Carlin, Hoffman, & Weghorst, 1997), claustrophobia (Booth & Rachman,
1992), fear of flying (Rothbaum et al., 1996), and fear of heights
(Marshall, 1988). A variant of exposure therapy has been developed for
the treatment of bloodinjection phobia, which is associated with
fainting caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure and slowing of the
heart rate. A procedure known as applied tension (described in the
following case), combined with exposure, has proven effective (Hellstrom
et al., 1996).

Case Study One patient, Mr. A., reported feeling faint when exposed to
any stimuli involving blood, injections, injury, or surgery. Even
hearing an instructor discuss the physiology of the heart caused Mr. A.
to feel sweaty and faint. Mr. A. was taught to recognize the ﬁrst signs
of a drop in blood pressure and then to combat this autonomic response
by tightening (tensing) the muscles of his arms, chest, and legs until
his face felt warm. Mr. A. was then taught to stop the tension for about
ﬁfteen to twenty seconds and then to reapply the tension, repeating the
procedure about ﬁve times. (The rise in blood pressure that follows this
process prevents fainting, and the fear becomes extinguished.) After
going through this process, Mr. A. was able to watch a video of thoracic
surgery, watch blood being drawn, listen to a talk about cardiovascular
disease, and read an anatomy book---stimuli that in the past would have
produced fainting (Anderson, Taylor, & McLean, 1996). This procedure
involving muscle tension is speciﬁc for phobias in which fainting may
occur.

and participant modeling effective in treating certain phobias

Systematic desensitization Systematic desensitization uses muscle
relaxation to reduce the anxiety associated with specific and social
phobias. Wolpe (1958, 1973), who introduced the treatment, first taught
clients a muscle relaxation response. Second, he had them visualize the
feared stimuli (arranged from least to most anxiety provoking) while in
the relaxed state. This was continued until the clients reported little
or no anxiety with the stimuli. This procedure was adapted for Mr. B.,
who had a fear of urinating in restrooms when others were present. He
was trained in muscle relaxation and, while relaxed, learned to urinate
under the following conditions: no one in the bathroom, therapist in the
stall, therapist washing hands, therapist at adjacent urinal, therapist
waiting behind client. These conditions were arranged in ascending
difficulty. The easier items were practiced first until Mr. B's anxiety
was sufficiently reduced. Over a period of seventeen weeks, the anxiety
diminished completely, and the gains were maintained in a follow-up at
seven and one-half months (McCracken & Larkin, 1991). Cognitive
restructuring In cognitive restructuring, unrealistic thoughts are
altered, as they are believed to be responsible for phobias. Individuals
with social phobias, for example, tend to be intensely self-focused and
fearful that others will see them as anxious, incompetent, or weak.
Their own self-criticism is the basis for their phobia (Harvey et al.,
2000; Hofmann, 2000). Cognitive strategies can help "normalize" social
anxiety by encouraging patients to interpret emotional and physical
tension as "normal anxiety" and by helping them redirect their attention
from themselves to others in the social situations. This approach has
been successful in treating individuals with public-speaking phobia, in
which a strong relationship was found between a decrease in self-focus
and a reduction in speech anxiety (Woody, Chambless, & Glass, 1997).
Claustrophobic individuals have also been successfully treated by having
them identify specific beliefs about danger and testing them when they
are in an enclosed chamber (Kamphuis & Telch, 2000; Öst et al., 2001).
Modeling therapy In modeling therapy, the individual with the phobia
observes a model (either in a visual portrayal or in person) in the act
of coping with, or responding appropriately in, the fear-producing
situation. Participant modeling

may also be involved, during which the individual with the phobia will
perform the same responses demonstrated by a model with the phobic
object (Ollendick & King, 1998). Some believe that modeling is a unique
therapeutic approach in its own right, whereas others believe that it is
a type of exposure treatment.

Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia Case Study At age thirty-eight, Eve
Robinson of Oakland was sure she was losing her mind. While driving on
the freeway one evening, she suddenly found she couldn't swallow. In
panic, she pulled over to calm herself and slowly made her way home,
vowing never to use the freeway again. A few months later, Robinson's
heart started pounding as she boarded a plane to return home from her
sister's wedding in Los Angeles. Convinced she was going to die, she
begged a ﬂight attendant to let her off and wrapped her hands around his
neck when he refused. . . . Eve soon hit rock bottom when she found
herself so fearful of having more attacks that she was unable to leave
the house for four months. (Cash, 1998, p. 34)

Panic Disorder Earlier, we defined panic attacks as intense fear
accompanied by symptoms such as a pounding heart, trembling, shortness
of breath, or fear of losing control or dying. According to DSM-IV-TR, a
diagnosis of panic disorder includes recurrent unexpected panic attacks
and at least one month of apprehension over having another attack or
worrying about the consequences of an attack. Individuals with panic
disorder report intense panic attacks, which usually peak in about ten
minutes or less, alternating with periods of somewhat lower anxiety,
during which they may be apprehensive about having another panic attack.
The attacks are especially feared because they often occur unpredictably
and without warning. Panic attacks often begin in late adolescence or
early adulthood (NIMH, 2007a). The twelve-month prevalence rate for
panic disorder is 2.7 percent (Kessler, Chiu, et al., 2005) and is twice
as common in women as in men (NIMH, 2007a). During the attacks, people
report a variety of physical symptoms, such as breathlessness, sweating,
choking, nausea, and heart palpitations. Many go to emergency rooms with
complaints of chest pain (Fleet et al., 2003). Individuals with panic
disorder often have comorbid disorders involving other anxiety
conditions or mood disturbances. One-third to

panic disorder recurrent unexpected panic attacks and at least one month
of apprehension over having another attack or worrying about the
consequences of an attack

134

C H A P T E R 5 • ANXIETY DISORDERS

one-half of individuals diagnosed with a panic disorder also have
agoraphobia, or anxiety about leaving the home, which is caused by fear
of having a panic episode in a public place (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a). Such cases are diagnosed as panic disorder with
agoraphobia. Because agoraphobia rarely exists without panic disorder
(over 95 percent have a current diagnosis or history of panic disorder;
American Psychiatric Association, 2000a), we discuss agoraphobia in this
section. Although panic disorder is diagnosed in only a small percentage
of individuals, panic attacks appear to be fairly common. Among U.S.
college students, one-fourth to one-third reported having had a panic
attack during a one-year period (Asmundson & Norton, 1993; Brown & Cash,
1990). Nearly 45 percent of U.S. college women reported having one or
more panic attacks within the previous year (Whittal, Suchday, &
Goetsch, 1994). Most panic attacks are associated with an identifiable
stimulus. However, in one study, more than 12 percent reported
experiencing unexpected panic attacks (Telch, Lucas, & Nelson, 1989).
Panic attacks are relatively common, so it is reassuring to know that
most people who have them do not develop a panic disorder. THE SCREAM,
BY EDVARD MUNCH The Norwegian painter describes the scene this way: "I
was walking along the road with two friends. The sun set. I felt a touch
of melancholy. Suddenly the sky became a blood red. I stopped, leaned
against a railing, dead tired (my friends looked at me and walked on),
and I looked at the ﬂaming clouds that hung like blood and a sword . . .
over the blue-black fjord and the city. My friends walked on. I stood
there trembling with fright. And I felt a loud unending scream piercing
nature" (cited in Harris, 2004, p. 15).

Agoraphobia Agoraphobia is an intense fear of being in public places
where escape or help may not be readily available. It arises from a fear
that panic-like symptoms will occur and incapacitate the person or cause
him or her to behave in an embarrassing manner, such as fainting, losing
control over bodily functions, or displaying excessive fear in public.
Anxiety over having a panic attack can prevent people from leaving their
homes. Agoraphobia occurs much more frequently in females than in males.
Although this phobia is relatively uncommon (less than 1 percent of U.S.
adults in a given year), 41 percent of those affected rate the symptoms
as serious (Kessler, Chiu, et al., 2005). Individuals who have
agoraphobia may misinterpret and overreact to bodily sensations. In
support of this view, Reiss and colleagues (1986) found that people with
agoraphobia scored high on the Anxiety Sensitivity Inventory (ASI),
which measures the degree to which individuals "fear" their
physiological reactions. Similar results have been obtained for
individuals with panic disorder.

Etiology of Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia

Did You Know?

T

he origin of the word panic is in Greek mythology. Pan was a Greek
demigod who lived in isolated forests. He amused himself by rustling
leaves and making other noises while following travelers who were
traveling at night through the woods. He would continue to frighten them
until they bolted in panic.

agoraphobia an intense fear of being in public places where escape or
help may not be readily available

As with the other disorders we have discussed so far, biological,
psychological, social, and sociocultural factors play a role in the
etiology of panic disorder, as shown in Figure 5.5. Biological Dimension
Higher concordance rates (percentages of relatives sharing the same
disorder) for panic disorder have been found in monozygotic (identical)
twins than in dizygotic (fraternal) twins; the degree of heritability
for agoraphobia and panic disorder due to genetic factors was estimated
to be about 35 percent, which is considered a modest contribution
(Kendler et al., 1992). Research has also been directed at identifying
specific genes, neural structures, and a neurochemical basis for panic
disorder. This is a difficult process because so many possible patterns
exist between these variables. In addition, the fact that panic symptoms
often are accompanied by depression or other anxiety disorders
complicates the search for specific mechanisms involved in panic
disorder. As we mentioned earlier, brain structures such as the amygdala
are involved in anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, and
neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, play an important role in
emotions. Implicated in shyness and anxiety is the serotonin transporter
gene (5-HTTLPR). Similarly, disturbances or abnormalities in a serotonin
receptor gene (5-HT1A) may contribute to panic disorder. Neuroimaging
has revealed that individuals with panic disorder had nearly one-third
fewer serotonin 5-HT1A receptors as compared with healthy controls
(Neumeister et al., 2004). Fewer receptors would result in decreased
levels of serotonin. It is interesting to note that SSRIs, medications
designed to increase levels of serotonin in the brain, are effective in
treating panic disorders, as well as other anxiety disorders.

• Anxiety sensitivity or physiological vigilance • Catastrophic thoughts

Genes may also increase risk for panic disorder by coding a decreased
expression of the serotonin receptors. Although this line of research is
promising, the findings should be considered tentative. Other studies
have reported the reduction of GABA receptors in the hippocampus and
amygdala areas (Roy-Byrne, Craske, & Stein, 2006) as being associated
with anxiety and fear. As you see, determining the biology of panic
disorder is a difficult quest. Psychological Dimension Different
psychological theories regarding the etiology of panic disorder have
been developed. The two major approaches are the psychodynamic and
cognitive-behavioral perspectives, with the latter receiving the most
research support. Psychodynamic perspective The psychodynamic view
stresses the importance of internal conflicts (rather than external
stimuli) in the origin of panic disorder. In this theory, the disorder
is hypothesized to originate in sexual and aggressive impulses that are
seeking expression. When a forbidden impulse threatens to disturb the
ego's integrity, an intense anxiety reaction occurs. Because this
conflict is unconscious, the individual does not know the source of the
anxiety. More recent psychodynamic formulations focus on uncovering the
unconscious determinants of the panic symptoms on issues such as
separation, autonomy, and anger because of problematic parent-child
relationships. In one case, a client with panic disorder reported having
high expectations of herself and was highly critical of her own work.
During therapy, it was discovered that her self-criticism was linked to
her mother's high expectations and criticisms of her. The panic symptoms
were related to unrealistic pressures on herself brought on by anger at
her mother (Milrod et al., 2007). Cognitive behavioral perspective The
cognitive-behavioral model attributes panic attacks to the individual's
interpretation of unpleasant bodily sensations as indicators of an
impending disaster. Cognitions and somatic symptoms can best be viewed
as a positive feedback loop that results in increasingly higher levels
of anxiety. A model for the development of panic disorder and
agoraphobia involved the following pattern (Roy-Byrne, Craske, & Stein,
2006): 1. A physiological change occurs, such as faster breathing or
increased heart rate due to a precipitant (for example, exercise,
excitement, hypervigilance, a stressor). 2. Catastrophic thoughts
develop, such as "Something is wrong," "I'm having a heart attack," or
"I'm going to die."

3.  These thoughts result in increased apprehension and fear and even
    more physiological changes in the body.
4.  A circular pattern develops as the amplified bodily changes now
    result in even more fearful thoughts.
5.  Through classical conditioning, the pairing of changes in internal
    bodily sensations (for example, increases in heart rate,
    respiration, muscle tension) with fear results in interoceptive
    conditioning---that is, the perception of bodily changes can now
    automatically produce fear and lead to panic attacks.
6.  Agoraphobia may develop because the individual becomes fearful of
    leaving the house or entering places where a panic attack may occur.
    Figure 5.6 illustrates this pattern. Some research supports the
    cognitive hypothesis. Anxiety-producing cognitions such as thoughts
    of dying, passing out, or acting foolishly have been found to
    precede or accompany panic attacks (Bakker et al., 2002; Schmidt,
    Lerew, & Trakowski, 1997; Whittal & Goetsch, 1995). Preliminary
    evidence indicates that when there is a reduction in panic-related
    cognitions (as a result of cognitive-behavioral therapy), there is a
    subsequent reduction in panic symptoms (Hoffman et al., 2007).
    Social and Sociocultural Dimensions Many patients with panic
    disorder report a disturbed childhood environment that involved
    separation anxiety, family conflicts, school problems, leaving home,
    or the loss of a loved one (Laraia et al., 1994; Mahoney, 2000;
    Wittchen et al., 1994). Such an environment could create a
    predisposition to developing anxiety reactions Did You Know? and
    subsequently a panic disorder. Individuals who report having panic
    attacks indicate that they faced more major Examples of Catastrophic
    Thoughts in Panic Disorder life changes just before the attacks
    began (Pollard, Pollard, Physical Mental Social & Corn, 1989). Women
    have a higher prevalence rate of panic disorder and report a greater
    amount of respiration"I will die" "I will go crazy" "People will
    think related symptoms (difficulty breathing, feeling faint I'm
    crazy or weird" and smothered) than men do. It is possible that "I

    fluctuations, which may influheart attack" hysterical" laugh at me"

    Sheikh, 2004). try to escape" at me" Culture can also play a role in
    panic disorder. Asian "I will pass out" and Hispanic adolescents
    reported higher anxiety sensitivity than white adolescents but were
    less likely to Source: Hicks et al. (2005). have panic attacks
    (Weems et al., 2002). In India, panic attacks are associated with
    physiological symptoms such as tachycardia and shortness of breath
    more than with thoughts of losing control or of going crazy
    (Neerakal & Srinivasan, 2003).

Treatment of Panic Disorder Both medication and cognitive-behavioral
therapies have been effective in treating panic disorder (Hicks et al.,
2005). With either therapy, it is important to

Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia

give clients information about panic disorders, as they believe they
have a serious physical condition or might die. Biochemical Treatment A
number of different classes of medications have been used successfully
to treat panic disorder. Benzodiazepines have been used; however, they
have proven less effective with panic episodes than with other anxiety
disorders (Roy-Byrne et al., 2006). Panic disorder also has been
successfully treated with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and SSRIs;
the older antidepressants, TCAs, are effective but have more side
effects than the SSRIs (Marcus et al., 2007). It usually takes four to
eight weeks for the medications to become fully effective, and some
patients may initially have more panic attacks than usual during the
first few weeks. Relapse rates after cessation of drug therapy appear to
be quite high, especially among clients who believe that the remission
of symptoms was due to the medication (Biondi et al., 2003). Behavioral
Treatment Cognitive-behavioral treatments, including individual therapy
(Barlow, Gorman, Shear, & Woods, 2000; Otto, Pollack, & Sabatino, 1996)
and group therapy (Penava et al., 1998), have been successful in
treating panic disorder. In fact, research reviews conclude that 80
percent or more of clients achieved and maintained panic-free status
(Fava et al., 1995; Margraf et al., 1993). Cognitivebehavioral treatment
involves extinction of fear associated with both internal bodily
sensations (heart rate, sweating, dizziness, breathlessness, and so
forth) and environmental situations associated with fear, such as being
in crowds or in unfamiliar areas. Catastrophic thoughts are also
identified and changed with corrective information (Hoffman et al.,
2007). In general, cognitive-behavioral treatment for panic disorder
involves the following steps (Hicks et al., 2005; Roy-Byrne et al.,
2006; Taylor et al., 1996): 1. Educating the client about panic disorder
and correcting misconceptions regarding the symptoms. 2. Identifying and
correcting catastrophic thinking (for example, the therapist might
comment, "Maybe you are attributing danger to what is going on in your
body," or "A panic attack will not stop your breathing"). 3. Teaching
the client to self-induce physiological symptoms associated with panic
(using hyperventilation, breathing through a straw, spinning, vigorous
exercise, and so forth) to allow the extinction of panic reactions in
response to bodily cues or sensations. 4. Encouraging the client to face
the symptoms, both within the session and in the outside world, using
such statements as, "Allow your body to have its reactions and let the
reactions pass." 5. Providing coping statements such as "This feeling is
not pleasant, but I can handle it." 6. Teaching the client to identify
the antecedents of the panic: "What stresses are you under?" 7.
Encouraging the use of cognitive strategies to combat the catastrophic
thinking associated with panic attacks.

Myth vs Reality Myth: Because the metabolism rate in certain areas of
the brain associated with anxiety disorders can be "normalized" with
medication, biological explanations and treatments should predominate.
Reality: Psychotherapy is highly effective with anxiety disorders and
may also affect brain metabolism. Medications appear to affect the fear
network at the level of the amygdala, whereas cognitive-behavioral
therapy leads to changes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.

Panic Disorder Treatment: Should We Focus on Internal Control?

I

magine standing in the middle of a busy mall when suddenly your heart
starts to pound, you begin to sweat, and you become nauseated and can
barely breathe. You can't move, and you are completely disoriented. You
feel as though you will either pass out or die. What is happening to
you? What brought on this terrifying experience? Will it happen again?
When you regain composure, you think about what has just happened. If
these panic attacks occur repeatedly, you will probably explore
treatment options. Which techniques will you choose? Consider the
following studies. Abraham Bakker and his colleagues (2002) compared
outcomes of two groups of patients. In one group, the patients were
treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)---a therapy that
encouraged patients to accept personal control over their panic
reactions. In the other group, patients were given antidepressant
medications without psychotherapy. Patients in the CBT group had lower
relapse rates than those treated pharmacologically, and those in the CBT
group learned to view their symptoms and their gains as the result of
their own efforts, not as a matter of luck, therapy, or medication.
Biondi and colleagues (2003) compared medication alone with a
combination of medication and CBT. The CBT strategies used included
sharing information about panic disorders; challenging catastrophic
misinterpretations; considering alternative explanations for bodily
sensations; practicing relaxation strategies; exposing clients to feared
situations; and understanding the implications of having a

panic disorder. Before, during, and at the end of treatment, the
researchers assessed participants' beliefs concerning whether recovery
was due to medication. After the treatment, relapse rate was 78.1
percent for the patients in the medication group compared with 14.3
percent for the CBT group. Long-term outcomes were found to be
signiﬁcantly better for patients who attributed their anxiety and
recovery to internal factors compared with patients who credited their
improvement to medication. Critical among the cognitive training
strategies outlined here, and a common factor in both studies, is the
enhancement of the patients' self-efﬁcacy---learning that both recovery
and the ability to manage anxiety are under their own control. Patients
who believed (or who came to believe) that success was in their own
hands, thus demonstrating an internal locus of control over their bodies
and their disorder, were signiﬁcantly more likely to reduce their
anxiety symptoms than patients who attributed their improvement to
external factors, such as medication. Do you attribute anxiety in your
life to internal factors (for example, "I must be making myself
anxious") or to external elements (for example, "things like this always
happen to me")? Do you believe medications are more likely to help you
control your anxiety, or do you see yourself in control when it comes to
understanding and dealing with anxietyprovoking events? Are there ways
of altering medication practices or rationale that would also foster
internal control over symptoms? Based on these studies, how would you
structure an intervention for panic disorder?

Generalized Anxiety Disorder Case Study I always thought I was just a
worrier. I'd feel keyed up and unable to relax. At times it would come

persistent, high levels of anxiety and excessive worry over many life
circumstances that are present on more days than not for more than six
months

All of us have had concerns or worries that are specific and time
limited. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by
persistent, high levels of anxiety and excessive worry over many life
circumstances that last for more days than not for more than six months.
These concerns are great enough to cause problems in daily life and are
accompanied by physiological responses such as heart palpitations,
muscle tension, restlessness, trembling, sleep difficulties, poor
concentration, and persistent apprehension and nervousness. It is a
condition that develops gradually, beginning in childhood or adolescence
(NIMH, 2007a). Individuals with GAD report higher anxiety levels, are
more sensitive to bodily changes, and exhibit greater physiological
responsiveness than do control participants (Hoehn-Saric et al., 2004).
Over two-thirds of people with GAD have comorbid (co-occurring)
disorders such as depression, substance abuse, or phobia (Stein, 2001).

about 3.1 percent of the adult U.S. population has GAD (Kessler, Chiu,
et al., 2005), and women are twice as likely to receive this diagnosis
as men (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005). Among older adults, GAD is
more common than major depression or severe cognitive impairment
(Wetherell, Gatz, & Craske, 2003). In medical settings around the world,
GAD is the most frequently diagnosed anxiety disorder (Goldberg, 1996;
Stein, 2001). Because cultures differ in their expressions of worry and
anxiety, the cultural context has to be considered when determining
whether the worries are "excessive" (American Psychiatric Association,
2000a).

Etiology of Generalized Anxiety Disorder GAD is the result of biological
factors combined with psychosocial stressors, as shown in Figure 5.7.
Let's take a look at each of the factors that may contribute to the
etiology of GAD. Biological Dimension There appears to be less support
for the role of genetic factors in GAD than in panic disorder. Still,
there appears to be a small but significant heritability factor in GAD
(Brawman-Mintzer et al., 1997; Gorman, 2001; Kendler et al., 1992). Twin
studies indicate a moderate contribution of genetic influence (Ehringer
et al., 2006). Genes may be expressed in terms of abnormalities with the
GABA receptors, other neurotransmitters, and overactivity of the anxiety
circuit in the brain. As mentioned earlier, the prefrontal cortex can
modulate the response of the amygdala to threatening situations. GAD may
involve a disruption in this system. In an MRI investigation, Monk and
colleagues (2006) exposed eighteen adolescents with GAD and fifteen
without GAD to angry faces. Those with GAD showed greater activation of
the prefrontal cortex in response to angry faces. The researchers
hypothesize that the prefrontal cortex may be attempting to regulate the
anxiety aroused by the angry faces. Psychological Dimension
Psychoanalytic and cognitive-behavioral theories have been developed
regarding the etiology of GAD, and recent research has focused on the
relationship between types of worry and GAD. Psychodynamic perspective
The psychodynamic perspective views the worry and anxiety displayed in
GAD as resulting from unacceptable impulses that lie close to
consciousness. The defenses against these impulses are considered poorly
organized and less effective than defenses mounted against other anxiety
disorders. In a

phobia, for example, the conflict between id impulses and the ego is
displaced onto a specific external stimulus that can be controlled
simply through avoidance. But the person with generalized anxiety
disorder has only one defense---to try to repress the impulses. When
that defense weakens, anxiety or panic attacks may occur. This
psychodynamic formulation does not have research support.
Cognitive-behavioral perspectives Cognitive-behavioral therapists
believe that anxiety and worry are caused by dysfunctional thinking and
beliefs. Individuals with GAD have a lower threshold for uncertainty,
which leads to worrying. They have erroneous beliefs regarding worry and
assume that "worry is an effective way to deal with problems" or that it
prevents some type of negative outcome from occurring (Ladouceur et al.,
2000). Beck (1985) believes that anxiety disorders result from a
combination of temperament and negative early learning that have
resulted in dysfunctional mental structures or schemas. Schemas may
involve beliefs such as "I am incompetent" or "The world is dangerous."
The individual interprets events through the filter of the schemas so
that ambiguous or even positive situations are viewed with concern and
apprehension. Newer cognitive approaches built on the work of Beck are
identifying the beliefs that individuals with GAD have about worry
(Riskind, 2005). Wells (2005) developed a theoretical model of GAD. He
believes that the roots of the disorder lie in beliefs regarding worry
that are responsible for the persistent worrying. In the model, there
are two types of worry. Type 1 worry involves positive beliefs regarding
worry, such as its use as a coping strategy. Individuals believe that
worry provides them a means of generating ways of coping with aversive
situations. They do this by constantly generating solutions to "what if"
scenarios. Once individuals believe "all the bases have been covered,"
their worry and anxiety is reduced until another event triggers concern.
Because of the continued stress involved with Type 1 worry, the
individual begins to believe that worry is uncontrollable, harmful, and
dangerous. The Type 2 worry involves worrying about worry, which
contributes to the development of GAD. This worrying about worry leads
to increased anxiety, thus reinforcing the view that worry has negative
effects. The increased anxiety and worry result in the avoidance of
situations and thoughts associated with the worries. This prevents the
individual from determining whether the worry is accurate and maintains
the GAD. This theoretical model has received research support
(McLaughlin, Mennin, & Farach, 2007; Purdon, 1999; Wells & Carter,
2001). Social and Sociocultural Dimensions Stressful conditions such as
poverty, poor housing, prejudice, and discrimination can also contribute
to GAD. The disorder is twice as prevalent among those with low income
(Kessler, Chiu, et al., 2005). It is also seen more frequently in
individuals who are separated, divorced, or widowed and in the
unemployed (Wittchen & Hoyer, 2001). GAD is more common among African
Americans, especially females (Horwath & Weissman, 1997). Traumatic
events can also be contributors to anxiety. According to Silverman and
La Greca (2002), a substantial number of children exposed to trauma
develop an anxiety disorder such as GAD.

Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder Benzodiazepines have been
successful in treating GAD, but because it is a chronic condition,
medication dependence issues are a concern (Nutt, 2001), particularly if
there is a history of substance abuse. Also, there is an increased risk
of falls and hip fractures in the elderly (Gorman, 2001; Wagner et al.,
2004). A newer antianxiety medication, buspirone, is also used to treat
GAD. Unlike the benzodiazepines, it takes at least two weeks to achieve
the antianxiety effect (NIMH, 2007a). Tricyclics and SSRI
antidepressants have been successful in treating GAD and are the
medications of choice, because they do not have the possible dependence
issues involved with the benzodiazepines (Allgulander et al., 2007;
Davidson, 2001; Seidel & Walkup, 2006).

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

Cognitive-behavioral therapy appears to have some success in treating
GAD. It is the only consistently validated treatment for the disorder
(Ballenger et al., 2000). In an evaluation of thirteen controlled
clinical trials, cognitive-behavioral strategies were effective in
treating GAD and were associated with low dropout rates and long-term
improvement (Borkovec & Ruscio, 2001). CBT has also been found to be
effective in treating GAD in older adults (Ayers et al., 2007). Symptom
reduction may be slower with CBT than with medication, but it produces
more enduring results (Zhang et al., 2002). The treatment strategies
generally involve teaching clients to (Dugas & Ladouceur, 2000; Eisen &
Silverman, 1998; Stanley et al., 2003): 1. Identify and modify the
worrisome thoughts 2. Discriminate between worries that are amenable to
problem solving and those that are not 3. Evaluate their beliefs
concerning worry 4. Discuss evidence for and against the distorted
beliefs 5. Decatastrophize worrisome thoughts

n the seventeenth century, obsessions and compulsions were often
described as symptoms of religious melancholy (depression). The unusual
nature of the intrusive thoughts and compulsions associated with
obsessive-compulsive disorder resulted in the disorder being considered
a form of insanity until the 1850s (Berrios, 1989).

6.  Develop self-control skills to monitor and challenge irrational
    thoughts and substitute more positive, coping thoughts
7.  Use muscle relaxation to deal with somatic symptoms Another disorder
    characterized by persistent troublesome thoughts but that also has
    some unique features is obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Case Study Washing my hair would take
about an hour. I would wash the back of my hair, the sides of my hair,
the front of my hair, the very top of my hair. Washing the front of my
forehead, I would scrub it sixty times; it could never be sixty-one. The
arms would start with the shoulders, and I would scrub them to the point
where I was scrubbing so hard on my collarbone and shoulder blades that
it almost felt like the bone was piercing through the skin and touching
the soap. (Strobeck, 2002, p. 79)

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessions
(intrusive, repetitive thoughts or images that produce anxiety) or
compulsions (the need to perform acts or to dwell on thoughts to reduce
anxiety). Although obsessions and compulsions can occur separately, they
frequently occur together. Most individuals with OCD have both
obsessions and behavioral or mental compulsions (Foa & Kozak, 1995;
Freeston & Ladouceur, 1997). Individuals with obsessive-compulsive
disorder often describe the thoughts and actions as not being the types
of thoughts he or she would expect to have and not under voluntary
control. The inability to resist or rid oneself of uncontrollable,
alien, and often unacceptable thoughts or to keep from performing
ritualistic acts over and over again arouses intense anxiety. In
general, these thoughts and impulses are recognized as being
unreasonable, although a minority of individuals with OCD do not
recognize their symptoms as being senseless (Catapano et al., 2001).
Failure to engage in ritual acts often results in mounting anxiety and
tension. As one individual noted, "The reason I do these kinds of
rituals and obsessing is that I have a fear that someone is going to
die. This is not rational thinking to me. I know I can't prevent
somebody from dying by putting 5 ice cubes in a glass instead of 4"
(Jenike, 2001, p. 2122). Individuals with obsessivecompulsive disorder
report that their problem interferes with their work, school, or
homemaking roles and with interpersonal relationships (Koran,
Thienemann, & Davenport, 1996).

OCD may be underdiagnosed. If it is suspected, screening questions such
as these may be useful: "Do you have unpleasant thoughts you can't get
rid of? Do you worry that you might impulsively harm someone? Do you
count things, or check things over and over? Do you worry a lot about
whether you performed religious rituals correctly or have been immoral?
Do you have troubling thoughts about sexual matters? Do you need to have
things arranged symmetrically or in a very exact order? Do you have
trouble discarding things, so that your house is quite cluttered?" (Work
Group on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, 2007, p. 12) Although OCD is a
single diagnostic category, it is composed of distinct subtypes, some of
which show different patterns of genetic inheritance, neural activity,
and response to treatment. The four types identified are (Saxena,
2007): 1. Harm-related, sexual, aggressive, and/or religious obsession

In a given year, about 1 percent of the U.S. adult population has
obsessivecompulsive disorder. Over half report the severity of the
disorder as "serious." Only 15 percent consider it to be "mild"
(Kessler, Chiu, et al., 2005). The disorder is about equally common in
males and females but is less common in African Americans and Mexican
Americans (Zhang & Snowden, 1999). Possibly because of the emotional
distress associated with the symptoms of OCD, many with this disorder
are depressed and may abuse substances. Tics are also common in OCD, and
it is often diagnosed in individuals with Tourette's disorder (Work
Group on ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder, 2007). See Figure 5.8 for some of
the more common obsessions and compulsions.

Obsessions As mentioned earlier, an obsession is an intrusive and
repetitive anxiety-arousing thought or image. The person may realize
that the thought is irrational, but he or she cannot keep it from
arising over and over again. Among a sample of children and adolescents,
the most common obsessions involved dirt or germs, disease and death, or
danger to oneself or loved ones (Swedo et al., 1989). Obsessions common
to adults involve bodily wastes or secretions, dirt or germs, and
environmental contamination (George et al., 1993). To reduce the
discomfort caused by obsessions, individuals use strategies such as
changing their thoughts, focusing on something positive, listening to
music, taking a walk, or reading (Freeston & Ladouceur, 1997). Although
most of us have experienced persistent thoughts---for instance, a song
or tune that keeps running through our minds---obsessions are stronger
and more intrusive. They create great distress and can interfere with
social or occupational activities. Do "normal" people have intrusive,
unacceptable thoughts and impulses? Several studies (Edwards &
Dickerson, 1987; Freeston & Ladouceur, 1993; Ladouceur, Freeston, et
al., 2000) have found that more than 80 percent of normal samples report
the existence of unpleasant intrusive thoughts and impulses. The content
of obsessions reported by obsessive-compulsive patients and by normal
populations overlap considerably. However, obsessive patients reported
that their obsessions lasted longer, were more intense, produced more
discomfort, were more difficult to dismiss, and were uncontrollable
(Morillo, Belloch, & Garcia-Soriano, 2007).

Compulsions A compulsion is the need to perform acts or to dwell on
mental acts repetitively. Distress or anxiety occurs if the behavior is
not performed or if it is not done "correctly." Compulsions are often,
but not always, associated with obsessions. Mild

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

forms include behaviors such as refusing to walk under a ladder or step
on cracks in sidewalks, throwing salt over one's shoulder, and knocking
on wood. The three most common compulsions among a sample of children
and adolescents (Swedo et al., 1989) involved excessive or ritualized
washing, repeating rituals (such as going in and out of a door and
getting up and down from a chair), and checking behaviors (doors and
appliances). Compulsive hoarding---acquiring or failing to discard
useless items---is relatively common among individuals with OCD, and
there is often a belief that the item hoarded may have value or some use
in the future (Luchian, McNally, & Hooley, 2007). One client collected
discarded objects such as soda cans, paper bags, and newspapers, saying
she "may need them sometime." Although movement around her house was
impeded, she could not decide what to throw away (Samuels et al., 2007).
Compulsions are also a common phenomenon in nonclinical populations
(Muris, Merckelbach, & Clavan, 1997). A continuum appears to exist
between "normal" rituals and "pathological" compulsions; in individuals
with obsessive-compulsive disorder, the compulsions are more frequent
and of greater intensity, and they produce more discomfort. In the
severe compulsive state, the behaviors become stereotyped and rigid; if
they are not performed in a certain manner or a specific number of
times, the compulsive individual is flooded with anxiety. Table 5.4
contains additional examples of obsessions and compulsions.

Etiology of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder The causes of
obsessive-compulsive disorder remain speculative. It is further
complicated by the many facets of OCD, suggesting that it may not be a
single disorder with a single cause. In this section we examine the

dimensions of the disorder, shown in Figure 5.9, and discuss whether it
should be considered a single disorder. Biological Dimensions Biological
explanations for obsessive-compulsive behaviors are based on data
relating to brain structure, genetic studies, and biochemical
abnormalities. Neuroimaging has revealed that some people with
obsessive-compulsive disorder show increased metabolic activity in the
frontal lobe of the left hemisphere. Perhaps this area of the brain, the
orbital frontal cortex, is associated with obsessivecompulsive behaviors
(Blier et al., 2000; see also Figure 5.10). Obsessive-compulsive
disorder suggests dysregulation on the orbital frontal-caudate circuit.
The orbital frontal cortex alerts the rest of the brain when something
is wrong. When it is hyperactive, it triggers the feeling that something
is not right. Connections to the caudate nucleus and gyrus (a ridge on
the cerebral cortex) produce an even stronger feeling that something is
"deadly wrong." This message is relayed through the thalamus to the
caudate nuclei, which normally lets only powerful impulses get through.
In OCD, its ability is weakened, and disturbing thoughts leak through
(Saxena et al., 1998). Of special interest is the fact that when these
individuals were given fluoxetine (a medication that increases the
activity level of serotonin), the cerebral blood flow to the frontal
lobes was decreased to values found in individuals without the disorder,
and patients reported a reduction in symptoms (Hoehn-Saric, Pearlson,
Harris, Machlin, & Camargo, 1991). Similar results have also been
reported with the use of cognitivebehavioral therapy (Rauch et al.,
2003). Other researchers believe that OCD should be viewed as comprising
a number of different subgroups rather than as a single disorder
(Chamberlain et al., 2007; Mataix-Cols et al., 2004; Samuels et al.,
2007). Use of MRIs has found that different brain areas are activated by
different OCD symptoms, such as hoarding and washing (Saxena et al.,
2004). Instead of the hypermetabolism in the orbitofrontal cortex, the
caudate nuclei, and the thalamus found in other types of OCD, patients
who hoard showed a pattern of significantly lower activation of the
cingulate cortex (Saxena, 2007). Additional support for the view that
OCD is an etiologically diverse condition is the finding that certain
symptom types show different responses to treatment (Hurley, Saxena,
Rauch, Hoehn-Saric, & Taber, 2002). Behavior therapy seems to be more
effective for clients with aggressive-checking, contamination-cleaning,
and symmetry-ordering symptoms than for those with sexual-religious
obsessions (Mataix-Cols et al., 2002).

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

Medications such as clomipramine, Paxil, Prozac, and Zoloft increase the
amount of available serotonin in the brain, and these medications have
been effective in treating many individuals with OCD. As a result,
researchers have hypothesized that the disorder is the result of a
serotonin deficiency (Greenberg, Altemus, & Murphy, 1997; Perse et al.,
1987; Tollefson et al., 1994). Drugs such as benzodiazepines or
antidepressants that are effective with other anxiety disorders but have
less effect on raising serotonin availability have been less effective
in treating this disorder (Zohar et al., 2007). However, individuals
with the hoarding form of OCD show less response to SSRIs or
cognitive-behavioral therapy than do other people with OCD (Samuels et
al., 2007). Orbital frontal cortex

on OCD. Although traditional psychoanalytic formulations have received
little research support, some individuals with OCD do show an overly
strong sense of guilt over moral issues. Any thought associated with
"immorality" is believed to be the same as committing the act itself.
This leads to compulsions such as washing in an attempt to cleanse
themselves (Steketee & Barlow, 2002). Behavioral and cognitive
perspectives Proponents of the behavioral perspective maintain that
obsessive-compulsive behaviors develop because they reduce anxiety. A
distracting thought or action recurs more often if it reduces anxiety.
For example, many college students may develop mild forms of compulsive
behavior during intense exam periods, such as final examinations. During
this stressful and anxiety-filled time, students may find themselves
engaging in escape activities such as daydreaming, straightening up
their rooms, or eating five or more times a day, all of which serve to
shield them from thoughts of the upcoming tests. If the stress lasts a
long time, a compulsive behavior may develop. Researchers have also
attempted to determine the cognitive factors that lead to severe doubts
associated with compulsive behavior. It seems that patients with OCD do
not trust their own memories and judgment and make futile attempts to
determine whether they actually performed the behavior or performed it
"correctly." The uncertainty leads to the rituals, and doubts may occur
even in the face of unambiguous evidence. An "OC checker may turn the
key in the lock over and over again without

being able to convince himself or herself that the door has in fact been
locked, even though he or she can plainly see that the key is in the
proper position, hear it engaging, and feel the lock snapping" (Dar et
al., 2000, p. 673). Individuals with OCD may have a disconfirmatory
bias---that is, they generate a search for evidence that undermines
their confidence. The person checking the lock may develop thoughts of
all the factors that may have prevented the door from staying locked. It
is uncertain whether the lack of confidence leads to OCD or whether it
is a result of having the disorder. Along with uncertainty, individuals
with obsessive-compulsive disorders show two other cognitive
characteristics: (1) probability bias, or the belief that having a
thought, such as shouting obscenities in church, increases the chance
that the action will occur; (2) morality bias, or the view that having
an immoral thought, such as throwing a child in front of a car, is as
bad as the actual behavior. Research has supported the view that these
are important aspects in OCD and that therapy should address these
cognitive biases (Rassin, Muris, Schmidt, & Merckelbach, 2000). Social
and Sociocultural Dimensions OCD is more common among the young and
among individuals who are divorced, separated, or unemployed (Karno &
Golding, 1991). African Americans and Hispanic Americans are less likely
to receive a diagnosis of OCD than European Americans are (Zhang &
Snowden, 1999). In treating two African American women with OCD,
Williams, Chambless, and Steketee (1998) found that each had believed
that she was the only black person to have this problem (neither had
contact with the other). Their sense of isolation was increased when
they found that the local OCD support group had no black members. Both
declined to join the group. Although both women improved with
cognitive-behavioral therapy, the therapists, who were European
Americans, were concerned about the possible impact of therapist-client
racial match. They stress the need to be sensitive to special issues
involved in therapy with ethnic minorities and point out that African
Americans with OCD have been underrepresented in clinical outcome
studies.

Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder The primary modes of
treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder are either biological or
behavioral in nature. Behavioral therapies have been used successfully
for many years, but treatment with medication has recently received
increased attention. Cultural aspects of treatment must also be
considered. Biological Treatments Because obsessive-compulsive disorder
is classified as an anxiety disorder, it might seem that benzodiazepines
would be an effective treatment. However, these medications are less
effective with OCD symptoms than with other anxiety disorders (Huppert
et al., 2004). For severe cases of OCD, improvement has occurred with a
combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and medication (Bouvard,
Milliery, & Cottraux, 2004). SSRIs are the antidepressants recommended
for the treatment of OCD because they have fewer side effects than older
antidepressants and are equally as effective (American Psychiatric
Association, 2007). However, only 60 to 80 percent of persons with
obsessive-compulsive disorder respond to these medications, and often
the relief is only partial (Pigott & Murphy, 1991; Pigott & Seay, 1997).
Children with OCD appear to be less responsive to treatment with
antidepressants than adults are (Ulloa et al., 2007). In addition, there
is a rapid return of symptoms, and relapse occurs within months of
stopping the medication (Jenike, 2001; Stanley & Turner, 1995). A
substantial minority of Asians and a small number of whites do best with
only 60 percent of the average dose of clomipramine (a tricyclic
antidepressant) because of metabolic differences (Work Group on
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, 2007).

Behavioral Treatments The treatment of choice for obsessive-compulsive
disorder is the combination of exposure and response prevention
(Abramowitz, Foa, & Franklin, 2003; Abramowitz & Larsen, 2007;
Valderhaug, Larsson, & Gotestam, 2007). In treating OCD, exposure
therapy involves continued actual or imagined exposure to a
fear-arousing situation; it can involve immediate presentation of the
most frightening stimuli (flooding) or more gradual exposure. Response
prevention involves not allow-

ing the individual with OCD to perform the compulsive behavior. The
steps in exposure therapy with response prevention generally involve
(Franklin et al., 2000): 1. Education about OCD and the rationale for
exposure and response prevention 2. Development of an exposure hierarchy
(from somewhat fearful to most-feared situations) 3. Exposure to feared
situations until anxiety has diminished 4. Prevention of the performance
of compulsive rituals such as hand washing Riemann (2006) also includes
cognitive restructuring to help clients identify and correct errors in
thinking, such as overestimating the probability of a negative event
(for example, the chances of getting a disease from touching a doorknob)
and catastrophic thinking (for example, thinking that someone will die
if a ritual is not completed a certain number of times). It is becoming
clear that single-model approaches are unable to explain why anxiety
disorders develop in some individuals and not others. As Gabbard (2000)
observed, "one of the greatest risks we face is reductionism . . . with
psychosocial specialists in one camp and neuroscientists in another"
(p. 118). Another approach that may not be useful is attempting to
determine how much nature or nurture contributes to a characteristic. As
Fox and his colleagues (2005) demonstrated in their study on behavior
inhibition (shyness), it is quite possible that some genetic expressions
may be "all or none." That is, the genetic characteristic is activated
only when certain environmental stimuli are present. Without the
stimulus, the gene is not "turned on." We don't know, however, how many
characteristics or traits are expressed in this manner. We must thus
resist the temptation to believe in easy explanations. Every so often
mass media will present research showing that they have found the
"anxiety" gene. Anxiety disorders reflect the interactions of a number
of different genes, brain structures, and neurotransmitters. It is
unlikely that a simple explanation for anxiety disorders will be found.
A multipath model that also considers psychological, social, and
sociocultural dimensions is more likely to fully answer the question of
why some individuals are more prone to developing an anxiety disorder.

I M P L I C AT I O N S

Summary 1. How are biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural
factors involved in the development of anxiety disorders? ■ All of these
factors are involved in anxiety disorders, but the contribution of each
varies from individual to individual and circumstance to circumstance. ■
Biological contributors include an inherited overactive fear circuitry
in the brain and neurotransmitter abnormalities. However, anxiety
disorders may also not develop in vulnerable individuals in a supportive
family or social environment. The impact of stressors can also be
mitigated by personality variables, such as a sense of control and
mastery. ■ Sociocultural factors such as power and status,
discrimination, and poverty may be responsible for the greater number of
women with anxiety disorders. 2. What are phobias, what are their
causes, and how are they treated? ■ Phobias are strong fears that exceed
the demands of the situation. Social phobias are irrational fears about

situations in which the person can be observed by others. Specific
phobias include all the irrational fears that are not classed as social
phobias or agoraphobia. Commonly feared objects include small animals,
heights, and the dark. ■ Biological explanations are based on studies of
the

influence of genetic, biochemical, and neurological factors or on the
idea that humans are prepared to develop certain fears. In the
psychodynamic view, phobias represent unconscious conflicts that are
displaced onto an external object. Behavioral explanations include the
classical conditioning view, in which phobias are based on an
association between an aversive event and a conditioned stimulus;
conditioning through observational learning; the role of thoughts that
are distorted and frightening; and reinforcement for fear behaviors. ■
The most effective treatments for phobias seem to be biochemical
(antidepressants) and behavioral (exposure and flooding, systematic
desensitization, modeling, and graduated exposure).

3.  What are panic disorder and agoraphobia, what are their causes, and
    how are they treated? ■ Panic disorder is marked by episodes of
    extreme anxi-

ety and feelings of impending doom. It is characterized by attacks that
seem to occur "out of the blue." Agoraphobia is an intense fear of being
in public places where escape or help may not be possible; it can keep
people from leaving home because attempts to do so may produce panic
attacks. ■ The causes of panic disorder and agoraphobia include
biological factors (genetic contribution, neural structures, and
neurotransmitters), psychological factors (the psychodynamic view
stresses the importance of internal sexual and aggressive impulses, the
cognitive-behavioral view emphasizes the importance of catastrophic
thoughts regarding bodily sensations), and social and sociocultural
factors (such as a disturbed childhood environment and genderrelated
issues). ■ Treatments for panic disorder and agoraphobia include
biochemical treatments (benzodiazepines and antidepressants) and
behavioral treatments (identification of catastrophic thoughts,
correcting them, and substituting more realistic ones). 4. What is
generalized anxiety disorder, what are its causes, and how is it
treated? ■ Generalized anxiety disorder involves chronically high levels
of anxiety and excessive worry that are present for six months or more.
■ There appears to be less support for the role of genetics in GAD than
in other anxiety disorders, although there are some reports of
abnormalities with the GABA receptors or overactivity of the anxiety
circuitry in the brain. Psychoanalysts believe the disorder is
inefficient because it stems from internal conflicts in the uncon-

scious. Cognitive-behavioral theorists emphasize erroneous beliefs
regarding the purpose of worry or the existence of dysfunctional
schemas. Social and sociocultural factors such as poverty and
discrimination can also contribute to GAD. ■ Drug therapy
(antidepressant medications), behavioral

therapies, and psychodynamic therapies have been used to treat these
disorders. 5. What is obsessive-compulsive disorder, what are its
causes, and how is it treated? ■ Obsessive-compulsive

disorder involves thoughts or actions that are involuntary, intrusive,
repetitive, and uncontrollable. Most persons with obsessive-compulsive
disorder are aware that their distressing behaviors are irrational.

■ Neuroimaging shows increased metabolic activity in

the orbital frontal cortex in those with OCD. Freud believed the
disorder represented the replacement of thoughts of a threatening
conflict with a less threatening behavior or thought. According to the
anxietyreduction hypothesis, obsessions and compulsions develop because
they reduce anxiety. Cognitivebehavioral therapists have focused on
factors such as confirmatory bias, probability bias, and morality bias.
Social and sociocultural dimensions are also important in the etiology
of OCD. It is more common among individuals who are divorced, separated,
or unemployed and occurs less frequently among African Americans and
Hispanic Americans. ■ Some antidepressants have been effective in
treating OCD. However, antianxiety medications are less effective with
this disorder than with other anxiety disorders. The treatment of choice
is a combination of flooding and response prevention, sometimes combined
with cognitive therapy.

Dissociative Disorders and Somatoform Disorders

J

oe Beiger, a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and assistant
high-school athletic director, walked out of his front door one morning
with his two dogs. Minutes later, his very identity was seemingly wiped
from his brain's hard drive. For twenty-ﬁve days, he wandered the
streets of Dallas . . . unable to remember his name, what he did for a
living or where he lived, until ﬁnally a contractor he had been working
with happened to recognize him. (Associated Press, 2007b) A boy of
twelve was referred for investigation of gait disorder. . . . He was
noted to walk with a bizarre staggering gait, which on close inspection
could be seen to be carefully coordinated. . . . Systematic detailed
clinical examination showed no neurological abnormality. . . . Shortly
before the onset of his illness he had moved with his peer group to a
secondary school with high academic expectations of pupils. He had not
been able to achieve these, and the teacher of his favorite subject had
humiliated him by rejecting class work he had done and throwing his
workbook on the ﬂoor. (Leary, 2003, p. 436)

These cases illustrate characteristics found in the dissociative
disorders, mental disorders in which a person's identity, memory, and
consciousness are altered or disrupted, and the somatoform disorders,
which involve physical symptoms or complaints that have no physiological
basis. Both groups of disorders are believed to occur due to an
underlying psychological conflict or need. The symptoms of the
dissociative disorders and the somatoform disorders generally become
known through self-report. Thus the possibility of faking must be
considered. Wadlh El-Hage, charged as a conspirator with Osama bin Laden
in the attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, claimed that
he suffered from a loss of memory. The court-appointed experts voiced
the opinion that he was "faking the symptoms of amnesia" (Weiser, 2000).
Lee Malvo, the Washington, D.C., sniper, claimed to have a dissociative
disorder (Jackson, 2003). In addition to the possibility of faking,
other questions have arisen about several of the dissociative disorders.

ical disorder? What are the causes and treatments of these conditions?

For example, some researchers are concerned about the sudden increases
in reports of dissociative identity disorder and dissociative amnesia.
They believe that counselors and therapists (or their clients) may be
inadvertently "creating" these disorders. Physical complaints from
individuals with somatoform disorders are also difficult to evaluate
when no biological basis seems to exist for the physical symptoms. Yet
the fact remains that in genuine cases of dissociative and somatoform
disorders, the symptoms are produced "involuntarily" or unconsciously.
Affected individuals actually are puzzled by their memory losses and
behavioral changes and suffer from their physical pain or disability.
This situation leads to a paradox: a person does demonstrate memory
disturbance in psychogenic amnesia (amnesia of psychological or
emotional origin), yet that memory still exists somewhere in the brain.
Similarly, a person may "lose" his or her sight in conversion disorder,
yet physiologically the eyes are perfectly capable of seeing. What
exactly happens in these cases?

assess and treat dissociative disorders, based on the belief that these
disorders may be induced by self-hypnosis. Is the trance induced by

The dissociative disorders---dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue,
depersonalization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder (multiple
personality)---are shown in Table 6.1. Each disorder involves some sort
of dissociation, or separation, of a part of the person's consciousness,
memory, or identity. The dissociative disorders are highly publicized
and sensationalized, yet, except for depersonalization disorder, they
have been considered relatively rare. However, as noted earlier, reports
of one of these disorders---dissociative identity disorder---have
increased dramatically. Corresponding to this increase is a complex
legal debate about behaviors about which the individual is amnesic, as
in the following: • A therapist claimed that it was one of her client's
twenty-four personalities who kidnapped and took sexual liberties with
her and that the main personality was not responsible (Haley, 2003). • A
man was charged with the rape of a woman with multiple personalities
when one of the nonconsenting personalities brought up the charge. • A
South Carolina woman with twenty-one personalities going through a
divorce claimed that she had not committed adultery and that she had
tried to stop the responsible personality, "Rosie," from becoming
involved in an extramarital affair. (In South Carolina, adultery is
grounds for barring alimony payments.) Cases such as these raise
questions regarding responsibility in these disorders. Does a diagnosis
of dissociative identity disorder or dissociative amnesia constitute
mitigating circumstances and "diminished capacity"?

Dissociative Amnesia Dissociative amnesia is the partial or total loss
of important personal information, sometimes occurring suddenly after a
stressful or traumatic event. Although amnesia can also be caused by
strokes, substance abuse, or other medical conditions, dissociative
amnesia is the result of psychological factors (Tikhonova et al., 2003).
For example, several individuals listed as missing after the September
11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center had apparently developed
amnesia (Tucker, 2002). An affected individual may be unable to recall
information such as his or her name, address, or names of relatives yet
remember the necessities of daily life---how to read, write, and drive.
Individuals with this disorder often score high on tests measuring

There are five types of dissociative amnesia---localized, selective,
generalized, systematized, and continuous---varying in terms of the
degree and type of memory that is lost. The most common, localized
amnesia, is a failure to recall all the events that happened in a
specific short period, often centered on some highly painful or
disturbing event. The following case is typical of localized amnesia.

Case Study An eighteen-year-old woman who survived a dramatic ﬁre
claimed not to remember it or the death of her child and husband in the
ﬁre. She claimed her relatives were lying about the ﬁre. She became
extremely agitated and emotional several hours later, when her memory
abruptly returned.

Selective amnesia is an inability to remember certain details of an
incident. For example, a man remembered having an automobile accident
but could not recall that his child had died in the crash. Selective
amnesia is often claimed by people accused of violent criminal offenses
(Mendlowicz et al., 2002). Many murderers report that they remember
arguments but do not remember killing anyone. However, according

C H A P T E R 6 • DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS AND SOMATOFORM DISORDERS

to one estimate, about 70 percent of criminals who say they have amnesia
for the crime are feigning (Merryman, 1997). Generalized amnesia is an
inability to remember anything about one's past life. Because of the
complete loss of memory of the individual's entire life, law enforcement
agencies or hospitals often become involved. The following case
illustrates some of the psychological events associated with generalized
amnesia.

Case Study Mr. A, a seventy-four-year-old white man, was brought to the
hospital emergency room after awakening on a park bench not knowing who
or where he was. He reported having no memory of how he got to the park,
nor did he know his name or where he was from (Ballew, Morgan, &
Lippmann, 2003, p. 347). Mr. A was treated with an antianxiety
medication and recovered his memory. His family was contacted, and his
sister reported that Mr. A had disappeared on two other occasions when
under stress.

Systematized amnesia involves the loss of memory for certain categories
of information. Patients may lose the ability to recall all memories of
their families or of a particular person. In one case, shortly after the
sudden death of her only daughter, an elderly woman had no recall of
having had a daughter. Finally, continuous amnesia, the fourth and least
common form of dissociative amnesia, is an inability to recall any
events that have occurred between a specific time in the past and the
present time. The individual remains alert and attentive but forgets
each successive event after it occurs. This cognitive problem may be
transient and is more common in people age fifty and over (Sadovsky,
1998). Cases of dissociative amnesia in which the amnesia comes to light
only after an individual begins to recall a repressed memory have
increased in recent years. These cases are generally believed to involve
exposure to trauma that is so overwhelming or threatening that the
individual represses the event (McNally, 2007). For example, one woman
recovered memories of a teacher molesting her when she was in the sixth
grade twenty years after the event. These memories were uncovered after
years of psychiatric treatment (the teacher was convicted but the case
was later overturned because of the weakness of the evidence; Loftus,
2003). In a sample of psychologists who had experienced childhood abuse,
40 percent reported a period of amnesia regarding some or all of the
abuse. In 56 percent of the cases, the memory returned during therapy
(Feldman-Summers & Pope, 1994). Laney and Loftus (2005) point out the
complexities involved in interpreting reports of repressed memories: •
Many abuse survivors claim that they forgot their abuse for a time, but
this does not necessarily mean that they repressed their memories of it.
• Many abuse survivors do not mention their abuse when initially asked,
but this is not proof of repression. • Memory is malleable. Details can
be distorted, and wholly false memories can be planted. generalized
amnesia a complete loss of memory of the individual's entire life
systematized amnesia the loss of memory for certain categories of
information

an inability to recall any events that have occurred between a speciﬁc
time in the past and the present time

continuous amnesia

• Just because a memory report is detailed, confidently expressed, and
emotional does not mean that it reflects a true experience. False
memories can have these features (p. 823). Similarly, Pezdek,
Blandon-Gitlin, and Gabbay (2006) point out that even implausible
memories can be planted and may be further strengthened by information
provided by parents or therapists. At this point, it is not clear how
many cases of genuine "repressed memory" actually exist, or whether the
phenomenon exists at all. Others argue that disorders such as
dissociative amnesia are culture-bound syndromes---that is, they are not
natural, neuropsychological phenomena but are, instead, socially
constructed entities. Pope and his colleagues (Pope et al., 2006) could
find no fictional or nonfictional portrayals of dissociative amnesia
before 1800 and believe that they are products of modern western
culture.

Dissociative Fugue Dissociative fugue (also called fugue state) is
confusion over personal identity (often involving the partial or
complete assumption of a new identity), accompanied by unexpected travel
away from home. Most cases involve only short periods away from home and
an incomplete change of identity. However, there are exceptions, as
shown in the following case.

Case Study Jane Dee Williams says she remembers nothing before the day
in May 1985 when she was found wandering and disoriented in an Aurora,
Colorado, shopping mall, wearing a green coat and carrying a Toyota key,
a copy of Watership Down, two green pens, and a notebook---but having no
clue as to who she was. She went to Aurora police for help and ended up
at the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Fort Logan with a diagnosis
of psychogenic fugue. She was treated and released without recovering
her memory. During the next twelve years, she remained amnesic but
started a new life, marrying and giving birth to two sets of twins. In
1997, a tip to the police from someone who recognized Williams from
photographs led to her discovery. Jane Dee Williams was actually Jody
Roberts, who had disappeared from her home and job as a reporter in
Tacoma, Washington. She still has no memory of her biological family.
(Merryman, 1997, A8)

As with dissociative amnesia, recovery from a fugue state is often
abrupt and complete, although the gradual return of bits of information
may also occur. Kopelman (2002) believes that genuine cases are short
lived. "Fugue states usually last only a few hours or days, if
prolonged, suspicion of simulation must always arise" (p. 2171).
However, some fugue states may last for months (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a).

DISSOCIATIVE FUGUE Jeff Ingram was on his way to visit a terminally ill
friend in Alberta and woke up four days later in Denver without any
memory of his life. He was without his car or any personal
identiﬁcation. Although most people with dissociative fugue recover
their memories within a short period of time, Jeff has not. He now wears
a necklace jump drive and bracelet that contains his personal
information. What psychological processes produce dissociative fugue?

Depersonalization Disorder Depersonalization disorder is perhaps the
most common dissociative disorder. It is characterized by feelings of
unreality concerning the self and the environment. Questions such as
"Have you ever had the feeling recently that things around you were
unreal?" or "Have you yourself felt unreal, that you were not a person,
not living in the real world?" are used to screen for this disorder
(Lambert et al., 2001). One woman described her symptoms this way: "It
is as if the real me is taken out and put on a shelf and stored
somewhere inside of me. Whatever makes me me is not there" (Simeon et
al., 1997, p. 1110). Episodes of depersonalization can be fairly
intense, and they can produce great anxiety because those who suffer
from them consider them unnatural, as the following case illustrates.

Case Study A twenty-year-old college student became alarmed when she
suddenly perceived subtle changes in her appearance. The reﬂection she
saw in mirrors did not seem to be hers. She became even more disturbed
when her room, her friends, and the campus also seemed to take on a
slightly distorted appearance. The world around her felt unreal and was
no longer predictable. During the day before the sudden appearance of
the symptoms, she had been greatly distressed by the low grades she
received on several important exams. When she ﬁnally sought help at the
university clinic, she expressed concern that she was going insane.

A diagnosis of depersonalization disorder is given only when the
feelings of unreality and detachment cause major impairment in social or
occupational functioning. At one time or another, nearly half of adults
have experienced brief symptoms typical of depersonalization disorder,
usually following severe stress. The disorder may be either short lived
or chronic in nature, depending on individual circumstances (American
Psychiatric Association, 2000a). The condition is often accompanied by
mood and anxiety disorders (Simeon et al., 2000).

C H A P T E R 6 • DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS AND SOMATOFORM DISORDERS

DEPERSONALIZATION DISORDER An individual may feel like an
automaton---mechanical and robotlike---when suffering from
depersonalization disorder. This painting, "The Subway" (ca. 1950), by
George Tooker, captures this feeling.

Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple-Personality Disorder)
Dissociative identity disorder (DID), formerly known as
multiple-personality disorder, is a dramatic condition in which two or
more relatively independent personalities appear to exist in one person.
The relationships among the personalities are often complex. Only one
personality is evident at any one time, and the alternation of
personalities usually produces periods of amnesia in the personality
that has been displaced. However, one or several personalities may be
aware of the existence of the others. The personalities usually differ
from one another and sometimes are direct opposites, as the following
case illustrates.

Case Study "Little Judy" is a young child who laughs and giggles.
"Gravelly Voice" is a man who speaks with a raspy voice. The "one who
walks in darkness" is blind and trips over furniture. "Big Judy" is
articulate, competent, and funny. These are four of the forty-four
personalities that exist within Judy Castelli. She was initially
diagnosed with schizophrenia but later told that dissociative identity
disorder was the appropriate diagnosis. She has become a lay expert on
mental health issues, a singer, a musician, an inventor, and an artist
whose work appeared on the February 2000 cover of the American
Psychological Association Monitor. (Woliver, 2000)

dissociative identity disorder (DID) a condition in which two

or more relatively independent personalities appear to exist in one
person; also known as multiplepersonality disorder

The characteristics of this disorder have changed over time. Goff and
Simms (1993) compared case reports from between the years 1800 and 1965
with those from the 1980s. The earlier cases involved fewer
personalities (three versus twelve), a later age of onset of first
dissociation (age twenty as opposed to age eleven in the 1980s), a
greater proportion of males, and a much lower prevalence of child abuse
(see Figure 6.1). Similarly, Pope and colleagues (2006) tracked
publications related to dissociative disorder and dissociative amnesia
over a twenty-year period. The number of publications was low in the
1980s, rose to a sharp peak in the mid-1990s, then declined sharply by
2003. No other disorder showed this bubble phenomenon.

155

Did You Know?

I

ndividuals with DID often claim that information about events happening
to one personality is unavailable to other personalities. Research has
found that learning does transfer between the different personalities
(Huntjens et al., 2006). How is information unconsciously shared between
personalities?

DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER Judy Castelli stands beside her stained
glass artwork. The people in the art have no faces but are connected and
touching each other. She considers her artistic endeavors a creative
outlet for her continuing struggle with multiple personalities.

The researchers concluded that both DID and dissociative amnesia
"enjoyed a brief period of fashion that has now waned . . . these
diagnostic entities presently do not command widespread scientific
acceptance" (p. 19). 90 80 70 60 Percent

Diagnostic Controversy Before the case of Sybil (a patient who appeared
to have sixteen different personalities) became popularized in a movie
and book in the 1970s, there had been fewer than two hundred reported
cases of multiple-personality disorder worldwide. Now thousands of new
cases are reported each year (Milstone, 1997). Foote and colleagues
(2006) believe that the condition is relatively common but often not
recognized and diagnosed. In their assessment of eighty-two admissions
to an innercity outpatient psychiatric clinic, 29 percent met the
criteria for a dissociative disorder, with five patients (6 percent)
receiving a diagnosis of DID, eight patients (10 percent) diagnosed with
dissociative amnesia, four patients (5 percent) having depersonalization
disorder, and seven patients (9 percent) given a diagnosis of
dissociative disorder NOS (not otherwise specified). This latter
category includes disorders in which dissociative symptoms are prominent
but do not meet the criteria for a specific dissociative disorder (for
example, trance states, a belief that one is possessed, and atypical
forms of amnesia). However, other practitioners believe that DID is rare
and that the increase in numbers may be due to clinician bias, the use
of faulty assessment, or the use of therapeutic techniques that increase
the likelihood of a DID diagnosis (Cormier & Thelen, 1998). With the
exception of the Netherlands and Turkey, DID is rarely diagnosed outside
the United States and Canada (Merskey, 1995; Phelps, 2000; Tutkun et
al., 1998). In a study of DID in Switzerland, Modestin (1992) concluded
that it is relatively rare and estimated its prevalence rate to be 0.05
percent to 0.1 percent of patients. He also found that three
psychiatrists accounted for more than 50 percent of the patients given
this diagnosis. Why is it that some psychiatrists or therapists report
treating many patients with dissociative identity disorder, whereas the
majority do not? The psychiatrists who treated "Eve," another well-known
case on which a movie was based, received tens of thousands of referrals
and found only one genuine case of dissociative identity disorder
(Thigpen & Cleckley, 1984). After studying patients with reported
dissociative identity disorder, Merskey (1992) contends that the
"personalities" represent differences in mood, memory, or

He attempted to pull on his penis to prevent the retraction. This
procedure had been effective with a previous episode that occurred when
he was nineteen. An evaluation of his mental state ruled out other
psychiatric diagnoses such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or
schizophrenia (Hallak, Crippa, & Zuardi, 2000). Dibuk ak Suut, a
Malaysian woman, goes into a trancelike state in which she will follow
commands, blurt out offensive phrases, and mimic the actions of people
around her. This happens when she has been suddenly frightened. She
displays profuse sweating and increased heart rate but claims to have no
memory of what she did or said (Osbourne, 2001). The symptoms of the
ﬁrst case ﬁt the description of koro, a culture-bound syndrome listed in
DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a) that has been
reported primarily in Southeast Asia, although cases have also been
reported in West Africa (Dzokoto & Adams, 2005). The symptoms involve an
intense fear that the penis or, in a woman, the labia, nipples, or
breasts are receding into the body. Koro may be related to body
dysmorphic disorder, but it differs in that koro is usually of brief
duration and is responsive to positive reassurances. In the second case,
the woman is displaying symptoms related to latah, a condition found in
Malaysia and many other parts of the world that involves mimicking or
following the instructions or behaviors of others and dissociation or
trancelike states. Other culture-bound disorders may be related to
either somatoform or dissociative disorders: Brain fag Found primarily
in West Africa, this condition affects high school and college students
who experience somatic

symptoms involving a "fatigued" brain, neck or head pain, or blurring of
vision due to difﬁcult course work or classes. Dhat A term used in India
to describe hypochondriacal concerns and severe anxiety over the
discharge of semen. The condition produces feelings of weakness or
exhaustion. Ataque de nervios Commonly found in Hispanics residing in
the United States and Latin America, the symptoms can include "brain
aches," stomach disturbances, anxiety symptoms, and dizziness. Patterns
of symptoms can resemble somatoform, anxiety, dissociative, or
depressive disorders. Pibloktoq Generally found in Inuit communities,
these dissociative-like episodes accompanied by extreme excitement are
sometimes followed by convulsions and coma. The individual may perform
aggressive and dangerous acts and report amnesia after the episode. Zar
A condition found in Middle Eastern or North African societies that
involves the experience of being possessed by a spirit. Individuals in a
dissociative state may engage in bizarre behaviors, including shouting
or hitting their heads against a wall. Culture-bound syndromes are
interesting because they point to the existence of a pattern of symptoms
that are associated primarily with speciﬁc societies or groups. These
"disorders" do not ﬁt easily into the DSM-IV-TR classiﬁcation or into
many of the biological and psychological models for dissociative and
somatoform disorders. What does it mean when disorders are discovered
that do not ﬁt into westerndeveloped classiﬁcation systems? Would we
assume that the etiology and treatment would be similar to those
developed for somatoform and dissociative disorders?

attention and that they are developed by unwitting therapists through
expectation, suggestion, and social reinforcement. Cases of dissociated
states and multiple personalities produced through hypnosis or
suggestion have been reported (Coons, 1988; Ofshe, 1992). Dissociation
experiences such as alterations in memory, thoughts, and perceptions or
a sense of depersonalization (feeling detached or numb) are not uncommon
in the face of stress (Cardena & Weiner, 2004; Freinkel, Koopman, &
Spiegel, 1994). Some clinicians may mistakenly interpret these symptoms
of stress as indicators of dissociative disorders. Whether the increase
in diagnosis of DID is the result of more accurate diagnosis, false
positives, an artifact, or an actual increase in the incidence of the
disorder is still being debated.

Myth vs Reality Myth: Dissociative identity disorder is relatively easy
to diagnose; the category is accepted by most mental health
professionals. Reality: There are no objective measures from which a
diagnosis can be made, and cases involving feigning the disorder have
been reported. Those who question the category raise the possibility
that symptoms of the disorder are inadvertently produced through
suggestion or hypnosis.

Etiology of Dissociative Disorders The possible causes of dissociative
disorders are subject to much conjecture. Because diagnosis depends
heavily on patients' self-reports, as noted, feigning or faking is
always a possibility. Fabricated amnesia, fugue, or DID can be produced
by individuals who "are attempting to flee a situation involving legal,
financial, or personal difficulties, as well as in soldiers who are
attempting to avoid combat or unpleasant military duties" (American
Psychiatric Association, 2000a, p. 525). However, true cases of these
disorders may also result from these types of stressors. Differentiating
between genuine cases of dissociative disorders and faked ones is
difficult. In this section, we consider the multipath dimensions that
contribute to the dissociative disorders (see Figure 6.2). Although two
models---the psychologically based posttraumatic model (PTM) and the
sociocognitive model (SCM)---are currently the most influential
etiological perspectives, neither is sufficient to explain why only some
individuals develop these disorders. It is likely that vulnerabilities
in the biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural dimensions
play a role. Biological Dimension A number of studies using PET scans
and MRIs on individuals diagnosed with DID have found variations in
brain activity when comparing different personalities (Reinders et al.,
2003; Sheehan, Sewall, & Thurber, 2005; Tsai et al., 1999). Switching
between personalities is associated with activation or inhibition of
certain brain regions, particularly the hippocampus (Tsai et al., 1999),
an area involved in memories and hypothesized to be involved in the
generation of dissociative states and amnesia (Teicher et al., 2002).
Differences in temporal lobe activity have also been found among
different personalities within an individual. This is interesting
because temporal lobe seizures sometimes involve altered states of
consciousness (Sheehan et al., 2005). However, these patterns of brain
activity are difficult to interpret because it is unclear what causes
them and what specific role they play, if any. Teicher and colleagues
(2002) believe that permanent structural changes in the brain can occur
as a result of childhood trauma through the chronic activation of a
stress response. This may result in the reduction of the volume of the
hippocampus and amygdala, which, in turn, may hamper the ability of the
brain to encode, store, and retrieve memory, comprehend contradictory
information, and integrate emotional memories (Spiegel, 2006). Vermetten
and colleagues (2006) used an MRI to

158

C H A P T E R 6 • DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS AND SOMATOFORM DISORDERS

compare the hippocampal and amygdalar volumes in fifteen females with
DID, all of whom reported histories of childhood sexual and/or physical
abuse, and compared them with those of twenty-three females without DID.
Hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were 19.2 percent and 31.6 percent
smaller, respectively, in those with DID than in those in the comparison
group. However, decreased brain volume in certain structures is also
found with increasing age and among other psychiatric patients. In the
Vermetten et al. study, the mean age of DID patients was 42.7 years
versus 34.6 for the control group. After controlling for age, only the
amygdalar volume was found to be significantly reduced among the DID
patients (Smeets, Jelicic, & Merkelbach, 2006). Conclusions are
difficult to reach because of the small number of participants involved
in the study, the age differences among control and DID patients, and
the presence of other comorbid psychiatric disorders in the patients
studied. Psychological Dimension The primary psychological explanations
for the dissociative disorders come from psychodynamic theory, although
individual vulnerabilities such as hypnotizability or suggestibility are
also thought to play an important role. Psychodynamic theory views the
dissociative disorders as a result of an individual's use of repression
to block from consciousness unpleasant or traumatic events (Richardson,
1998). When complete repression of these impulses is not possible
because of the intensity of the impulses or poor ego strength,
dissociation or separation of certain mental processes may occur. In
dissociative amnesia and fugue, for example, large parts of the
individual's personal identity are no longer available to conscious
awareness. This process protects the individual from painful memories or
conflicts. The dissociation process is carried to an extreme in
dissociative identity disorder. Here, the splits in mental processes
become so extreme that more or less independent identities are formed,
each with its own unique set of memories (Gleaves, 1996). Following this
line of thinking, the contemporary psychodynamic perspective
conceptualizes dissociative identity disorder as resulting from severe
childhood abuse as illustrated in their posttraumatic model (PTM).
According to Kluft (1987), the four factors necessary for the
development of DID are: 1. Exposure to overwhelming childhood stress,
such as traumatic physical or sexual abuse 2. The capacity to dissociate
3. Encapsulating or walling off the experience 4. Developing different
memory systems If a supportive environment is not available or if the
personality is not resilient, DID results from these factors (Irwin,
1998; also see Figure 6.3). Thus, according to the posttraumatic model,
the split in personality develops because of traumatic early experiences
combined with an inability to escape them. In the case of Sybil, for
example, Sybil was severely abused by her mother. Dr. Wilbur, Sybil's
psychiatrist, speculated that "by dividing into different selves \[which
were\] defenses against an intolerable and dangerous reality, Sybil had
found a \[design\] for survival" (Schreiber, 1973, p. 158). Consistent
with this perspective, most individuals diagnosed with DID do report a
history of physical or sexual abuse during childhood (Boon & Draijer,
1993; Coons, 1994; Foote et al., 2006; Sheehan et al., 2005; Vermetten
et al., 2006). To develop DID, the individual must have the capacity to
dissociate---or separate---certain memories or mental processes in
response to traumatic events. A person's susceptibility to hypnotism may
be a characteristic of the dissociation process, and, in fact, people
who have DID appear to be very susceptible to hypnotic suggestion. Some
researchers believe that pathological dissociation is a result of the
interaction between auto- or self-hypnosis and acute traumatic stress
(Butler et al., 1996). People might escape unpleasant experiences
through self-hypnosis---by entering a hypnotic state. In contrast to
individuals with other psychiatric disorders, females with DID have a
history of trance states and sleepwalking and report more alterations in
consciousness (International Society for the Study of Dissociation,
2005; Scroppo et al., 1998).

Dissociative Disorders

As with most psychodynamic conceptualizations, it is difficult to
formulate and test hypotheses. In addition, the posttraumatic model
presupposes exposure to childhood trauma. In most studies, information
on child abuse is based on patient self-reports, is not independently
corroborated, and involves varying definitions of abuse (Lilienfeld et
al., 1999). Questions have also been raised regarding reports of
memories retrieved from very early ages. Clients with DID have reported
the emergence of alternate personalities at the age of two or earlier
(Dell & Eisenhower, 1990), and in one study, 11 percent reported being
abused prior to age one (Ross et al., 1991). Reports regarding memories
of events at these ages would be highly suspect. Social and
Sociocultural Dimensions An approach that takes both social and
sociocultural factors into consideration is the sociocognitive model
(SCM) of DID, developed by Spanos (1994) and further elaborated by Scott
Lilienfeld and his colleagues (1999). In this perspective, the disorder
is conceptualized as a syndrome that consists of rule-governed and
goal-directed experiences and displays of multiple role enactments that
have been created, legitimized, and maintained by social reinforcement.
Patients with DID synthesize these role enactments by drawing on a wide
variety of sources of information, including the print and broadcast
media, cues provided by therapists, personal experiences, and
observations of individuals who have enacted multiple identities.

According to this model, patients learn about the phenomenon and its
characteristics through the mass media. The behaviors of individuals
with DID become well known and, under the right circumstances, people
can enact these roles. Vulnerable individuals may demonstrate these
behaviors when therapists provide the appropriate cues. The
"personalities" developed through this process are displayed
spontaneously and without conscious deception. Proponents of the SCM
model cite the large increase shown in DID cases after mass media
portrayals of this disorder as support for this perspective. For
example, after the 1973 publication of Sybil (whose subject had sixteen
personalities), the mean number of personalities for those diagnosed
rose from three to twelve (Goff & Simms, 1993). CROSS-CULTURAL FACTORS
AND DISSOCIATION Dissociative trance states can be entered voluntarily
as part of certain cultural or religious practices, as demonstrated by
this Haitian woman during a voodoo ceremony. Can the study of such
phenomena in another culture shed light on the process of dissociation
in western societies?

"Suspect" Techniques Used to Treat Dissociative Identity Disorder

B

ennett Braun, who founded the International Society for the Study of
Dissociation and who trained many therapists to work with dissociative
identity disorder, was brought up on charges by the Illinois Department
of Professional Regulation. A former patient, Patricia Burgess, claimed
that Braun inappropriately used hypnotic drugs, hypnosis, and leather
strap restraints to stimulate "abuse" memories. Under repressed-memory
therapy, Burgess became convinced that she possessed three hundred
personalities, was a high priestess in a satanic cult, ate meatloaf made
of human ﬂesh, and sexually abused her children. Burgess later began to
question her "memories." In November 1997, she won a \$10.6 million
lawsuit, alleging inappropriate treatment and emotional harm (Associated
Press, 1998). Braun lost his license to practice for two years and was
placed on probation for an additional ﬁve years (Bloomberg, 2000).
Another former patient, Elizabeth Gale, also won a \$7 million
settlement against Braun and other staff at the hospital. She became
convinced she was raised as a "breeder" to produce babies who would be
subjected to sexual abuse. She has since sought to reestablish

relationships with family members whom she accused of being part of a
cult (Dardick, 2004). Such lawsuits create a quandary for mental health
practitioners. Many feel intimidated by the threat of legal action if
they attempt to treat adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse,
especially cases involving recovered memories. However, discounting the
memories of patients may represent further victimization. Especially
worrisome is the use of techniques such as hypnosis, trance work, body
memories, or age regression, as they may produce inaccurate "memories"
(Benedict & Donaldson, 1996). For Further Consideration 1. In the case
of "repressed memories," should clients be told that some techniques are
experimental and may produce inaccurate information? 2. Under what
conditions, if any, should a therapist express doubt about information
"remembered" by a client? 3. Given the high prevalence of child sexual
abuse and the indeﬁnite nature of "repressed" memories, how should
clinicians proceed if a client discusses early memories of abuse?

Therapists are also influenced by exposure to mass media regarding DID
and may "unconsciously" encourage reports of DID from clients. This
would be referred to as an iatrogenic disorder---a condition
unintentionally produced by a therapist through mechanisms such as
selective attention, suggestion, reinforcement, and expectations that
are placed on the client. Could some or even most cases of dissociative
identity disorder be iatrogenic? A number of researchers and clinicians
say yes. They believe that many of the "cases" of DID and dissociative
amnesia have unwittingly been produced by therapists, self-help books,
and the mass media (Aldridge-Morris, 1989; Chodoff, 1987; Goff & Simms,
1993; Loftus, Garry, & Feldman, 1994; Merskey, 1995; Ofshe, 1992;
Weissberg, 1993). Clients most sensitive to these influences may have
predisposing characteristics. For example, research findings indicate
that women who report dissociations are also prone to engage in fantasy
(McNally et al., 2000). The authenticity of one well-known case of DID,
Sybil, has been questioned (Borch-Jacobsen, 1997). Herbert Spiegel, a
hypnotist, worked with Sybil and used her to demonstrate hypnotic
phenomena in his classes. He described her as a "Grade 5" or "hypnotic
virtuoso," something found in only 5 percent of the population. Sybil
told Spiegel that her psychiatrist, Cornelia Wilbur, had wanted her to
be "Helen," a name given to a feeling she expressed during therapy.
Spiegel later came to believe that Wilbur was using a technique in which
different memories or emotions were converted into "personalities."
Sybil also wrote a letter denying that she had multiple personalities
and stating that the "extreme things" she told about her mother were not
true. Tapes of sessions between Wilbur and Sybil indicate that Wilbur
may have described personalities for Sybil (Rieber, 2006). Although
iatrogenic influences can be found in any disorder, such effects may be
more common with dissociative disorders, in part because of the high
levels of hypnotizability and suggestibility found in individuals with
these conditions (Simeon et al., 2001). As Goff (1993) states, it is "no
coincidence that the field of \[multiple-personality disorder\] studies
in the United States largely originated among

Dissociative Disorders

161

practitioners of hypnosis" (p. 604). Hypnosis and other memory-retrieval
methods may create rather than uncover personalities in suggestible
clients. Although some cases of DID probably are therapist produced, we
do not know to what extent iatrogenic influences can account for this
disorder. However, the sociocognitive model of DID does offer some
testable hypotheses.

Treatment of Dissociative Disorders A variety of treatments for the
dissociative disorders have been developed, including supportive
counseling and the use of hypnosis and personality reconstruction.
Currently, there are no specific medications for the dissociative
identity disorders. Instead, medications are prescribed to treat
concurrent anxiety or depression. Dissociative Amnesia and Dissociative
Fugue The symptoms of dissociative amnesia and fugue tend to remit, or
abate, spontaneously. Moreover, patients typically complain of
psychological symptoms other than the amnesia, perhaps because the
amnesia interferes only minimally with their day-to-day functioning. It
has been noted that depression is often associated with the fugue state
and that severe stress is often associated with both fugue and
dissociative amnesia (Kopelman, 2002). A reasonable therapeutic approach
is then to treat these dissociative disorders indirectly by alleviating
the depression (with antidepressants or cognitive-behavioral therapy)
and the stress (through stress-management techniques). Depersonalization
Disorder Depersonalization disorder is also subject to spontaneous
remission, but at a much slower rate than seen with dissociative amnesia
and fugue. Treatment generally concentrates on alleviating the feelings
of anxiety or depression or the fear of going insane. Occasionally a
behavioral approach has been tried. For example, behavior therapy was
successfully used to treat depersonalization disorder in a
fifteen-year-old girl who had blackouts that she described as "floating
in and out." These episodes were associated with headaches and feelings
of detachment, but neurological and physical examinations revealed no
biological cause. Treatment involved getting increased attention from
her family and reinforcement from them when the frequency of blackouts
was reduced, training in appropriate responses to stressful situations,
and selfreinforcement (Dollinger, 1983). Dissociative Identity Disorder
The mental health literature contains more information on the treatment
of dissociative identity disorder than on all of the other dissociative
disorders combined. Treatment for this disorder is not always A FAMOUS

with dissociative identity disorder inspired the book and movie The

successful. Chris Sizemore (who was the inspiration for the book and
movie The Three Faces of Eve) developed additional personalities after
therapy but has now recovered. She is a writer, lecturer, and artist.
Sybil also recovered---she became a college art professor and died in
Lexington, Kentucky, in 1998 at the age of seventy-five (Miller &
Kantrowitz, 1999). Success, however, may be difficult to achieve. Coons
(1986) conducted a follow-up study of twenty patients with dissociative
identity disorder. Each patient was studied for about thirty-nine months
after his or her initial assessment. Nine patients achieved partial or
full recovery, but only five patients maintained it---the others
dissociated again. More than one-third were unable to work because of
their disorder. However, a more recent two-year follow-up study of
fifty-four patients with dissociative identity disorder showed more
optimistic results. Most showed improvement, especially those who had
been able to integrate their separate personalities during therapy
(Ellason & Ross, 1997). The major goal in the treatment of dissociative
identity disorder is the fusion and complete integration of all the
individual personalities. In many cases, this cannot be achieved. A
hierarchical treatment approach involves (International Society for the
Study of Dissociation, 2005): 1. Working on safety issues,
stabilization, and the reduction of symptoms 2. Identifying and working
through the traumatic memories underlying the disorder 3. Attempting to
integrate the personalities Hypnosis is often used to attempt the fusion
or integration. With the patient in a hypnotic state, the different
personalities are asked to emerge and introduce themselves to the
patient, to make the patient aware of their existence. Then the
personalities are asked to help the patient recall the traumatic
experiences or memories that originally triggered the development of new
personalities. An important part of this recalling step is to enable the
patient to experience the emotions associated with the traumatic
memories. The therapist then explains to the patient that these
additional personalities developed to serve a purpose but that
alternative coping strategies are available now. The final steps involve
piecing together the events and memories of the personalities,
integrating them, and continuing therapy to help the patient adjust to
the new self.

Somatoform Disorders The somatoform disorders, shown in Table 6.2,
involve complaints of physical symptoms that closely mimic authentic
medical conditions. Although no actual physiological basis exists for
the complaints, the symptoms are not considered voluntary or under
conscious control. The patient believes the symptoms are real and
indications of a physical problem. The somatoform disorders include
somatization disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder,
hypochondriasis, and body dysmorphic disorder. Individuals with
somatoform disorders are also likely to have comorbid disorders such as
mood disorder, personality disorder, and substance use disorder (Noyes
et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2000). The somatoform disorders are a
disparate group, and some researchers have suggested that disorders such
as hypochondriasis and body dysmorphic disorder be moved from this
category and placed under anxiety disorders (Fava, Fabbri, Sirri, &
Wise, 2007; Starcevic, 2006). Kroenke, Sharpe, and Sykes (2007)
recommended classifying hypochondriasis as a "health anxiety disorder"
and body dysmorphic disorder as a variant of obsessive-compulsive
disorder. In addition, patients are often unhappy with a somatoform
diagnosis, feeling that the diagnosis implies that their physical
complaints or suffering is not genuine (Starcevic, 2006). Depending on
the particular primary care setting, 10 to 50 percent of all patients
report physically unexplained symptoms (Arnold et al., 2006; DeWaal et
al., 2004; McCarron, 2006; Rief & Hiller, 2003). However, determining

diagnosis for these individuals is somatoform disorder can be difficult.
As Peveler (1998) points out, "Somatoform disorder diagnoses are still
mostly diagnoses of exclusion, rather than constructs with clinical

classification encourages a mind-body distinction and that is difficult
to determine whether physical complaints regarding symptoms are
"disproportionate" or "not fully explained." In some cases, physical or
neurological factors that explain the symptoms have, in fact, later been
discovered (Alao & Chung, 2007; Moser et al., 1998).

T

he expression of psychological and social distress through physical
symptoms is the norm in many cultures of the world: • Worldwide, the
most common somatoform symptoms are gastrointestinal complaints or
abnormal skin sensations, whereas menstrual pain, abdominal pain, and
chest pain are most common in the United States. • Distinctive cultural
somatoform symptoms include concerns about body odor (Japan), body heat
and coldness (Nigeria), loss of semen while urinating (India), and
kidney weakness (China). Source: From Singh (2007).

Before we discuss the somatoform disorders individually, we should note
that they are wholly different from either malingering---faking a
disorder to achieve some goal, such as an insurance settlement---or the
factitious disorders. Factitious disorders are mental disorders in which
the symptoms of physical or mental illnesses are deliberately induced or
simulated with no apparent incentive. In contrast to both of these
conditions, individuals with somatoform disorders firmly believe that a
physical condition exists.

Somatization Disorder An individual with somatization disorder
chronically complains of bodily symptoms that have no physical basis.
According to DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a), the
following are necessary for a diagnosis of somatization disorder: • A
history of complaints that involve at least four pain symptoms in
different sites, such as the back, head, and extremities • Two
gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea, and bloating • One
sexual symptom, such as sexual indifference, irregular menses, or
erectile dysfunction • One pseudoneurological symptom, such as
conversion symptoms, amnesia, or breathing difficulties If the
individual does not fully meet these criteria but has at least one
physical complaint of six months' duration, he or she would be given a
diagnosis of undifferentiated somatoform disorder. The following case
illustrates several of the characteristics involved in these disorders.

Cheryl was a thirty-eight-year-old separated Italian American woman who
was raising her ten-yearold daughter Melanie without much support. . . .
Cheryl suffered from vertigo and had a history of neck pain and other
vague somatic complaints, as well as a history of several abusive
relationships and unresolved grief about the loss of her mother. . . .
Cheryl and Melanie described in rich detail an elaborate system of cues
that Melanie had learned to respond to by comforting her mother,
providing remedies such as back rubs and hot compresses or taking over
activities such as grocery shopping if her mother felt dizzy in the
store. (McDaniel & Speice, 2001)

In this case, the problem was treated by helping Cheryl and Melanie
identify "nonhelpful behaviors" that may reinforce the symptoms and
those that are useful in adapting to problem situations. Alternate ways
of getting support were also discussed. However, in many cases the
"cause" of the behavior is difficult to determine. Anxiety and
depression and other psychiatric disorders are common complications of
somatization disorder (Allen et al., 2001; Stern, Murphy, & Bass, 1993).
Although somatization disorder is considered a chronic condition, in one
large study, only about one-third of those diagnosed with the disorder
met the criteria twelve months later (Simon & Gureje, 1999). Although
physical complaints are common, the diagnosis of somatization disorder
(or hysteria, as it was formerly called) is relatively rare, with an
overall prevalence rate of up to 2 percent for women and less than 0.2
percent for men (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). The diagnosis
is more prevalent in African Americans and twice as likely among those
with less than a high school education or those of lower socioeconomic
status (Noyes et al., 2006; Swartz et al., 1991).

Conversion Disorder Conversion disorder is one of the more puzzling
disorders. The original name for the disorder, conversion neurosis,
comes from Freud, who believed that an unconscious sexual or aggressive
conflict was "converted" into a physical problem. An individual with
conversion disorder demonstrates physical problems or impairments in
sensory or motor functions controlled by the voluntary nervous
system---such as paralysis, loss of feeling, and deficits in sight or
hearing---suggesting a neurological

Factitious Disorder and Factitious Disorder by Proxy Two remarkable
types of mental disorder are illustrated in the following cases:
Factitious Disorder In a two-year period, four women presented for
HIV-related care, claiming that they were HIV-seropositive. However,
repeated serologic testing revealed no evidence of HIV infection. In all
cases, the women were either quite angry or appeared surprised when told
they did not have HIV infection. A common denominator in all four cases
was a history of prolonged sexual, physical, or emotional abuse. Three
of the four had been to multiple physicians, changing doctors as soon as
the absence of HIV infection was established (Mileno et al., 2001,
p. 263). Factitious Disorder by Proxy (proposed new diagnosis) A hidden
camera at a children's hospital captured the image of a mother
suffocating the baby she had brought in for treatment of breathing
problems. In another case, a child was brought in for treatment of
ulcerations on his back; hospital staff discovered the mother had been
rubbing oven cleaner on his skin. Another "sick" infant had been fed
laxatives for nearly four months (Wartik, 1994). In each of these cases,
no apparent motive was found other than the attention the parent
received from the hospital staff that cared for the child's "illness."

These cases illustrate a group of mental disorders, termed factitious
disorders in DSM-IV-TR, in which people intentionally simulate physical
or mental conditions or voluntarily induce an actual physical condition.
The criteria include (1) intentional production or feigning of physical
or psychological symptoms; (2) that the only apparent motivation for the
behavior is to assume the sick role or to be a patient; and (3) that the
purpose of this behavior is not for external incentives such as economic
gain, avoiding legal responsibilities, and so forth. Another term used
for this disorder is Munchausen syndrome.

This practice differs from malingering, which involves simulating a
disorder to achieve some goal---such as feigning sickness to collect
insurance. The goals in malingering are usually apparent, and the
individual can "turn off" the symptoms whenever they are no longer
useful. In factitious disorders, the purpose of the simulated or induced
illness is much less apparent, complex psychological variables are
assumed to be involved, and the individual is usually unaware of the
motivation for the behaviors. The individual displays a compulsive
quality in the need to simulate illness. Signs of a factitious disorder
may include long unexplained illnesses with multiple surgical or complex
treatments, "remarkable willingness" to undergo painful or dangerous
treatments, tendency to anger if the illness is questioned, and the
involvement of multiple doctors (Flaherty et al., 2001; Gregory &
Jindal, 2006). If an individual deliberately feigns or induces an
illness in another person, the diagnosis is factitious disorder by proxy
(or Munchausen by proxy). In the preceding cases, the mothers produced
symptoms in their children to vicariously assume the sick role. Because
this diagnostic category is somewhat new, little information is
available on prevalence, age of onset, or familial pattern. However,
diagnosis of this condition is difﬁcult. In Seattle, one pediatrician
has been involved in over one hundred purported cases during the past
twenty-ﬁve years, some resulting in children being removed from their
families. One appeals court judge wrote that the pediatrician
"apparently has a penchant for diagnosing Munchausen syndrome by proxy,
notwithstanding its rarity and his questioned qualiﬁcation to make that
diagnosis" (Smith, 2002, p. A10). If factitious disorder by proxy
becomes an ofﬁcial diagnosis, what safeguards should be put in place to
balance protection of the child with the possibility of a false
accusation against the parent?

disorder but with no underlying organic cause (Listernick, 2007).
Although rare, complaints may also include memory loss or "cognitive or
intellectual impairment" that resembles dementia (Liberini et al.,
1993). Individuals with conversion disorder are not consciously faking
symptoms, as are those who have a factitious disorder or who are
malingering. A person with conversion disorder actually believes that
there is a genuine physical problem, and it produces notable distress or
impairment in social or occupational functioning. As discussed in
Chapter 1, it was known earlier as hysteria, and Mesmer was able to
effect cures using hypnosis. Psychological factors are considered
important contributors to conversion disorder, in either the initiation
or exacerbation of the problem, as illustrated in the following cases:

Case Study A forty-four-year-old woman was admitted to a psychiatric
hospital from a neurology ward with "pseudo-seizures" and "functional
hemiplegia" (paralysis of one side of the body). She was
wheelchair-bound. . . . She described a disrupted childhood with a
physically abusive, alcoholic father. She had two stormy and violent
marriages. . . . Although reluctant to accept a psychological

CONVERSION DISORDER Although there is nothing physically wrong with the
eyes of this Cambodian woman, she claims to be blind. It is thought that
trauma suffered in Cambodian prison camps due to the brutality of the
Khmer Rouge produced such horror that her eyesight "shut down"
psychologically. Hysterical blindness is a very rare conversion disorder
in the United States but is quite high among Cambodian refugees.
Approximately 150 individuals (mostly women) from a Cambodian community
of 85,000 people in Long Beach, California, suffer from this disorder.

origin of her symptoms, she agreed to undergo hypnosis. Under hypnosis,
she walked and moved her paralyzed limbs normally. She received
psychotherapy, exploring her childhood and relationship difﬁculties.
Within six months she was using her right upper limb normally and
walking with a frame. (Singh & Lee, 1997, pp. 426--427) The boy was
referred at age ten as a case of juvenile myasthenia gravis (weakening
of the voluntary muscles). For ﬁve weeks he had been unable to open his
eyes, and the consequent "blindness" had stopped him from attending
school. . . . On detailed physical examination, no other abnormalities
were found. In the hospital ward it was noted that he did not walk into
furniture. . . . He was the local village football star . . . and had
been blamed for his team's defeat . . . and from that day he had been
unable to open his eyes. (Leary, 2003, p. 436)

The most common conversion symptoms seen in neurological clinics involve
psychogenic pain, disturbances of stance and gait, sensory symptoms,
dizziness, and psychogenic seizures (Rechlin, Loew, & Joraschky, 1997).
The occurrence of symptoms is often related to stress. Nearly 75 percent
of respondents in one sample reported that their conversion symptoms
developed after they had experienced a stressor (Singh & Lee, 1997). In
a ten-year follow-up study of individuals diagnosed with conversion
disorder, symptoms persisted in about 40 percent of the cases (Mace &
Trimble, 1996). Sudden onset, shorter duration of symptoms, and a good
premorbid (pre-illness) personality are associated with a positive
outcome (Crimlisk et al., 1998; Singh & Lee, 1997). It is often
difficult to distinguish between actual physical disorders and
conversion reactions. In one sample of sixty patients with sudden onset
of neurological symptoms, 50 percent had physical disorders, and the
remainder received a diagnosis of conversion disorder (Binzer,
Eisenmann, & Kullgren, 1998). Conversion disorder usually involves
either the senses or motor functions that are controlled by the
voluntary (rather than the autonomic) nervous system, and there is
seldom any actual physical damage. For example, a person with hysterical
paralysis of the legs rarely shows the atrophy of the lower limbs that
occurs when there is an underlying biological cause, although in some
persistent cases, disuse can result in atrophy (Schonfeldt-Lecuona et
al., 2003). Some symptoms, such as the inability to talk or whisper
while still being able to cough or glove anesthesia (the loss of feeling
in the hand, ending in a straight line at the wrist), are easily
diagnosed as conversion disorders because coughing indicates an intact
vocal cord function and, in glove anesthesia, the area of sensory loss
does not correspond to the distribution of nerves in the body (Brown,
2004; see Figure 6.4).

Somatoform Disorders

Other symptoms may require extensive neurological and physical
examinations to rule out a true medical disorder before a diagnosis of
conversion disorder can be made. Discriminating between people who are
faking and those with conversion disorder is difficult. For example,
participants asked to simulate a hearing loss can produce response
patterns highly similar to those of individuals with hearing loss from
conversion disorder (Aplin & Kane, 1985). Nerve pathways

Pain Disorder Pain disorder is characterized by reports of severe pain
that may (1) have no physiological or neurological basis, (2) be greatly
in excess of that expected with an existing physical condition, or (3)
linger long after a physical injury has healed. As with the other
somatoform disorders, psychological conflicts are involved. People who
have pain disorder have numerous physical complaints, make frequent
visits to physicians, and may become drug or medication abusers.
Unexplained physical pain involving the abdomen, head, and limbs is
present in a considerable number of young children (Hunfeld et al.,
2002). Chronic pain is relatively common and affects 30 percent of the
U.S. population (Hoffman, Papas, Chatkoff, & Kerns, 2007). Because
psychological factors do play a role in exacerbating pain, it is
difficult to determine when pain is to be considered "excessive" or is
"lingering too long." Understandably, questioning the veracity of
reports of pain results in feelings of anger and frustration from
patients (Merten & Brunnhuber, 2004). Some researchers (Fava & Wise,
2007) believe that pain disorder should be viewed as a
psychophysiological disorder, indicating that both physical and
psychological factors are involved. A multipath model of pain allows one
to consider how biological, psychological, and socioenvironmental
factors can moderate the pain experience.

GLOVE ANESTHESIA In glove anesthesia, the lack of feeling covers the

nerve pathways. This discrepancy leads to a diagnosis of conversion
disorder.

A 41-year-old woman, Linda, reported having a history of concerns about
cancer, especially stomach or bowel cancer. Her grandmother had bowel
cancer when Linda was 22. Media stories of illness, medical
documentaries, or reading about people who are ill trigger her worries:
. . . "I notice a feeling of discomfort and bloating in my abdomen. . .
. I wonder if this could be an early sign of cancer. Cancer is something
that can happen at my age. People can have very few symptoms and then
suddenly it is there and a few months later they are gone." (Furer &
Walker, 2005, p. 261)

The primary characteristic of hypochondriasis is a persistent
preoccupation with one's health and physical condition, even in the face
of negative findings. Fear of death or aging is common, as are anxiety
or depressive disorders (Bleichhardt, Timmer, & Reif, 2005).
Characteristics of the disorder include (Furer & Walker, 2005; Kellner,
Hernandez, & Pathak, 1992; Leibbrand, Hiller, & Fichter, 2000): 1.
Bodily preoccupation: a tendency toward self-observation,
oversensitivity to bodily sensations, and alarm when unpleasant or
unusual symptoms are identified 2. Disease phobia: the fear of having a
serious illness or dying from an undetected disease 3. Disease
conviction: the belief remains even with frequent assurance from
physicians, family, and friends that nothing is wrong (Starcevic, 2005).
In a study of twenty individuals with hypochondriasis (ten females and
ten males), the most common health concerns involved undetected cancer,
heart attack, and brain tumors. As opposed to individuals in a control
group, the participants showed a tendency to overestimate negative
outcomes with ambiguous healthrelated information (Haenen et al., 2000).
Hypochondriasis is often characterized by fearful thoughts of having a
fatal disease (Avia & Ruiz, 2005; Barsky, 1991). Because this disorder
does not involve a physical symptom or complaint, some researchers
believe hypochondria should be placed under anxiety disorders and called
"health anxiety disorder" (Abramowitz & Moore, 2007; Fava et al., 2007;
Starcevic, 2006).

Body Dysmorphic Disorder Case Study The patient was a
twenty-four-year-old Caucasian male in his senior year of college. He
presented at intake by stating, "I've got a physical deformity (small
hands) and it makes me very uncomfortable, especially around women with
hands bigger than mine. I see my deformity as a sign of weakness; it's
like I'm a cripple."... He spent considerable time researching hand
sizes for different populations and stated at intake that his middle
ﬁnger is one and one-fourth inches smaller than the average size for a
male in the United States. ... He also reported being concerned that
women might believe small hands are indicative of having a small penis.
(Schmidt & Harrington, 1995, pp. 162--163)

body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) preoccupation with an

imagined defect in appearance in a normal-appearing person or an
excessive concern over a slight physical defect

According to DSM-IV-TR, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) involves a
preoccupation with an imagined defect in appearance in a
normal-appearing person or an excessive concern over a slight physical
defect. The term comes from the Greek word dysmorphia, which means
abnormal shape. This disorder is often referred to as the "fear of
ugliness" (Rivera & Borda, 2001). The preoccupation produces marked
clinical distress and may be underdiagnosed because individuals may be
unwilling to bring attention to the "problem" (Grant, Kim, & Crow,
2001). Individuals with this disorder often engage in frequent mirror
checking, regard their "defect" with embarrassment and loathing, and are
concerned that others may be looking at or thinking about their defect.
They make frequent requests for cosmetic surgeries despite the outcome
of previous treatment (Fontenelle et al., 2006; Rivera & Borda, 2001).
Concern commonly focuses on bodily features such as excessive hair or
lack of hair and the size or shape of the nose, face, or eyes (see
Figure 6.5). Among twenty patients with BDD in Brazil, many had other
psychiatric disorders, and three-quarters had obsessive-compulsive
disorder. Over one-third had active suicidal ideation, and 30 percent
had no insight into their difficulties (Fontenelle et al., 2006). The
degree

Somatoform Disorders

of insight in BDD clients can range from good to absent (Lucchelli,
Bondolfi, & Bertschy, 2006; Phillips et al., 2001). BDD tends to be
chronic and difficult to treat. In a one-year follow-up of 183
individuals with BDD, 84 percent of whom received mental health
treatment, only 9 percent had full remission and 21 percent had partial
remission of symptoms (Phillips et al., 2006). Some bodybuilders who
show a pathological preoccupation with their muscularity may also suffer
from BDD. Researchers identified a subgroup of bodybuilders who scored
high in body dissatisfaction, had low self-esteem, and mistakenly
believed they were "small" even though they were large and very muscular
(Choi et al., 2002; Olivardia, Pope, & Hudson, 2000). In DSM-IV-TR, body
build or muscularity has been added as an area of body preoccupation in
BDD. As with the other somatoform disorders, individuals with BDD seek
medical attention---often from dermatologists or plastic surgeons. They
are also likely to undergo multiple medical procedures (Phillips &
Rasmussen, 2004). Persons with BDD often suffer from functional
impairment. They may avoid social activities, work, and school and may
become housebound and suicidal (Schmidt & Harrington, 1995). The more a
person agrees with the following statements, the more likely he or she
is to have BDD. 1. Do you believe that there is a "defect" in a part of
your body or appearance? 2. Do you spend considerable time checking this
"defect"? 3. Do you attempt to hide or cover up this "defect" or remedy
it by exercising, dieting, or seeking surgery? 4. Does this belief cause
you significant distress, embarrassment, or torment? 5. Does the "flaw"
interfere with your ability to function at school, at social events, or
at work? 6. Do friends or family members tell you that there is nothing
wrong or that the "defect" is minor? Researchers (Fava et al., 2007;
Kroenke, Sharp, & Sykes, 2007; Starcevic, 2006) have questioned the
placement of BDD within the somatoform disorders category because it
does not involve physical disease or dysfunction. They argue that BDD is
a variant of obsessive-compulsive disorder and should be considered an
anxiety disorder. Indeed, some people with BDD have been successfully
treated with fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, which is also
used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (Lydiard, Brady, & Austin,
1994; Phillips & Rasmussen, 2004).

Etiology of Somatoform Disorders Most etiological theories tend to focus
on what they consider to be the "primary" cause of somatoform disorders.
However, they are unable to explain why only some individuals exposed to
these "causes" develop somatoform disorders. In the vast majority of
cases, multiple factors contribute, as evidenced by the multipath model
that includes biological (sensitivity to bodily cues), psychological
(negative thoughts related to pain or bodily functioning), social
(modeling by parents, relatives, or friends), and sociocultural
dimensions (gender and cultural influences), as shown in Figure 6.6.
Biological Dimensions Research involving twin (Torgersen, 1986) or
family studies (Noyes et al., 1997) provides little evidence for
heredity in somatoform disorders. The exception is BDD, which may, in
fact, be a variant of OCD (Rivera & Borda, 2001). Instead, biological
vulnerabilities in terms of lower pain thresholds or greater sensitivity
to somatic cues have been hypothesized (Kellner, 1985; Starcevic, 2005).
Barsky and Wyshak (1990) believe that a predisposition may be
"hard-wired" into the central nervous system that involves (1)
hypervigilance or exaggerated focus on bodily sensation, (2) increased
sensitivity to even mild bodily sensations, and (3) a disposition to
react to somatic sensations with alarm. The predisposition becomes a
fully developed disorder only when a trauma or stressor occurs that the
individual cannot deal with. In a test involving a physical stressor
(foot placed in cold water), individuals with hypochondriasis
demonstrated greater increases in heart rate, displayed a greater drop

in temperature in the immersed limb, rated the experience as more
unpleasant, and terminated the task more frequently relative to a
control group (Gramling, Clawson, & McDonald, 1996). It has been
hypothesized that "people who continually report being bothered by pain
and bodily sensations may have a higher-than-normal arousal level, which
results in increased perception of internal stimuli" (Hanback & Revelle,
1978, p. 523). Innate factors may account for greater sensitivity to
pain and bodily functions (Kellner, 1985; Starcevic, 2005).
Additionally, individuals with somatoform disorders often have had
serious illness or physical injury (Smith et al., 2000; Starcevic,
2005). Psychological Dimension Theoretical explanations have included
the psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral perspectives. Certain
psychological characteristics have also been associated with the
somatoform disorders. Psychodynamic perspective In psychodynamic theory,
somatic symptoms are seen as a defense against the awareness of
unconscious emotional issues (Dworkin, VonKorff, & LeResche, 1990).
Freud believed that hysterical reactions (biological complaints of pain,
illness, or loss of physical function) were caused by the repression of
some type of conflict, usually sexual in nature. To protect the
individual from intense anxiety, this conflict is converted into a
physical symptom (Breuer & Freud, 1895/1957). The psychodynamic view
suggests that two mechanisms produce and then sustain somatoform
symptoms. The first provides a primary gain for the person by protecting
him or her from the anxiety associated with the unacceptable desire or
conflict; the need for protection gives rise to the physical symptoms.
This focus on the body keeps the patient from an awareness of the
underlying conflict (Simon & VonKorff, 1991). Then a secondary gain
accrues when the person's dependency needs are fulfilled through
attention and sympathy. In one study of twenty-five patients with a
somatoform disorder, all relied on family members and friends to
complete domestic tasks and were receiving disability allowances
(Allanson, Bass, & Wade, 2002). Cognitive-behavioral perspective
Cognitive-behavioral researchers point to the importance of
reinforcement, modeling, cognitions, or a combination of these factors
in the development of somatoform disorders. Some contend that people
with somatoform disorders assume the "sick role" because it is
reinforcing and because it allows them to escape unpleasant
circumstances or to avoid responsibilities (Schwartz,

Somatoform Disorders

Slater, & Birchler, 1994). The importance of reinforcement was shown in
a study of male pain patients. Men with supportive wives (attentive to
pain cues) reported significantly greater pain when their wives were
present than when their wives were absent. The reverse was true of
patients whose wives were nonsupportive: reports of pain were greater
when their wives were absent (Williamson, Robinson, & Melamed, 1997).
Some patients may seek out contact with medical staff as a source of
reinforcement because of social isolation or an inability to connect
with family or friends (Stuart & Noyes, 2005). Individuals with
somatoform disorders have reported being rejected by family members at
an early age and feeling unloved (Rivera & Borda, 2001). Parental
modeling and reinforcement of illness behaviors may also be influential
in determining people's current reactions to illness. Over 50 percent of
a sample of individuals with conversion disorder, somatization disorder,
pain disorder, or hypochondriasis had had a serious physical illness in
the preceding twelve months, and many reported serious physical
illnesses among family members (Smith et al., 2000). Individuals with
somatoform disorders showed a background of parental models or family
members with chronic physical illnesses (Smith et al., 2000; Starcevic,
2005), and they were also more likely to report having missed school for
health reasons and having had childhood illnesses (Barsky et al., 1995).
The most recent views of somatoform disorders stress the importance of
cognitive factors (Avia & Ruiz, 2005; Furer & Walker, 2005; Lipsitt &
Starcevic, 2006; Severeijns et al., 2004). According to this
perspective, a somatoform disorder may develop in predisposed
individuals (that is, those who have somatic sensitivity, a low pain
threshold, a history of illness, and parental attention to somatic
attention or modeling) in the following manner (Barsky, 1991; Starcevic,
2005): (1) an anxiety- or stress-arousing event; (2) the perception of
somatic changes such as pain, increased heart rate, and respiration; (3)
the thought that these sensations reflect a disease process; (4)
amplification of bodily sensations, causing even more pain or concern;
(5) increased catastrophic thoughts regarding these sensations, creating
a circular feedback pattern. Individuals with somatoform disorders have
been shown to make unrealistic interpretations of bodily sensations and
to overestimate the dangerousness of bodily symptoms (Haenen et al.,
2000). Social and Sociocultural Dimensions Hysteria, now known as
conversion disorder, was originally perceived as a problem that
afflicted only women; in fact, it derived its name from hystera, the
ancient Greek word for uterus. Hippocrates believed that a shift or
movement of the uterus resulted in complaints of breathing difficulties,
anesthesia, and seizures. He presumed that the movement was due to the
uterus "wanting a child." However, Satow (1979) argued that hysteria was
more prevalent in women when social mores did not provide them with
appropriate channels for the expression of aggression or sexuality. Anna
O., a patient of physician Josef Breuer, was a twenty-one-year-old woman
who developed a variety of symptoms, including dissociation, muscle
rigidity, and insensitivity to feeling. Freud and Breuer both believed
that these symptoms were the result of intrapsychic conflicts. They did
not consider the impact of social role restrictions on abnormal
behavior. According to Hollender (1980), Anna O. was highly intelligent,
but her educational and intellectual opportunities were severely
restricted because she was a woman. Breuer described her as "bubbling
over with intellectual vitality." As Hollender pointed out, "Not only
was Anna O., as a female, relegated to an inferior position in her
family with future prospects limited to that of becoming a wife and
mother, but at the age of twenty-one she was suddenly called on to
assume the onerous chore of nursing her father" (Hollender, 1980,
p. 798). It is possible that many of her symptoms were produced to
relieve the guilt she felt because of her resentment of this duty---as
well as to maintain her intellectually stimulating contact with Breuer.
After treatment, Anna O. was supposedly cured. However, she, in fact,
remained severely disturbed and received additional treatment at an
institution. Later, she headed a home for orphans, was involved in
social work, and became recognized as a feminist leader.

n the second century, Galen believed that hysteria was a result of
sexual deprivation in women. Treatment involved marriage or, for women
who remained single, vaginal massage by a midwife. Later, physicians
treated the condition by producing "hysterical paroxysm," or orgasm, in
women. An electric vibrator was advertised in a Sears catalog in 1918 to
treat hysteria.

CONVERSION DISORDER OR SOCIETY'S VICTIM? Anna O., whose real name was
Bertha Pappenheim, was diagnosed as being severely disturbed, even
though her later years were extremely productive. Was her condition a
product of societal restrictions on the role of women or her inability
to conform to that role? Or was it something totally different?

172

C H A P T E R 6 • DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS AND SOMATOFORM DISORDERS

Cultural factors can influence the frequency, expression, and
interpretation of somatic complaints. Risk factors associated with
somatoform disorders include lower educational levels, ethnicity, and
immigrant status (Noyes et al., 2006). Physical complaints often occur
in reaction to stress among Asian Americans (Sue & Sue, 2008a). In fact,
Asian Indian children who were referred for psychiatric services had
three times as many somatoform disorders as their white counterparts
(Jawed, 1991). Among some African groups, somatic complaints (feelings
of heat, peppery and crawling sensations, and numbness) differ from
those expressed in western cultures (Ohaeri & Odejide, 1994). Reports of
pain also differ between white and Hispanic patients with current health
problems. Hispanics report more pain, which might be due to the cultural
acceptance of physical problems as an expression of distress (Hernandez
& Sachs-Ericsson, 2006). Differences such as those just described may
reflect different cultural views of the relationship between mind and
body. The dominant view in western culture is the psychosomatic
perspective, in which psychological conflicts are expressed in physical
complaints. But many other cultures have a somatopsychic perspective, in
which physical problems produce psychological and emotional symptoms.
Although we probably believe that our psychosomatic view is the
"correct" one, the somatopsychic view is the dominant perspective in
most cultures. As White (1982) claimed, "It is rather the more
psychological and psychosomatic mode of reasoning found in Western
cultures which appears unusual among the world's popular and traditional
system of belief" (p. 1520). Physical complaints expressed by persons of
ethnic minorities may need to be interpreted differently from similar
complaints made by members of the majority culture.

Treatment of Somatoform Disorders Although somatoform disorders are
considered to be difficult to treat, newer biological and psychological
treatments have met with greater success. There is also increasing
recognition of the necessity of moving away from a mind-body
distinction, understanding the client perspective regarding somatoform
disorders, and acknowledging the relationship between stressors and
their role in physical complaints.

Case Study Mr. X was a sixty-eight-year-old Chinese man who reported
sleep disturbances, a loss of appetite, dizziness, and a sensation of
tightness around his chest. Several episodes of chest pain led to
admission and medical evaluation at the local hospital. All results,
including tests for ischemic heart disease, were normal. He was referred
for psychiatric consultation. Because traditional Chinese views of
medicine recognize an interconnection between mind and body, the
psychiatrist accepted and showed interest in the somatic symptoms, such
as their onset, duration, and exacerbating and relieving factors.
Medication was provided as a supportive treatment. A stressor was
identiﬁed that involved arguments with his wife. Suggestions were made
on how to improve communication, which led to a decrease in physical
complaints. (Yeung & Deguang, 2002)

Biological Treatment Antidepressant medications such as the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown promise with somatoform
disorders, primarily somatization and somatoform pain disorders (Taylor,
Asmundson, & Coons, 2005). In addition, interventions involving an
increase in physical activity have been recommended for conversion
disorders (Smith et al., 2000). SSRIs have been successful in improving
nearly two-thirds of a sample of individuals with body dysmorphic
disorder (Phillips et al., 2001; Phillips & Rasmussen, 2004). However,
these biological treatments appear to be beneficial primarily with the
depression, anxiety, and other comorbid conditions that accompany
somatoform disorders. Psychological Treatments The most promising
interventions for somatoform disorders involve the cognitive-behavioral
approach. A fundamental focus is an understanding of the client's view
regarding his or her problem. Individuals with somatoform disorders are
often frustrated, disappointed, and angry following years of encounters
with the medical profession. They believe that the treatment strategies
have

Somatoform Disorders

been ineffective and resent the implication that they are "fakers" or
problem patients (Lipsitt & Starcevic, 2006). Medical personnel do show
negative reactions when interacting with individuals with somatoform
disorders (Merten & Brunnhuber, 2004). Because of these reactions,
patients and physicians have a difficult time establishing a positive
relationship. A more recent approach has been to demonstrate empathy
regarding the physical complaints and focus on helping the individual
develop better coping skills, as indicated in the following statement to
a patient: "I don't know exactly the cause of your problem, and I'm not
certain that I can provide immediate relief. Nevertheless, I will work
with you as best I can to find solutions" (Monopoli, 2005, p. 293). In
another approach, somatoform disorders are viewed within a social
context--- a belief that somatic complaints are a reflection of
unsatisfying or inadequate social relationships. Individuals who assume
a "sick role" often receive some reinforcement, such as escape from
responsibility and control of others through bodily complaints. However,
negative aspects include rejection from others, which may result in
increased social isolation. Therapy is therefore directed toward
developing and improving the individual's social network. A therapist
may say something such as: "There is treatment available that may be
helpful to you, if you would like to participate. This involves learning
new ways of understanding and coping with stresses, other than turning
to substances or going to the nearest emergency room. Treatment will
also involve learning more about yourself and finding out what gets in
the way of developing more fulfilling relationships" (Gregory & Jindal,
2006, p. 34). A randomized controlled trial was conducted (Allen et al.,
2006) to compare cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with standard
medical care augmented by psychiatric consultation for somatization
disorder. CBT was based on the biopsychological model in which pain or
bodily symptoms were seen to be related to the degree of stress or
anxiety affecting the patient. The approach involved: (1) scheduling
regular appointments rather than making appointments by patient request,
(2) brief examinations by a physician regarding the physical complaints,
(3) providing psychoeducation regarding the relationship between pain or
bodily symptoms and stress and anxiety, (4) relaxation training to
reduce physiological arousal, (5) encouraging more social contact and
involvement in pleasurable and meaningful activities, and (6)
identifying and modifying negative thoughts. The ten-session CBT program
was significantly more effective in reducing somatization symptoms and
complaints than standard medical care augmented with psychiatric
consultation. Because many patients with somatoform disorders appear to
have cognitive distortions, such as a conviction that they are
especially vulnerable to disease, cognitivebehavioral approaches focused
on correcting these misinterpretations have been successful (Barsky &
Ahern, 2004). In one program, individuals with hypochondriasis who had
fears of having cancer, heart disease, or other fatal diseases were
educated about the relationship between misinterpretations of bodily
sensations and selective attention to illness themes. Six two-hour group
sessions were held that covered topics such as "What Is
Hypochondriasis?" "The Role of Your Thoughts," "Attention and Illness
Anxiety," "Stress and Bodily Symptoms," and "Your Own Vicious Cycle." As
homework assignments, participants monitored and challenged
hypochondriacal thoughts. After completing these sessions, most
participants showed considerable improvement or no longer met the
criteria for hypochondriasis, and the gains were maintained at a
six-month follow-up (Hiller et al., 2002). Reattribution training has
also led to improvement among individuals with somatic complaints. Case
studies indicate that systematic desensitization, exposure, and
cognitive therapy are promising approaches in the treatment of body
dysmorphic disorder (Neziroglu & Yaryura-Tobias, 1997; Rosen, Reiter, &
Orosan, 1995).

The two primary models for dissociative disorders include the
psychoanalytically based posttraumatic model (PTM) and the
sociocognitive model (SCM). Both models account for only certain
etiological aspects of dissociative disorders. The PTM model is
dependent on childhood trauma for the development of DID. However, there
are

I M P L I C AT I O N S

174

C H A P T E R 6 • DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS AND SOMATOFORM DISORDERS

cases of DID in which childhood traumas were not reported, and certainly
the majority of individuals who have been abused as children do not
develop this disorder. The SCM model (which stresses the importance of
exposure to mass media portrayals of DID and therapist suggestions) also
has shortcomings. The model fails to explain why only a very small
number of individuals who undergo therapy and are aware of the
characteristics of DID develop this disorder. Because each perspective
is limited in breadth, minimal attention is paid to other biological,
psychological, social, or sociocultural dimensions, which limits the
explanatory power of both models. Views regarding somatoform disorders
are changing, from focusing on a mindbody distinction to interactions
between psychological events and physical functioning. For example, a
complaint of back pain can be a result of tension of the muscles of the
back due to workplace stress. In this case both the pain and stress can
be treated together through medication and relaxation training. Social
factors, such as relationship problems or even the relationship between
the therapist and client, can influence reports of pain. However,
etiological theories regarding somatoform disorders (psychoanalytic,
cognitive-behavioral, family, medical) remain distinct from one another
and rarely consider the other dimensions.

Summary 1. What are dissociations? What forms can they take? How are
they caused, and how are they treated? ■ Dissociation involves a
disruption in consciousness,

memory, identity, or perception and may be transient or chronic. ■
Dissociative amnesia and dissociative fugue involve a

selective form of forgetting in which the person can not remember
information that is of personal significance. Depersonalization disorder
is characterized by feelings of unreality---distorted perceptions of
oneself and one's environment. Dissociative identity disorder involves
the alternation of two or more relatively independent personalities in
one individual. ■ Biological

explanations for DID have focused on studies finding variations in brain
activity when comparing different personalities. Some researchers
believe that childhood trauma and chronic stress can result in permanent
structural changes in the brain. Psychoanalytic perspectives attribute
these disorders to the repression of impulses that are seeking
expression and ways of coping with childhood abuse. Sociocultural
explanations for dissociation include exposure to media portrayals of
dissociation and role enactment. Social explanations include childhood
abuse, subtle reinforcement, responding to the expectations of a
therapist, or mislabeling dissociative experiences.

■ Dissociative amnesia and dissociative fugue tend to

be short-lived and remit spontaneously; behavioral therapy has also been
used successfully. Dissociative identity disorder has most often been
treated with psychotherapy and hypnosis, as well as with behavioral and
family therapies.

2.  When do physical complaints become a psychological disorder? What
    are the causes and treatments of these conditions? ■ Somatoform
    disorders involve complaints about physical symptoms that mimic
    actual medical conditions but have no apparent organic basis.
    Instead, psychological factors are directly involved in the
    initiation and exacerbation of the problem. Somatization disorder is
    characterized by chronic multiple complaints and early onset.
    Conversion disorder involves a physical impairment that has no
    organic cause. Pain disorder is a condition in which reported severe
    pain has a psychological rather than a physical basis.
    Hypochondriasis involves a persistent preoccupation with bodily
    functioning and disease. Body dysmorphic disorder involves
    preoccupation with an imagined bodily defect. ■ Biological
    explanations have suggested that there is increased vulnerability to
    somatoform disorder when individuals have high sensitivity to body
    sensations, a lower pain threshold, and/or a history of illness or
    injury. The psychoanalytic view holds that somatoform disorders are
    caused by the repression of sexual conflicts and their conversion
    into physical symptoms. Other psychological factors include social
    isolation, high anxiety or stress, and catastrophic thoughts
    regarding bodily sensations. Social explanations suggest that the
    role of "being sick" is reinforcing. Parental models for injury or
    illness can also be influential. From a sociocultural perspective,
    somatoform disorders result from societal restrictions placed on
    women, who are affected to a much greater degree than men by these
    disorders. Additionally, social class, limited knowledge about
    medical concepts, and cultural acceptance of physical symptoms can
    play a role.

hmet and Hasan are male Turkish citizens in their 30s who were arrested,
imprisoned, and tortured. Ahmet was imprisoned for several years and
experienced a great deal of torture; Hasan was imprisoned for several
weeks and experienced far less torture. . . . Why did Hasan, but not
Ahmet, develop posttraumatic stress disorder? (Mineka & Zinbarg, 2006,
p. 10) Nineteen adults who appeared to have had a massive heart attack
after an emotional event (e.g., car accident, news of a death, surprise
birthday party, armed robbery, court appearance) were found to have 30
times the normal level of adrenalin or epinephrine in their blood
stream, an amount toxic to the heart and capable of producing heart
failure. This reversible cardiac condition which is precipitated by
emotional stress has been called the "broken heart" syndrome. (Wittstein
et al., 2005) A 12-year longitudinal study focused on the impact of
downsizing on employees. This study followed the remaining workforce of
approximately 13,000 after a reduction of workers by nearly half over a
period of one year. Of those studied, two-thirds showed health declines
such as increases in heart attacks, strokes, obesity rates, depression,
and substance abuse. However, one-third of the employees appeared to
thrive. (Maddi, 2002)

Stressors are external events or situations that place a physical or
psychological demand on a person. They range from chronic irritation and
frustration to acute and traumatic events. Stress is an internal
psychological or physiological response to a stressor. Something that
disturbs one person doesn't necessarily disturb someone else, and two
people who react to the same stressor may do so in very different ways.
Many people who are exposed to stressors, even traumatic ones,
eventually move on with their lives. Other people show intense and
somewhat long-lasting psychological or physical stress disorders. What
leads some individuals to be more susceptible to stressors than others?

In the months following the earthquake that hit Los Angeles in 1994,
there was an increase in cardiovascular deaths, from an average of 15.6
to 51 a day (Underwood, 2005). These deaths occurred primarily among
vulnerable individuals with preexisting coronary heart disease or high
blood pressure who succumbed due to emotional stress. Along with the
involvement of stressors in physical problems such as headaches, high
blood pressure, and asthma, stress-related psychological disorders such
as acute and posttraumatic stress disorders can also develop. In this
chapter we cover first the psychological disorders produced by traumatic
stressors and then the physical illnesses, such as hypertension, that
are stress related. As we will see, these disorders may be best
explained by examining biological, psychological, social, and
sociocultural dimensions using the multipath model.

Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder develop in
response to an extreme psychological or physical trauma. Acute stress
disorder (ASD) is characterized by anxiety and dissociative symptoms
that occur within one month after exposure to a traumatic stressor.
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by anxiety,
dissociative, and other symptoms that last for more than one month and
that occur as a result of exposure to extreme trauma. For example, in a
group of individuals directly affected by the terrorist attacks on
September 11, 2001 (those who were in the World Trade Center complex
during the attacks, who experienced injury in the attacks, or who had
friend or relatives killed in the attacks), 12 percent developed PTSD
(Marshall et al., 2007). The prevalence of PTSD is as high as 19 percent
among veterans serving in Iraq or Afghanistan (Hoge et al., 2004; Seal
et al., 2007). Other situations that may lead to PTSD include being
sexually assaulted or a victim of a violent crime, domestic violence,
school shooting (Curry, 2001), sexual harassment (O'Donohue et al.,
2006), natural disaster, car accident, or other situation in which there
is a fear of severe injury or death (National Institute of Mental Health
\[NIMH\], 2007f).

Diagnosis of Acute and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders The diagnostic
criteria for acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder are
similar. They both necessitate an exposure to a traumatic stressor and
differ primarily in onset (ASD within four weeks and PTSD at any time)
and duration (ASD lasts two to twenty-eight days, and PTSD lasts longer
than one month). An individual with an initial diagnosis of ASD is
likely to receive a diagnosis of PTSD if the symptoms persist for more
than four weeks. The following case illustrates the features and origins
of PTSD:

Case Study I was raped when I was twenty-ﬁve years old. For a long time,
I spoke about the rape as though it was something that happened to
someone else. I was very aware that it had happened to me, but there was
just no feeling. Then I started having ﬂashbacks. They kind of came over
me like a splash of water. I would be terriﬁed. Suddenly I was reliving
the rape. Every instant was startling. I wasn't aware of anything around
me, I was in a bubble, just kind of ﬂoating. And it was scary. Having a
ﬂashback can wring you out. (NIMH, 2007f, p. 7)

Etiology of Acute and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders

177

In the National Comorbidity Survey, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD for
American adults is 6.8 percent, with about twice as many women as men
receiving the diagnosis (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005; NIMH, 2007f).
Of the few studies available on ASD, lifetime prevalence rates from 14
to 33 percent of those exposed to traumatic stress have been reported
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). However, the prevalence of
ASD may be underestimated, as those with the symptoms may not seek
treatment within the twenty-eight-day period that defines the disorder.
The DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for acute stress disorder and
posttraumatic stress disorder are: 1. Exposure to a traumatic stressor
that: (a) involved possible death or severe injury and (b) is
experienced by the individual with intense fear or horror. IMPACT OF

reactions can be considered normative responses to an overwhelming and
traumatic stimulus. Symptoms such as numbing, detachment,
depersonalization, and dissociation can help the individual minimize
awareness of traumatic memories and subsequently alleviate discomfort.
Most victims show a marked decrease in symptoms with time (Delahanty,

Etiology of Acute and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders What are the
factors associated with an increased risk of developing ASD or PTSD
after exposure to trauma? Certainly the magnitude of the stressor may be
very important in the development of PTSD. In a study of Cambodian
refugee immigrants who had experienced multiple stressors, such as the
deaths of family members, torture, extreme fear, and deprivation during
their escapes, 86 percent met the criteria for PTSD (Carlson &
Rosser-Hogan, 1991). Rape is also clearly a traumatic event. Immediately
after a sexual assault, 74 percent of the victims met the criteria for
ASD, and, after three months, 35 percent met the criteria for PTSD

(Valentiner et al., 1996). These data support the contention that some
extreme stressors may produce PTSD in almost everyone. Table 7.1 shows
PTSD prevalence associated with specific stressors. There appears to be
a strong correlation between the level of danger perceived from a trauma
and the likelihood of developing PTSD. However, there is also evidence
that PTSD symptoms can develop in individuals faced with repeated
subtraumatic stressors, such as employment problems or marital distress
(Astin et al., 1995; Scott & Stradling, 1994). Many social workers who
worked with clients suffering from trauma also experienced intrusive
memories, avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic stories,
and anxiety when exposed to cues of the event. About 15 percent met the
criteria for PTSD (Bride, 2007). If a situation meets all of the
criteria for PTSD with the exception of exposure to a traumatic
stressor, should there be a diagnosis of PTSD? More work needs to be
done to clarify the nature of traumatic stressors in PTSD and to
determine the necessity of direct experience with the trauma in the
diagnosis of the disorder. Not everyone exposed to a traumatic event
will develop one of the stress disorders. Other factors, such as the
person's individual characteristics, his or her perception of the event,
and specific vulnerabilities, have an influence or moderate the impact
of a traumatic event (La Greca & Silverman, 2006). In this section we
use the multipath model to consider the biological, psychological,
social, and sociocultural dimensions of the stress disorders, as shown
in Figure 7.1.

Biological Dimension As compared with trauma-exposed individuals who do
not have PTSD, those who develop the disorder show a sensitized
autonomic system (Keltner & Dowben, 2007; Orr et al., 2000; Rauch, Shin,
& Wright, 2003). There is some evidence that PTSD is not a biologically
normative stress response but one in which a number of neural and
biological systems are sensitized, resulting in hypersensitivity to
stimuli that are similar to the traumatic event (Kennedy, 2002). The
normal fear response involves the amygdala, the part of the brain that
is the major interface between sensory experiences such as trauma and
the neurochemical and neuroanatomical circuitry of fear. One's response
to a fear stimulus is rapid, occurring in milliseconds. The signal to
the sympathetic nervous system produces increases in heart rate and
blood pressure. Additional stress responses occur from the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the neuroendocrine system
involved in stress reactions and regulation of body processes such as
the immune system, mood, digestion, and energy. When there is a fear
response, cortisol is released. It is a major stress hormone that
prepares the body for "fight or flight" by raising blood pressure, blood
sugar level, and heart rate.

Cortisol also helps restore homeostasis after the stressor is removed.
Individuals with PTSD continue to demonstrate enhanced stress levels
even when the stressor is no longer present. Why this is so is unclear.
It is possible that chronic stress results in the inability to inhibit
the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in a continued stress response
(Koren, Hemel, & Klein, 2006). Some also hypothesize that long-term
exposure to cortisol by brain structures such as the hippocampus can
lead to cell damage, resulting in impaired memory and reexperiencing of
the traumatic event (Townsend & Weisler, 2007). Smaller hippocampal
volume has been found in individuals with PTSD, but it is unclear
whether it is a result of exposure to stressors or represents a
preexisting vulnerability (Koren et al., 2006). The nature of the
alteration of the neurobiology of PTSD is still being investigated. The
changes in sensitivity of the neural and biological systems may not be
permanent, as over half of those with PTSD recover (Yehuda, 2000).

Psychological Dimension What are the preexisting or psychological
contributions to developing a stress disorder? Specific psychological
vulnerabilities have been identified, although the precise role they
play varies from individual to individual. In a twin study, Gilbertson
and colleagues (2006) studied forty-three Vietnam veterans and their
twin brothers who had not been exposed to combat. Nineteen of the
veterans developed PTSD, whereas none of the noncombatant twin brothers
did. The researchers wanted to determine whether neuropsychological
deficits in memory, attention, and intellectual functioning were the
result of exposure to trauma or whether lower cognitive functioning is a
preexisting risk. The researchers assessed the cognitive functioning of
two sets of monozygotic (identical) twins. The researchers found the
following results when comparing twin sets who did or did not develop
PTSD: 1. The non-combat-exposed twin of the one who developed PTSD
showed similar cognitive performance to that of his brother. This leads
to the conclusion that lower cognitive functioning was not due to
exposure to combat. 2. The cognitive performance of the twin pair who
developed PTSD was significantly lower than that of the twin set without
PTSD. Lower cognitive functioning may serve as a vulnerability to PTSD.
However, Gilbertson and colleagues point out that most of the twins
scored in the normal range on the cognitive tests. In other words,
above-average cognitive

TSD was not ofﬁcially recognized as a diagnosis until 1980, but its

Silver, & Prause (2006).

skills seemed to act as a protective factor. Why this occurs and which
cognitive skills are important in PTSD is not known. Preexisting
conditions such as trait anxiety and depression were found to be risk
factors for the development of PTSD among youths exposed to Hurricane
Katrina (Weems et al., 2007). Also, individuals who are anxiety prone
and who score high on the characteristic of neuroticism (Breslau, Davis,
& Andreski, 1995) appear to be more vulnerable to PTSD. Individuals with
higher anxiety may react much more strongly to a traumatic event. Other
psychological factors may also play a role. Disaster survivors with
psychiatric histories were more likely to develop PTSD than those
without previous disorders (North, Smith, & Spitznagel, 1997). One study
showed that war veterans who developed PTSD were more likely to have
sustained injuries, engaged in firefights, come closer to their own
deaths, and witnessed others die (Hoge et al., 2004). Because a
traumatic event precipitates the disorder, several researchers (Orr et
al., 1995; Yehuda & McFarlane, 1995) believe that classical conditioning
is involved. People who have PTSD often show reactions to stimuli
present at the time of the trauma (e.g., darkness, time of day, smell of
diesel fuel, propeller noises). According to this perspective, the
reason that extinction does not occur is that the individual avoids
thinking about the situation.

Social Dimension Poor or inadequate support during childhood has also
been identified as possibly contributing to the development of the
stress disorders (Bremner et al., 1993). Individuals who are more
socially isolated and without an adequate support system appear to be
more vulnerable (Schnurr, Friedman, & Rosenberg, 1993). In one study,
those who reported low social support in the six months prior to
exposure to the 9/11 attacks were more than twice as likely as those
with high levels of social support to report symptoms of PTSD (Galea et
al., 2002). The lack of social support after experiencing a trauma may
be more important than the influences of childhood abuse and family
history (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine, 2000; Ozer, Best, Lipsey, &
Weiss, 2003).

Sociocultural Dimension Recent immigrants and refugees from countries in
which there have been civil disturbances or conflict may have elevated
rates of the stress disorders (Sue & Sue, 2008a). PTSD AND ABUSE In this
photo, Cheryl, center, consoles Catherine, twenty-four, during group
therapy. Catherine is reliving the physical and emotional abuse she
received during her childhood. Posttraumatic stress disorder is not
isolated to combat situations. Women who have been battered or have
suffered sexual assaults often report high rates of acute stress or
posttraumatic stress disorder.

Treatment of Acute and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders

Ethnic differences in response patterns were seen in a survey of 1,008
New York adult residents following the terrorist attacks of 9/11; 3.2
percent of Asian Americans, 6.5 percent of white Americans, 9.3 percent
of African Americans, and 13.4 percent of Hispanic Americans reported
symptoms consistent with PTSD (Galea et al., 2002). Women are also twice
as likely as men to suffer from a stress disorder (Galea et al., 2002;
NIMH, 2007f). This may result from an inherent vulnerability or from
greater exposure to stressors that are likely to result in PTSD. In
analyzing the data from the National Violence Against Women Project,
Cortina and Kubiak (2006) concluded that the greater prevalence of
stress disorders in women was due to more exposure to violent
interpersonal situations. In a similar fashion, Tolin and Foa (2006)
performed a meta-analysis of studies to determine whether gender
differences existed in terms of PTSD vulnerability. When they controlled
for exposure to interpersonal violence, the difference in rates of PTSD
between men and women was reduced, but not eliminated, suggesting that
additional factors are involved in the gender differences in prevalence.

Treatment of Acute and Posttraumatic Stress Disorders SSRI
antidepressant medication (Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac) has been successful in
the treatment of ASD and PTSD (Nacasch et al., 2007). These medications
alter serotonin levels, acting at the level of the amygdala and its
connections and desensitizing the fear network. Depending on the
specific medication, 50 to 85 percent report much or very much
improvement in symptom relief, although from 17 to 62 percent of those
on placebos also report the same degree of improvement (Davidson, 2000).
However, discontinuation rates are twice as high with medication as
compared with behavioral treatments (Davidson, 2000; Foa, 2000), perhaps
due to side effects such as insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and
depressed appetite. Exposure to cues associated with the trauma appears
to be effective in treating PTSD (Basoglu, Livanou, & Salcioglu, 2003;
Nacasch et al., 2007; Foa, 2000; Taylor et al., 2003). The process of
exposure may involve asking the person to re-create the traumatic event
in his or her imagination. In one study of victims of sexual assault
(Foa et al., 1999), the women were asked to repeatedly imagine and
describe the assault "as if it were happening now." They verbalized the
details of the assault, as well as their thoughts and emotions regarding
the incident. Their descriptions were recorded, and this process was
repeated for about an hour. The women were then instructed to listen to
the recordings once a day and, when doing so, to "imagine that the
assault is happening now." This process allowed extinction to occur. It
is believed that the more accurate the imagined details, the more
effective the therapy will be. Exposure also appears to effectively
correct erroneous cognitions associated with the traumatic event.
Cognitive factors may also account for some of the symptoms of PTSD.
Battered women with PTSD have thoughts associated with guilt or
self-blame. Cognitions such as "I could have prevented it," "I never
should have . . . ," and "I'm so stupid" maintain the symptoms of PTSD.
In one study, the condition remitted in 87 percent of battered women who
underwent the following procedure (Kubany et al., 2004): 1.
Psychoeducation about PTSD, along with the rationale for exposure
homework 2. Exposure homework assignments that involved watching movies
on domestic violence and/or looking at pictures of the abusive partner
3. Psychoeducation about the importance of developing a

PTSD AND THE MILITARY The 2nd Brigade combat team from Fort Carson,
Colorado, suffered heavy casualties in Iraq. Many of the soldiers in the
unit suffered from PTSD. However, the army was not always receptive to
complaints related to PTSD. An investigation showed systematic abuse of
soldiers with this disorder. Tyler Jennings, Corey Davis, and Alex Orum
all received a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered mistreatment by the army.

Physical Stress Disorders: Psychophysiological Disorders Case Study The
data from 200 patients who happened to have deﬁbrillators implanted
before the World Trade Center attack on September 11, 2001, provided
interesting information regarding the impact of the stressful event. The
deﬁbrillators, which record serious arrhythmias, showed that the
frequency of lifethreatening tachyarrhythmias increased twofold for
thirty days after 9/11. (Steinberg et al., 2004)

"Broken heart" syndrome and the illnesses suffered by individuals as a
result of the stress discussed at the beginning of the chapter
illustrate the impact that stressors can have on physical conditions.
Most researchers now acknowledge that attitudes and emotional states can
have an impact on physical well-being. In the past, physical disorders
such as asthma, hypertension, and headaches that stem from stressors
were called psychosomatic disorders. The use of this term was meant to
distinguish disorders from conditions considered strictly physical in
nature. Mental health professionals now recognize, however, that almost
any physical disorder can have a strong psychological component or
basis. Although the psychosomatic disorders were previously considered a
separate class of disorders, DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a) does not categorize them as such. Instead, it
contains the category "Psychological Factors Affecting Medical
Conditions." This classification acknowledges the belief that both
physical and psychological factors are involved in all human processes.
The term psychosomatic disorder has been replaced with
psychophysiological disorder, meaning any physical disorder that has a
strong psychological basis or component.

Myth vs Reality Myth: Psychophysiological disorders are merely
psychological in nature and can be treated with only psychotherapy. Real
physical problems are not present.

psychophysiological disorder

any physical disorder that has a strong psychological basis or component

Reality: Although psychophysiological disorders do have a psychological
component, actual physical processes or conditions are involved. They
differ from conversion reactions that are only psychological in nature.
Any physical condition can be considered a psychophysiological disorder
if psychological factors are implicated etiologically, if they make the
condition worse, or if they delay improvement. In most cases, both
medical and psychological treatments are needed.

The Hmong Sudden Death Syndrome

V

ang Xiong is a former Hmong (Laotian) soldier who, with his wife and
child, resettled in Chicago in 1980. The change from his familiar rural
surroundings and farm life to an unfamiliar urban area must have
produced a severe culture shock. In addition, Vang vividly remembered
seeing people killed during his escape from Laos, and he expressed
feelings of guilt about having to leave his brothers and sisters behind
in that country. He reported having problems almost immediately. \[He\]
could not sleep the ﬁrst night in the apartment, nor the second, nor the
third. After three nights of sleeping very little, Vang came to see his
resettlement worker, a bilingual Hmong man named Moua Lee. Vang told
Moua that the ﬁrst night he woke suddenly, short of breath, from a dream
in which a cat was sitting on his chest. The second night, the room
suddenly grew darker, and a ﬁgure, like a large black dog, came to his
bed and sat on his chest. He could not push the dog off, and he grew
quickly and dangerously short of breath. The third night, a tall,
white-skinned female spirit came into his bedroom from the kitchen and
lay on top of him. Her weight made it increasingly difﬁcult for him to
breathe, and as he grew frantic and tried to call out he could manage
but a whisper. He attempted to turn onto his side, but found he was
pinned down. After ﬁfteen minutes, the spirit left him, and he awoke,
screaming. (Tobin & Friedman, 1983, p. 440)

As of 1993, 150 cases of sudden death among Southeast Asian refugees had
been reported. Almost all were men,

with the possible exception of one or two women; most occurred within
the ﬁrst two years of residence in the United States. Autopsies produced
no identiﬁable cause for the deaths. Some cases of sudden unexplained
deaths have also been reported in Asian countries (Aoki et al., 2003).
Although the number of cases is declining, these deaths remain a most
puzzling phenomenon (Gib Parrish, Centers for Disease Control, personal
communication, 1993). All of the reports were the same: a person in
apparently good health went to sleep and died in his or her sleep.
Often, the victim displayed labored breathing, screams, and frantic
movements just before death. Some consider the deaths to represent an
extreme and very speciﬁc example of the impact of psychological stress
on physical health. Vang was one of the lucky victims of the
syndrome---he survived it. He went for treatment to a Hmong woman,
Mrs. Thor, who is a highly respected shaman in Chicago's Hmong
community. She interpreted his problem as being caused by unhappy
spirits and performed the ceremonies required to release them. After
that, Vang reported he had no more problems with nightmares or with his
breathing during sleep. In many nonwestern cultures, physical or mental
problems may be attributed to supernatural forces such as witchcraft or
evil spirits (Sue & Sue, 2008a). When differences in perspectives
regarding illnesses exist, how should they be dealt with? Should Vang
have been given antianxiety medications? Why was the spiritual treatment
successful?

Characteristics of Psychophysiological Disorders Psychophysiological
disorders involve actual tissue damage (such as coronary heart disease),
a disease process (immune impairment), or physiological dysfunction (as
in asthma or migraine headaches). Both medical treatment and
psychotherapy are usually required. The relative contributions of
physical and psychological factors in a physical disorder may vary
greatly. Although psychological events are often difficult to detect,
repeated association between stressors and the disorder or its symptoms
should increase the suspicion that a psychological component is
involved. In this section we discuss several of the more prevalent
psychophysiological disorders---coronary heart disease, hypertension
(high blood pressure), headaches, and asthma---and then consider the
evidence suggesting a connection between stress and disease as a result
of decreased immunological functioning. Research identifying biological,
psychological, social, and sociocultural dimensions of the specific
psychophysiological disorders is also reviewed.

Coronary Heart Disease Coronary heart disease (CHD) involves the
narrowing of cardiac arteries, resulting in the restriction or partial
blockage of the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart. Symptoms of CHD
may include chest pain (angina pectoris), heart attack, or, in severe
cases, cardiac arrest. Approximately 452,300 Americans die of coronary
heart disease each year, although the rate has been declining (American
Heart Association, 2007).

C H A P T E R 7 • STRESS DISORDERS

Stress plays a role in coronary heart disease from both a biological and
psychological perspective. Stress, resulting in the A release of
hormones that activate the sympathetic nervous system, can lead to
changes in heart rhythm, such as ventricular fibrillation (rapid,
ineffective contractions of the heart), bradycardia (slowing of the
heartbeat), tachycardia (speeding up of the heartB beat), or arrhythmia
(irregular heartbeat). Figure 7.2 shows an example of ventricular
fibrillation. Psychological factors are also implicated in
cardiovascular disease. In a sample of 335 older adults in Pittsburgh,
diary ratings of stressful demands and levels of perceived control in
daily life were obtained. Individuals who perceived greater daily stress
and lower control were found to have thickening of the lining of the
carotid artery, a marker of atherosclerosis (Kamarck et al., 2007).
Chronic work stress has been found to be related to an increased risk of
a second heart attack. Workers in their forties or fifties were
interviewed regarding their lifestyle and work stress (heavy workload,
time demands, and little control) six weeks after returning to work
FIGURE VENTRICULAR DEFIBRILLATION IN following a heart attack, and then

complications (Aboa-Eboule et al., 2007). Source: Nademanee et
al. (1997). In a longitudinal study, depression seems to be a risk
factor for cardiac mortality, both in individuals who had and did not
have cardiac disease at the beginning of the study. The risk was twice
as high for those with major than with minor depression, although any
depression was associated with increased mortality (Penninx et al.,
2001). Studies suggest that both psychological and social variables,
such as hostility, and childhood experiences, such as physical, sexual,
or emotional abuse, may be contributory factors that produce certain
pathogenic physiological changes (Richards, Alvarenga, & Hof, 2000;
Underwood, 2005). Psychological and social factors have been shown to
directly affect physiological processes that influence both blood
coagulation and increases in blood pressure, thereby increasing the
thickness of artery walls and contributing to CHD (Harenstam, Theorell,
& Kaijser, 2000; Kamarck et al., 2004).

7.2

Hypertension Case Study On October 19, 1987, the stock market
drastically dropped 508 points. By chance, a forty-eightyear-old
stockbroker was wearing a device measuring stress in the work
environment on that day. The instrument measured his pulse every ﬁfteen
minutes. At the beginning of the day, his pulse was sixty-four beats per
minute and his blood pressure was 132 over 87 (both rates within the
normal range). As stock prices fell dramatically, the man's
physiological system surged in the other direction. His heart rate
increased to eighty-four beats per minute and his blood pressure hit a
dangerous 181 over 105. His pulse was "pumping adrenaline, ﬂooding his
arteries, and maybe slowly killing him in the process." (Tierney, 1988)

pressure of 140 (systolic) over 90 (diastolic) or higher

This reaction illustrates the impact of a stressor on blood pressure,
the measurement of the force of blood against the walls of the arteries
and veins. Many people who experienced the stock market plunge that
occurred after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 or who survived the
exploding and collapsing buildings at the World Trade Center may also
have shown dangerously high levels of blood pressure. We all experience
a transient physiological response to stressors, but in some people, it
develops into a chronic condition called essential hypertension, a blood
pressure of 140 (systolic) over 90 (diastolic) or higher. Essential
hypertension is found in about 29 percent of

GENDER AND ETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN HYPERTENSION AMONG U.S. ADULTS The
highest prevalence of chronic high blood pressure occurs among African
Americans and among all individuals over the age of ﬁfty. Women tend to
score somewhat lower than other groups. Biological, psychological,
social, and sociocultural factors have been implicated in the gender and
ethnic differences in hypertension.

Source: Data from Burt et al. (1995); American Heart Association (2007).

STRESS AND HYPERTENSION On September 11, 2001, many survivors of the
World Trade Center recounted the terror they felt during the attack and
their ﬁght for survival. Onlookers were also horriﬁed to see people jump
to their deaths; many people barely escaped the collapsing building. The
survivors and observers went through a traumatic event that produced
severe physiological reactions. What was happening to them?

the U.S. adult population. Over 72 million have high blood pressure that
needs treatment (American Heart Association, 2007). However, 30 percent
are unaware of their hypertension, and more than 40 percent are not
being treated (Chobanian et al., 2003). Three-quarters of women and
two-thirds of men over the age of seventy-five have hypertension
(Centers for Disease Control, 2005). It is most prevalent in the African
American population and older adults (American Heart Association, 2007).
Chronic hypertension may lead to arteriosclerosis (narrowing of
arteries) and to increased risk of strokes and heart attacks. Figure 7.3
shows some gender and ethnic comparisons of hypertension among adults.
Biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural factors appear to
have interrelated roles in the development of hypertension. Individuals
placed under stress experience significant increases in blood pressure
(Bishop et al., 2003; Smith, Ruiz, & Uchino, 2000). Individuals with
high blood pressure have exhibited exaggerated reactions to a stressor
compared with their counterparts with normal or borderline high blood
pressure (Tuomisto, 1997). A familial component may also be involved. In
examining cardiovascular stress reactivity among monozygotic and
dizygotic twins, genetic factors were found to contribute significantly
to blood pressure (De Geus et al., 2007). Psychological and social
aspects of gender may also be involved in the development of
hypertension. In a study by Lai and Linden (1992), men and women were
evaluated on emotional expressiveness and classified as either "anger
in" (suppressing anger) or "anger out" (expressing anger). They were
then exposed to verbal harassment and either allowed to release their
anger or inhibited from doing so. Men displayed greater cardiovascular
reactivity to the harassment than did women. The opportunity to release
anger facilitated heart rate and blood pressure recovery in men but not
in women. Holding in anger did not produce the strong negative
physiological reactions in women that it did in men. The researchers
hypothesized that these differences in recovery patterns may be due to
the differential socialization of males and females. Sociocultural
factors, such as living in crowded neighborhoods and working in
stressful occupations, are also associated with high blood pressure (Ely
& Mostardi, 1986; Fleming et al., 1987).

ETHNICITY AND HYPERTENSION David Thomas was buying groceries and decided
to get a blood pressure check at a clinic located in the store. He found
that he was a prime candidate for a stroke and received blood pressure
treatment along with his bread. African Americans have much higher rates
of hypertension than their white counterparts, whereas Asian Americans
and American Indians have much lower rates. What factors may account for
the large between-group differences?

Migraine, Tension, and Cluster Headaches Case Study A forty-two-year-old
woman described her headaches as a throbbing that pulsed with every
heartbeat. The pain was accompanied by visual effects, such as sparklers
ﬂashing across her visual ﬁeld. The symptoms would last for up to three
days. (Adler & Rogers, 1999) Frank Weeden describes his headaches in the
following manner: "It feels like someone walked up to me, took a
screwdriver and jammed it up in my right eye and kept digging it around
for 20 minutes." (Linn, 2004, p. A1)

Headaches are among the most common psychophysiological complaints.
About 90 percent of males and 95 percent of females have at least one
headache during a given year. Over 45 million Americans suffer from
chronic, recurring headaches (Meeks, 2004). The pain of a headache can
vary in intensity from dull to excruciating. Although we discuss
migraine, tension, and cluster headaches separately, the same person can
be susceptible to more than one type of headache. (Figure 7.4
illustrates some differences among the three types.) A number of
biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural factors have been
associated with the onset of headaches, including stress, negative
emotions, sexual harassment, poor body posture, eyestrain, exercise, too
much or too little sleep, exposure to smoke or strong odors, the
weather, temperature changes, and changes in altitude (Martin &
Seneviratne, 1997; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke \[NINDS\], 2007a; Silberstein, 1998). In an experiment, Martin
and Seneviratne (1997) attempted to verify that food deprivation and
negative emotions can precipitate headaches. For nineteen hours, they
either withheld food from thirty-eight women and eighteen men who
suffered from migraine or tension headaches or exposed them to a
stressor that produced negative emotions (difficult-to-solve anagrams).
The findings supported the view that the two conditions can induce
headaches. Individuals who had been deprived of food or subjected to the
anagrams reported both more headaches and headaches of greater intensity
than individuals who had been allowed to eat or were not exposed to
stress. migraine headache moderate to severe pain resulting from
constriction of the cranial arteries followed by dilation of the

Migraine Headaches Moderate to severe pain resulting from constriction
of the cranial arteries followed by dilation of the cerebral blood
vessels are the distinguishing features of migraine headaches. Anything
that affects the size of these blood vessels, which are connected to
sensitive nerves, can produce a headache. Thus certain chemicals, such
as sodium nitrate (found in hot dogs), monosodium glutamate, and

tyramine (found in red wines), can produce headaches by distending blood
vessels in certain people. Pain from a migraine headache may be mild,
moderate, or severe. It may last from a few hours to several days and is
often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Migraines affect nearly 12
percent of the U.S. adult population, most commonly young adult women
(Hamelsky & Lipton, 2006; Marquardt, 2000). A nationwide survey (Stewart
et al., 1992) revealed that migraine headaches were common not only
among women but also among people with lower incomes. They are less
common among African Americans than among white Americans. Among young
children and adolescents, 8 million have migraines. During childhood,
migraines appear to occur at about the same rates among boys and girls.
After puberty, the headaches become more common in females (Silberstein,
1998). Migraine headaches appear to involve a biological predisposition,
such as greater reactivity of the blood vessels in the brain that
respond to physical and psychological stressors. The precise mechanism
involved, however, is not known. Physical treatments such as drug
therapy, eliminating certain foods associated with migraines, and
exercise can reduce symptoms. Several psychological interventions, such
as relaxation, cognitive therapy, and biofeedback, have also been used
to treat headaches (NINDS, 2007). Tension Headaches Tension headaches
are produced by prolonged contraction of the scalp and neck muscles,
resulting in vascular constriction and steady pain. They are the most
common form of headache and tend to disappear once the stress producing
the muscle tension is over (NINDS, 2007). In one study, psychological
factors were found to precipitate the headaches in up to 61 percent of
the patients,

most of whom were women (Martin & Seneviratne, 1997). Tension headaches
are generally not as severe as migraine headaches, and they can usually
be relieved with aspirin or other analgesics. A population-based study
(Schwartz et al., 1998) of 13,345 people revealed some prevalence rates
for tension headaches. Episodic tension headaches are relatively common,
with an overall yearly prevalence rate of 38.4 percent. The rate peaks
between the ages of thirty and thirty-nine. More women than men get
these headaches, and whites had a higher prevalence of tension headaches
(40.1 percent for men, 46.8 percent for women) than did African
Americans (22.8 percent for men, 30.9 percent for women). Interestingly,
headaches were more frequently reported among the most educated
individuals, with the highest rates occurring for those who have a
graduate school education (at nearly 49 percent for both men and women).
Cluster Headaches Cluster headaches are excruciating stabbing or burning
sensations located in the eye or cheek. Episodic cluster headaches occur
in cycles, and incapacitating attacks can occur a number of times a day
(Meeks, 2004). Each attack may last from fifteen minutes to three hours
before ending abruptly. Along with the headache, the individual may
experience tears or a stuffy nose on the same side of the head on which
the pain is felt (Silberstein, 1998). The cycles may last from several
days to months, followed by pain-free periods. In those with chronic
cluster headaches, no more than one week passes without a headache. Only
about 10 to 20 percent of cluster headaches are of the chronic type.
Cluster headaches do not appear to run in families and, in contrast to
other headaches, are more common in men (Silberstein, 1998).

Asthma

cluster headache excruciating stabbing or burning sensations located in

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways in the lungs.
Bronchiospasms, excessive mucus secretion, and edema constrict the
airways, making it difficult to completely empty the lungs and thereby
reducing the amount of air that can be inhaled (see Figure 7.5).
Symptoms range from mild and infrequent to severe daily wheezing with
the need to seek emergency care. In severe asthma attacks, respiratory
failure can occur. In the United States, asthma has increased
dramatically since the 1980s. It afflicts up to 20 million individuals,
with a disproportionate recent increase among women (Asthma and Allergy
Foundation of America, 2007). Ethnic minority children living in inner
cities are more vulnerable to asthma. In one study involving 654

Age adjusted to 2000 U.S. standard population.

American children between the ages of nine and twelve, nearly 28 percent
had symptoms of asthma (Christiansen et al., 1996). High rates of asthma
have also been reported among Puerto Rican children (Ortega et al.,
2004) and among multiracial, Native American, and African American
children. The prevalence is lowest among Asian American and Native
Hawaiian children (Rhodes, Bailey, & Moorman, 2004). Puerto Ricans and
African Americans are over three times more likely to die from asthma
than other Americans (National Center for Health Statistics, 2007).
Figure 7.6 shows the current asthma prevalence among different groups.
Many of the deaths that occur from asthma may happen because the
individual or others underestimate the severity of the attack and delay
seeking assistance; people with asthma seem to have a poor perception of
air flow obstruction. Some fail to notice when their airflow is reduced
even by 50 percent (Stout, Kotses, & Creer, 1997). Asthma appears to
have a diurnal variation: symptoms often are worse during the night and
early morning. Biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural
factors appear to all play a role in the development of asthma. First,
asthma can be triggered by allergies and may have a genetic component.
For example, the chance that a child will have asthma if one parent has
asthma is one in three. If both parents have asthma, the chances
increase to seven in ten (Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America,
2007). The recent increase in the number of asthma cases in the United
States is puzzling. Suspicion grows that a number of different
pollutants (cigarette smoke, air pollution, pet hair and dander, indoor
molds, and cockroaches) may be responsible. Rosenstreich, Eggleston, and
Kattan (1997) examined 476 children with asthma who lived in inner
cities. They found that 23 percent were allergic to pets, 35 percent to
dust mites, and 37 percent to cockroaches. Allergy to cockroaches had
the highest association with emergency room treatment, hospitalization,
and school absences in these children. A program to reduce environmental
allergens within the houses of children with asthma was associated with
a reduction in symptoms (Morgan et al., 2004).

190

C H A P T E R 7 • STRESS DISORDERS

Although pollutants may be responsible for the increase in asthma cases,
psychological, social, and sociocultural factors seem to be important in
producing attacks. Higher hostility levels among African American men
and white women were associated with significant reductions in lung
function. White men with high hostility scores did not show this
reduction. It is possible that hostility has stronger consequences for
women and minority men than for white men (Jackson, Kubzansky, Cohen, &
Jacobs, 2007). Children who have parents with asthma are more likely to
develop this condition if their family environment is characterized as
being negative when compared to children with asthmatic parents who did
not provide poor or conflictual parenting (McCarthy, 2002). Emotional
arousal has been found to be associated with decreased size of the
airways in the lungs (Isenberg, Lehrer, & Hochron, 1992) and feelings of
breathlessness in individuals with asthma (Rietveld, Everaerd, & van
Beest, 2000). In one study (Fritz, Rubenstein, & Lewiston, 1987),
psychological factors such as depression and family conflicts were found
to be the main causes in 18 percent of individuals with this disorder.
However, asthma in a child might be the cause of family conflict rather
than being the result of family problems (Chen, Bloomberg, et al.,
2003).

Stress and the Immune System

UNDER ATTACK This highly magniﬁed photo shows the surface of a T-cell
that is infected with the HIV virus. T-cells function as a part of the
immune response to viruses and infections. In this case it is being
compromised. Some believe that one's attitude can inﬂuence the
susceptibility of components of the immune system such as T-cells,
whereas others disagree.

We have already suggested a relationship between stress and illness. How
do emotional and psychological states influence the disease process? We
know that stress is related to illness, but what is the precise
relationship between the two? How does stress affect health? Stress
itself does not appear to cause infections, but it may decrease the
immune system's efficiency, thereby increasing a person's susceptibility
to disease. The white blood cells in the immune system help maintain
health by recognizing and destroying pathogens such as bacteria,
viruses, fungi, and tumors. In an intact system, over one thousand
billion white blood cells circulate through the bloodstream. Two major
classes of white blood cells are lymphocytes and phagocytes. Lymphocytes
include B-cells (which produce antibodies against invaders), T-cells
(which detect and destroy foreign cells), and natural-killer (NK) cells
(which act as an early detection system to prevent the growth of
tumors). Phagocytes similarly respond to infection (Cohen & Herbert,
1996; Kiecolt-Glaser & Glaser, 1993). As mentioned earlier, stress
produces physiological changes in the body. Part of the stress response
involves the release of several neurohormones that impair immune
functioning. Corticosteroids, for example, have very strong
immunosuppressive actions and are often used to suppress immunity caused
by allergic reactions. Endorphins, although also associated with
positive effects, such as the production of a sense of well-being, can
inhibit or decrease natural-killer cells' tumor-fighting ability. A
deficient immune system may fail to detect invaders or produce
antibodies. The ability to fight infection may be impaired, or its blood
cells may be unable to multiply. Because of the weakening in defenses,
infections and diseases are more likely to develop or worsen. Exposure
to chronic stress does appear to increase vulnerability to upper
respiratory infection and accelerates the progression of disease
(Miller, Chen, & Zhou, 2007). Cohen and his associates (1998) had 276
volunteers complete a life stressor interview, after which they were
evaluated to determine whether they were ill. Those who were healthy
were then quarantined and given nasal drops containing cold viruses to
determine whether they would develop a cold within five days. Of this
group, 84 percent became infected with the virus, but only 40 percent
developed cold symptoms. Types of life stressors varied for those who
did and did not develop colds. Participants with acute stressful life
events lasting less than one month tended not to develop colds. In
contrast, those who suffered severe stress for one or more months were
much more likely to develop colds. The types of chronic stressors most
closely related to colds were long-term conflicts with family or friends
and either unemployment or underemployment. Although deteriorations in
immune system functioning may be related to vulnerability to certain
diseases, can they influence processes such as cancer? Consider the
following case:

Can Laughter or Humor Inﬂuence the Course of a Disease?

C

lown noses, whoopee cushions, and the antics of the Three Stooges can
produce laughter. Can humor reduce the severity of a physical illness or
even be curative? Norman Cousins, who suffered from rheumatoid disease,
described how he recovered his health through laughter. He claimed that
ten minutes of laughter would provide two hours of pain relief (Cousins,
1979). In 1999, Patch Adams, a physician who used humor with his
patients, received an award for "excellence in the ﬁeld of therapeutic
humor" at the American Association of Therapeutic Humor. Ohio
psychologist Steve Wilson quit clinical practice in 1998 to found the
World Laughter Tour and to teach classes in therapeutic laughter. He
believes humor can reduce the need for pain medication, possibly boost
immune functioning, and lower blood pressure ("Psychosomatic Medicine,"
2004). Some research shows that exposing participants to humorous videos
reduces stress and improves immune system functioning (Bennett, Zeller,
Rosenberg, & McCann, 2003). However, the evidence is mixed and
relatively weak (Bennett & Lengacher, 2006). How might humor inﬂuence
the disease process? Several routes are possible:

1.  Humor may have a direct impact on physiological functioning.
2.  Humor may inﬂuence people's beliefs about their ability to carry out
    health-promoting behaviors and give them greater conﬁdence that
    their actions can relieve the illness.
3.  Humor may serve as a buffer between exposure to stressors and the
    development of negative states, such as depression, which have been
    found to be related to the development or severity of physical
    conditions.
4.  Humor may make an individual more likely to receive social support
    from friends and family. For Further Consideration
5.  How would you respond to researchers who might argue that laughter
    and humor are ineffective in slowing the progression of a disease
    such as cancer and that it is disrespectful to furnish patients with
    false hope?
6.  Knowing that humor does produce physiological changes in the body,
    what are some criticisms of studies that indicate that it has little
    impact on the disease process?

Case Study Anne was an unhappy and passive individual who always acceded
to the wishes and demands of her husband. She had difﬁculty expressing
strong emotions, especially anger, and often repressed her feelings. She
had few friends and, other than her husband, had no one to talk to. She
was also depressed and felt a pervasive sense of hopelessness. During a
routine physical exam, her doctor discovered a lump in her breast. The
results of a biopsy revealed that the tumor was malignant.

Could Anne's personality or emotional state have contributed to the
formation or the growth of the malignant tumor? If so, how? Could she
now alter the course of her disease by changing her emotional state and
thereby improving her immune functioning? Several problems exist in
research that investigates the relationship between moods and
personality on cancer (Honda & Goodwin, 2004). First, cancer is a
general name for a variety of disease processes, each of which may have
a varying susceptibility to emotions. Second, cancer develops over a
relatively long period of time. Determining a temporal relationship
between its occurrence and a specific mood or personality is not
possible. Third, most studies examining the relationship between
psychological variables and cancer have been retrospective---that is,
personality or mood states were assessed after the cancer was diagnosed.
The discovery that one has a life-threatening disease can produce a
variety of emotions. People who receive the life-threatening diagnosis
of cancer may respond with depression, anxiety, and confusion. Thus,
instead of being a cause, negative emotions may be a result of the
knowledge of having a life-threatening disease. Do stress, emotional
difficulties, or personality characteristics increase the chance that a
person will develop cancer or increase the cancer's severity if it does
occur? Certain emotions and stressors have been associated with a less
efficient immune system, and under these conditions cancer might be more
likely to gain a foothold. Nevertheless, the connection between stress
and naturally occurring cancers has yet to

192

C H A P T E R 7 • STRESS DISORDERS

be demonstrated. In a critical review of the literature on the impact of
psychological factors on the progression of cancer, Coyne, Stefanek, and
Palmer (2007) concluded, "an adequately powered study examining effects
of psychotherapy on survival after a diagnosis of cancer would require
resources that are not justified by the strength of the available
evidence" (p. 367).

Etiology of Psychophysiological Disorders Case Study Florida was hit by
four hurricanes within a six-week period. One woman was able to deal
with the ﬁrst, even though Hurricane Francis smashed her windows, ﬂooded
her carpets, and caused her to throw food away. Then Hurricane Jeanne
hit her again, causing similar damage. She had to wait in the hot sun to
get ice and was without food or water for her children. As she related,
"The ﬁrst one, I stayed strong. But this second one, I started crying
and couldn't stop." (Barton, 2004, p. A3)

As we have seen, not everyone who faces stressful events develops an
illness or shows reduced immune functioning. Daily living involves
constant exposure to stressors: work expectations at school or on the
job, relationship problems, illness, marriage, divorce, and aging, to
name a few. Why is it that only some individuals develop a physical
disorder when exposed to stressors? In this section, we use the
multipath model to explore some of the biological, psychological,
social, and sociocultural dimensions of the disease process, as shown in
Figure 7.7. Although we are discussing these dimensions separately,
there are significant interactions among them.

Biological Dimension Stressors can directly produce physiological
changes through the release of neurohormones (epinephrine,
norepinephrine, catecholamines, and cortisol). These neurohormones,
along with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, prepare the
body for emergency action by increasing heart rate, respiration,
alertness, and decreased vulnerability to inflammation. This preparation
helps humans respond

quickly to a crisis situation. However, when such activation occurs over
an extended period of time, a psychophysiological disorder can develop
(Stone et al., 2000; White & Moorey, 1997). Table 7.2 compares
short-term adaptive responses of the body to stressors with symptoms
that sometimes develop when these physiological reactions continue and
become chronic. As mentioned earlier, physical conditions such as
headaches, asthma, hypertension, and immune functioning may have a
genetic component. In addition, exposure to chronic stress results in
the continued activation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal systems
and the release of stress hormones that contribute to
psychophysiological disorders and a weakened immune system. Early
environmental influences such as traumatic childhood experiences may
also produce changes in brain structure and in the stress-responsive
neurobiological systems, resulting in increased vulnerability to the
development of a psychophysiological disorder (Anda et al., 2006). Three
other biological explanations for psychophysiological disorders have
been suggested: somatic weakness, autonomic response specificity, and
general adaptation syndrome. The somatic weakness hypothesis is a
commonsense explanation for the development of particular
psychophysiological disorders. This view suggests that congenital
factors or vulnerability acquired through physical trauma or illness may
predispose a particular organ to develop irregularities when exposed to
stressors. The particular physiological disorder that develops is
determined by whichever system is the "weakest link" in the body.
Logical as it may seem, the somatic weakness hypothesis is difficult to
validate because it is not yet possible to measure the relative
strengths of the different physical systems in the human body before a
bodily weakness appears. Closely related to the somatic weakness
hypothesis is the concept of autonomic response specificity---the
hypothesis that some individuals respond to different stressors with the
same physiological response. For example, an individual who constantly
shows exaggerated cardiovascular reactions to a number of different
situations may be more likely to develop hypertension. In fact, twins
have been found to respond similarly with increases in blood pressure
under stress (De Geus et al., 2007). Tuomisto (1997) found that, when
exposed to different stressors, individuals with hypertension displayed
an exaggerated reactivity in blood pressure compared with individuals
without hypertension. The suggestion that these physiological responses
are innate is supported by researchers who have observed that
distinctive autonomic behavior patterns in infants tended to persist
throughout early childhood (Thomas, Chess, & Birch, 1968).

193

194

C H A P T E R 7 • STRESS DISORDERS

Hans Selye (1956, 1982) proposed a helpful model for understanding the
body's physical reaction to biological stressors. He put forth a
three-stage model, which he called the general adaptation syndrome
(GAS), for understanding the body's physical and psychological reaction
to biological stressors. The stages are alarm, resistance, and
exhaustion. Selye describes the alarm stage as a "call to arms" of the
body's defenses when it is invaded or assaulted biologically. During
this first stage, the body reacts immediately to the assault, with rapid
heartbeat, loss of muscle tone, and decreased temperature and blood
pressure. A rebound reaction follows as the adrenal cortex enlarges and
the adrenal glands secrete corticoid hormones. This initial response
enhances the body's recovery from injury (Underwood, 2005). If exposure
to the stressor continues, the adaptation or resistance stage follows.
The body mobilizes itself to defend, destroy, or coexist with the injury
or disease. The symptoms of illness may disappear. With HIV, for
example, the immune system reacts by producing nearly a billion
lymphocytes a day to combat the virus. Over time, the immune system
gradually weakens and is overcome (Ho et al., 1995). The decrease in the
body's resistance increases its susceptibility to other infections or
illnesses. If the stressor continues to tax the body's finite resistive
resources, the symptoms may reappear as exhaustion of the defense system
sets in (thus the name exhaustion stage). If stress continues unabated,
death may result. Research does support the view that brief exposure to
stressors enhances immune functioning, whereas long-lasting stress is
associated with its deterioration (Segerstrom & Miller, 2004). Although
genetics and physiological response to chronic stress play a role in
physical illness, so do psychological, social, and sociocultural
factors.

Psychological Dimension Psychological and personality characteristics
can also mediate the effects of exposure to stressors. For example, a
longitudinal study of remaining employees after nearly half of the
workforce was removed during downsizing showed that although twothirds
developed health problems, one-third appeared to thrive. The individuals
who did well had three characteristics: (1) commitment---they were
involved in ongoing changes rather than giving up and feeling isolated;
(2) control---they made attempts to influence decisions and refused to
feel powerless, and (3) challenge---changes were viewed as opportunities
(Maddi, 2002). Depression Psychological conditions such as depression
can influence both physiological functioning and behaviors that affect
health. Depressed individuals show a dysregulation of the autonomic
nervous system. They have elevated levels of catecholamines (epinephrine
and norepinephrine), resulting in exaggerated cardiovascular responses
to stressors (Carney, Freedland, & Veith, 2005). In addition, an
individual who is depressed may sleep and exercise less, eat less
healthy food, and consume more caffeine, alcohol, or cigarettes. A
depressed individual may also be less likely to seek help or follow a
treatment regimen (Weinman & Petrie, 1997). These behaviors may in turn
increase the individual's susceptibility to disease or may prolong an
existing illness. Also, an individual's beliefs about the causes,
symptoms, duration, and curability of the disease may determine whether
the person seeks help and follows the treatment program. Patients who
strongly believe that an illness is controllable or treatable often
recover more quickly than others who believe otherwise.

biological stressors

Helplessness or Control Control and the perception of control over the
environment and its stressors appear to mitigate the effects of stress.
In a study of older adults with physical health problems, those who had
high levels of control behaviors, such as engaging in health-improving
strategies, seeking help, and remaining motivated to address their
physical problems, did not show the pattern of biological dysregulation
typical of those with health issues (Wrosch et al., 2007).

Etiology of Psychophysiological Disorders

One study of nursing home residents examined the impact of control on
the residents' health and emotional states (Langer & Rodin, 1976). In
the "responsibility induced" group, residents were allowed to make
certain decisions, such as how to arrange their rooms, when to see
movies, whether to accept visitors, and whether to have plants in their
rooms. The "traditional" group was not offered these choices and had
decisions made for them. Within a short period, the nurses rated 71
percent of the traditional group as more debilitated and 93 percent of
the responsibility-induced group as improved. Self-report questionnaires
revealed that the responsibility-induced group rated themselves as
happier and more active. Mortality rates also differed between the two
groups. After eighteen months, 15 percent (7 of 47) of those in the
responsibility-induced group had died versus 30 percent (13 of 44) in
the traditional group. The reason for the differences in mortality rates
is unclear. Some deaths, however, might be associated with a less
efficient immune system.

195

CONTROL AND STRESS The lack of a sense of control or unpredictability
can dramatically increase stress. Alma Rollins, an interpreter, tells of
the impact of the immigration raids at the Swift & Company meat packing
plant in Nebraska on both the workers and their children. The effects of
the raids produced emotional turmoil and stress reactions in those
affected. Approximately ﬁve million U.S. children have at least one
undocumented parent, and researchers are determining the effect of
potential deportation on their mental health.

Self-Efﬁcacy Another cognitive variable that appears to have an impact
on illness is the belief in one's ability to take action to attain goals
or to effect change. An individual with high self-efficacy may engage in
more health-related activities when an illness occurs, whereas low
self-efficacy would result in feelings of hopelessness. Self-efficacy
has been related to recovery from orthopedic surgery; the stronger the
belief in the ability to recover by participating in rehabilitation, the
more successful the outcome (Waldrop et al., 2001).

Hostility The emotion of hostility has been implicated in several
physiological disorders, particularly coronary heart disease (Richards
et al., 2000). Several possibilities exist that may explain the
relationship between hostility and coronary heart disease. First,
hostility may increase the hostile person's cardiovascular responsivity
and physiology, subsequently increasing the risk of developing coronary
heart disease. At least one study (Miller et al., 1998) supports this
view. In that study, individuals who scored high on hostility showed
exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity to a stressor (verbal harassment)
compared with participants who were low on hostility. Thus hostility may
lead to damaging physiological responses. The experience of strong anger
in young healthy males when they were frustrated or treated unfairly was
related to elevations in serum cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins,
both of which have been found to increase the risk of developing
coronary heart disease (Richards et al., 2000). Hostility in children
and adolescents has also been related to elevated lipids and blood
pressure (Raikkonen, Matthews, & Salomon, 2003). Optimism Optimism,
another cognitive state, also appears to mediate the impact of a
disease. In a study on psychosocial predictors of the course of illness
in men with AIDS, Taylor and colleagues (2000) found that those with a
high realistic acceptance of death died an average of nine months
earlier than those with a low realistic acceptance. What might cause
such a difference? The researchers believe that "an optimistic, even
unrealistically optimistic, view of the future, may reserve resources
that not only help people manage the ebb and flow of everyday life but
that assume special significance in helping people cope with intensely
stressful and life-threatening events" (p. 106).

ocial isolation has been associated with decreased immune functioning.
Is this due to the physiological impact of isolation, or to the fact
that socially connected individuals have friends who might bring them
food or medicine when they are ill? Hermes and colleagues (2006)
compared rats raised in isolation with those who lived in a small group.
All were fed the same amount of food. When a substance was injected
under their skin, the rats that were isolated took longer to heal.
Isolation itself was responsible for the poorer immune response.

196

C H A P T E R 7 • STRESS DISORDERS

Social Dimension Coronary heart disease, impaired immunological
functioning, and other adverse health outcomes has been associated with
a variety of social stressors (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004; Pike et al.,
1997). Having a strong social network is associated with positive health
behaviors (Cohen & Lemay, 2007). Divorced or separated men tend to have
more physical illness than their married counterparts (Eaker et al.,
2007), and separated and divorced men who were preoccupied with thoughts
of their former partners showed a lower level of immune functioning
(Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1987). Abrasive marital interactions between
long-married men and women are also associated with negative health
changes (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1997). Number and quality of social
relationships may also affect our vulnerability to illnesses, and a
person's perception or interpretation of the event is important, as
well. Although our discussion has focused on the direct physiological
impact of stress on health, indirect pathways must also be considered.
For example, an individual with a spouse or a large social network may
receive encouragement for healthy eating habits, exercise, and other
health-promoting activities, thus increasing resistance to disease.

Sociocultural Dimension

Did You Know?

S

pirituality and religion have been shown to be associated with physical
health. In one study of 5,300 African Americans, a group at risk for
high blood pressure, those involved in religious activities had
signiﬁcantly lower blood pressure than those who were not. This effect
was found even though religious African Americans were heavier and had
lower levels of medication adherence. Source: Wyatt (2006).

Conflicts with societal standards, discrimination, and cultural
expectations can have a significant impact on health. Women are more
likely to be affected by stress because of their role as caregivers for
children, partners, and parents (Stambor, 2006). Women who reported high
job stress or who perceived their relationships with their bosses to be
poor had higher fibrinogen levels than those found among other female
employees. Fibrinogen, a blood-clotting compound, may contribute to
coronary heart disease by contributing to atherosclerosis and the
formation of blood clots (Davis, Mathews, Meilahn, & Kiss, 1995).
Although genetic and other biological explanations may explain the high
rate of hypertension in African Americans, another line of research
supports a sociocultural explanation. Exposure to racism is associated
with elevations in cardiovascular responses in African American men and
women (Clark, 2006; Merritt et al., 2006). African Americans who watched
videos or imagined depictions of social situations involving racism
showed increases in heart rate and blood pressure (Fang & Myers, 2001;
Jones et al., 1996). Elevations in cardiovascular responses were also
observed among a sample of African American men who were exposed to
subtle racism (Merritt et al., 2006). Thus exposure to discrimination
may function as a prevalent stressor and increase the chances of
hypertension (Troxel et al., 2003). However, at least among African
American women, the relationship may be more complicated. Increases in
blood pressure when exposed to racism were only found among women who
were low in seeking social support; those who were high in seeking
social support did not show this tendency (Clark, 2006). Thus coping
ability, resources, and social support may mitigate vascular reactivity.
Cultural changes or conflict can also affect health. In a study of
Japanese persons living in Japan, Hawaii, and California, the highest
mortality rate from coronary heart disease was found among those living
in California and the lowest among those living in Japan. This
difference was not accounted for by the risk factors for coronary heart
disease discussed earlier in this chapter. In trying to decide what was
responsible for the variation in mortality rates, the researchers
compared Japanese immigrants who had maintained a traditional lifestyle
with those who had acculturated (adopted the habits and attitudes
prevalent in their new country). The coronary heart disease rate for
acculturated Japanese individuals was five times greater than that for
those who had retained their traditional values (Marmot & Syme, 1976).
Perhaps breaking close social and community ties, which is part of the
acculturation process, promoted a greater vulnerability to the disease.

197

MAINTAINING TRADITION AND REDUCING RISK Japanese Americans who maintain
traditional lifestyles have a lower rate of coronary heart disease than
those who have acculturated. The difference does not appear to be due to
diet or other investigated risk factors. What reasons can you come up
with to explain the ﬁndings?

Cultural changes also have been found to affect health in Samoa. Samoans
have a culture that stresses rigid control of behaviors, including
strict discipline for children, control of anger for females, and
suppression of emotions in adults. Steele and McGarvey (1997)
hypothesized that the Samoan traditional pattern in which women were
expected to suppress their emotions could conflict with the expanded
roles expected by modern young women, resulting in increases in blood
pressure. In support of their hypothesis, the investigators found an
interesting contrast: higher blood pressure was related to an inhibition
of anger in young women but to an outward expression of anger in older
women. The roles or behavior patterns the women were socialized to
(modern or traditional) appeared to influence whether the expression of
anger increased blood pressure.

Treatment of Psychophysiological Disorders Psychotherapy has been found
to be effective in treating the psychophysiological disorders.
Individuals who showed "burnout" due to chronic job stress had
significantly lower cortisol levels as compared with a control group.
After fourteen sessions of psychotherapy, they showed an increase in
morning cortisol levels (Mommersteeg et al., 2006). Although mind-body
techniques may not cure illness, individuals who engage in
stress-management techniques report less pain, less anxiety, improved
sleep, a higher quality of life, and a sense of participation in their
treatment. Stress hormones are also reduced (Tyre, 2004). Treatment
programs for psychophysiological disorders generally consist of both
medical treatment for the physical symptoms and psychological therapy to
eliminate stress and anxiety. This combination provides a wide array of
approaches to these disorders, with mainly positive results. Two of the
dominant psychological approaches are stress management and anxiety
management programs, which usually include either relaxation training or
biofeedback.

Relaxation Training Relaxation training is a therapeutic technique in
which a person acquires the ability to relax the muscles of the body in
almost any circumstance. It is possible that this reduces the "fight or
flight" reaction that may be triggered by muscle tension (Marr, 2006).
Progressive muscle relaxation has been effective in reducing
physiological arousal and the impact of stressors (Rausch, Gramling, &
Auerbach, 2006).

198

C H A P T E R 7 • STRESS DISORDERS

Current programs are typically modeled after Jacobson's (1938, 1967)
progressive relaxation training. Imagine that you are a patient who is
beginning the training. You are instructed to concentrate on one set of
muscles at a time---first tensing them and then relaxing them. First you
clench your fists as tightly as possible for approximately ten seconds,
then you release them. As you release your tightened muscles, you are
asked to focus on the sensation of warmth and looseness in your hands.
You practice this tightening and relaxing cycle several times before
proceeding to the next muscle group, in your lower arms. After each
muscle group has received individual attention in tensing and relaxing,
the trainer asks you to tighten and then relax your entire body. The
emphasis throughout the procedure is on the contrast between the
feelings produced during tensing and those produced during relaxing. For
a novice, the entire exercise lasts about thirty minutes. A
relaxation-based treatment was found to be effective in producing
"clinically significant" reductions in headache activity among recurrent
headache sufferers. The program was unique in that it was conducted over
the Internet and through e-mail. Participants received instructions for
applied relaxation and its application in stressful situations. Although
dropout rates were high, a large number of participants appeared to
benefit from a minimal-therapist-contact and self-help-focused
intervention (Strom, Pettersson, & Andersson, 2000).

Biofeedback In biofeedback training, the client is taught to voluntarily
control some physiological functions, such as heart rate or blood
pressure. During training, the client receives second-by-second
information (feedback) regarding the activity of the organ or function
of interest. For someone attempting to lower high blood pressure, for
example, the feedback might be actual blood pressure readings, which are
presented visually on a screen or as some auditory signal transmitted
through a set of headphones. The biofeedback device enables the patient
to learn to control the targeted physiological function. Eventually the
patient learns to use that method without benefit of the feedback
device.

Case Study A twenty-three-year-old male patient reported having a
resting heart rate that varied between 95 and 120 beats when he was in
high school. This variation was associated with apprehension over exams.
The patient came into treatment because his high rate had continued and
he was concerned that it might lead to a serious cardiac condition. The
treatment consisted of eight sessions of biofeedback training. The
patient's heart rate was monitored, and he was provided with both a
visual and an auditory feedback signal. After the treatment period and
one year later, his heart rate had stabilized and was within normal
limits (73 beats per minute). The patient reported that he had learned
to control his heart rate during stressful situations by both relaxing
and concentrating on reducing the heart rate. (Janssen, 1983)

biofeedback training

a therapeutic approach that combines physiological and behavioral
approaches, in which a patient receives information regarding particular
autonomic functions and is rewarded for inﬂuencing those functions in a
desired direction

Biofeedback is essentially an operant conditioning technique in which
the feedback serves as reinforcement. It has been used to help people
lower their heart rates and decrease their blood pressure during
stressful situations (Nakao et al., 1997; Shahidi & Salmon, 1992), treat
migraine and tension headaches (Holroyd et al., 1995; Hovanitz & Wander,
1990), decrease the need for medication in asthma (Lehrer et al., 2004),
reduce muscle tension (Gamble & Elder, 1983), and redirect blood flow
(Reading & Mohr, 1976). Biofeedback and verbal reinforcement were used
to help children with asthma control their respiratory functioning
(Kahn, Staerk, & Bonk, 1974).

Cognitive-Behavioral Interventions Because hostility is associated with
hypertension, cognitive-behavioral programs have been developed to
reduce the expression of this emotion. In one study, individuals with
hypertension participated in a six-week anger management program (Larkin
&

Treatment of Psychophysiological Disorders

Zayfert, 1996). When initially exposed to confrontational roleplaying
situations, they experienced sharp rises in blood pressure. The
participants learned to relax by using muscle relaxation techniques and
to change their thoughts about confrontational situations. They also
received assertiveness training to learn appropriate ways of expressing
disagreements. After the various types of training, their blood pressure
was significantly reduced when they again participated in
confrontational role-playing scenes. The discovery or knowledge that one
has a life-threatening disease can affect an individual's belief system.
The world may be seen as unfair, leading to feelings of depression or
avoidance and an inability to process the disease experience.
Social-cognitive processing approaches attempt to help the individual
adjust and find validation and meaning in the experience. In a study of
seventy women cancer survivors, the type of cognitive process was found
to predict adjustment to cancer (Cordova et al., 2001). Those who were
unable to cognitively process their diseases because of invalidation
("When I talk about cancer, my husband tells me I'm living in the past")
or because of discomfort ("It's difficult to share with those you love,
as they are scared, too"; p. 709) reported more depressive symptoms. In
contrast, women who reported being able to talk about cancer were less
depressed and better adjusted. Cognitive strategies to improve coping
skills and to manage stress have also been effective in improving both
physiological functioning and psychological distress in HIV-positive men
(Cruess et al., 2000). Patients with asthma who engaged in three
sessions of writing about a trauma ("write about the most stressful
experience in your life") significantly improved lung function as
opposed to those who wrote only about time management (Stone et al.,
2000). With many diseases, having the opportunity to express fears, to
cognitively process beliefs, and to develop adaptive strategies appears
to improve patients' feelings of wellbeing and physical health.

CONTROLLING PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES Meditation is associated with a
relaxed bodily state produced by minimizing distractions and focusing on
a positive image, mantra, or word. This process has been associated with
the reduction in the level of stress hormones and the development of a
sense of control. It has been found to be helpful in the treatment of
hypertension and headaches.

As we mentioned earlier, psychologists are becoming increasingly aware
that single-cause models of psychophysiological illness are inadequate.
Not everyone exposed to the same set of stressors develops a
psychophysiological disorder. In addition, we must be able to explain
why an individual develops coronary heart disease rather than asthma. It
is clear that the search for an explanation must consider biological,
psychological, social, and sociocultural dimensions. We are just
beginning to understand the biology of stress disorders and the specific
brain structures involved, but many questions remain. For example, what
does it mean that parts of the brain become "sensitized"? Have
structural changes occurred, and are they reversible? Psychological
characteristics also mediate the relationship between a stressor and its
impact on the body. Negative emotions may amplify the event, whereas
cognitive characteristics such as control, optimism, and self-efficacy
may defuse its impact. Do these qualities directly affect physical
health through the immune system, or is it that individuals with these
qualities behave in a manner that affects health (amount of exercise,
sleep, type of food)? Social networks and sociocultural factors have
also been found to be related to health. Why does marriage appear to
have more health benefits for men than for women? Why are there gender
and racial differences in the prevalence of both the psychological and
physical stress disorders? As you can see, many questions remain that
can be answered only by continuing to examine the multitude of possible
contributors to the stress disorders.

I M P L I C AT I O N S

Summary 1. What are acute and posttraumatic stress disorders, and how
are they diagnosed? ■ Acute and posttraumatic stress disorders involve
expo-

sure to a traumatic event, resulting in intrusive memories of the
occurrence, attempts to forget or repress the memories, emotional
withdrawal, and increased arousal. ■ Acute stress disorder (ASD) is
characterized by anxi-

ety and dissociative symptoms that occur within one month after exposure
to a traumatic stressor. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is
characterized by anxiety, dissociative, and other symptoms that last for
more than one month and that occur as a result of exposure to extreme
trauma. 2. What causes acute and posttraumatic stress disorders? ■
Various

biological, psychological, sociocultural, and social factors have been
implicated in the stress disorders. Possible biological factors involve
a sensitized autonomic system, involvement of stress hormones, and brain
cell damage. Psychological factors include level of cognitive
functioning, trait anxiety and depression, and classic conditioning.
Poor or inadequate support during childhood has also been identified as
possibly contributing to the development of the stress disorders, as
have various sociocultural factors, such as immigration status and
gender.

3.  What are the different treatments for acute and posttraumatic stress
    disorders? ■ Antidepressant medication has been successful in the

treatment of ASD and PTSD, as has exposure to cues associated with the
trauma. Exposure and cognitivebased therapies such as psychoeducation
have also proven effective in some cases. 4. What role do stressors play
in physical health, and what are the psychophysiological disorders? ■
Any external events or situations that place a physi-

cal or psychological demand on a person can serve as stressors and can
affect physical health. Stressors can range from chronic irritation and
frustration to acute and traumatic events. ■ A

psychophysiological disorder is any physical disorder that has a strong
psychological basis or component. Psychophysiological disorders involve
actual

200

tissue damage (such as coronary heart disease), a disease process
(immune impairment), or physiological dysfunction (as in asthma or
migraine headaches). Examples of psychophysiological disorders include
coronary heart disease (CHD); essential hypertension; migraine, tension,
and cluster headaches; and asthma. ■ Not everyone develops an illness
when exposed to the

same stressor or traumatic event because stress is an internal
psychological or physiological response to a stressor. Individuals
reacting to the same stressor may do so in very different ways. 5. What
causes psychophysiological disorders? ■ Various biological,
psychological, sociocultural, and social factors have been implicated in
the psychophysiological disorders. ■ Biological explanations include (1)
chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system and continual
release of neurohormones, (2) genetic contributions, and (3) somatic
weakness, autonomic response specificity, and general adaptation
syndrome. ■ Psychological contributors include characteristics such as
helplessness versus control, optimism, hostility, selfefficacy, and the
role of classical and operant conditioning in acquiring or maintaining
these disorders. ■ Social contributors include having an inadequate
social network, abrasive interpersonal interactions, a stressful
environment, and, for men, being unmarried. ■ Sociocultural factors such
as gender, racial, or ethnic background are risk factors in certain
physiological disorders. Stressful environments associated with poverty,
prejudice and racism, and cultural conflicts have been related to
illnesses. 6. What methods have been developed to treat
psychophysiological disorders? ■ These disorders are treated through
stress management

or anxiety management programs, combined with medical treatment for
physical symptoms or conditions. ■ Relaxation training and biofeedback
training, which help the client learn to control muscular or organic
functioning, are usually a part of such programs. ■ Cognitive-behavioral
interventions, which involve changing anxiety-arousing thoughts, have
also been useful.

Personality Disorders

T

he epitome of a hard-driven, successful businessman, Robert T. seemed to
have it all: enormous ﬁnancial wealth, inﬂuence with politicians, a
private jet, a young, beautiful wife, and, despite his reputation as a
ruthless corporate raider, he enjoyed high regard from associates for
his business acumen. Then, in less than a year, he lost everything,
including his wife, who ﬁled for divorce. Stockholders raised questions
about nonstandard accounting practices, inappropriate personal use of
funds for family vacations, and unauthorized purchase of properties in
the name of his wife. When banks refused to loan him funds on a
prospective takeover bid and creditors demanded repayment of loans, his
ﬁnancial world collapsed. Lawsuits from investors against Robert and his
company followed, with the trustees ﬁnally demanding his resignation.
Although Robert refused to resign and launched a campaign against his
own board of directors, accusing them of a personal vendetta and of
conspiring against him, he was eventually removed from his post. Only
with his downfall did the facts about Robert's tendency to exaggerate
and distort the truth become known. He was not a graduate of the Wharton
School of Business, as his resume had indicated; he had told people that
he was divorced once, but in fact he had been married four times (two of
the marriages ended in divorce before age twenty); and his fortune did
not come from "old money" but from a series of questionable business
schemes in real estate that often left investors holding bad debts: he
referred to them as "collateral damage." People who knew him in the past
often described him as deceitful, cunning, and calculating. He showed a
disregard for the rights of others, manipulated them, and then discarded
them when they served no further use to him. This attribute was evident
even in his early years. For example, he had married a sixteen-year-old
girl from a wealthy family, but when her father refused to support them,
Robert blamed his wife and constantly belittled her until their divorce
three months later. He never expressed regret or remorse for any of his
actions but operated from a belief that "this is a dog-eat-dog

in therapy, but school records revealed a pattern of juvenile alcohol
use, poor grades, frequent lying, and petty theft. At age fourteen, he
was tentatively diagnosed with a conduct disorder when school ofﬁcials
became concerned with his fascination for setting ﬁres in the restroom
toilets. Nevertheless, it is interesting that the school psychologist
described Robert as "charming, very bright, persuasive, and with high
potential for future success."

personality disorder a disorder characterized by inﬂexible,
long-standing, and maladaptive personality traits that cause signiﬁcant
functional impairment, subjective distress, or a combination of both for
the individual

202

Robert T. typifies our definition of an individual with a personality
disorder in that he possesses a constellation of inflexible,
long-standing, and maladaptive personality traits that cause significant
functional impairment, subjective distress, or a combination of both
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). As we shall shortly see,
Robert can best be described as having an antisocial personality
disorder. He pushes the boundaries of social convention and often
violates moral, legal, and ethical rules for his own personal gain, with
little regard for the feelings of others. His characteristic way of
handling things is long-standing and developmental in nature (evident in
his early teens; Weston & Riolo, 2007). Although these traits can be
quite functional in some settings, they inevitably bring about personal
and social difficulties (Millon et al., 2004). People with personality
disorders often display temperamental deficiencies or aberrations
(Robert's tendency to blame others), rigidity in dealing with life
problems (deceiving others through lying, exaggeration, and
manipulation), and defective perceptions of self and others ("do unto
others before they do unto you"). In spite of all these difficulties,
people with personality disorders often function well enough to get
along without aid from others. They often fall under the radar and are
simply described as odd, peculiar, dramatic, or unusual. They may not
see themselves as having a problem. For example, a person with a
pronounced tendency to avoid social interactions is described as "shy"
(avoidant personality disorder), a person with a strong self-orientation
is described as "selfish" (narcissistic personality disorder), and a
person with a preference to be alone is described as a "hermit"
(schizoid personality disorder). Indeed, some pronounced personality
traits may actually serve as an asset in some situations (such as Robert
T.'s behaviors in a highly competitive business environment). For these
reasons, many people with personality disorders rarely come to the
attention of mental health professionals, seldom seek help from them,
and often terminate prematurely when in therapy (Millon et al., 2004).
As a result, the incidence of personality disorders has been difficult
to ascertain, but available statistics indicate that these disorders
account for 5 to 15 percent of admissions to hospitals and outpatient
clinics. The overall lifetime prevalence of personality disorders is 9
to 13 percent, which suggests that the disorders are relatively common
in the general population (Lenzenweger et al., 2007; Phillips, Yen, &
Gunderson, 2004; Weissman, 1993).

Diagnosing Personality Disorders

Diagnosing Personality Disorders All of us have characteristic ways of
responding, thinking, and feeling when encountering situations or other
people. Some of us are outgoing, sociable, and adventurous in new or
unfamiliar situations. Others of us are more cautious, laid back, and
hesitant to form new relationships until we have adequately familiarized
ourselves with our surrounding environment. In other words, most of us
have a degree of consistency and predictability in our outlook on life
and in how we approach people and situations (Millon et al., 2004). Yet
all of us possess a degree of flexibility in how we respond to similar
or different situations. A shy coworker, for example, is not necessarily
shy in all situations, nor when he or she gets to know other employees.
People with personality disorders, however, possess extreme patterns of
responding that are inflexible, long-standing, and enduring and that can
extend into the elderly years (Abrams & Bromberg, 2007); they are shy
and withdrawn in nearly all situations and continue to be uncomfortable
even with people they know well. Personality disorders begin early in
life and generally become evident in adolescence (Weston & Riolo, 2007),
but there are frequently telltale signs in childhood, as well. Robert T.
was diagnosed with a conduct disorder in middle school, which is often
thought to be a forerunner of antisocial personality disorder (Millon et
al., 2004). DSM-IV-TR uses the following criteria to diagnose a
personality disorder. 1. Enduring pattern of inner experience and
behavior that deviates from person's culture in two or more of the
following areas: cognition, affect, interpersonal functioning, or
impulse control. 2. Relatively inflexible and pervasive across personal
and social situations. 3. Significant distress or impairment in social,
occupational, and other areas of functioning. 4. Pattern is stable and
long-term and can be traced to adolescence or early childhood. 5. Not
accounted for by another mental or general medical condition. In
diagnosing a personality disorder, DSM-IV-TR recognizes the importance
of culture and ethnicity. It acknowledges that culture shapes habits,
customs, values, and personality characteristics, so that expressions of
personality in one culture may differ from those in another culture.
Asians, for example, are more likely to exhibit shyness and
collectivism, whereas Americans are more likely to show assertiveness
and individualism (Sue & Sue, 2008a). Japanese people and Asian Indians
(South Asians) display the overt dependent behaviors characteristic of
dependent personality disorders more than Americans or Europeans display
them (Bornstein, 1997). Does this mean that people in Japan and India
are more likely to have this personality disorder? More likely, the high
incidence of these behaviors reflects the influence of other factors,
one of which may be cultural bias in the classification system. In one
study conducted in the United Kingdom, it was found that whites were 2.8
times more likely to be given a diagnosis of antisocial personality
disorder than African Caribbeans (Mikton & Grounds, 2007). The diagnosis
varied not only with the race of the client but also with that of the
clinician. The three possible explanations of bias were (1) belief that
antisocial and criminal behavior is more "normal" among African
Caribbean men, (2) tendency to attribute antisocial behavior to
environmental factors for blacks, and (3) reluctance to attribute
pathology to blacks because of sensitivity to risks of prejudice and
stigmatization. Anyone making judgments about personality functioning
and disturbance must consider the individual's cultural, ethnic, and
social background (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Gender
implications are also important in the diagnosis of personality
disorders, although there are some inconsistencies due primarily to the
year of the studies and the locations from which the populations are
drawn (Millon et al., 2004). One major

203

204

C H A P T E R 8 • PERSONALITY DISORDERS

study found that men are more likely than women to be diagnosed as
having antisocial personality disorder (Grant et al., 2004), whereas
women more often receive diagnoses of borderline, dependent, or
histrionic personality disorders (Millon et al., 2004; Torgersen,
Kringlen, & Cramer, 2001). The existence of gender differences in the
diagnosis of certain personality disorders is widely known in the
profession. The question, however, is whether these differences are
attributable to biases in making diagnoses or to actual gender
variations in disorders (Widiger & Coker, 2002). It is important to note
that personality disorders are diagnosed under Axis II in the DSM-IV-TR,
whereas most of the other disorders are reported under Axis I. As you
recall, the multiaxial classification of mental disorders lists all the
clinical disorders on Axis I, whereas personality disorders, mental
retardation, and long-standing defenses are noted on Axis II. This
distinction is made for several reasons: (1) it is believed that
personality disorders are distinct from Axis I disorders in that they
are chronic, developmental, and relatively inflexible patterns of
responding that are less likely to be successfully changed in treatment,
and (2) given this reasoning, it is entirely possible for a personality
disorder to coexist with one or more clinical disorders on Axis I. For
example, a person with a personality disorder may also be diagnosed with
schizophrenia or alcohol dependency (Axis I disorders). Usually, people
with personality disorders are hospitalized only when a second, Axis I
superimposed disorder so impairs social functioning that they require
inpatient care. In fact, the treatment outcome for people with Axis I
disorders who also have personality disorders is worse than for those
who have only Axis I disorders (Benjamin & Karpiak, 2002; Clarkin &
Levy, 2004). Diagnosing personality disorders is difficult for a number
of reasons (see Table 8.1). First, to varying degrees and at various
times, we all exhibit some of the traits that characterize personality
disorders---for example, suspiciousness, dependency, sensitivity to
rejection, or compulsiveness. For this reason, many investigators
(Bienenfeld, 2007b; Widiger, 2007) prefer to view personality disorders
as the extremes of underlying dimensions of normal personality traits.
They argue that dimensions such as extraversion (sociability),
agreeableness (nurturance), neuroticism, conscientiousness, and openness
to experience may be used to describe personality disorders (Costa &
McCrae, 2005). Because people differ in the extent to which they possess
a trait, a clinician may have trouble deciding when a client exhibits a
trait to a degree that could TA B L E

CATEGORICAL WEAKNESSES OF DSM AXIS II PERSONALITY DISORDERS A number of
weaknesses or problems in using Axis II to categorize personality
disorders have been identiﬁed (Widiger, 2007). WEAKNESS

DESCRIPTION

Pejorative connotations

Because personality disorders are thought to be relatively unchangeable
even in therapy, insurance carriers are reluctant to provide coverage.
To be diagnosed with such a condition gives the impression that there is
little prospect of improvement, even though research provides compelling
evidence that meaningful change can occur.

Excessive diagnostic co-occurrence

It is not unusual for a person to meet criteria for an excessive number
of personality disorders. Which one does he or she have?

Differences among those sharing the same diagnosis

People possessing the same diagnosis of a personality disorder often
appear very different from one another; they rarely share the same
personality features.

Inconsistent and arbitrary diagnostic boundaries

The boundaries used to determine normal personality features and
personality disorders are inconsistent, subjective, and arbitrary. No
clear rationale is given for establishing these boundaries.

Inadequate scientiﬁc base

Except for the study of antisocial and borderline personality disorders,
the eight other disorders are lacking in a research base and seem to be
based more on subjective clinical formulations.

Disorders Characterized by Odd or Eccentric Behaviors

be considered a symptom of a disorder (Millon et al., 2004). DSM-IV-TR
criteria for diagnosing disorders are based on a categorical model in
which a disorder is present if "enough of" certain symptoms or traits
are exhibited and is not present if "not enough of" the symptoms are
demonstrated (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Thus, according
to DSM, people are classified as either having or not having a disorder.
In reality, people may "have" a personality disorder to varying degrees.
Researchers are now using taxometric methods (analyzing data to discover
the underlying data structure) to see which personality disorders better
fit a categorical or continuous model. So far, based on these methods,
schizotypal personality disorder appears to be categorical in nature
(Haslam, 2003), whereas others appear to fit a dimensional model. In
addition, personality patterns may not be stable. Many personality
characteristics exhibited in one situation may vary or be unstable
across situations. Second, although diagnosticians show excellent
reliability in diagnosing whether a particular client has a personality
disorder, they show much lower reliability when they must classify
clients as to the precise type of personality disorder (Bornstein, 1998;
Costa & McCrae, 2005). Co-occurrence is common in that a person
diagnosed with one personality disorder often meets criteria for others
as well (Widiger, 2007). Because people can have more than one type of
personality disorder, the problems in diagnosing these disorders are
formidable. Moreover, although the distinction between personality
disorders and other disorders is valid, many individuals have symptoms
that do not neatly characterize a particular disorder and that overlap
with different disorders (Widiger & Shea, 1991). The third reason that
personality disorders are difficult to diagnose is that clinicians may
not adhere to diagnostic criteria. In one study, clinicians were asked
to indicate the symptoms exhibited by their clients who had been
diagnosed with personality disorders. In many cases, the clinicians'
diagnoses were incongruent with the symptom patterns that DSM requires
for diagnosing the personality disorders (Morey & Ochoa, 1989).
DSM-IV-TR asserts that a number of traits, not just one, must be
considered in determining whether a disorder exists. For example, to
diagnose dependent personality disorder, the clinician must find a
constellation of characteristics (such as the inability to make
decisions independently and the subordination of one's own needs). The
clinician must also consider other criteria or factors. For example, the
personality pattern (1) must characterize the person's current, as well
as long-term, functioning, (2) must not be limited to episodes of
illness, and (3) must either notably impair social or occupational
functioning or cause subjective distress. Thus a person who is
temporarily dependent because of an illness would not be diagnosed as
having a dependent personality. As Table 8.2 shows, DSM-IV-TR lists ten
specific personality disorders and groups them into three clusters,
depending on whether they are characterized by (1) odd or eccentric
behaviors; (2) dramatic, emotional, or erratic behaviors; or (3) anxious
or fearful behaviors. We begin by discussing each of the ten personality
disorders rather briefly. Then we focus in greater detail on the
multipath analysis of one of them---antisocial personality
disorder---primarily because more empirical findings and information are
available concerning this disorder.

Disorders Characterized by Odd or Eccentric Behaviors Three personality
disorders are included in this cluster: paranoid personality, schizoid
personality, and schizotypal personality.

Paranoid Personality Disorder

paranoid personality disorder

People with paranoid personality disorder show unwarranted
suspiciousness, hypersensitivity, and reluctance to trust others. They
interpret others' motives as being malevolent, question their loyalty or
trustworthiness, persistently bear grudges, or are suspicious of the
fidelity of their partners, as seen in the following case.

endure over time, although symptoms of antisocial and borderline
personality disorders tend to remit with age. Source: Based on American
Psychiatric Association (2000a); Corbitt & Widiger (1995); Grant et

disagree on these rates.

Case Study Ralph and Ann married after a brief, intense courtship. The
ﬁrst year of their marriage was relatively happy, although Ralph tended
to be domineering, opinionated, and very protective of his wife. Ann had
always known that Ralph was a jealous person who demanded a great deal
of attention. She was initially ﬂattered that Ralph would become upset
when other men ﬂirted with her because it indicated he cared. It soon
became clear, however, that his jealousy was excessive, as he seemed to
impute nefarious intentions not only to men but also to Ann herself. For
example, when Ann came home from shopping later than usual, Ralph would
become very hostile and agitated and would demand an explanation. He
often doubted her explanations, and would embarrass Ann by calling her
coworkers or neighbors to conﬁrm her stories. As the situation
progressively worsened, Ralph began to suspect that Ann was having
affairs with other men, and he would leave work early to be with his
wife. He said that business was slow and that they could spend more time
together. Whenever the phone rang, Ralph insisted on answering it
himself. Wrong numbers and male callers took on special signiﬁcance for
him; he felt that they must be trying to contact Ann. Ann found it
difﬁcult to discuss the matter with Ralph. He

Is There Gender Bias in Diagnosing Mental Disorders?

W

e know that gender differences exist in the diagnosed prevalence of
mental disorders such as depression and anorexia nervosa, which have
been found to be higher among women than among men. Men have been found
to have a higher rate of the following personality disorders: 1.
Paranoid personality disorder 2. Schizoid personality disorder 3.
Schizotypal personality disorder 4. Narcissistic personality disorder 5.
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder 6. Antisocial personality
disorder Women have been found to have a higher rate of the
following: 1. Borderline personality disorder 2. Histrionic personality
disorder Two disorders appear to have similar rates regardless of
gender: 1. Avoidant personality disorder 2. Dependent personality
disorder (ﬁndings unclear and mixed with occasional higher rates for
females) Do these differences reﬂect real genetic and sociocultural
inﬂuences, or are they simply the result of gender biases? Gender bias
occurs when diagnostic categories are not valid and when they have a
different impact on men and women. The mere fact that men and women have
different prevalence rates for a particular disorder is not sufﬁcient to
prove gender bias. Rates may differ because of actual biological
conditions (for example, a genetic

predisposition) or social conditions (stressors) that affect one gender
more than another. For the diagnostic system to be biased, the
differences must be attributable to errors or problems in the categories
or diagnostic criteria. Widiger and Spitzer (1991) attempted to
enumerate the sources of biases, in addition to failings in the
diagnostic system. Try your hand at this task by examining the following
sources of potential bias and indicating areas in which you believe bias
can occur. 1. In what ways can clinicians themselves be biased when
evaluating others or when making a diagnosis? For example, might a
clinician evaluate the same behavior (such as aggressiveness)
differently, depending on whether a man or a woman displays it? 2. How
might a clinical assessment instrument be biased? Can you think of
characteristics that western culture considers desirable and healthy
that are associated more with one gender than the other and that could
be used in a questionnaire? Some would argue that characteristics
associated with women are more likely to be considered deviant or
undesirable than are those associated with men. Masculine norms tend to
deﬁne characteristics found primarily in women as negative. 3. Can you
think of a situation in which sampling bias could distort the ﬁndings in
a study of the prevalence of depression in women? Sampling bias occurs
in cases in which one gender with a particular disorder is more likely
than the other gender to be present in a particular setting in which the
research is conducted. 4. Given that gender bias can occur, what can a
clinician do to guard against such bias in his or her work? This ﬁnal
question is, perhaps, the most important to address.

was always quick to take the offensive, and he expressed very little
sympathy or understanding toward her. He thought she and her male
friends were playing him for a fool. Ralph's suspicions regarding his
wife's ﬁdelity were obviously unjustiﬁed. Nothing that Ann did
implicated her with other men. Yet Ralph persisted in his pathological
jealousy and suspiciousness and became angry when she suggested that he
was wrong in distrusting her. This behavior pattern, along with Ralph's
absence of warmth and tenderness, suggested a paranoid personality
disorder. Follow-up: After several weeks of treatment, Ann began to feel
stronger in her relationship with Ralph. During one confrontation in
which Ralph objected to her seeing the therapist, Ann asserted that she
would continue the treatment. She said that she had always been faithful
to him and that his jealousy was driving them apart. In a rare moment,
Ralph broke down and started crying. He said that he needed her and
begged her not to leave him. At this time, both are seeing a counselor
for marital therapy.

People with paranoid personality disorder may demonstrate restricted
affect (that is, aloofness and lack of emotion), and they tend to be
rigid and preoccupied with unfounded beliefs that stem from their
suspicions and sensitivity. These beliefs are extremely resistant to
change. Many persons with this disorder fail to go for treatment because
of their guardedness and mistrust (Meissner, 2001).

208

C H A P T E R 8 • PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Certain groups, such as refugees and members of minority groups, may
display guarded or defensive behaviors not because of a disorder but
because of their minority group status or their unfamiliarity with the
majority society. To avoid misinterpreting the clinical significance of
such behaviors, clinicians assessing members of these groups must do so
cautiously. The prevalence of paranoid personality disorder ranges from
0.5 to 4.4 percent of the population (American Psychiatric Association
2000a; Grant et al., 2004). Some psychodynamic explanations propose that
persons with paranoid personality disorder engage in the defense
mechanism of projection, denying their unacceptable impulses and
attributing them to others ("I am not hostile; they are"). Vaillant
(1994) has shown that paranoid personality is associated with projection
to a striking degree. In terms of treatment, psychotherapy is usually
the treatment of choice. However, because clients are suspicious and
have difficulty trusting others, rapport and intimacy in the therapeutic
relationship are difficult to build.

Schizoid Personality Disorder

ELUDING CAPTURE AIDED BY SCHIZOID PERSONALITY FEATURES OF UNABOMBER It
took many years for authorities to track down and arrest Ted Kaczynski,
the Unabomber, who killed many people over an 18-year period. Formerly a
University of California, Berkeley, math professor, Kaczynski is
believed to have a schizoid personality disorder and to have eluded
capture because of his "hermitlike" existence. He was a loner and did
not seem interested in socializing with people. He was ﬁnally arrested
in his isolated cabin, where he had lived alone for many years.

schizoid personality disorder

coldness, and indifference to others schizotypal personality disorder

and by poor interpersonal relationships

Schizoid personality disorder is marked primarily by social isolation,
emotional coldness, and indifference to others. People with this
disorder have a long history of impairment of social functioning. They
are often described as being reclusive and withdrawn (American
Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Many live alone in apartments or
furnished rooms and engage in solitary recreational activities such as
watching television, reading, or taking walks. They tend to neither
desire nor enjoy close relationships; they have few activities that
provide pleasure. Because of a lack of capacity or desire to form social
relationships, people with schizoid disorder are perceived by others as
peculiar and aloof and therefore inadequate as dating or marital
partners. The disorder appears to be uncommon, and slightly more males
are diagnosed with it, according to DSM-IV-TR. Members of different
cultures vary in their social behaviors, and diagnosticians must
consider the cultural background of individuals who show schizoid
symptoms. People with schizoid disorder may be required to interact with
others in the workplace and similar situations, but their relationships
are superficial and frequently awkward. In such situations, people with
this disorder tend to comply with the requests or feelings of others in
an attempt to avoid extensive involvement, conflicts, and expressions of
hostility. They prefer a hermit-like existence (Stone, 2001). Ted
Kaczynski (the Unabomber) is reported to have been diagnosed with
schizoid personality disorder and lived like a hermit alone for many
years as he planned and carried out his attacks on others. In general,
individuals with this disorder prefer social isolation and the single
life rather than marriage. When they do marry, their spouses are often
unhappy in the marital relationships. For example, a man may marry
primarily to please his parents, but his inability to show affection,
lack of interest in sex, and lack of participation in family activities
may cause marital problems. The relationship between schizoid
personality disorder and schizophrenia (described in Chapter 13) is
unclear. One view is that the disorder is a beginning stage of
schizophrenia. Another is that schizophrenia may develop as a
complication of the schizoid personality disorder. Some studies have
shown that schizoid personality disorder is associated with a cold,
unempathic, and emotionally impoverished childhood (Marmar, 1988).
Whether there is a genetic predisposition to the disorder is not clear.
With respect to treatment, as with most personality disorders,
individual psychotherapy is preferred. However, persons with this
disorder usually seek treatment only if they are experiencing stress or
a crisis. The intervention should then be directed at resolving the
crisis.

Schizotypal Personality Disorder People who have schizotypal personality
disorder manifest peculiar thoughts and behaviors and have poor
interpersonal relationships. Many believe they possess

Disorders Characterized by Odd or Eccentric Behaviors

magical thinking abilities or special powers ("I can predict what people
will say before they say it"), and some are subject to recurrent
illusions ("I feel that my dead father is watching me"). Speech
oddities, such as frequent digression or vagueness in conversation, are
often present. The disorder occurs in approximately 3 percent of the
population (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a), more frequently
among men than women. Again, the evaluation of individuals must take
into account their cultural milieu. Superstitious beliefs, delusions,
and hallucinations may be condoned or encouraged in certain religious
ceremonies or other cultures. The peculiarities seen in schizotypal
personality disorder stem from distortions or difficulties in cognition
(Goodman et al., 2007). That is, these people seem to have problems in
thinking and perceiving. People with this disorder often show social
isolation, hypersensitivity, and inappropriate affect (emotions). They
seem to lack pleasure from social interactions (Blanchard et al., 2000).
The prevailing belief is that the disorder is defined primarily by
cognitive distortions, however, and that affective and interpersonal
problems are secondary. Research has demonstrated some cognitive
processing abnormalities in individuals with this disorder that help to
explain many of the symptoms (Goodman et al., 2007; Stone, 2001). The
man described in the following case was diagnosed as having schizotypal
personality disorder:

Case Study A forty-one-year-old man was referred to a community mental
health center's activities program for help in improving his social
skills. He had a lifelong pattern of social isolation, with no real
friends, and spent long hours worrying that his angry thoughts about his
older brother would cause his brother harm. On interview, the patient
was distant and somewhat distrustful. He described in elaborate and
often irrelevant detail his rather uneventful and routine daily life. .
. . For two days he had studied the washing instructions on a new pair
of jeans---Did "Wash before wearing" mean that the jeans were to be
washed before wearing the ﬁrst time, or did they need, for some reason,
to be washed each time before they were worn? . . . He asked the
interviewer whether, if he joined the program, he would be required to
participate in groups. He said that groups made him very nervous because
he felt that if he revealed too much personal information, such as the
amount of money that he had in the bank, people would take advantage of
him or manipulate him for their own beneﬁt. (Spitzer et al., 1994,
pp. 289--290)

The man's symptoms included absence of close friends, magical thinking
(worrying that his thoughts might harm his brother), being distant in
the interview, and social anxiety. These symptoms are associated with
schizotypal personality disorder. As is true of schizoid personality
disorder, many characteristics of schizotypal personality disorder
resemble those of schizophrenia, although in less serious form. For
example, people with schizophrenia exhibit problems in personality
characteristics, psychophysiological responses, and information
processing---deficits that have also been observed among persons with
schizotypal personality disorder (Goodman et al, 2007; Lenzenweger,
2001). Some evidence is consistent with a genetic interpretation of the
link between the two disorders. Kendler (1988) found a higher risk of
schizotypal personality disorder among relatives of people diagnosed
with schizophrenia than among members of a control group. In general,
family, twin, and adoption studies support the genetic relationship
between schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder. Despite the
possibility of genetic influence in the disorder, early environmental
enrichment for children (two years of enhanced nutrition, education, and
physical exercise) has been found to reduce schizotypal personality
disorder and symptoms compared with a nonenriched group of children
(Raine et al., 2003). Various psychotherapies have been used to treat
schizotypal personality disorder, such as dynamic therapy, supportive
therapy, and cognitive-behavioral approaches, as well as group
psychotherapy. For clients who are experiencing a great deal of anxiety,
small doses of anxiolytics (a class of antianxiety drugs) may be used
(Stone, 2001).

C H A P T E R 8 • PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Disorders Characterized by Dramatic, Emotional, or Erratic Behaviors The
group of disorders characterized by dramatic, emotional, or erratic
behaviors includes four personality disorders: antisocial, borderline,
histrionic, and narcissistic.

Antisocial Personality Disorder Chronic antisocial behavioral patterns,
such as a failure to conform to social or legal codes, a lack of anxiety
and guilt, and irresponsible behaviors, indicate antisocial personality
disorder. If you recall our opening case study of Robert T., who has an
antisocial personality disorder, you will have a thumbnail sketch of the
characteristics associated with this disorder. People with this disorder
show little guilt for their wrongdoing, which may include lying, using
other people, and aggressive sexual acts. Their relationships with
others are superficial and fleeting and involve little loyalty. The
following case presents another example of antisocial personality
disorder in the teenage years:

Case Study

Did You Know?

H

istorically, people have been interested in antisocial personalities. An
early nineteenth-century British psychiatrist, J. C. Prichard (1837),
described it this way: The moral and active principles of the mind are
strongly perverted or depraved; the power of selfgovernment is lost or
greatly impaired; and the individual is found to be incapable, not of
talking or reasoning upon any subject proposed to him . . . but of
conducting himself with decency and propriety in the business of life.
(p. 15)

antisocial personality disorder

a personality disorder characterized by a failure to conform to social
and legal codes, by a lack of anxiety and guilt, and by irresponsible
behaviors

Roy W. was an eighteen-year-old high school senior who was referred by
juvenile court for diagnosis and evaluation. He was arrested for
stealing a car, something he had done on several other occasions. The
court agreed with Roy's mother that he needed evaluation and perhaps
psychotherapy. During his interview with the psychologist, Roy was
articulate, relaxed, and even witty. He said that stealing was wrong but
that none of the cars he stole was ever damaged. The last theft occurred
because he needed transportation to a beer party (which was located only
a mile from his home) and his leg was sore from playing basketball. When
the psychologist asked Roy how he got along with young women, he grinned
and said that he was very outgoing and could easily "hustle" them. He
then related the following incident: "About three months ago, I was
pulling out of the school parking lot real fast and accidentally
sideswiped this other car. The girl who was driving it started to scream
at me. God, there was only a small dent on her fender! Anyway, we
exchanged names and addresses and I apologized for the accident. When I
ﬁlled out the accident report later, I said that it was her car that
pulled out from the other side and hit my car. How do you like that?
Anyway, when she heard about my claim that it was her fault, she had her
old man call me. He said that his daughter had witnesses to the accident
and that I could be arrested. Bull, he was just trying to bluff me. But
I gave him a sob story---about how my parents were ready to get a
divorce, how poor we were, and the trouble I would get into if they
found out about the accident. I apologized for lying and told him I
could ﬁx the dent. Luckily he never checked with my folks for the real
story. Anyway, I went over to look at the girl's car. I really didn't
have any idea of how to ﬁx that old heap so I said I had to wait a
couple of weeks to get some tools for the repair job. "Meanwhile, I
started to talk to the girl. Gave her my sob story, told her how nice I
thought her folks and home were. We started to date and I took her out
three times. Then one night I laid her. The crummy thing was that she
told her folks about it. Can you imagine that? Anyway, her old man
called and told me never to get near his precious little thing again.
She's actually a slut. "At least I didn't have to ﬁx her old heap. I
know I shouldn't lie but can you blame me? People make such a big thing
out of nothing."

The irresponsibility, disregard for others, and disregard for societal
rules and morals evident in this interview indicated to the psychologist
that Roy had antisocial personality disorder. Cleckley's (1976) classic
description of the disorder included the following characteristics: 1.
Superficial charm and good intelligence 2. Shallow emotions and lack of
empathy, guilt, or remorse 3. Behaviors indicative of little life plan
or order 4. Failure to learn from experiences and absence of anxiety 5.
Unreliability, insincerity, and untruthfulness

Disorders Characterized by Dramatic, Emotional, or Erratic Behaviors

Some of these characteristics are apparent in Roy's case. For example,
he felt no guilt for his actions or for manipulating the young woman and
her family. In fact, he was quite proud of his ability to seduce her and
to avoid responsibility for the car repair. The ease with which Roy
related his story to the psychologist demonstrated his lack of concern
for those who were hurt by his behaviors. Roy showed no anxiety during
the interview. DSM-IV-TR criteria for the disorder differ somewhat from
Cleckley's description, which is based on clinical observations of
various cases. For example, DSM-IV-TR criteria do not include lack of
anxiety, shallow emotions, failure to learn from past experiences, and
superficial charm. They do include a history before age fifteen of
failing to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors,
irritability and aggressiveness, impulsivity, lack of remorse, and
deceitfulness. For the diagnosis to be made, the individual must be at
least eighteen years old. DSM-IV-TR criteria, however, fail to convey
the conceptual sense of the disorder that was clearly outlined in
Cleckley's original description. Some research now suggests that
psychopathy is composed of three factors: arrogant and deceitful
interpersonal style, deficient affective experience, and impulsive and
irresponsible behavioral style (Cooke & Michie, 2001). The distinction
between Cleckley's conceptualization and DSM-IV-TR criteria is important
because sole use of DSM-IV-TR may not capture the "personality" aspect
or the underlying construct of the disorder. Because they overemphasize
behavioral manifestations and criminality, the DSM-IV-TR criteria make
rendering a diagnosis easier and more reliable, but they may fail to
capture the essence of the disorder. Thus Cleckley's conceptualization
and the research on psychopathy are more likely to emphasize personality
components than is the description of antisocial personality disorder in
DSM-IV-TR. Antisocial behaviors may arise from a multitude of causes, of
which personality pathology is only one (Cooke & Michie, 2001).
Furthermore, only a minority of patients with antisocial personality
disorder have severe psychopathy (Meloy, 2001). In the United States,
the incidence of antisocial personality disorder is estimated to be
about 2.0--3.6 percent overall; rates differ by gender, with more men
than women diagnosed with the disorder (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a; Grant et al., 2004). Overall estimates vary from
study to study, however, which may be due to differences in sampling,
diagnostic, and methodological procedures. The disorder is much more
frequent in urban environments than in rural ones and in lower
socioeconomic groups than in higher ones. Rates of antisocial
personality disorder appear comparable among whites, African Americans,
and Latino Americans (Robins, Tipp, & Przybeck, 1991), although one
study in the United Kingdom suggests significantly lower rates among
African Caribbeans than whites (Mikton & Grounds, 2007). Although
African Americans had a higher rate of incarceration for crimes, their
rate of antisocial personality disorder is either equal to or lower than
that of the general population.

CRIME BOSSES AND ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDERS Vito Corleone (played
by Marlon Brando) in The Godfather and Boss Tony Soprano (played by
James Gandolﬁni) in the TV series The Sopranos are both men who exhibit
many of the traits of an antisocial personality disorder. Both men
evidenced a callous disregard for the rights of others and showed little
regret or remorse for cheating, lying, breaking the law, or even murder.
However, they also revealed characteristics that are at odds with the
diagnosis. Both had deep family relationships, revealed intense loyalty
and emotional commitment to their families, evidenced ﬂashes of guilt;
Tony Soprano even sought psychiatric help for his anxiety attacks.

212

C H A P T E R 8 • PERSONALITY DISORDERS

BEHAVIOR PATTERNS, CONTEXT, AND DIAGNOSIS Individuals who engage in
social protest or civil disobedience are rarely regarded as having
antisocial personality disorder. Although some may break the law, the
other features of antisocial personality disorder---chronic lack of
remorse and deceitfulness, for example---are usually absent. In this
photo, a group of individuals demonstrate to rally support against the
war in Iraq. Are social protests, as well as antisocial personality
disorders, more common among young adults than older adults?

The behavior patterns associated with antisocial personality disorder
are different and distinct from behaviors involving social protest or
criminal lifestyles. People who engage in civil disobedience or violate
the conventions of society or its laws as a form of protest are not, as
a rule, persons with antisocial personalities. Such people can be quite
capable of forming meaningful interpersonal relationships and of
experiencing guilt. They may perceive their violations of rules and
norms as acts performed for the greater good. Similarly, engaging in
delinquent or adult criminal behavior is not a necessary or sufficient
condition for diagnosing antisocial personality. Although many convicted
criminals have been found to have antisocial characteristics, many
others do not. They may come from a subculture that encourages and
reinforces criminal activity; hence in perpetrating such acts they are
adhering to group mores and codes of conduct. As mentioned earlier,
DSM-IV-TR criteria tend to emphasize criminality, but the
appropriateness of this emphasis is being questioned. People with
antisocial personalities are a difficult population to study because
they do not voluntarily seek treatment. Only one out of seven will ever
discuss their problems with a doctor, and concurrent problems are the
reason for their participation in treatment (Meloy, 2001). Consequently,
investigators often seek research participants in prison populations,
which presumably harbor a relatively large proportion of psychopaths.
Some research suggests, however, that psychopaths in prison do differ
from the nonimprisoned psychopathic population (Widom, 1977). Although
they share similarities, antisocial personalities in the general
community tended to have higher levels of education, and, although often
arrested, they were infrequently convicted of crimes.

Borderline Personality Disorder

borderline personality disorder

a personality disorder characterized by intense ﬂuctuations in mood,
self-image, and interpersonal relationships

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by intense fluctuations
in mood, self-image, and interpersonal relationships. Persons with this
disorder are impulsive, have chronic feelings of emptiness, and form
unstable and intense interpersonal relationships (Goodman et al., 2007).
They may be quite friendly one day and quite hostile the next. Many
perceive their early childhoods as having malevolent others---others who
were hostile or physically violent (Nigg et al., 1992). Many exhibit
recurrent suicidal behaviors or gestures (Yen et al., 2003), and the
probability of suicide is higher than average among those who have this
disorder (Duberstein & Conwell, 1997). Self-destructive behaviors such
as suicide attempts are often triggered by interpersonal conflicts and
events (Welch, Shaw, & Linehan, 2002). Sexual difficulties, such as
sexual preoccupation, dissatisfaction, and depression, have also

any well-known individuals have been described as having borderline
personality disorder---Adolph Hitler, Marilyn Monroe, and even Princess
Diana. Biographer and journalist Sally Bedell-Smith (1999) consulted a
psychologist, who agreed that Princess Diana's rapid mood swings,
preoccupation with real or imagined abandonment, dissatisfaction,
depression, and suicide attempts ﬁt the category well. It is important
to note, however, that people with personality disorders may also suffer
from Axis I disorders.

Princess Diana, smiling happily in this picture, was known to suffer
from rapid mood swings, depression, and suicide attempts. Her emotional
and behavioral traits, such as impulsiveness, marked ﬂuctuations in
mood, chronic feelings of emptiness, and unstable and intense
interpersonal relationships, are consistent with a diagnosis of
borderline personality disorder. Why do women receive this diagnosis far
more frequently than do men?

been observed (Zanarini et al., 2003). Although no single feature
defines borderline personality disorder, its essence can be captured in
the capriciousness of behaviors and the lability of moods (Millon et
al., 2004). According to DSM-IV-TR, the prevalence is about 1.4--2.0
percent of the population, with females three times as likely as males
to receive the diagnosis (Lenzenweger et al., 2007). This is the most
commonly diagnosed personality disorder in both inpatient and outpatient
settings (Oldham, 2006). Some researchers believe that the prevalence of
the disorder is increasing because our society makes it difficult for
people to maintain stable relationships and a sense of identity. The
following example illustrates some of the many facets of borderline
personality disorder.

Case Study Bryan was a twenty-three-year-old graduate student majoring
in sociology at a prestigious university. He was active in student
government and was viewed as charismatic, articulate, and sociable. When
he met other students for the ﬁrst time, he could often persuade them to
participate in the campus activities that interested him. Women were
quite attracted to him because of his charm and self-disclosing nature.
They described him as exciting, intense, and different from other men.
Bryan could form close relationships with others very quickly. Bryan
could not, however, maintain his social relationships. Sometimes he
would have a brief but intense affair with a woman and then abruptly and
angrily ask himself what he ever saw in her. At other times, the woman
would reject him after a few dates because she thought Bryan was moody,
self-centered, and demanding. He often called his friends after midnight
because he felt lonesome, empty, and bored and wanted to talk. Several
times he threatened to commit suicide. He gave little thought to the
inconvenience he was causing. Once he organized a group of students to
protest the inadequate student parking the university provided. The
morning of the planned protest demonstration, he announced that he no
longer supported the effort. He said he was not in the right mood for
the protest, much to the consternation of his followers, who had spent
weeks preparing for the event. Bryan's intense but brief relationships,
the marked and continual shifts in moods, and boredom with others in
spite of his need for social contacts all point to borderline
personality disorder.

People who have borderline personality disorder may exhibit psychotic
symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations (for example, hearing
imaginary voices that tell them to commit suicide), but the symptoms are
usually transient. They also

213

214

C H A P T E R 8 • PERSONALITY DISORDERS

usually have an ego-dystonic reaction to their hallucinations (Oldham,
2006). That is, they recognize their imaginary voices or other
hallucinations as being unacceptable, alien, and distressful. By
contrast, a person with a psychotic disorder may not realize that his or
her hallucinations are pathological. Some researchers (Trull et al.,
1997) have found that individuals with borderline personality features
are more likely to show dysfunctional moods, interpersonal problems,
poor coping skills, and cognitive distortions than are people without
borderline personality characteristics. However, it is important to note
that, using taxometric methods, some researchers have found that
borderline personality disorder may be better viewed as a continuous
rather than a categorical disorder (Rothschild et al., 2003; Widiger &
Mullins-Sweatt, 2005). That is, rather than either having or not having
the disorder, people differ in the degree of borderline personality
characteristics they exhibit. Although diverse models have been used to
conceptualize borderline personality disorder, most of the literature
comes from researchers with psychodynamic perspectives. For example,
Kernberg (1976) proposed the concept of object splitting---that people
with borderline personality disorder perceive others as all good or all
bad at different times. This split results in emotional fluctuations
toward others. Another perspective looks at the disorder from a social
learning viewpoint. One view (Millon et al., 2004) is that borderline
personality is caused by a faulty self-identity, which affects the
development of consistent goals and accomplishments. As a result,
persons with this disorder have difficulty coping with their own
emotions and with life in general. They then develop a conflict between
the need to depend on others and the need to assert themselves. A
similar model (Sable, 1997) views the conflict as a desire for proximity
and attachment versus a dread and avoidance of engagement, but it
attributes the conflict to traumatic attachment experiences that
occurred early in life, not to a faulty self-identity. A third
possibility is that the fluctuations in emotions or dysfunctions in
emotional regulation are at the core of the disorder (Linehan, 1987).
Such emotional dysregulations have been observed in different
populations of people with this disorder, including adolescents
(Santisteban et al., 2003). An interesting aspect of this approach is
the idea that biological factors may be responsible for the emotional
dysregulation among individuals with borderline personality disorder. In
fact, MRI and PET scans reveal structural abnormalities in the
prefrontal cortex and a different pattern of activation in the amygdala
in the working brain of people with borderline personality disorder
(Goodman et al., 2007). Both are implicated in mood and motor
disinhibition. Cognitive-oriented approaches have also been used. There
appear to be two core aspects of borderline personality: difficulties in
regulating emotions and unstable and intense interpersonal relationships
(Oldham, 2006). According to this approach, these two aspects are
affected by distorted or inaccurate attributions (explanations for
others' behaviors or attitudes). Cognitive-behavioral therapy for
borderline personality disorders, therefore, attempts to change the way
clients think about and approach interpersonal situations (Beinenfeld,
2007a). Another cognitive theorist, Aaron Beck, argued that an
individual's basic assumptions (that is, thoughts) play a central role
in influencing perceptions, interpretations, and behavioral and
emotional responses (Beck et al., 1990). Individuals with borderline
personality disorder seem to have three basic assumptions: (1) "The
world is dangerous and malevolent," (2) "I am powerless and vulnerable,"
and (3) "I am inherently unacceptable." Believing in these assumptions,
individuals with this disorder become fearful, vigilant, guarded, and
defensive. For these reasons, they are difficult to treat. Regardless of
therapeutic approach, most individual psychotherapies end with the
borderline patient's dropping out of treatment (Gunderson & Links,
2001). Finally, Linehan (1993) has developed dialectical behavior
therapy (DBT) specifically for clients with borderline personality
disorder. Patients are taught skills that include emotional regulation,
distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness (Benjamin & Karpiak,
2002). Linehan's goals, in descending order of priority, are to

Disorders Characterized by Dramatic, Emotional, or Erratic Behaviors

215

change (1) suicidal behaviors, (2) behaviors that interfere with
therapy, (3) behaviors that interfere with quality of life, (4)
behavioral skills acquisition, (5) posttraumatic stress behavior, and
(6) self-respect behaviors. Thus she targets as priorities possible
suicidal behaviors in clients and the therapist-client relationship. Her
treatment has been found to decrease dropping out and suicidal behaviors
and to be generally effective (Emmelkamp, 2004). Because of positive
treatment outcomes, DBT has been increasingly used as a treatment
procedure. These diverse theoretical perspectives on this disorder
reflect the strong interest in borderline personality. In contrast to
the theoretical contributions, empirical research is sparse. Some
investigators have found that individuals with the disorder have a
history of chaotic family environments, including physical and sexual
abuse (Clarkin, Marziali, & Munroe-Blum, 1991; Golier et al., 2003;
Phillips & Gunderson, 1999) and family history of mood and substance-use
disorders (Morey & Zanarini, 2000). Such family experiences may affect
perceptions of self and others. Benjamin and Wonderlich (1994) found in
one study that individuals with borderline personality disorder viewed
their mothers and others in their environment as more hostile than did a
comparable group of people with mood disorders. Again, mood changes,
intense and unstable interpersonal relationships, identity problems, and
other characteristics associated with borderline personality disorder
can be observed in all persons to a greater or lesser extent. In fact,
although borderline personality disorder is associated with relationship
dysfunctions and problems, so are other personality disorders (Daley,
Burge, & Hammen, 2000). As is the case with other personality disorders,
diagnosis is difficult, and formulations about the causes of the
disorder must rely on what we know about personality development in
general. We return to that topic later in this chapter.

Histrionic Personality Disorder People with histrionic personality
disorder engage in self-dramatization, exaggerated expression of
emotions, and attention-seeking behaviors. The desire for attention may
lead to flamboyant acts or flirtatious behaviors (Phillips & Gunderson,
1999). Despite superficial warmth and charm, the histrionic person is
typically shallow and egocentric. Individuals from different cultures
vary in the extent to which they display their emotions, but the
histrionic person goes well beyond cultural norms. In the United States,
about 1 to 3 percent of the population may have this disorder (Grant et
al., 2004). Gender differences are not evident (Corbitt & Widiger,
1995). Histrionic behaviors were evident in a female client seen by one
of the authors, as shown in the following case.

Case Study The woman was a thirty-three-year-old real estate agent who
entered treatment for problems involving severe depression. Her
boyfriend had recently told her that she was a self-centered and phony
person. He found out that she had been dating other men, despite their
understanding that neither would go out with others. The woman claimed
that she never considered "going out with other men" as actual dating.
Once their relationship was broken, her boyfriend refused to communicate
with her. The woman then angrily called the boyfriend's employer and
told him that unless the boyfriend contacted her, she would commit
suicide. He never did call, but instead of attempting suicide, she
decided to seek psychotherapy. The woman was attractively dressed for
her ﬁrst therapy session. She wore a tight and clinging sweater. Several
times during the session she raised her arms, supposedly to ﬁx her hair,
in a very seductive manner. Her conversation was animated and intense.
When she was describing the breakup with her boyfriend, she was tearful.
Later, she raged over the boyfriend's failure to call her and, at one
point, called him a "son of a bitch." Near the end of the session, she
seemed upbeat and cheerful, commenting that the best therapy might be
for the therapist to arrange a date for her.

None of the behaviors exhibited by this client alone warrants a
diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder. In combination, however,
her self-dramatization,

histrionic personality disorder

expression of emotions, and attention-seeking behaviors

216

C H A P T E R 8 • PERSONALITY DISORDERS

incessant drawing of attention to herself via seductive movements, angry
outbursts, manipulative suicidal gesture, and lack of genuineness point
to this disorder. Both biological factors, such as autonomic or
emotional excitability, and environmental factors, such as parental
reinforcement of a child's attention-seeking behaviors and the existence
of histrionic parental models, may be important influences in the
development of histrionic personality disorder (Millon et al., 2004).
The lack of research on the effectiveness of treatments with personality
disorders in general makes it difficult to definitively designate a
treatment of choice. Research on histrionic personality disorder is
practically nonexistent (Weston & Riolo, 2007). As noted by Horowitz
(2001), psychodynamic therapies have been aimed at establishing a
therapeutic alliance with the client and providing insight into
resistance to change. Cognitive-behavioral therapy has focused on
changing the client's irrational cognitions and assumptions.

Narcissistic Personality Disorder

narcissistic personality disorder

a personality disorder characterized by an exaggerated sense of
selfimportance, an exploitative attitude, and a lack of empathy

The clinical characteristics of narcissistic personality disorder are an
exaggerated sense of self-importance, an exploitative attitude, and a
lack of empathy. People with this disorder require attention and
admiration and have difficulty accepting personal criticism. In
conversations, they talk mainly about themselves and show a lack of
interest in others. Many have fantasies about power or influence, and
they constantly overestimate their talents and importance. Individuals
diagnosed with this disorder show reflective responses and idealization
involving unlimited success, a sense of entitlement, and a sense of
self-importance (Hilsenroth et al., 1997). Owing to their sense of
self-importance, people with narcissistic personality disorder expect to
be the superior participants in all relationships. For example, they may
be impatient and irate if others arrive late for a meeting but may
frequently be late themselves and think nothing of it. One narcissistic
client reported, "I was denied promotion to chief executive by my board
of directors, although my work was good, because they felt I had poor
relations with my employees. When I complained to my wife, she agreed
with the board, saying my relations with her and the children were
equally bad. I don't understand. I know I'm more competent than all
these people" (Masterson, 1981, p. ix). The client was depressed and
angry about not being promoted and about the suggestion that he had
difficulty in forming social relationships. His wife's confirmation of
his problems further enraged him. During therapy, he was competitive and
sought to devalue the observations of the therapist. Many persons with
this disorder exhibit arrogance and grandiosity (Groopman & Cooper,
2001). In a study that evaluated the kinds of defense mechanisms used by
individuals with different personality disorders, narcissistic
personality disorder was strongly associated with the use of
dissociation as a defense mechanism (Vaillant, 1994). People with this
disorder may use denial and dissociation to ward off feelings of
inferiority developed from early childhood (Kernberg, 1975; Marmar,
1988), and they may attempt to maintain their inflated self-concept by
devaluing others (Kernberg, 1975). Narcissistic traits are common among
adolescents and do not necessarily imply that a teenager has the
disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). However, it was
found that people later diagnosed with this disorder were more likely to
experience feelings of invulnerability, to display risk taking behavior,
and to have strong feelings of uniqueness as adolescents (Weston &
Riolo, 2007). The prevalence of narcissistic personality disorder is
about 1 to 2 percent, although some studies have found lower rates
(Grant et al., 2004). More males than females are given the diagnosis.
As in the case of most of the personality disorders, no controlled
treatment studies for narcissistic personality disorder have been
conducted, and treatment recommendations are therefore based on clinical
experience (Groopman & Cooper, 2001). Individual psychotherapy and group
therapy have been used and are generally recommended.

NARCISSISTIC BEHAVIOR Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) in the movie The
Devil Wears Prada illustrates some of the symptoms of narcissistic
personality disorder, including an exaggerated sense of self-importance,
an excessive need for admiration, and an inability to accept criticism
or rejection. Do you think that narcissistic personality disorder is
increasing among young people?

Disorders Characterized by Anxious or Fearful Behaviors Another cluster
of personality disorders is characterized by anxious or fearful
behaviors. This category includes the avoidant, dependent, and
obsessive-compulsive personality disorders.

Avoidant Personality Disorder The essential features of avoidant
personality disorder are a fear of rejection and humiliation and a
reluctance to enter into social relationships. Persons with this
disorder tend to have low self-esteem and to avoid social relationships
without a guarantee of uncritical acceptance by others. A study of
childhood antecedents of persons with avoidant personality disorder
revealed that they engaged in fewer extracurricular activities, hobbies,
and leadership roles, had less athletic ability, and were less popular
in school (Rettew, Zanarini, & Yen, 2003; Weston & Riolo, 2007). Unlike
persons with schizoid personalities, who avoid others because they lack
interest, and unlike persons who are shy because of their cultural
background, people with avoidant personality disorder do not desire to
be alone. On the contrary, they crave affection and an active social
life. They want---but fear---social contacts, and this ambivalence may
be reflected in different ways. For example, many people with this
disorder engage in intellectual pursuits, wear fine clothes, or are
active in the artistic community. Their need for contact and
relationships is often woven into their activities. Thus an avoidant
person may write poems expressing the plight of the lonely or the need
for human intimacy. A primary defense mechanism is fantasy, whereby
wishes are fulfilled to an excessive degree in the person's imagination
(Millon et al., 2004). Avoidant personality disorder occurs in less than
1 percent of the population, and no gender differences are apparent
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). People with this disorder are
caught in a vicious cycle: because they are preoccupied with rejection,
they are constantly alert to signs of derogation or ridicule. This
concern leads to many perceived instances of rejection, which cause them
to avoid others. Their social skills may then become deficient and
invite criticism from others. In other words, their very fear of
criticism may lead to criticism. People with avoidant personality
disorder often feel depressed, anxious, angry at themselves, inferior,
and inadequate into their elderly years (Mahgoub & Hossain, 2007).

C H A P T E R 8 • PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Case Study Jenny L., an unmarried twenty-seven-year-old bank teller,
showed several features of avoidant personality disorder. Although she
functioned adequately at work, Jenny was extremely shy, sensitive, and
quiet with fellow employees. She perceived others as being insensitive
and gross. If the bank manager joked with other tellers, she felt that
the manager preferred them to her. Although Jenny tried to be friendly,
she did not interact much with anyone because of the possibility of them
criticizing or rejecting her. Jenny had very few hobbies. A great deal
of her time was spent watching television and eating chocolates. As a
result, she was about forty pounds overweight. Television romances were
her favorite programs; after watching one, she tended to daydream about
having an intense romantic relationship. Jenny eventually sought
treatment for her depression and loneliness.

Some researchers believe that the disorder is on a continuum with the
Axis I disorder social phobia, whereas others see it as a distinct
disorder that simply has features in common with social phobia
(Sutherland, 2001). Little research has been conducted on the etiology
of avoidant personality disorder. One suggestion (Marmar, 1988) is that
a complex interaction of early childhood environmental experiences and
innate temperament produce the disorder. Parental rejection and censure,
reinforced by rejecting peers, have been proposed as factors in the
disorder (Phillips & Gunderson, 1999). Because of the fear of rejection
and scrutiny, clients may be reluctant to disclose personal thoughts and
feelings. It is important for the therapist to establish rapport and a
therapeutic alliance, or the client may fail to return for treatment. A
number of different therapies have been used, such as
cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, interpersonal, and
psychopharmacological treatments (Sutherland, 2001).

Dependent Personality Disorder

dependent personality disorder

a personality disorder characterized by reliance on others and an
unwillingness to assume responsibility

People who rely on others and are unwilling to assume responsibility
show dependent personality disorder. These people lack self-confidence,
and they subordinate their needs to those of the people on whom they
depend. Nevertheless, casual observers may fail to recognize or may
misinterpret their dependency and inability to make decisions. Friends
may perceive dependent personalities as understanding and tolerant,
without realizing that they are fearful of taking the initiative because
they are afraid of disrupting the relationship. In addition, a dependent
personality may allow his or her spouse to be dominant or abusive for
fear that the spouse will otherwise leave. Beck and associates (1990)
believe that the dependency is not simply a matter of being passive and
unassertive, problems that can be treated with assertiveness training.
Rather, dependent personalities have two deeply ingrained assumptions
that affect their thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors. First, they see
themselves as inherently inadequate and unable to cope. Second, they
conclude that their course of action should be to find someone who can
take care of them. Depression, helplessness, and suppressed anger are
often present in dependent personality disorder. The individual's
environment must be considered before rendering a diagnosis of dependent
personality disorder. The socializing process that trains people to be
independent, assertive, and individual rather than group oriented is not
equally valued in all cultures (Sue & Sue, 2008a). Nor do all people
manifest dependency all the time in the cultures that do value it. Some
individuals, such as hospitalized patients, typically develop some
degree of dependency during confinement. According to Grant and
colleagues (2004), the prevalence of this disorder is about 2.5 percent.
The prevalence by gender is unclear. Bornstein (1997) finds evidence
that it is found more often among men than among women, Torgersen and
colleagues (2001) believe that rates are higher among women, and Corbitt
and Widiger (1995) believe that there are no gender differences in this
disorder. The following case illustrates a dependent personality
disorder that cannot be attributed to cultural or situational factors.

Disorders Characterized by Anxious or Fearful Behaviors

219

Case Study Jim was ﬁfty-six, a single man who was living with his
seventy-eight-year-old widowed mother. When his mother was recently
hospitalized for cancer, Jim decided to see a therapist. He was
distraught and depressed over his mother's condition. Jim indicated that
he did not know what to do. His mother had always taken care of him,
and, in his view, she always knew best. Even when he was young, his
mother had "worn the pants" in the family. The only time that he was
away from his family was during his six years of military service. He
was wounded in the Korean War, was returned to the United States, and
spent a few months in a Veterans Administration hospital. He then went
to live with his mother. Because of his service-connected injury, Jim
was unable to work full time. His mother welcomed him home, and she
structured all his activities. At one point, Jim met and fell in love
with a woman, but his mother disapproved of her. During a confrontation
between the mother and Jim's woman friend, each demanded that Jim make a
commitment to her. This was quite traumatic for Jim. His mother ﬁnally
grabbed him and yelled that he must tell the other woman to go. Jim
tearfully told the woman that he was sorry, but she must go, and the
woman angrily left. While Jim was relating his story, it was clear to
the therapist that Jim harbored some anger toward his mother, though he
overtly denied any feelings of hostility. Also clear were his dependency
and his inability to take responsibility. His life had always been
structured, ﬁrst by his mother and then by the military. His mother's
illness meant that his structured world might crumble.

People clearly differ in the degree to which they are dependent or
submissive. How dependency is explained varies according to theoretical
perspective. From the psychodynamic perspective, the disorder is a
result of maternal deprivation, which causes fixation at the oral stage
of development (Marmar, 1988). Behavioral learning theorists believe
that a family or Did You Know? social environment that rewards dependent
behaviors and These are the primary differences and similarities between

Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder The characteristics of
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) are perfectionism, a
tendency to be interpersonally controlling, devotion to details, and
rigidity. Again, these traits are found in many normal people. Unlike
normal people, however, individuals with obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder show marked impairment in occupational or social
functioning. Their relationships with others may be quite stiff, formal,
and distant (McCullough & Maltsberger, 2001). Further, the extent of the
character rigidity is greater among people who have this disorder. OCPD,
as presented in this chapter, is distinct from obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD), as discussed in the chapter on anxiety disorders. The
two disorders have similar names, but the clinical manifestations of
these disorders are quite different. OCPD is not characterized by the
presence of obsessions (intrusive and repetitive anxiety-arousing
thoughts) or compulsions (a need to perform acts or to dwell on mental
acts repetitively). Rather, OCPD involves a preoccupation with
orderliness,

obsessive-compulsive personality disorder a personality disorder

controlling, devotion to details, and rigidity

220

C H A P T E R 8 • PERSONALITY DISORDERS

perfectionism, and control. Persons with OCD experience tremendous
anxiety related to specific preoccupations, which are perceived as
threatening. They usually recognize that their obsessions or compulsions
are irrational or senseless. In OCPD, it is one's dysfunctional
philosophy that produces anxiety, discomfort, and frustration. OCPD is a
pervasive characterological disturbance. People with the disorder
genuinely see their way of functioning as the "correct" way. Their
overall style of relating to the world around them is processed through
their own strict standards. Research also shows that OCPD symptoms are
related to anger and depression and that those with these symptoms are
more prone to suppress their anger (Whiteside & Abramowitz, 2004). The
preoccupation with details, rules, and possible errors leads to
indecision and an inability to see "the big picture." There is an
overconcern with being in control, not only over the details of their
lives but also over their emotions and other people (Phillips &
Gunderson, 1999). Coworkers may find individuals with this disorder too
demanding, inflexible, miserly, and perfectionistic. They may actually
be ineffective on the job, despite long hours of devotion, as in the
following case.

Case Study Cecil, a third-year medical student, was referred for therapy
by his graduate adviser. The adviser told the therapist that Cecil was
in danger of being expelled from medical school because of his inability
to get along with patients and other students. Cecil often berated
patients for failing to follow his advice. In one instance, he told a
patient with a lung condition to stop smoking. When the patient
indicated he was unable to stop, Cecil angrily told the patient to go
for medical treatment elsewhere---that the medical center had no place
for such a "weak-willed fool." Cecil's relationships with others were
similarly strained. He considered many members of the faculty to be
"incompetent old deadwood," and he characterized fellow graduate
students as "partygoers." The graduate adviser told the therapist that
Cecil had not been expelled only because several faculty members thought
that he was brilliant. Cecil studied and worked sixteen hours a day. He
was extremely well read and had an extensive knowledge of medical
disorders. Although he was always able to provide a careful and detailed
analysis of a patient's condition, it took him a great deal of time to
do so. His diagnoses tended to cover every disorder that each patient
could conceivably have, on the basis of all possible combinations of
symptoms.

AS GOOD AS IT GETS Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets tries to woo
Helen Hunt, a woman he ﬁnds very attractive. Suffering from OCPD,
however, his preoccupation with details and rules and overconcern with
being in control interferes with his emotions toward Ms. Hunt. Many ﬁnd
people with obsessive-compulsive personality disorders to be too
demanding, inﬂexible, miserly, and perfectionistic.

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder occurs in about 1 percent of
the population according to DSM-IV-TR, but a more recent study places it
at 7.9 percent (Grant et al., 2004). It is about twice as prevalent
among males as females, according to DSM-IV-TR. Cognitive-behavioral
therapy, as well as supportive forms of psychotherapy, have helped some
clients (Barber et al., 1997; Beck et al., 1990). No medications
specific to obsessivecompulsive personality disorder are currently
available (McCullough & Maltsberger, 2001). The diversity of personality
disorders makes it difficult to do justice in exploring the etiology of
each. In many cases, we simply do not possess enough knowledge of these
disorders to engage in a proper and informed explanation of their
causes. Yet it is clear that personality disorders are influenced by
biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural forces. In the next
section, we use our multipath model to discuss one of the better
researched personality disorders: antisocial personality disorder.

Multipath Analysis of One Personality Disorder: Antisocial Personality
Disorder

221

Multipath Analysis of One Personality Disorder: Antisocial Personality
Disorder Research on personality disorders has been quite limited,
although anecdotal, clinical, and theoretical speculation abound (Millon
et al., 2004). As mentioned previously, research on antisocial
personality disorder (APD) is perhaps more developed because of its
higher visibility and association with criminality. Thus, to give you a
broader view and an appreciation of the wide range of explanatory views
that can be proposed for personality disorders in general, we have
chosen to concentrate our etiological analysis on APD. Using our
multipath model, we survey how the four dimensions (biological,
psychological, social, and sociocultural) explain APD development and
their possible interacting contributions, as shown in Figure 8.1. In
this way, we hope to provide a prototype for understanding the
multidimensional development of other personality disorders, as well.

Biological Dimension An extraordinary amount of research has been
devoted to trying to uncover the biological basis of APD. Indeed, early
researchers concentrated primarily on using genetics, central nervous
system abnormalities, and autonomic nervous system abnormalities to
explain the disorder. Genetic Inﬂuences Throughout history, many people
have speculated that some individuals are born to "raise hell." It is
not uncommon for casual observers to remark that antisocials, criminals,
and sociopaths appear to have an inborn temperament toward
aggressiveness, sensation seeking, impulsivity, and a disregard for
others. These speculations are difficult to test because of the problems
involved in distinguishing between the influences of environment and
heredity on behavior. For example, APD is five times more common among
first-degree biological relatives of males with APD and ten times more
common among first-degree biological relatives of females with APD than
among the general population (American Psychiatric Association, 1987,
2000a). But is this due to heredity or environment?

C H A P T E R 8 • PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Support for the former is found in studies comparing concordance rates
for identical or monozygotic (MZ) twins with those for fraternal or
dizygotic (DZ) twins. MZ twins share exactly the same genes, whereas DZ
twins are genetically no more alike than any two siblings. Most studies
show that MZ twins do tend to have a higher concordance rate than DZ
twins for antisocial tendencies, delinquency, and criminality (Eley,
Lichtenstein, & Moffitt, 2003; Gottesman & Goldsmith, 1994). Further,
adoptees who were separated from their biological parents who have APD
and were raised by parents without APD still exhibited higher rates of
antisocial characteristics (Cadoret & Cain, 1981). Although this body of
evidence seems to show a strong causal pattern, it should be examined
carefully, for several reasons. First, many of the studies fail to
clearly distinguish between antisocial personalities and criminals; as
we noted earlier, they may draw research participants only from criminal
populations. Truly representative samples of people with APD should be
investigated. Second, the evidence supporting a genetic basis for
antisocial tendencies does not preclude the environment as a factor.
Antisocial personality is undoubtedly caused by environmental, as well
as genetic, influences (Slutske et al., 1997). The fact that crime has
increased fivefold or more in most industrialized western countries over
the past fifty years has to be attributed to environmental influences,
because gene pools cannot change that quickly (Rutter, 1997). As noted
in our multipath model, heredity and environment may interact in complex
ways. For example, one study found that ineffective parenting was
unrelated to conduct problems in children with antisocial temperamental
characteristics, but for children without such characteristics,
ineffective parenting increased conduct disorders (Wootton et al.,
1997). Third, studies indicating that genetic factors are important do
not provide much insight into how APD is inherited. What exactly is
transmitted genetically? Genetic factors do not influence crime and
antisocial behavior directly, but they seem to affect the probability
that such behavior will occur (Rutter, 1997). Hence there is no specific
"gene for crime."

Myth vs Reality Myth: Antisocial personality problems are primarily
caused by genetic factors. Some people seem born to "raise hell."
Reality: Although genetic factors are related to antisocial personality
disorder, a wide range of family patterns can inﬂuence the development
of the disorder. For example, dysfunctional aspects of family life, such
as severe parental discord, a parent's maladjustment or criminality,
overcrowding, and even large family size, can predispose a child to
antisocial personality disorder, especially if the child does not have a
loving relationship with at least one parent (Millon et al., 2004).

Central Nervous System Abnormality Some investigators suggest that
adults with antisocial personalities tend to have abnormal brain wave
activity similar to that of young children (Elliott & Gillett, 1992;
Hare, 1993). Perhaps these abnormalities indicate brain pathology,
especially in the frontal lobes (Deckel, Hesselbrock, & Bauer, 1996;
Goodman et al., 2007). MRI and PET scans of brains of individuals with
APD reveal structural and activity abnormalities in the prefrontal
portion of the brain and the limbic amygdala circuitry. These regions
are known to underlie emotional processing (Brambilla et al., 2004;
Frankle, Lombardo, & New, 2005). Such pathology could inhibit the
capacity of people with APD to learn how to avoid punishment and could
render them unable to learn from experience. This explanation is
plausible, but there simply is not enough evidence to support its
acceptance. Many persons diagnosed with APD do not show activity
abnormalities in these regions of the brain (Milstein, 1988). In
addition, the electroencephalogram (EEG) is an

Multipath Analysis of One Personality Disorder: Antisocial Personality
Disorder

223

imprecise diagnostic device, and abnormal brain wave activity in people
with antisocial personalities may simply be correlated with, rather than
a cause of, disturbed behavior. Autonomic Nervous System Abnormalities
Other interesting research points to the involvement of the autonomic
nervous system (ANS) in the prominent features of APD: the inability to
learn from experience, the absence of anxiety, and the tendency to
engage in thrillseeking behaviors. Two lines of investigation can be
identified, both based on the assumption that people with APD have ANS
deficiencies or abnormalities. The first states that ANS abnormalities
make antisocial personalities less susceptible to anxiety and therefore
less likely to learn from their experiences in situations in which
aversive stimuli (or punishment) are involved. The second explanation
suggests that ANS abnormalities could keep antisocial people emotionally
underaroused. To achieve an optimal level of arousal or to avoid
boredom, underaroused individuals might seek excitement and thrills and
fail to conform to conventional behavioral standards. The two
premises---lack of anxiety and underarousal---may, of course, be related
because underarousal could include underaroused anxiety. Genetic
Predisposition to Fearlessness or Lack of Anxiety Lykken (1982)
maintained that because of genetic predisposition, people vary in their
levels of fearlessness. APD develops because of fearlessness or low
anxiety levels. People who have high levels of fear avoid risks, stress,
and strong stimulation; relatively fearless people seek thrills and
adventures. Fearlessness is associated with heroes (such as those who
volunteer for dangerous military action or who risk their lives to save
others), as well as with individuals with antisocial personalities who
may engage in risky criminal activities or impulsively violate norms and
rules. Lykken's (1957) classic research suggested that, because
psychopaths do not become conditioned to aversive stimuli as readily as
nonpsychopaths do, they fail to acquire avoidance behaviors, experience
little anticipatory anxiety, and consequently have fewer inhibitions
about engaging in antisocial behavior. More recent studies have also
demonstrated that low anxiety among psychopaths is associated with more
errors in learning tasks (Newman & Schmitt, 1998).

SENSATION SEEKING AND ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY Lykken theorized that
people with low anxiety levels are often thrill seekers. The difference
between the psychopath who takes risks and the adventurer may largely be
a matter of whether the thrill-seeking behaviors are channeled into
destructive or constructive acts. In this picture, we see a female skier
launching herself from an almost vertical cliff. It is believed,
however, that men are more likely to be risk takers than women. Do you
believe there are gender differences in thrill-seeking behaviors? If so,
what can account for the gender differences?

Arousal, Sensation-Seeking, and Behavioral Perspectives These studies by
Lykken and others suggest that individuals with APD may have
deficiencies in learning because of lower anxiety. Another line of
research proposes that they simply have lower levels of ANS reactivity
and are underaroused. According to this view, the sensitivity of
individuals' reticular cortical systems varies, although there is an
optimal level for each person. The system regulates the tonic level of
arousal in the cortex, so that some people have high and some have low
levels of arousal. Those with low sensitivity need more stimulation to
reach an optimal level of arousal (Goma, Perez, & Torrubia, 1988). If
psychopaths are underaroused, it may take a more intense stimulus to
elicit a reaction in them than in nonpsychopaths. The lowered levels of
reactivity may cause psychopaths to show impulsive, stimulus-seeking
behaviors to avoid boredom. Zuckerman (1996) believes that a trait he
calls impulsive unsocialized sensation seeking can help explain not only
APD but also other disorders. Those with this trait want to seek
adventures and thrills, are disinhibited, and are susceptible to
boredom. Psychopaths score high for this trait. Similarly, Farley (1986)
proposed that people vary in their degree of thrill-seeking behaviors.
At one end of the thrillseeking continuum are the "Big T's"---the risk
takers and adventurers who seek excitement and stimulation. Because of
their low levels of CNS or ANS arousal,

Did You Know?

I

s it possible that heroes and psychopaths are two sides of the same
coin? Both share one characteristic: fearlessness. They tend to choose
frightening or challenging situations, push the boundaries of acceptable
behavior, and may use deception to attain goals. The difference seems to
be that heroes channel their fearlessness into socially approved
activities and are socialized in families that emphasize loving
relationships rather than punishment. Psychopaths come from punitive and
hostile family environments (Lykken, 1982).

224

C H A P T E R 8 • PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Big T's need stimulation to maintain an optimal level of arousal. On the
other end of the continuum are "Little t's"---people with high arousal
who seek low levels of stimulation to calm their hyped-up nervous
systems. In contrast to Big T's, Little t's prefer certainty,
predictability, low risk, familiarity, clarity, simplicity, low
conflict, and low intensity.

Psychological Dimension Psychological explanations of personality
disorders and specifically APD tend to fall into three camps:
psychodynamic, cognitive, and social learning. Psychodynamic
Perspectives According to psychodynamic approaches, the psychopath's
absence of guilt and frequent violation of moral and ethical standards
are the result of faulty superego development (Fenichel, 1945). Although
the ego develops adequately, the personalities of people with APD are
dominated by id impulses that operate primarily from the pleasure
principle in seeking immediate (impulsive) gratification with minimal
regard for others (egocentricity). Because the infantile id is dominated
primarily by sex and aggression, so are people with APD who act out
these impulses on others (Millon et al., 2004). People exhibiting
antisocial behavior patterns presumably Did You Know? did not adequately
identify with their parents and thus did not internalize the morals and
values of eck and colleagues (1990) have proposed psychological society.
It is believed that frustration, rejection, or orientations (strategies)
and beliefs that characterize a number inconsistent discipline resulted
in fixation at an early of personality disorders. Do these make sense to

Cognitive Perspectives Cognitive explanations of APD stress the
relationship of core beliefs that influence behavior (Beck et al.,
1990). These core beliefs operate on a nonconscious level, occur
automatically, and influence emotions and behaviors. For the antisocial
person, the thoughts are "Others are patsies," "The world is hostile,"
"It's okay to take advantage of others," "Do unto others before they do
unto you." These thoughts arise from what Beck and colleagues (1990)
refer to as a "predatory strategy." It is built around a need to
perceive oneself as strong and independent, necessary attributes for
survival in a competitive, hostile, and unforgiving world.

Learning Perspectives Learning theories stress a number of different
forces in explaining APD: (1) inherent neurobiological characteristics
that delay or impede learning, (2) lack of positive role models in
developing prosocial behaviors, or (3) presence of poor role models. In
all cases, whether we are speaking about classical conditioning, operant
conditioning, or social modeling, it is proposed that biology or
social/developmental factors combine in unique ways to influence the
development of APD. As we have seen earlier, some believe that learning
deficiencies among individuals with APD are caused by the absence of
anxiety and by lowered autonomic reactivity. If so, is it possible to
improve their learning by increasing their anxiety or arousal ability?
To test this idea, researchers designed two conditions in which
psychopaths, a mixed group, and nonpsychopaths would perform an
avoidance learning task, with electric shock as the unconditioned
stimulus. Under one condition, participants were injected with
adrenaline, which presumably increases arousal; under the other, they
were injected with a placebo. Psychopaths receiving the placebo made
more errors in avoiding the shocks than did nonpsychopaths; psychopaths
receiving adrenaline, however, tended to perform better than
nonpsychopaths. These findings imply that psychopaths do not react to
the same amount of anxiety as do nonpsychopaths and that their learning
improves when their anxiety is increased (Schachter & Latané, 1964).

Disorder

.55 Mean avoidance learning

The kind of punishment used in avoidance learning is also an important
consideration in evaluating psychopaths' learning deficiencies (Schmauk,
1970). Whereas psychopaths may show learning deficits when faced with
physical (electric shock) or social (verbal feedback) punishments, they
learn as well as nonpsychopaths when the punishment is monetary loss.
Figure 8.2 shows the effects of the three types of punishment for
incorrect responses in Schmauk's study of convicted psychopaths. The
certainty of punishment may also influence the responsiveness of those
with antisocial personality disorder to punishment. Psychopaths and
nonpsychopaths do not seem to differ in responding when punishment is a
near certainty (Siegel, 1978). When the probability of punishment is
highly uncertain, however, psychopaths do not suppress their behaviors.
Threats of punishment by themselves do not seem to be sufficient to
discourage psychopaths. Social modeling or observational learning is a
complex form of learning that involves the social dimension in our
multipath model. As with our understanding of the reciprocal interaction
between autonomous nervous system reactivity and learning processes, so
too a strong relationship exists between how learning occurs through the
social dimension of APD. It is impossible to discuss one without the
other.

EFFECT OF TYPE OF PUNISHMENT ON PSYCHOPATHS AND OTHERS The effects of
three different types of punishment on an avoidance learning task are
shown for three groups of participants. Although physical or social
punishment had little impact on psychopaths' learning, monetary
punishment was quite effective.

Among the many factors that have been implicated in the development of
personality disorders, relationships within the Source: Schmauk (1970).
family---the primary agent of socialization---are paramount in the
development of antisocial patterns. In a review of factors that predict
delinquency and antisocial behaviors in children, it was found that a
family's socioeconomic status was a weak predictor, whereas other family
characteristics, such as poor parental supervision and involvement, were
good predictors (Loeber, 1990). Antisocial personality, according to
this view, results from children who are exposed to family environments
of neglect, hostility, indifference, and physical abuse (Millon et al.,
2004). Children from such environments learn that the world is cold,
unforgiving, and punitive. Struggle and survival become part of their
outlook on life, and they respond in an aggressive fashion to control
and manipulate the world. Rejection or deprivation by one or both
parents may mean that the child has little opportunity to learn socially
appropriate behaviors or that the value of people as socially
reinforcing agents is diminished. There is also evidence that family
structure, predictability of expectations, and dependability of family
roles are related to lower antisocial tendencies (Tolan et al., 1997).
Parental separation or absence and assaultive or inconsistent parenting
are related to antisocial personality (Phillips & Gunderson, 1999).
Children may have been traumatized or subjected to a hostile environment
during the parental separation, or the hostility in such families may
result in interpersonal hostility among the children (Benjamin, 1996;
Kiesler, 1996). Such situations may lead to little satisfaction in close
or meaningful relationships with others. Individuals with APD tend to
misperceive the motives and behaviors of others and have difficulty
being empathetic (Benjamin, 1996). It has been long established that
people with antisocial personality disorder can learn and use social
skills very effectively (Ullmann & Krasner, 1975), as shown in their
adeptness at manipulation, lying, and cheating and their ease at being
charming and sociable. The difficulty is that, in many areas of
learning, these individuals do not pay attention to social stimuli, and
their schedules of reinforcement differ from those of most other people.
Perhaps this relatively diminished attention stems from inconsistent
reinforcement from parents or inadequate feedback on behaviors.

226

C H A P T E R 8 • PERSONALITY DISORDERS

Children may also copy the behaviors of a parent who exhibits antisocial
tendencies. In one major study, researchers examined the past records
and statuses of nearly five hundred adults who had been seen about
thirty years earlier as children in a child guidance clinic. More than
ninety of the adults exhibited antisocial tendencies. These persons were
compared with a group of one hundred adults who, as children, had lived
in the same geographic area but had never been referred to the clinic.
The researchers found the following (Robins, 1966): 1. There was little
relationship between having antisocial personality disorder as an adult
and participating in gangs as a youth. 2. Antisocial behavior (theft,
aggression, juvenile delinquency, lying) in childhood was a predictor of
antisocial behavior in adults. 3. The adjustment level of fathers, but
not that of mothers, was significant---having a father who was
antisocial was related to adult antisocial characteristics. 4. Growing
up in a single-parent home was not related to psychopathy. This early
study seemed to indicate that antisocial behavior is probably influenced
by the presence of an antisocial father who either serves as a model for
such behavior or provides inadequate supervision, inconsistent
discipline, or family conflict. The father's influence on antisocial
behaviors in children may be a result of traditional gender role
training. Males have traditionally received more encouragement to engage
in aggressive behaviors than females have, and antisocial patterns are
more prevalent among men than among women. As traditional gender roles
change, one might reasonably expect that antisocial tendencies will
increase among females and that mothers will play a greater role in the
development of antisocial behaviors in children. Parental antisocial
patterns, especially among fathers, have also been implicated in the
development of child conduct disorders (Lahey et al., 1988).
Interestingly, divorce among parents does not appear to be related to
having children with conduct disorder, when parental antisocial
background is controlled. That is, the association between divorce and
increased conduct disorders of children was caused primarily by the fact
that divorced parents were more likely to be antisocial than were
married parents. It is unclear, however, whether the effects of having a
psychopathic parent are genetic (parents transmitting a certain genetic
makeup to children) or environmental (parents providing an antisocial
role model). Consistent with our multipath model, a disturbed family
background or disturbed parental model is neither a necessary nor a
sufficient condition for the development of antisocial personality.
Indeed, antisocial personality probably has multiple and interacting
dimensional causes.

Sociocultural Dimension The study of culture and personality has always
been of fascination to early anthropologists, who believed that culture
shapes the development of personality or that culture represents an
expanded extension of personality (Benedict, 1934; Kardiner, 1939; Mead,
1928). Little doubt exists that our lives are influenced by the values,
traditions, and institutions of our society and that such factors as
social class, race, gender, and other sociodemographic variables are
important in both normal and abnormal development (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a; Sue & Sue, 2008a). Determining the relative impact
of specific sociocultural factors, however, is a complicated procedure.
We have already seen that socioeconomic class is a weak predictor of
delinquency and APD but that gender and larger cultural values
(individualism and collectivism) may have a profound impact (Ivey et
al., 2007; Millon et al., 2004). Gender Because males are more likely to
exhibit both conduct disorders and APD than females, there is a strong
possibility that different pathways to development exist along gender
lines. For example, although parental conflict and disharmony are often
implicated in APD development, studies suggest that they do not predict

Treatment of Antisocial Personality Disorder

antisocial behavior for men but do predict it for women (Mulder et al.,
1994). Further, the specific manner of expression of APD seems
influenced by gender as well: men were found to exhibit job problems,
violence, and traffic offenses, whereas women were more likely to report
relationship problems, job problems, and violence. Because the sex role
for women emphasizes a less assertive and more peoplefocused
orientation, the term relational aggression has been coined to describe
the behavior of females with APD (Millon et al., 2004). Whereas men are
believed to engage in direct acting-out behaviors (physical aggression),
women express themselves by more indirect or passive means (spreading
rumors or false gossip and rejecting others from their social group). As
gender role differences have narrowed, however, female antisocial
behaviors have become progressively similar to those of their male
counterparts. Cultural Values To be born and raised in the United States
is to be exposed to the standards, beliefs, and values of United States
society. One dominant value is that of "rugged individualism," which is
composed of two assumptions: (1) healthy functioning is equated with
individualism and independence, and (2) people can and should master and
control their own lives and the universe (Sue & Sue, 2008a). Striving,
competition, and ability to manipulate the environment are considered
pathways to success; achievements are measured by surpassing the
attainment of others. In the extreme, this psychological orientation may
fuel the aggressive and violent behavior of antisocials. Other
societies, such as those in some Asian countries, possess values and
beliefs that are often at odds with individualistic values: collectivism
and interdependence are valued, concern is with group rather than
self-development, and being in harmony with the universe is preferred
over mastering it. Some have observed that antisocial behavior (crime
and violence) is less likely to occur in Japan and China than in the
United States because of these countries' collectivistic orientation, in
which harmony and relationship with others are valued (Ivey et al.,
2007). Such findings also seem to be present among Asian Americans and
Hispanic Americans in the United States. Because traditional Asian
values, for example, value harmony, subtlety, and restraint of strong
feelings, Asian American clients who seek therapy are less likely than
their white European American counterparts to evidence actingout
disorders (overt expressions of anger, physical aggression, verbal
hostility, substance abuse, and criminal behavior; Sue & Sue, 2008a).
Thus it is clear that the sociocultural dimension is a powerful
determinant in the etiology and manifestation of personality disorders.

Treatment of Antisocial Personality Disorder As you have seen, evidence
is growing that low anxiety and low autonomic reactivity characterize
individuals with APD. But we still do not know whether these
characteristics are products of inherited temperament, of an acquired
congenital defect, or of social and environmental experiences during
childhood. The theory that psychopaths have developed a defense against
anxiety is intriguing, but the factors behind the development of such a
defense have not been pinpointed. Because people with antisocial
personality disorder feel little anxiety, they are poorly motivated to
change themselves; they are also unlikely to see their behaviors as
"bad" and may try to manipulate or "con" therapists. Thus traditional
treatment approaches, which require the genuine cooperation of the
client, may be ineffective for antisocial personality disorder. Few
treatment outcome studies have been conducted for this disorder (Simon,
1998). In some studies, drugs with tranquilizing effects (phenothiazines
and Dilantin) have been helpful in reducing antisocial behavior (Meyer &
Osborne, 1982). People with antisocial personality disorder, however,
are not likely to follow through with self-medication. Moreover, drug
treatment is effective in only a few cases, and it can result in side
effects such as blurred vision, lethargy, and neurological disorders.

Impulse Control Disorders

D

eﬁnitions of personality disorders include the characteristic of
impulsivity. Yet DSM classiﬁes certain impulse control disorders in a
distinct category; these disorders occur in 8.9 percent of the
population during any given year (Kessler, Chiu, et al., 2005). Although
they may be long-standing and unvarying behavioral patterns, they are
not considered personality disorders. People with impulse control
disorders tend to share three characteristics: (1) they fail to resist
an impulse or temptation, despite knowing the act is wrong or harmful to
them or others; (2) they experience tension or arousal before the act;
and (3) they feel a sense of excitement, gratiﬁcation, or release after
committing the act. Guilt or regret may or may not follow. The core
feature of the disorder is the repeated expression of impulsive acts
that lead to physical or ﬁnancial damage to the individual or another
person, often resulting in a sense of relief or release of tension
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Disorders in this category
include intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, pathological
gambling, pyromania, and trichotillomania. 1. Intermittent explosive
disorder describes people who experience separate and discrete episodes
of loss of control over their aggressive impulses, resulting in serious
assaults on others or the destruction of property. The aggressiveness is
grossly out of proportion to any precipitating stress that may have
occurred. People with this disorder show no signs of general
aggressiveness between episodes and may genuinely feel remorse for their
actions. The disorder is apparently rare and believed to be much more
common among males than females. 2. Kleptomania is characterized by a
recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects. People with this
disorder do not need the objects for personal use and do not steal them
for their monetary value; indeed, they usually have enough money to buy
the objects and typically discard, give away, or surreptitiously return
them. The individual feels irresistible urges and tension before
stealing or shoplifting and then an intense feeling of relief or
gratiﬁcation after the theft. The stealing is not committed to express
anger or vengeance and is not in response to a delusion or
hallucination. The disorder appears to be more common among females than
among males. 3. Pathological gambling is a chronic and progressive
failure to resist impulses to gamble. The gambling occurs despite the
detrimental consequences that often accompany the behavior, such as
ﬁnancial ruin, turning to illegal activities to support gambling,
disruptions of family or interpersonal relationships, and sacriﬁcing
obligations and responsibilities. Those afﬂicted with pathological

gambling constitute about 1 to 3 percent of adults, with the disorder
more common among men than women (American Psychiatric Association,
2000a). 4. Pyromania is characterized by deliberate and purposeful ﬁre
setting on more than one occasion. Fire and burning objects fascinate
people with this disorder, who get intense pleasure or relief from
setting the ﬁres, watching things burn, or observing ﬁreﬁghters and
their efforts to put out ﬁres. Their ﬁre-setting impulses are driven by
this fascination rather than by motives involving revenge, sabotage, or
ﬁnancial gains. Fire setters have been reported to have high rates of
mood and substance use disorders (McElroy & Arnold, 2001). 5.
Trichotillomania is a disorder characterized by an inability to resist
impulses to pull out one's own hair. Although trichotillomania
principally involves the hairs in the scalp, a person with this disorder
may pull hair from other parts of the body, such as eyelashes, beard, or
eyebrows. Skin inﬂammation, itch, or other physical conditions do not
provoke the hair pulling. Rather, the person simply cannot resist the
impulse, which begins with a feeling of tension that is replaced by a
feeling of release or gratiﬁcation after the act. Initially, the hair
pulling may not disturb the follicles, and new hair will grow. In severe
cases, new growth is compromised and permanent balding results. Although
some of the impulse control disorders, such as pathological gambling and
pyromania, have gained much public attention, we know very little about
their speciﬁc causes. There is some debate about whether impulse control
disorders are more appropriately considered symptoms and manifestation
of some other disturbance, such as obsessivecompulsive disorders. For
example, the characteristics of impulse control disorders seem similar
to those found in this OCD in three ways: (1) the disorders have an
obsessivecompulsive quality in that the person feels a compulsion to
perform certain acts; (2) the impulse control disorders also have a
compulsive feature that is found in substance abusers or addicts who
must maintain their habits; (3) to some extent, the behaviors of people
with impulse control disorders resemble those of people with sexual
disorders (such as exhibitionism and fetishism) in that tension,
fascination, and release may precede or follow the acts. This
controversy has been recently reinvigorated by a move to declare
Internet addiction a new impulse control disorder in the 2012 edition of
DSM-V. In one major survey, it was found that 15 percent of client
youths described being addicted to the Internet and that they used the
Internet so frequently that they isolated themselves from family and
friends (Cynkar, 2007). Many children and adults not only feel a
compulsion to constantly surf

Treatment of Antisocial Personality Disorder the Internet but also
describe the cyberworld as their new social environment, in which they
enter chat rooms, instant-message one another, post their proﬁles on
MySpace, visit YouTube or pornography sites, and play virtual games
(Bishop, 2005; DeAngelis, 2007), to the detriment of relationships with
signiﬁcant others and of their education or jobs. Opponents of including
Internet addiction as a disorder believe the move is unwarranted because
it represents a form of compulsion or "self-medication" from an existing
disorder such as depression or loneliness. A lonely social isolate may
be dependent on the Internet for vicarious companionship, but it is a
compensatory response to an

229

existing personal problem. An overly broad approach to the deﬁnition of
addiction opens the ﬂoodgates to declaring every compensatory behavior
an impulse control disorder, such as ﬁngernail biting, frequent sexual
activities, or even excessive use of the telephone. For Further
Consideration 1. Can you make a case for and against the existence of
impulse control disorders as distinct from other forms of compulsive
activities? 2. What are your thoughts about Internet addiction? Have you
ever found yourself so preoccupied with Internet use that other aspects
of your life have suffered?

It may be that successful treatment can occur only in a setting in which
behavior can be controlled. That is, treatment programs may need to
provide enough control so that those with antisocial personalities
cannot avoid confronting their inability to form close and intimate
relationships and the effect of their behaviors on others. Such control
is sometimes possible for psychopaths who are imprisoned for crimes or
who, for one reason or another, are hospitalized. Intensive group
therapy may then be initiated to help clients with antisocial
personalities in the required confrontation. Some behavior modification
programs have been tried, especially with delinquents who behave in
antisocial ways. The most useful treatments are skill based and
behavioral (Meloy, 2001). Money and tokens that can be used to purchase
items have been given as rewards to young people who show appropriate
behaviors (discussion of personal problems, good study habits,
punctuality, and prosocial and nondisruptive behaviors). This use of
material rewards has been fairly effective in changing antisocial
behaviors (Van Evra, 1983). Once the young people leave the treatment
programs, however, they are likely to revert to antisocial behavior
unless their families and peers help them maintain the appropriate
behaviors. Cognitive approaches have also been used. Because individuals
with antisocial personalities may be influenced by dysfunctional beliefs
about themselves, the world, and the future, they vary in skills for
anticipating and acting on possible negative outcomes of their
behaviors. Beck and colleagues (1990) have advocated that the therapist
build rapport with the client, attempting to guide the patient away from
thinking only in terms of self-interest and immediate gratification and
toward higher levels of thinking. These higher levels would include, for
example, recognizing the effects of one's behaviors on others and
developing a sense of responsibility. Because cognitive and behavioral
approaches assume that antisocial behaviors are learned, treatment
programs may target these behaviors by setting rules and enforcing
consequences for rule violations, substituting new behaviors for
undesirable ones, and learning to anticipate consequences of behaviors
(Meloy, 2001). Because current treatment programs do not seem very
effective, new strategies must be used. These strategies should focus on
antisocial youths who seem amenable to treatment, and treatment programs
should broaden the base of intervention to involve not only the young
clients but also their families and peers. Because people with
antisocial personality disorder may seek thrills (Big T's), they may
respond to intervention programs that provide the physical and mental
stimulation they need (Farley, 1986). Longitudinal studies show that the
prevalence of this disorder diminishes with age as these individuals
become more aware of the social and interpersonal maladaptiveness of
their social behaviors (Phillips & Gunderson, 1999).

I M P L I C AT I O N S

Although personality disorders have generated rich clinical examples and
speculation, not much empirical research has been conducted to provide
definitive insights into the causes of the disorders. Many researchers
use the five-factor model of personality, which describes personality
patterns in terms of neuroticism (emotional adjustment and stability),
extraversion (preference for interpersonal interactions, being
fun-loving and active), openness to experience (curiosity, willingness
to entertain new ideas and values, and emotional responsiveness),
agreeableness (being good-natured, helpful, forgiving, and responsive),
and conscientiousness (being organized, persistent, punctual, and
self-directed; Widiger, 2007). Individuals vary in the extent to which
they exhibit any of these factors. For example, in terms of deliberation
(the factor of conscientiousness), an individual with antisocial
personality disorder would score low, whereas one with
obsessivecompulsive personality disorder would score high. The
five-factor model allows researchers and clinicians to assess
personality disorders as a particular set of personality characteristics
and to compare different disorders. It also views the etiology of
personality disorders as a matter of discovering determinants of
personality in general. Our review of the etiology of APD seems to
suggest that other personality disorders are also the result of a
multidimensional interaction of biological, psychological, social, and
sociocultural factors. As we have seen, studies consistently indicate
that genetic as well as environmental factors interact in many ways with
differential outcomes. It appears, for example, that certain genetic
characteristics of individual children may determine much of the
environment they experience, so that the contributions of heredity and
environment may be quite complex. Genetic characteristics may affect
environmental factors, which in turn influence personality (Saudino,
1997). Individuals who inherit a disposition to be sociable may seek out
certain social environments, joining social clubs and engaging in
interpersonal activities. These environments may then further strengthen
the personality's tendency toward sociability. Again, our multipath
model looks for explanations of personality disorders from a
multidimensional rather than a singular perspective.

Summary 1. What are personality disorders, and how are they viewed? ■
Personality disorders are enduring, inflexible, long-

standing maladaptive personality traits that cause significant
functional impairment, subjective distress, or a combination of both.
DSM-IV-TR lists ten specific personality disorders; each causes notable
impairment of social or occupational functioning or subjective distress
for the person. They are usually manifested in adolescence and continue
into adulthood, and they involve disturbances in personality
characteristics. ■ There are differences in thought as to whether per-

sonality disorders should be viewed categorically or in a dimensional
manner (extremes on a continuum of normal personality traits). The
personality disorders include a diversity of behavioral patterns in
people who are typically perceived as being odd or eccentric; dramatic,
emotional, and erratic; or anxious and fearful. 2. What personality
disorders are considered odd or eccentric? ■ The three personality
disorders in this cluster are paranoid personality disorder
(suspiciousness, hypersensitivity, and mistrust); schizoid personality
disorder (social isolation and indifference to others); and schizotypal
personality disorder (peculiar thoughts and behaviors). 3. What
personality disorders are considered dramatic, emotional, or erratic? ■
The four personality disorders in this cluster are antisocial
personality disorder (failure to conform to social or legal codes of
conduct); borderline personality disorder (intense mood and self-image
fluctuations);

histrionic personality disorder (self-dramatization and
attention-seeking behaviors); and narcissistic personality disorder
(sense of self-importance and lack of empathy). 4. What personality
disorders are considered anxious and fearful? ■ The

three personality disorders in this cluster are avoidant personality
disorder (fear of rejection and humiliation); dependent personality
disorder (reliance on others and inability to assume responsibility);
and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (perfectionism and
interpersonal control).

5.  How does the multipath model explain antisocial personality
    disorder? ■ Because personality is at the core of the disorder,
    etiological explanations focus on factors that influence
    personality. Genetics and neurobiological factors (underarousal of
    ANS and low anxiety), psychodynamic, cognitive and learning
    formulations, social or parental and family environments, and
    sociocultural factors (gender, race, and culture) all seem to
    contribute in a highly complex fashion.
6.  What types of therapy are used in treating antisocial personality
    disorder? ■ Traditional treatment approaches are not particularly
    effective with antisocial personalities. It may be that successful
    treatment can occur only in a setting in which behavior can be
    controlled. That is, treatment programs may need to provide enough
    control so that those with antisocial personalities cannot avoid
    confronting their inability to form close and intimate relationships
    and the effect of their behaviors on others.

im was a ﬁfty-four-year-old alcoholic. He was well educated, having
received a bachelor's degree in engineering and a master's degree in
management. Until recently, he was employed as a middle manager in an
aerospace ﬁrm. Because of federal defense industry budget cuts and
because of his absenteeism from work caused by drinking, Jim lost his
job. He decided to enter treatment. His drinking history was long. Jim
clearly recalled the ﬁrst time that he drank. At age ﬁfteen, he attended
a party at his friend's house. Alcohol was freely served. Jim took a
drink, and despite the fact that alcohol "tasted so bad," he forced
himself to continue drinking. Indeed, he became drunk and had a terrible
hangover the next day. He swore that he would never drink again, but two
weeks later he drank again at his friend's house. Over the next several
years, Jim acquired the ability to consume large amounts of alcohol and
was proud of his drinking capacity. At social gatherings, he was
uninhibited and the "life of the party." His drinking continued during
college, but it was conﬁned primarily to his fraternity weekend parties.
He was considered a very heavy drinker in the fraternity, but the
drinking did not seem to affect his academic performance. He frequently
drove his car during weekend binges, however, and was once caught and
convicted of drunken driving. After graduate school, he got married and
took a position in an aerospace ﬁrm. Katie, Jim's wife, also drank but
never as heavily as Jim. Although his drinking had been largely conﬁned
to weekends, Jim started drinking throughout the week. He attributed his
increased drinking to pressures at work, company-sponsored receptions at
which alcohol was served, and a desire to feel "free and comfortable" in
front of company executives during the receptions. Over time, Jim was
unable to complete work assignments on time and was frequently absent
from work because of his drinking. The drinking continued despite
frequent arguments with Katie over his drinking and a physician's
warning, after a routine physical examination, that alcohol had probably

caused the abnormal results of Jim's liver-functioning tests. He could
not control his alcohol consumption. Katie noticed that Jim was getting
angrier and angrier over his work assignments. Jim felt that deadlines
for him to complete assignments were unrealistic. She felt that he was
increasingly difﬁcult to be around. He drank now daily, usually in his
ofﬁce at the end of the workday. His colleagues knew Jim had a drinking
problem, but because he was still functioning well at work, they kidded
him about drinking rather than counseling him against consuming alcohol.
They were, however, concerned about his absenteeism, frequent tardiness,
and inability to get started in the morning, which were caused by his
drinking. Over the years, Katie simply fell out of love with Jim. The
arguments, Jim's drinking, and his unwillingness to communicate with her
ﬁnally led to a divorce. He was quite bitter over the divorce, although
Katie could not see how he was getting anything out of the marriage.
When awards for defense contracts had diminished, Jim's company started
to lay off workers. Jim was among the ﬁrst to be asked to leave.

Problem drinking can develop in many different ways and can begin at
almost any age. However, Jim's history is typical in several respects.
First, as is true of most people, he initially found the taste of
alcohol unpleasant, and, after his first bout of drunkenness, he swore
that he would never drink again. Nevertheless, Jim did return to
drinking. Second, heavy drinking served a purpose: it reduced his
anxiety, particularly at work. Third, consumption continued despite the
obvious negative consequences. Fourth and finally, a preoccupation with
alcohol consumption and the deterioration of social and occupational
functioning are also characteristic of the problem drinker. Why did Jim
force himself to drink when alcohol initially tasted so bad? Even though
alcohol may have reduced some work anxieties, it also increased
arguments with his wife and resulted in health problems. Why drink and
become an alcoholic? Throughout history, people have swallowed, sniffed,
smoked, or otherwise taken into their bodies a variety of chemical
substances for the purpose of altering their moods, levels of
consciousness, or behaviors. The widespread use of drugs in our society
today is readily apparent in our vast consumption of alcohol, tobacco,
coffee, medically prescribed tranquilizers, and illegal drugs such as
cocaine, marijuana, and heroin. Compared with other societies, our
society is generally permissive with regard to the use of these
substances. As indicated in Figure 9.1, many people have tried
substances, especially alcohol, at some time in their lives. The
substances or drugs are psychoactive in that they alter moods, thought
processes, or other psychological states. Substance-related disorders
are ailments arising from the use of psychoactive substances that affect
the central nervous system and cause significant social, occupational,
psychological, or physical problems. DSM-IV-TR divides substancerelated
disorders into two categories: (1) substance-use disorders that involve
dependence and abuse and (2) substance-induced disorders, such as
withdrawal and substance-induced delirium. The discussion in this
chapter focuses primarily

on the substance-use disorders represented in Table 9.1, rather than on
substanceinduced disorders or maladaptive use of other substances such
as anabolic steroids and nitrous oxide ("laughing gas"). Some
substance-induced cognitive disorders are discussed in the chapter on
cognitive disorders. DSM-IV-TR differentiates the substance-use
disorders in two ways: (1) by the actual substance used and (2) by
whether the disorder pattern is that of substance abuse or substance
dependence. Regardless of the substance involved, the general
characteristics of the abuse or dependence are the same. Substance abuse
is a maladaptive pattern of recurrent use that extends over a period of
twelve months, that leads to notable impairment or distress, and that
continues despite social, occupational, psychological, physical, or
safety problems. The abuse may cause legal problems (e.g., illegal
activities to support a drug habit) or jeopardize the safety of the user
or others (such as driving while intoxicated). It may affect the user's
ability to maintain meaningful social relationships or to fulfill major
role obligations at work, school, or home. And need for the substance
may lead to a preoccupation with its acquisition and use. In substance
dependence, a person exhibits several of the following symptoms over a

the substance, despite knowledge of its harmful physical, psychological,
or interpersonal effects. 2. The user takes increasingly larger amounts
of the substance or continues to use it over a longer period than he or
she intended. 3. The user devotes considerable time to activities
necessary to obtain the substance, even though those activities mean
that important social, occupational, and recreational activities must be
sacrificed. 4. The user exhibits evidence of tolerance: increasing doses
of the substance are necessary to achieve the desired effect, such as a

    concentrate after reducing or ceasing intake of the substance. In
    diagnosing substance dependence, the clinician also specifies
    whether the dependence is physiological; evidence of either
    tolerance or withdrawal indicates physiological dependence. As can
    be readily noted, the criteria for substance dependence include
    those for abuse and withdrawal. Because dependence is considered the
    more severe disorder, people who meet the criteria for both
    dependence and abuse for a particular substance are diagnosed only
    as dependent, not as abusing. In this chapter, we first examine
    substance-use disorders, including the effects of the abuse of
    alcohol and various drugs. We also examine the degree to which
    different theories may increase our understanding of the causes and
    treatment of the abuse of alcohol and other substances.

Substance-Use Disorders A number of substances can result in abuse,
dependence, intoxication, and withdrawal. Among them are prescription
drugs such as Valium; legal substances such as alcohol and cigarettes;
and illegal substances such as LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide),
cocaine, and heroin. Alcohol and substance abuse is the second leading
cause of disability in the United States, Canada, and western Europe,
ahead of physical diseases and second only to mental illness
(President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003). Each of the
drugs discussed in this chapter can create an abuse or dependence
disorder. Many are also associated with legal problems, because their
use is expressly prohibited except under strict medical supervision. We
discuss general categories of substances---depressants, stimulants, and
hallucinogens---that contain many specific drugs, such as alcohol,
narcotics, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,

easily classified because they may have multiple effects.

Depressants or Sedatives Depressants (or sedatives) cause generalized
depression of the central nervous system and a slowing down of
responses. People taking such substances feel calm and relaxed. They may
also become sociable and open because of lowered interpersonal
inhibitions. Let's examine in more detail one of the most widely used
depressants--- alcohol---and then discuss other depressants, such as
narcotics, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines. Alcohol-Use Disorders
Alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are, of course, substance abuse and
dependence in which the substance is alcohol. People who have either of
these alcohol-related disorders are popularly referred to as alcoholics,
and their disorder as alcoholism. Drinking problems can be exhibited in
two major ways. First, the person may need to use alcohol daily to
function; that is, he or she may be unable to abstain. Second, the
person may be able to abstain from consuming alcohol for certain periods
of time but fail to control drinking once it has started. This person is
a "binge" drinker. Both patterns of drinking can result in deteriorating
relationships, job loss, family conflicts, and violent behavior while
intoxicated. Alcohol Consumption in the United States People drink
considerable amounts of alcohol in the United States. Some interesting
facts: • Slightly more than half (51 percent) of Americans age twelve or
older reported being current drinkers of alcohol (Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration \[SAMHSA\], 2007). This translates
to an estimated 125 million people. • Most of the alcohol is consumed by
a small percentage of people---50 percent of the total alcohol consumed
is drunk by only 10 percent of drinkers. • Drinking is widespread among
young people. Among persons ages twelve to twenty, about 10.8 million
(28.3 percent of this age group) reported drinking alcohol in the
preceding month (SAMHSA, 2007). • Over 14 million American adults suffer
from alcohol abuse or dependence (Nitzkin & Smith, 2004). • Early use of
alcohol has been found to be a strong predictor of progression into
serious problem drinking (Nelson, Heath, & Kessler, 1998). • Men drink
two to five times as much as women, although gender differences in the
use of alcohol are decreasing (Nelson et al., 1998). • Ethnic
differences exist in consumption patterns (SAMHSA, 2007), with
nonHispanic whites having among the highest rates, as indicated in
Figure 9.2. Problems associated with alcohol consumption in the United
States are apparent in terms of social, medical, physical, and financial
costs. Alcohol consumption and alcoholism are associated with serious
health-care costs; lowered productivity on the job; shortened life
expectancy (by about ten to twelve years); and high rates of suicide,
automobile accidents, spousal abuse, and divorce. Over seventy-five
thousand deaths per year are due to excessive alcohol use, which is the
third leading lifestyle-related cause of death in the United States
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006). Concern has also
been directed at children of alcoholic parents, who are at risk for
social maladjustment, self-depreciation, lower self-esteem, and
alcoholism (Fields, 2004). In view of the problems associated with
alcohol use, why do people continue drinking? Particularly ironic is the
fact that, like Jim in our case description at the beginning of the
chapter, most people consuming alcoholic beverages for the first time
find the taste unpleasant. To better understand this puzzle, let's
consider the physiological and psychological effects of alcohol.

The Effects of Alcohol Alcohol has both physiological and psychological
effects, which can be further broken down into short-term and long-term
effects. We consider short-term effects first. Once swallowed, alcohol
is absorbed into the blood without digestion. When it reaches the brain,

alcohol depresses the inhibitory brain centers), poor judgment, and
reduced concentration. Depending on the situation or context in which
drinking occurs, other effects, such as negative moods and anger, may
also be experienced. Reactions also depend on the expectancy that
individuals have developed with respect to alcohol (Witkiewitz &
Marlatt, 2004). Some people behave differently in the presence of others
simply because of their perception that they have been drinking, not
because of the effects of the alcohol (as, for example, when an
individual has only a few sips of beer and begins to act hostile). Heavy
and prolonged drinking often impairs sexual performance and produces a
hangover. Ironically, because of the loss of inhibitions, people
mistakenly believe that alcohol is a stimulant rather than a depressant.
The long-term psychological effects of heavy drinking are more serious.
Although THE COST OF DRINKING At a press conference, a mother talks
about the death there is no single type of alcoholic, Jellinek of her
son Dustin Church, 18, who was killed in an alcohol-related car
accident. (1971) observed certain patterns among indiDo you know of

develop alcohol dependence. The case of Jim is an example of this
pattern. Most people begin to drink in social situations. Because the
alcohol relieves tension, the drinkers tend to drink more and to drink
more frequently. Tolerance levels may increase over a period of months
or years. Because of stress, inability to adequately cope, or biological
predisposition to alcoholism, some drinkers become preoccupied with

of intense euphoria and well-being (and sometimes negative reactions
such as nausea) often accompany narcotics use. Opium and its derivatives
(especially heroin) result in dependency. Tolerance for narcotics builds
rapidly, and withdrawal symptoms are severe. Opiates such as heroin are
usually administered intravenously, causing puncture marks on the
extremities of the body and spreading diseases such as AIDS, which can
be transmitted through needle sharing. Over 25 percent of AIDS cases
involve persons who abuse intravenous drugs (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2007b). According to a recent report, about 0.3 percent
of persons age twelve or older used heroin during the preceding month
(SAMHSA, 2007), and 0.7 percent of the adult population has shown opioid
abuse or dependence at some time during their lives. The prevalence of
addiction decreases with age, and males are more affected than females
by a ratio of 1.5:1 for opioids other than heroin (that is, those
available by prescription) and 3:1 for heroin (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a). Because dependency is likely to occur after
repeated use, narcotics addicts are usually unable to maintain normal
relationships with family and friends or to pursue legitimate careers.
They live to obtain the drug through any possible means. Nonmedical use
of narcotics is illegal, and many addicts have little choice but to turn
to criminal activities to obtain the drug and to support their expensive
habits. Overdosing can occur and can result in death. Barbiturates
Synthetic barbiturates, or "downers," are powerful depressants of the
central nervous system, and, like alcohol, can reduce inhibitions and
become intoxicating. They are used to induce relaxation and sleep,
although they are not often prescribed because of the availability of
less powerful tranquilizers and sleeping pills. They are quite dangerous
for several reasons. First, psychological and physical dependence can
develop. Second, although their legal use as a tranquilizer and sleeping
aid is restricted, their availability in the illegal drug market makes
it difficult to control misuse or abuse. More than 1 million
individuals---primarily middle-aged and older people---are now estimated
to be barbiturate addicts. Third, users often experience harmful
physical effects. Excessive use of either barbiturates or heroin can be
fatal, but barbiturates are the more lethal. Constant heroin use
increases the amount of the drug required for a lethal dosage. The
lethal dosage of barbiturates does not increase with prolonged use, so
accidental overdose and death can easily occur. And combining alcohol
with barbiturates can be especially dangerous because alcohol compounds
the depressant effects of the barbiturates, as it did in the following
case.

C H A P T E R 9 • SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS

Case Study Kelly M., a seventeen-year-old girl from an
upper-middle-class background, lived with her divorced mother. Kelly was
hospitalized after her mother found her unconscious from an overdose of
barbiturates, consumed together with alcohol. She survived the overdose
and later told the therapist that she had regularly used barbiturates
for the previous year and a half. The overdose was apparently accidental
and not suicidal. For several weeks following the overdose, Kelly openly
discussed her use of barbiturates with the therapist. She had been
introduced to the drugs by a boy in school who told her they would help
her relax. Kelly was apparently unhappy over her parents' divorce. She
felt that her mother did not want her, especially because her mother
spent a lot of time away from home building a real estate agency. And
although she enjoyed occasional visits with her father, Kelly felt
extremely uncomfortable in the presence of the woman who lived with him.
The barbiturates helped her relax and relieved her tensions. Arguments
with her mother would precipitate heavy use of the drugs. Eventually she
became dependent on barbiturates and always spent her allowance to buy
them. Her mother reported that she had no knowledge of her daughter's
drug use. She did notice, though, that Kelly was increasingly isolated
and sleepy. The therapist informed Kelly of the dangers of barbiturates
and of combining them with alcohol. Kelly agreed to undergo treatment,
which included the gradual reduction of barbiturate use, as well as
psychotherapy with her mother.

Kelly's practice of polysubstance use, or the use of more than one
chemical substance at the same time, can be extremely dangerous. For
example, heavy smokers who consume a great deal of alcohol run an
increased risk of esophageal cancer. Chemicals taken simultaneously may
exhibit a synergistic effect, interacting to multiply one another's
effects. For example, when a large dose of barbiturates is taken along
with alcohol, death may occur because of a synergistic effect that
depresses the central nervous system. Furthermore, one of the substances
(such as alcohol) may reduce the person's judgment, resulting in
excessive (or lethal) use of

POLYSUBSTANCE ABUSE Using one psychoactive drug can be dangerous in
itself, but mixing two or more chemical substances at the same time can
be deadly. Each of these talented performers---Jim Morrison, Janis
Joplin, John Belushi, and River Phoenix---died from polydrug use. How

the other drug. Equally dangerous is the use of one drug to counteract
the effect of another. For instance, a person who has taken a stimulant
to feel euphoric may later take an excessive amount of a depressant
(such as a barbiturate) in an attempt to get some sleep. The result can
be an exceedingly harmful physiological reaction. According to
DSM-IV-TR, polysubstance dependence may be diagnosed if (1) a person has
used at least three substances (not including nicotine and caffeine) for
a period of twelve months and (2) during this period, the person meets
the criteria for substance dependence for the substances considered as a
group but not for any single specific substance. Benzodiazepines One
member of this category of drugs is Valium, which is one of the most
widely prescribed drugs in the United States (Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration \[SAMHSA\], 2002). Like other sedatives,
Valium is a central nervous system depressant; it is often used to
reduce anxiety and muscle tension. People who take the drug seem less
concerned with and less affected by their problems. Some side effects
may occur, such as drowsiness, skin rash, nausea, and depression, but
the greatest danger in using Valium is in abusing it. Because life
stressors are unavoidable, many people use Valium as their sole means of
dealing with stress; then, as tolerance develops, dependence on the drug
may also grow. The female-to-male and white-to-African American use
ratios are about 3:1 (Franklin & Frances, 1999). Benzodiazepines are
more likely to be prescribed for older adults, so there is special
concern for this population (SAMHSA, 2002; U.S. Surgeon General, 1999).

Stimulants A stimulant is a substance that is a central nervous system
energizer, inducing elation, grandiosity, hyperactivity, agitation, and
appetite suppression. Commonly used stimulants are amphetamines,
caffeine, nicotine, and cocaine and crack. Amphetamines Amphetamines,
also known as "uppers," speed up central nervous system activity and
bestow on users increased alertness, energy, and sometimes feelings of
euphoria and confidence. They increase the concentration of the
neurotransmitter dopamine in synapses, which exposes the postsynaptic
cells to high levels of dopamine. Increased concentration of dopamine
may amplify nerve impulses in the brain that are associated with
pleasure (Brower, 2006; Wise, 1988). Amphetamines inhibit appetite and
sleep, and some are used as appetite suppressants or diet pills. These
stimulants may be physically addictive and become habit forming, with a
rapid increase in tolerance. They are taken orally, intravenously, or
nasally ("snorting"). "Speed freaks" inject amphetamines into their
blood vessels and become extremely hyperactive and euphoric for days.
Another immediate and powerful effect is obtained by smoking a pure,
crystalline form ("ice") of the substance (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a). Assaultive, homicidal, and suicidal behaviors can
occur during this time. Heavy doses may trigger delusions of
persecution, similar to those seen among people with paranoid
schizophrenia. Overdoses are fatal, and brain damage has been observed
among chronic abusers. About 2 percent of U.S. adults have suffered from
amphetamine abuse or dependence at some time during their lives. It is
more common among persons from lower socioeconomic groups and among men
than women by a ratio of two or three to one (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a; SAMHSA, 2007). Amphetamine is closely related
chemically to methamphetamine, an even more powerful stimulant.
Methamphetamines and other stimulants, such as Ecstasy
(methylenedioxymethamphetamine), are often called "club drugs," which is
a term that comes from the popular use of certain drugs at dance clubs
and "raves." Other substances, such as the hallucinogen LSD (d-lysergic
acid diethylamide), GHB (gamma hydroxybutyrate), Ketamine, Roofies or
Rohypnol (flunitrazepam), alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine, may also be
taken at raves. The substances tend to induce energy and excitement,
feelings of well-being and connection with others

and one's environment, and loss of inhibitions. After the substances are
ingested, the effects of well-being may last for hours. The aftereffects
may last for twentyfour hours or more, and users may experience
lethargy, low motivation, and fatigue. Some experience severe effects,
such as depression and anxiety, as well as physical changes in blood
pressure, convulsions, and even death. In the case of Ecstasy,
longlasting damage can occur to brain areas that are critical for
thought and memory. Roofies (Rohypnol) are short-acting benzodiazepines
that interfere with shortterm memory. Rohypnol is known as the
"date-rape" drug because unsuspecting individuals who are given the drug
may feel uninhibited and not remember recent activities. It is a
tasteless and odorless drug that dissolves easily in beverages. Because
of psychological, cognitive, and biological dangers associated with
their use, club drugs are considered unsafe.

Caffeine Caffeine is a legal stimulant ingested primarily in coffee,
chocolate, tea, and cola drinks. It is the most widely consumed
psychoactive substance in the world, prized by almost every culture for
its ability to perk people up and keep them awake. In North America,
about 90 percent of adults report using caffeine every day, and the
average American consumes approximately 200 milligrams (mg) of caffeine
per day (Larson & Carey, 1998). Caffeine is considered intoxicating
when, after recently ingesting 250 mg (about two cups of coffee) or
more, a person shows several of the following symptoms: restlessness,
nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, gastrointestinal
disturbance, rambling speech, and cardiac arrhythmia. The consequences
of caffeine intoxication are usually transitory and relatively minor. In
some cases, however, the intoxication is chronic and seriously affects
the gastrointestinal or circulatory system. Nicotine Nicotine is another
widely used legal stimulant, and dependence on it is most commonly
associated with cigarette smoking. Media campaigns periodically immerse
the public in warnings that cigarette smoking is harmful to the body and
that secondhand smoke is dangerous to others. Cigarette smoking accounts
for nearly one-fifth of the deaths in the United States and is the
single most preventable cause of death (American Cancer Society, 2007).
The prevalence of smoking is decreasing slightly in most industrialized
nations, but it is rising in developing areas. According to SAMHSA
(2007), 29.6 percent of the U.S. population age twelve or older reported
current use of a tobacco product. During the month, 25 percent of the
population had smoked cigarettes, 5.6 percent had smoked cigars, 3.3
percent had used smokeless tobacco, and 0.9 percent had smoked tobacco
in pipes. Some, of course, used more than one type of tobacco. The
highest rate of use was reported by young adults ages eighteen to
twenty-five (43.9 percent). In terms of gender, a higher proportion of
males than females smoked cigarettes (27.8 vs. 22.4 percent). As it is
estimated that between 80 and 90 percent of regular smokers are nicotine
dependent, close to 25 percent of the U.S. population may be nicotine
dependent (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). It has long been
shown that cigarettes are strongly addicting. Schachter (1977) noted
that chronic smokers need their "normal" constant intake of nicotine.
When heavy smokers are given low-nicotine cigarettes, they smoke more
cigarettes and puff more frequently. The following symptoms are
characteristic of nicotine dependence: • Attempts to stop or reduce
tobacco use on a permanent basis have been unsuccessful. • Attempts to
stop smoking have led to withdrawal symptoms, such as a craving for
tobacco, irritability, difficulty in concentrating, sleep difficulties,
and restlessness. • Tobacco use continues despite a serious physical
disorder, such as emphysema, that the smoker knows is exacerbated by
tobacco use. Cocaine and Crack A great deal of publicity and concern has
been devoted to the use of cocaine, a substance that is extracted from
the coca plant and that induces feelings of euphoria and self-confidence
in users. A number of professional athletes,

film stars, political figures, and other notables use this drug
regularly. Cocaine is a fashionable drug, especially among middle- and
upper-class professionals, and its use is equally distributed between
males and females. Cocaine has among the highest levels of past-year
illicit drug dependence or abuse (1.7 million persons), according to
SAMHSA (2007). In the late 1800s, cocaine was heralded as a wonder drug
for remedying depression, indigestion, headaches, pain, and other
ailments. It was often included in medicines, tonics, and wines; it was
even used in cola drinks such as Coca-Cola. In the early 1900s, however,
its use was controlled, and the possession of cocaine is now illegal.
Cocaine can be eaten, injected intravenously, or smoked, but it is
usually "snorted" (inhaled). Eating does not produce rapid effects, and
intravenous use requires injection with a needle, which leaves needle
marks and introduces the possibility of infection. When cocaine is
inhaled into the nasal cavity, however, the person quickly feels
euphoric, stimulated, and confident. Heart rate and blood pressure
increase, and (according to users) fatigue and appetite are reduced. As
in the case of amphetamines, cocaine appears to increase synaptic
dopamine levels in the brain by inhibiting the reuptake of the dopamine.
These actions may make the drug reinforcing and stimulating (Brower,
2006).

Users may become dependent on cocaine. That is, a user can develop an
addiction and be unable to stop using it, sometimes after only a short
period of time. Although users do not show gross physiological
withdrawal symptoms, Gawin (1991) noted that the distinction between
psychological and physical addiction is difficult to make and that
chronic abuse of cocaine can produce neurophysiological changes in the
central nervous system. The constant desire for cocaine can impair
social and occupational functioning, and the high cost of the substance
can cause users to resort to crime to feed their habit. In addition,
side effects can occur. Feelings of depression and gloom may be produced
when a cocaine high wears off. Heavy users sometimes report weight loss,
paranoia, nervousness, fatigue, and hallucinations. Because cocaine
stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, premature ventricular
heartbeats and death may occur. Crack is a purified and potent form of
cocaine produced by heating cocaine with ether ("freebasing"). Crack is
sold as small, solid pieces or "rocks." When smoked, crack produces
swift and marked euphoria, followed by depression. About 0.3 percent of
persons (0.7 million) twelve years of age or older used crack during the
month before they were surveyed. Among full-time college students, the
rate is 0.1 percent (SAMHSA, 2007). Crack is a major concern to society
for four reasons. First, it is relatively inexpensive and readily
obtainable, so large segments of the population have easy access to the
substance. Second, the euphoria of the high from crack is quite intense
and immediate compared with sniffing cocaine. Thus many people prefer
crack. Third, users appear to develop a relatively rapid addiction to
crack, and they continually seek the substance. Fourth, because of the
increasing popularity of the drug and the crimes associated with crack,
law enforcement resources have been expanded in the attempt to control
its sale, distribution, and use.

Hallucinogens Hallucinogens are substances that produce hallucinations,
vivid sensory awareness, heightened alertness, or perceptions of
increased insight. Their use does not typically lead to physical
dependence (that is, to increased tolerance or withdrawal reaction),
although psychological dependency may occur. Common hallucinogens are
marijuana, LSD, and PCP.

Marijuana The mildest and most commonly used hallucinogen is marijuana,
also known as "pot" or "grass." Although DSM-IV-TR does not technically
consider marijuana a hallucinogen, it does have many of the same effects
as hallucinogens. This substance is generally smoked in a cigarette, or
"joint." Among persons age twelve or older, the rate of preceding-month
marijuana use was 6.0 percent (SAMHSA, 2007). About 40 percent of the
U.S. population over age twelve has used marijuana, although it is an
illegal substance. Marijuana use is most common in the age range of
eighteen to thirty years and in the male population. As in the case of
cigarettes, chronic smoking of marijuana can lead to lung cancer. The
subjective effects of marijuana include feelings of euphoria,
tranquility, and passivity. Once the drug has taken effect, subjective
time passes slowly, and some users report increased sensory experiences,
as well as mild perceptual distortions. Individual reactions vary
according to prior experience with marijuana, expectancy of its effects,
and the setting in which it is used. Simons and colleagues (1998) found
that the enhancement of perceptual and cognitive experiences was an
important motive in marijuana use. Although much controversy has raged
over the effects of marijuana, many states have now decriminalized the
possession of small quantities of this substance. Marijuana has been
helpful in treating some physical ailments, such as certain forms of
glaucoma (an eye disorder), and in reducing the nausea of patients being
treated with chemotherapy for cancer. Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD)
LSD or "acid" gained notoriety as a hallucinogen in the mid-1960s.

A JOINT FOR WHAT AILS YOU The evidence of marijuana's effectiveness in
treating patients with certain problems---such as glaucoma, AIDS-related
loss of appetite, nausea due to chemotherapy, and multiple
sclerosis---continues to grow. Still, marijuana is not readily available
for medicinal purposes. Until the federal government lifts the ban on
the medical use of marijuana, patients will continue to rely on such
operations as Oakland's Cannabis Buyers Club (shown here), an
underground network that supplies marijuana to the sick. Do you believe
marijuana should be available to patients with these problems?

drug, LSD produces distortions of reality and hallucinations. "Good
trips" are experiences of sharpened visual and auditory perception,
heightened sensation, convictions that one has achieved profound
philosophical insights, and feelings of ecstasy. "Bad trips" include
fear and panic from distortions of sensory experiences, severe
depression, marked confusion and disorientation, and delusions. Some
users report "flashbacks," the recurrence of hallucinations or other
sensations days or weeks after taking LSD. Fatigue, stress, or the use
of another drug may trigger a "flashback." LSD is considered a
psychotomimetic drug because, in some cases, it produces reactions that
mimic those seen in acute psychotic reactions. It does not produce
physical dependence, even in users who have taken the drug hundreds of
times. Aside from its psychological effects, no substantial evidence
supports the belief that LSD is dangerous in and of itself. Large doses
do not cause death, although there are reports of people who have
unwittingly committed suicide while under the influence of LSD.
Initially researchers believed that LSD caused chromosomal damage and
spontaneous abortions, but such events are probably attributable to
impurities in the drug, the use of other drugs, or the unhealthy
lifestyles of many users. Phencyclidine (PCP) Phencyclidine, also known
as PCP, "angel dust," "crystal," "superweed," and "rocket fuel," has
emerged as one of the most dangerous of the so-called street drugs.
Originally developed for its painkilling properties, PCP is a
hallucinatory drug that causes perceptual distortions, euphoria, nausea,
confusion, delusions, and violent psychotic behavior. Reactions to the
drug are influenced by dosage, the individual user, and the
circumstances in which it is taken. One thing is clear: PCP has in many
cases caused aggressive behavior, violence, or death from the taker's
recklessness or delusions of invincibility. The drug is illegal, but it
is still widely used, often sprinkled on marijuana and smoked. Spitzer
and coworkers (1994, pp. 121--122) described the effects of PCP on a
chronic user. As you will see, one long-term effect may have been a
personality change.

Case Study The patient was a twenty-year-old male who was brought to the
hospital, trussed in ropes, by his four brothers. This was his seventh
hospitalization in the past two years, each for similar behavior. One of
his brothers reported that he "came home crazy" late one night, threw a
chair through a window, tore a gas heater off the wall, and ran into the
street. The family called the police, who apprehended him shortly
thereafter as he stood naked, directing trafﬁc at a busy intersection.
He assaulted the arresting ofﬁcers, escaped them, and ran home screaming
threats at his family. There his brothers were able to subdue him. On
admission the patient was observed to be agitated, his mood ﬂuctuating
between anger and fear. His speech was slurred, and he staggered when he
walked. He remained extremely violent and disorganized for the ﬁrst
several days of his hospitalization, then began having longer and longer
lucid intervals, still interspersed with sudden, unpredictable periods
in which he displayed great suspiciousness, a ﬁerce expression, slurred
speech, and clenched ﬁsts. After calming down, the patient denied ever
having been violent or acting in an unusual way ("I'm a peaceable man")
and said he could not remember how he got to the hospital. He admitted
to using alcohol and marijuana socially but denied phencyclidine (PCP)
use except for once, experimentally, three years previously.
Nevertheless, blood and urine tests were positive for phencyclidine, and
his brother believed "he gets dusted every day."

Myth vs Reality Myth: Smoking marijuana or taking one drug does not lead
to the use of more serious drugs. Reality: Although some individuals can
abuse or become dependent on only one drug, others are susceptible to
polysubstance use. This pattern of use seriously increases risks for
mental and physical deterioration. For example, in emergency medical
visits for club drug use, over 70 percent of the cases involved more
than one drug. Alcohol was the most frequent substance associated with
most club drugs, and marijuana was frequently found in combination with
LSD (Clay, 2001).

Etiology of Substance-Use Disorders Why do people abuse substances,
despite the knowledge that alcohol and drugs can have devastating
consequences in their lives? The answer to this question is complicated
by the number of different kinds of substances that are used and the
number of factors that interact to account for the use of any one
substance. In general, progression from initial substance use to abuse
or dependence follows a typical sequence (Walter, 2001). First, for a
variety of reasons, persons may experiment with alcohol or drugs in
order to gain experience, feel high, enhance self-confidence, rebel
against authorities, imitate others, conform to social pressure from
users of drugs, and so forth. Second, because the drug may begin to
serve an important purpose (reduce tension or anxiety; produce feelings
of pleasure; make one feel "grown up," especially for adolescents;
enhance social relations with other users; and so forth), consumption
increases. Third, tolerance may increase, and abuse or dependency
develops. Bodily or brain processes may be altered with repeated drug
use. The individuals crave the substance and may suffer withdrawal
symptoms without it. Fourth, lifestyle changes occur with abuse or
dependence. These changes may include preoccupation with how to get the
substance; loss of interest in previous activities, hobbies, and social
relationships; and planning of activities around opportunities to use
the drug (see Figure 9.3). In the case of illicit drugs, criminal acts
may be necessary to hide the drug habit or to finance and obtain the
drug. Consistent with the multipath model, in all four phases,
biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural factors are
involved (see Figure 9.4). Let's now turn to research involving these
factors.

9.3 TYPICAL PROGRESSION TOWARD DRUG ABUSE OR DEPENDENCE

Biological Dimension Because alcohol and drugs affect metabolic
processes and the central nervous system, investigators have explored
the possibility that heredity or congenital factors increase
susceptibility to addiction. In the case of alcoholism, there is
evidence that it "runs in families" (Piasecki et al., 2005). Persons
with a family history of alcoholism have an increased lifetime risk of
4.5 times or greater of developing alcoholism relative to the general
population (Lovallo et al., 2006). Because family members usually share
both genetic and environmental influences, researchers face the
challenge of somehow separating the contributions of these two sets of
factors. Many investigators have attempted to isolate genetic and
environmental factors through the use of adoption studies and twin
studies. Several studies have indicated that children whose biological
parents were alcoholics but who were adopted and raised by nonrelatives
are more likely to develop drinking problems than are adopted children
whose biological parents were not alcoholics (Franklin & Frances, 1999;
Goodwin, 1979; Kanas, 1988). In one study of alcohol abuse among adopted
individuals, Cadoret and Wesner (1990) found clear-cut evidence of a
genetic factor operating from biological parent to adopted child.
However, they also found evidence of environmental influences: having an
alcoholic in the adoptive home also increases the risk of alcohol
problems in the adopted person. Investigators studying the concordance
rates for alcoholism among MZ (monozygotic or identical) and DZ
(dizygotic or fraternal) twins have reported similar

ddiction may also extend to compulsive behaviors such as kleptomania and
overeating. Drug addictions at the cellular level involve changes to the
synapse structure, cell shape, and the way nerve cells communicate with
each other (Kalivas & Volkow, 2005). People with compulsive behaviors
have brain patterns and changes that are similar to those of people with
drug addictions (Brower, 2006).

FAMILY TIES Drew Barrymore entered rehab at the age of thirteen to deal
with her addiction to drugs and alcohol. Although it is difﬁcult to
separate environmental and genetic inﬂuences in cases of alcohol abuse,
both were likely operating in Drew's case. Not only did she experience
the stress of young stardom, but she also had a family history of
alcohol abuse---her grandfather drank himself to death and her father
abused alcohol and drugs. Does this mean that drug abuse is inherited?

findings. Concordance rates indicate the likelihood that both cotwins
have a disorder. MZ twins generally have a higher concordance rate of
alcoholism than DZ twins. The concordance rate for DZ twins is about the
same rate as in other nontwin sibling pairs (Kendler et al., 1992;
McGue, Pickens, & Svikis, 1992). One study of twins found not only a
strong genetic component in alcohol consumption but also a gender
difference in that males are more likely to be influenced by biological
factors than are females (King et al., 2005). Collectively, findings
suggest that heredity is important in alcoholism, although relatively
little progress has been made in identifying the specific genes involved
(Wall et al., 2005). However, environmental factors are also important,
as illustrated in the twin studies in which MZ twins are not 100 percent
concordant. It is possible that two types of alcoholism may exist:
familial and nonfamilial. Familial alcoholism shows a family history of
alcoholism, suggesting genetic predisposition. This type of alcoholism
develops at an early age (usually by the late twenties), is severe, and
is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism (but not other mental
disorders) among blood relatives (Emmelkamp, 2004). Nonfamilial
alcoholism does not show these characteristics and is presumably
influenced more by environment. Researchers have attempted to find risk
factors or markers for alcoholism. Risk factors are variables related
to, or etiologically significant in, the development of a disorder.
Biological markers involving neurotransmitters in the brain have been
found to be related to alcoholism (Kranzler & Anton, 1994; Tabakoff,
Whelan, & Hoffman, 1990). Another risk factor appears to be sensitivity
or responsiveness to alcohol (Schuckit, 1990). Individuals who are not
sensitive to alcohol may be able to consume large amounts of it before
feeling its effects, and they may therefore be more susceptible to
alcoholism. As mentioned earlier, being a child of an alcoholic and
coming from a family with a history of alcoholism are risk factors.
Noble (1990) compared two groups: high-risk sons of alcoholic fathers
and low-risk sons of social-drinking fathers. The boys in the two groups
were matched for demographic background, and at the start of the study
none had ever consumed alcohol or used drugs. The researchers compared
central nervous system functioning, using behavioral,
neuropsychological, and electrophysiological measures. The central
nervous system functioning of both the high-risk boys and their
alcoholic fathers differed from that of the low-risk boys and their
fathers. Furthermore, the high-risk boys were more likely than low-risk
boys to begin drinking. The researcher also studied family environments
to see whether highrisk boys had disturbed family backgrounds. No
differences in family background and environment were found. Noble
(1990) concluded that hereditary factors may be important in alcoholism.
If children of alcoholics have an increased risk for developing
substance use problems, can biological markers be found that account for
this increased risk? Studies have shown that the A1 allele of the D2
dopamine receptor (DRD2) gene may be a causal mechanism for alcoholism,
as well as for nicotine, cocaine, and opium dependence. In one study of
adolescent boys who were children of alcoholics, substance use was
assessed. Boys with the A1+ allele tried and got intoxicated on alcohol
more often, tried and used more substances overall, developed a tobacco
habit more often, and experienced a marijuana high at an earlier age
than boys with the A1− allele (Conner et al., 2005). How might altered
neurotransmitter transporters or brain functions affect the addiction
process? An integrated model of drug addiction has developed in which
drug addiction causes changes in the brain that in turn alter reward
systems and cognitive functioning. In this view, alcohol and drugs in
vulnerable individuals wreak havoc with brain chemistry and structure
(Brower, 2006). Chronic substance abuse alters the normal dopamine
reward and stress pathways, thus flooding the brain with far more
dopamine than is secreted normally. Feelings of euphoria or pleasure may
ensue. Eventually, the drug crowds out other pleasures and turns into an
allconsuming, compulsive desire. As addiction develops, the chronic
flooding of dopamine eventually results in the depletion and
deregulation of dopamine and other

Etiology of Substance-Use Disorders

neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate and GABA) involved in stress and
reward. Consequently, by the time an addiction is established, the drug
may bring little pleasure and only helps the user to feel temporarily
"normal" (Brower, 2006). In other words, the pleasurable effects of the
substance are dampened, and more and more of the substance is needed
(Nestler & Malenka, 2004). The brain and neurotransmitter changes may
interfere with judgment and decision making. Persons with drug addiction
may be unable to make good decisions in the face of temptations or
urges. This may be particularly true in relapse, which is the resumption
of the drug habit after a period of voluntary abstinence. Using brain
imaging, Paulus, Tapert, and Schuckit (2005) found that it was possible
to accurately predict which methamphetamine addicts in a rehabilitation
program would relapse and which would be abstinent on the basis of brain
activity in certain parts of the brain. Those who relapsed showed
reduced brain activity in those parts of the brain involved in decision
making and analytic processes. Presumably, they were less able to
prevent relapses or to avoid temptations. Is it possible that once
someone is addicted and physiologically dependent on a substance,
continued use is caused by the person trying to avoid the pain of
withdrawal? Many researchers and clinicians formerly believed that
addiction to other substances, such as heroin, could be best explained
by biological factors such as physical dependence and the attempt to
avoid withdrawal symptoms. However, we now know that drug use is a
complex phenomenon and that explanatory models must also incorporate the
role of learning, expectancy, and situational factors. Consider heroin
withdrawal, for example. Some have characterized heroin withdrawal
reactions as no more agonizing than a bad case of the flu (Ausubel,
1961). Heroin addicts who enter a hospital and receive no heroin while
hospitalized will stop having withdrawal symptoms in a week or two. Yet
the vast majority who have lost their bodily need for the drug resume
heroin use after hospitalization. Many researchers believe that
withdrawal symptoms do not motivate relapse and measures of the severity
of withdrawal do not predict who is likely to relapse (Baker et al.,
2006). There appear to be many factors that maintain drug use and drug
dependence. In summary, genetics appears to be important in determining
dopamine and dopamine receptor levels that are involved in the
addiction. However, neurotransmission processes themselves may be
influenced by consumption behavior, and social environment factors are
important in the initiation and practice of drug use. In other words, a
multipath model is needed to explain substance addiction and abuse.

Psychological Dimension Psychological research on alcohol and drug use
has largely focused on tension-reducing properties, pleasurable
feelings, expectancies from substance use, or the possibility that
certain personality types become addicts and abusers. Tension and
Anxiety Reduction Early behavioral explanations for alcohol abuse and
dependence were based on two assumptions: (1) that alcohol temporarily
reduces anxiety and tension and (2) that drinking behavior is learned.
In a classic experiment, researchers induced an "experimental neurosis"
in cats (Masserman, Yum, Nicholson, & Lee, 1944). After the cats were
trained to approach and eat food at a food box, they were given an
aversive stimulus (an air blast to the face or an electric shock)
whenever they approached the food. The cats stopped eating and exhibited
"neurotic" symptoms---anxiety, psychophysiological disturbances, and
peculiar behaviors. When the cats were given alcohol, however, their
symptoms disappeared, and they started to eat. As the effects of the
alcohol wore off, the symptoms began to reappear. The experimenters also
found that these cats now preferred "spiked" milk (milk mixed with
alcohol) to milk alone. Once the stressful shocks were terminated and
the fear responses extinguished, however, the cats no longer preferred
spiked milk. Alcohol apparently reduced the cats' anxieties and was used
as long as the anxieties were present.

controversy

Is Drug Addiction a Disease?

I

n the past, alcohol and drug addicts were seen as weak-willed persons
who should be condemned for their voluntary choice to start and continue
a drug habit. The American Psychological Association, American Medical
Association, and National Association of Social Workers have policies
that assume that addictive processes represent a disease state.
Alcoholics Anonymous views alcohol and drug addiction as a disease and
illness. Consequently, drug addicts should not be viewed as somehow
immoral or weak in character. But what is a disease? The American
Heritage Dictionary (2007) considers disease "a pathological condition
of a part, organ, or system of an organism resulting from various
causes, such as infection, genetic defect, or environmental stress, and
characterized by an identiﬁable group of signs or symptoms."
Wollschlaeger (2007) states that the disease concept includes (1) a
clear biological basis; (2) unique, identiﬁable signs and symptoms; (3)
a predictable course and outcome; and (4) the inability to control the
cause of the disease. He believes that addiction satisﬁes these
criteria. Leshner (2001) has also argued that addictions are a disease.
The essence of addiction is uncontrollable, compulsive drug craving,
seeking, and use, even in the face of negative health and social
consequences. Using drugs repeatedly over time changes brain structure
and function in fundamental and long-lasting ways, and more of the
substance is needed (Nestler & Malenka, 2004). However, drug addiction
seems to defy popular notions of a disease because it involves voluntary
behaviors (i.e., consuming a drug) over which a person has choice.
Furthermore, Wyatt (2001) notes that if changes in brain

structure and function are the evidence for brain disease, then the
following are also brain diseases: reading, riding a bicycle, memorizing
lines in a play, learning not to touch a hot stove, and dribbling a
basketball. They all involve brain changes. For decades, Szasz (2007)
has battled the notion that addiction and mental disorders are illnesses
or diseases. The debate is not trivial. Many of those who favor a
disease concept have opposed controlled intake of substances among
addicts. Under this view, for example, alcoholics should never take a
drink. Consumption even in small amounts will set off the disease
process and drunkenness will occur. The opposing view is that alcoholics
can be trained to moderate their drinking. What seems to be clear is
that reciprocity exists in that behaviors can change brain structures
and processes and that brain processes affect behaviors. Three points
should be considered. First, whether one wants to consider addiction as
a disease depends on one's deﬁnition and the usefulness of that
deﬁnition. Second, the issue of whether addicts are weak-willed or
immoral is more of a moral judgment than a scientiﬁc ﬁnding. Finally,
there is the possibility that addiction may be a heterogeneous condition
in which some experience more of a disease process than others. For
Further Consideration 1. Should addictive behaviors and compulsions that
are voluntary (e.g., drinking alcohol) be considered diseases? 2. If
drug and alcohol addictions are considered diseases, should we consider
compulsive overeating or compulsive gambling diseases?

As illustrated in experimental neurosis, the tension-reducing model
assumes that alcohol reduces tension and anxiety and that the relief of
tension reinforces the drinking response. Although it makes intuitive
sense, the model has produced conflicting findings in alcoholics. In
fact, prolonged drinking is often associated with increased anxiety,
distress, and depression (McNamee, Mello, & Mendelson, 1968; Steffen,
Nathan, & Taylor, 1974). In a study of smokers, contrary to
expectations, smoking after experiencing negative moods did not reduce
the negative affect, although smokers increased their puffing (Conklin &
Perkins, 2005). Other evidence supports the idea that the
tension-reducing model is too simplistic. Steele and Josephs (1988,
1990) found that alcohol can either increase or decrease anxiety,
depending on the way alcohol affects perception and thought. When
confronted with a stressful situation, people who drank alcohol in the
experiment experienced anxiety reduction if they were allowed to engage
in a distracting activity. When faced with a stressor, however, those
who drank and did not have a distracting activity experienced an
increase in anxiety. The investigators argued that the distracting
activity allowed drinkers to divert attention from the stressor. Without
the distraction, drinkers' attention may have focused on the stressor,
which served to magnify their anxiety. The tension-reduction model has
difficulty accounting for the two phases of alcohol effects, in which
blood alcohol levels initially rise and then fall. Giancola

Etiology of Substance-Use Disorders

251

and Zeichner (1997) found that increases in aggression tended to occur
during the ascending phase (when blood alcohol level is increasing)
rather than the descending phase (when blood alcohol level is
decreasing) of blood alcohol levels. That is, despite having similar
blood alcohol levels, individuals exhibited more aggression during the
ascending rather than during the descending phase. The tension-reduction
model has a problem explaining this two-phase effect because the blood
alcohol levels, tensions, and expectations are presumably similar
regardless of the phase. This research raises the possibility that the
concept of tension reduction is too simple to explain the effects of
alcohol. Expectancy and Cognitive Inﬂuences A number of researchers have
focused less on tension reduction and more on the expectancies that are
learned in substance use. Individuals who use drugs may come to expect
feeling relaxed, confident, high, less anxious, and so on. In a study of
marijuana and cocaine use among college students, Schafer and Brown
(1991) showed the importance of expectancies. Their survey of positive
and negative expectancies (for example, relaxation, social facilitation,
and cognitive impairment) for the use of marijuana and cocaine showed
that students who used these drugs also expected strong positive
experiences. Cooper, Russell, and George (1988) found that stress is
related to drinking when individuals expect positive effects from
drinking and have coping styles that avoid dealing with anger. In
contrast, stress and drinking were negatively correlated among those
with little positive expectancy for alcohol and a tendency to actively
deal with their anger. Other investigators (Stacy, Newcomb, & Bentler,
1991) found that expectancy is also predictive of drug use. In a classic
experiment, Marlatt, Demming, and Reid (1973) provided evidence that
learned expectations also affect consumption. In the process, they
challenged the notion that alcoholism is a disease in which drinking
small amounts of alcohol leads, in an alcoholic, to involuntary
consumption to the point of intoxication. In their study, alcoholics and
social drinkers were recruited to participate in what was described as a
"tasting experiment." Alcoholics and social drinkers were led to believe
that they would be given alcohol or tonic in mixed drinks and actually
were given alcohol and tonic regardless of what they were told. What
happens if they think they are receiving (or not receiving) alcohol and
actually are given (or not given) alcohol? Participants who were told
that they would receive alcohol drank more than those who were told that
they would receive tonic, and those who actually consumed alcohol did
not drink more than those who consumed tonic. The participants'
expectancy had a stronger effect than the actual content of their drinks
on how much they consumed. In fact, several people who were given tonic
when they believed they were imbibing alcohol acted as though they were
"tipsy" from the drinks! Expectancy and cognitive factors may also be
important in relapse, in which there is a failure to maintain
abstinence. For persons attempting to abstain from using substances
after addiction, relapse is common. Risk of relapse for alcohol, heroin,
tobacco, and other substances is greatest during the first three months
following treatment, becoming less and less likely over time. By the end
of three years, relapse is unlikely. Factors associated with relapse
include younger age at onset of drug use, more extensive involvement
with substances, antisocial behavior, comorbid psychiatric disorder,
less involvement in school or work, and less support from drug-free
family and peers (Walter, 2001). Earlier we had mentioned that relapse
is associated with certain brain activity. Some researchers have also
found that negative emotional states (such as depression, interpersonal
conflict, and anxiety) are highly associated with relapse (Cooney et
al., 1997). They account for 53 percent of relapses among alcoholics
trying to quit drinking (Hodgins, El-Guebaly, & Armstrong, 1995).
Negative emotional states tended to play a role in major relapse
(substantial use of the substance), whereas social pressure led to minor
relapse (taking just a beer). Negative physical states, urges and
temptations, and positive emotional states did not strongly predict
relapse. Interestingly, there was a gender difference in the states
reported. Women were more

likely than men to cite interpersonal conflict and less likely to report
emotional states such as depression. This suggests that women may be
more vulnerable to social influences than men are in the context of
alcohol use and relapse. A person can obviously stop drinking after one
drink. To explain the full-blown resumption of drinking that so often
follows an alcoholic's first drink, Marlatt (1978; Witkiewitz & Marlatt,
2004) proposed a cognitive interpretation involving the notion of an
abstinence violation effect. That is, once drinking begins, the person
senses a loss of personal control. He or she feels weak-willed and
guilty and gives up trying to abstain. The abstinence violation effect
may also apply to other relapse behaviors, such as overeating,
masturbating, and smoking. In a test of the abstinence violation effect,
Shiffman and his colleagues (1996) asked participants in a
smoking-cessation program to record any instances of relapse (smoking)
and their reactions. The investigators then followed the participants'
progress for three months to assess their subsequent smoking after an
instance of relapse. They found that psychological demoralization after
an initial instance of relapse played a role in progression to another
relapse. Personality Characteristics Is it possible that certain
personality types become addicts? In reviews of research on personality
and alcoholism, Nathan (1988), Franklin and Frances (1999), and Sher and
Trull (1994) have concluded that there is no single alcoholic
personFEELING HIGH Alcohol consumption can result in ality. Nathan found
only two personality characteristics---antisocial feelings of happiness,
loss of inhibitions, and poor judgment. Alcohol depresses the inhibitory
centers of behavior (especially during youth) and
depression---associated with the brain. Sandra Bullock stars in the
movie 28 Days, drinking problems. However, many alcohol abusers do not

antecedent of alcohol abuse (that is, problem drinking may cause people
to feel depressed). Similarly, in the case of other drugs, no
personality types have emerged. Some general personality tendencies,
such as impulsive sensation seeking or behavioral disinhibition (too
little control), have been found to be related to substance-use
disorders (Sher, Bartholow, & Wood, 2000). It is highly unlikely that
addiction is caused by a single personality type.

Social Dimension In almost all explanations of substance use, social or
interpersonal factors are considered important. For example, one may try
drinking and maintain drinking because of pressures from peers, modeling
oneself after parents who drink, pressures from peers to drink,
expecting to feel less anxious in social situations, and so forth. A
review of the literature on adolescent drinking led researchers to
conclude that teenage problem drinkers are exposed first to parents who
are themselves heavy drinkers and then to peers who act as models for
heavy consumption (Braucht, 1982). The parents not only consumed a great
deal of alcohol but also showed inappropriate behaviors, such as
antisocial tendencies and rejection of their children. When such
children loosened their parental ties, they tended to be strongly
influenced by peers who may be heavy drinkers (Bray et al., 2003). In
addition to acting as role models, parents who consume a great deal of
alcohol have been shown to exhibit reduced parental monitoring of the
activities of adolescent children and to produce stress and negative
affect. These, in turn, make the adolescent more likely to associate
with alcohol and drug-using peers and to increase substance usage
(Chassin et al., 1993). There is evidence to indicate that adolescents
who are exposed to peer and adult drinkers tend to develop positive
expectancies over the use of alcohol (for example, believing that
drinking alcohol makes it easier to be part of a group; Cumsille, Sayer,
& Graham, 2000).

Etiology of Substance-Use Disorders

Is Drug Use an Indicator of Disturbance?

M

any individuals believe that drug users are maladapted and have higher
rates of emotional disturbance than non-drug users. Indeed, research
shows that psychological disturbances (for example, depression or other
emotional problems) and drug abuse or dependence co-occur. Among the
24.6 million adults with serious psychological distress, 21.3 percent
were dependent on or abused illicit drugs or alcohol. Only 7.7 percent
of adults without serious psychological distress had substance
dependency or abuse (SAMHSA, 2007). Antisocial personality
characteristics are often associated with drug use. Depression is
associated with cigarette smoking and nicotine dependence (Windle &
Windle, 2001) and other substance use disorders (Sobell & Sobell, 2007).
As many as half of people with severe mental disorders develop alcohol
or other substance abuse problems at some point in their lives (U.S.
Surgeon General, 1999). Does this mean that drug use causes a person to
become antisocial or maladjusted? Or is a person maladjusted and
therefore prone to drug use? When two characteristics--- such as drug
use and antisocial personality patterns---are related, what kinds of
causal inferences can be made? One way of examining these issues is to
conduct a longitudinal study. As mentioned in Chapter 4, longitudinal
research evaluates the behaviors of individuals over a period of time.
If longitudinal research shows that a characteristic or behavior occurs
before drug use, we can be certain that drug use did not cause the
behaviors. For example, Sher, Bartholow, and Wood (2000) evaluated the
personality characteristics of students and then determined their
subsequent degree of substance use. They found that sensation seeking or
behavioral disinhibition predicts substance-use disorders. Because the
sensation-seeking behaviors occurred before substance use, we are
conﬁdent that substance use did not cause sensation seeking. In
practice, however, interpreting cause and effect is not easy.

In another longitudinal study, psychological evaluations (including
personality, adjustment, and parent-child assessments) were made of boys
and girls at different ages, beginning at age three and continuing to
age eighteen. At age eighteen, they were interviewed about the frequency
of drug use. The investigators, Shedler and Block (1990), wanted to see
whether certain psychological characteristics were associated with drug
use---characteristics that were present before drug use and therefore
could not be caused by drug use. The results were quite striking: those
who frequently used marijuana and had tried at least one other drug were
maladjusted, demonstrating alienation, poor control over impulses, and
emotional distress. These psychological characteristics were present
before and during drug use. Do the results also imply that adolescents
who do not use drugs are better adjusted than those who do? In addition
to studying frequent users, the investigators also examined
abstainers---adolescents who had never tried marijuana or other
drugs---and they studied experimenters, those who had used drugs only a
few times. Interestingly, the abstainers were relatively anxious,
emotionally constricted, and lacking in social skills. Those who had
experimented with drugs occasionally were better adjusted than either
the adolescents who used drugs frequently or those who had never used
drugs! Parents of abstainers and frequent users also exhibited greater
personality problems. Given the ﬁnding that those who experiment with
drugs are the best adjusted, should we advocate that adolescents
occasionally try drugs? Such a position would be inconsistent with the
results. Recall from the data that adjustment patterns preceded drug
use, so experimenting with drugs will not necessarily cause one to be
better adjusted. The point is that we often make mistakes in drawing
inferences about cause and effect, and we must be careful not to base
practices or policies on these erroneous inferences.

Studies also indicate that both peer selection and peer socialization
influence druguse patterns. Frequency of alcohol and drug use reported
by African American adolescents was significantly related to both peer
pressure and peer drug use (Farrell & White, 1998). In a study of
adolescents who did not initially smoke, those who had more friends who
smoked were subsequently more likely to smoke (Killen et al., 1997).
Sussman and his colleagues (1994) also found that a good predictor of
subsequent smoking in adolescents was their identification with groups
in which members smoked. However, smoking did not predict subsequent
group identification. Curran, Stice, and Chassin (1997) note that the
association between peer use and self-use of drugs appears to be a
two-way street: a drug user tends to choose friends who are users, and
friends who use drugs tend to influence an individual to take drugs. The
importance of social expectations in substance use was demonstrated in a
study of adolescents over a two-year period (Smith et al., 1995). Their
drinking pattern was best characterized by a positive feedback model:
those who expected social benefits (such as feelings of confidence and
comfort) from drinking drank more.

C H A P T E R 9 • SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS

CULTURAL VARIATIONS IN DRINKING Drinking behavior varies from country to
country and culture to culture. In "wet" cultures, alcohol is integrated
into daily life and is widely available. Most people drink freely during
meals and throughout the day. Italy is considered a wet culture. Here,
we see a celebration festival for wine in Impruneta, Chianti.

They then endorsed even more positive social benefits, which made even
greater consumption more likely. Finally, the presence or absence of
social supports is related to consumption. Hussong and colleagues (2001)
found that young adults with less intimate and supportive friendships,
as compared with their peers, showed risk for greater drinking following
emotional states such as sadness and hostility.

Sociocultural Dimension Drinking varies according to sociocultural
factors, such as gender, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, religion,
and country. As mentioned previously, males and young adults consume
more alcohol than females and older adults, respectively. Interestingly,
consumption tends to increase with socioeconomic status, although
alcoholism is more frequent in the middle socioeconomic classes (SAMHSA,
2007). In terms of religious affiliation, heavier drinking is found
among Catholics than among Protestants or Jews. Furthermore, drinking
behavior varies from country to country. In "wet" cultures, alcohol is
integrated into daily life and activities (for example, is consumed with
meals) and is widely available and accessible. In these cultures,
abstinence rates are low, and wine is the beverage of preference.
Individuals are more likely to drink during meals and freely during the
day. European countries bordering the Mediterranean have traditionally
exemplified wet cultures. In "dry" cultures, alcohol consumption is not
common during everyday activities (for example, it is less frequently a
part of meals), and access to alcohol is more restricted. Abstinence is
more common, but when drinking occurs it is more likely to result in
intoxication; furthermore, wine consumption is less common. The United
States, Canada, and Scandinavian countries are considered dry cultures
(Bloomfield et al., 2003). Asians appear to have a lower rate of
consumption. The low prevalence rates among Asians may be caused by
cultural practices that discourage drunkenness or solitary drinking (Sue
& Nakamura, 1984). Recent research suggests that the prevalence rates
may also be affected by variations of an enzyme---aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH). Alcohol is metabolized in the body and results in acetaldehyde,
which is a toxic substance. An accumulation of acetaldehyde is
associated with dysphoria, face flushing, and palpitations, as well as a
lower risk for alcoholism. Thus Asians who have variations of ALDH may
either metabolize alcohol more quickly or metabolize acetaldehyde more
slowly. In both cases, acetaldehyde accumulates in the body and causes
adverse reactions and lower risk for alcoholism (Eng, Luczak, & Wall,
2007).

Intervention and Treatment of Substance-Use Disorders

255

Ethnic differences in the United States are also found, with a higher
percentage of heavy drinkers among non-Hispanic whites and Native
Americans than among Asians, African Americans, or Hispanics, as shown
in Figure 9.2. These findings suggest that cultural values play an
important role in drinking patterns. The values affect not only the
amount consumed and the occasions on which drinking takes place but also
the given culture's tolerance of alcohol abuse.

Intervention and Treatment of Substance-Use Disorders Treatment of
substance abusers and addicts depends on both the individual user and
the type of drug being used. Most alcohol and drug treatment programs
have two phases: first, the removal of the abusive substance, and
second, long-term maintenance without it. In the first phase, which is
also referred to as detoxification, the user is immediately or
eventually prevented from consuming the substance. The removal of the
substance may trigger withdrawal symptoms that are opposite in effect to
the reactions produced by the drug. For instance, a person who is
physically addicted to a central nervous system depressant such as a
barbiturate will experience drowsiness, decreased respiration, and
reduced anxiety when taking the drug. When the depressant is withdrawn,
the user experiences symptoms that resemble the effects of a
stimulant---agitation, restlessness, increased respiration, and
insomnia. Helping someone successfully cope during withdrawal has been a
concern of many treatment strategies dealing with various drugs,
particularly in treating heroin addicts. Sometimes, addicts are given
medication to alleviate some of the withdrawal symptoms. For example,
tranquilizers may be helpful to alcoholics experiencing withdrawal. In
the second phase, intervention programs attempt to prevent the person
from returning to the substance (in some rare cases, controlling or
limiting the use of the substance). These programs may be community
programs, which include sending alcoholics or addicts to hospitals,
residential treatment facilities, or halfway houses, where support and
guidance are available in a community setting. Family therapy has
consistently been successful in treating adolescent substance abusers
(Sexton, Alexander, & Mease, 2004). Whatever the setting, the treatment
approach may be chemical, cognitive-behavioral, or multimodal. In this
section, we discuss these approaches to the treatment of various
substance-use disorders and review their effectiveness. We also take a
quick look at prevention programs.

Pharmacological Approach To keep addicts from using certain substances,
some treatment programs dispense other chemical substances. Antabuse,
naltrexone, and Campral, each with different effects on alcoholics, have
been tried. Antabuse (disulfiram) has been used for decades. It produces
an aversion to alcohol. A person who consumes alcohol one to two days
after taking Antabuse suffers a severe reaction, including nausea,
vomiting, and discomfort. Antabuse has the effect of blocking the
progressive breakdown of alcohol so that excessive acetaldehyde
accumulates in the body; acetaldehyde causes dysphoria (depression or
distress). Most alcoholics will not consume alcohol after ingesting
Antabuse. Those who do risk not only discomfort but also, in some cases,
death. While clients are taking Antabuse and are not drinking, as
demonstrated in several studies (see Gallant, 2001), psychotherapy and
other forms of treatment may be used to help them develop coping skills
or alternative life patterns. The problem with Antabuse treatment is
that alcoholic patients may stop taking the drug once they leave the
hospital or are no longer being monitored. And some may drink anyway
because they believe the effects of Antabuse have dissipated, because
they have forgotten when they last took it, or because they are tempted
to drink in spite of the Antabuse. Naltrexone has been used to reduce
craving or the reinforcing effects of alcohol. The reduced craving
appears specific to alcohol, not to just any drink (for example, fruit
juices), as found in a study by Rohsenow, Monti, Hutchinson, and
colleagues (2000). Campral (acamprosate) has most recently been approved
by the FDA. It has

been found to be effective in some investigations, although a
comparative study involving naltrexone, psychotherapeutic treatment, and
Campral revealed that all but Campral were quite effective for
alcoholics (Anton et al., 2006). Pharmacological agents such as
clonidine and naltrexone have allowed some heroin addicts to be
detoxified as outpatients (Franklin & Frances, 1999). Chemical treatment
may also be used to reduce the intensity of withdrawal symptoms in
heroin addicts who are trying to break the drug habit. The drug
methadone is prescribed to decrease the intensity of withdrawal
symptoms. Methadone is a synthetic narcotic chemical that reduces the
craving for heroin without producing euphoria (the "high"). It was
originally believed that reformed heroin addicts could then quite easily
discontinue the methadone at a later date. Although methadone initially
seemed to be a simple solution to a major problem, it has an important
drawback: it can itself become addicting. The following case illustrates
this problem, as well as other facets of the typical two-phase treatment
program for heroin addiction.

Case Study After several months of denying the seriousness of his heroin
habit, Gary B. ﬁnally enrolled in a residential treatment program that
featured methadone maintenance, peer support, confrontational therapy,
and job retraining. Although at ﬁrst Gary responded well to the
residential program, he soon began to feel depressed. He was reassured
by the staff that recovering heroin addicts frequently experience
depression and that several treatment options existed. A fairly low dose
of tricyclic antidepressant medication was prescribed, and Gary also
began supportive-expressive (psychodynamic) therapy. Psychotherapy
helped Gary identify the difﬁcult relationships in his life. His
dependence on these relationships and his dependence on drugs were
examined for parallels. His tendency to deny problems and to turn to
drugs as an escape was pointed out. The therapy then focused on the
generation of suitable alternatives to drugs. He worked hard during his
therapy sessions and made commendable progress. For the next three
months Gary enjoyed his life in a way that previously had been foreign
to him. He was hired by a small restaurant to train as a cook. He was
entirely satisﬁed with the direction in which his life was going until
the day he realized that he was eagerly looking forward to his daily
methadone dose. Gary knew of people who had become addicted to
methadone, but it was still a shock when it happened to him. He decided
almost immediately to terminate his methadone maintenance program. The
withdrawal process was physically and mentally painful, and Gary often
doubted his ability to function without methadone. But by joining a
support group composed of others who were trying to discontinue
methadone, he was eventually able to complete methadone withdrawal. Gary
had never imagined that the most difﬁcult part of his heroin treatment
would be giving up methadone.

In smoking cessation programs, one tactic has been the use of nicotine
replacement therapy. Because smokers become addicted to the nicotine in
cigarettes, the aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to provide
an alternate way of ingesting nicotine. This reduces withdrawal symptoms
associated with smoking cessation, thus helping resist the urge to smoke
cigarettes. Nicotine is delivered using a transdermal nicotine patch,
inhaler, nasal spray, gum, sublingual tablet, or lozenge. NRT has been
found to be fairly effective in smoking cessation (Silagy

Intervention and Treatment of Substance-Use Disorders

257

et al., 2003). Evidence that NRT is effective is that people on the
treatment are three to five times less likely to move from a smoking
lapse to a full-blown relapse than people not having NRT (Shiffman et
al., 2006). That is, it helps to prevent further smoking even after one
who wants to quit has succumbed to smoking.

Cognitive and Behavioral Approaches Cognitive and behavioral therapists
have devised several strategies for treating alcoholism and other
substance-use disorders. Aversion therapy, which is based on classical
conditioning principles, has been used for many years. Aversion therapy
is a conditioning procedure in which the response to a stimulus is
decreased by pairing the stimulus with an aversive stimulus. For
example, alcoholics may be given painful electric shocks while drinking
alcohol, or they may be given emetics (agents that induce vomiting)
after smelling or tasting alcohol or when they get the urge to drink.
After several sessions in which the emetic is used, alcoholics may vomit
or feel nauseated when they smell, taste, or think about alcohol.
Another aversive conditioning strategy is to have smokers rapidly puff
and inhale cigarette smoke, which may make them sick. Imagery has been
used as part of covert sensitization, an aversive conditioning technique
in which the individual imagines a noxious stimulus in the presence of a
behavior. Alcoholic patients, for example, are trained to imagine nausea
and vomiting in the presence of alcoholic beverages (Cautela, 1966).
PUFFING SO FAST YOUR STOMACH CHURNS This ﬁfteenCovert sensitization has
also been used with drug addicts. One year-old is undergoing aversive
conditioning in an attempt difficulty with this technique is the
inability of some patients to generalize the treatment---that is, to
pair the learned aversive to help her stop smoking. The technique
involves having the person puff their cigarettes at a very rapid pace,

have had some success with alcoholics (Hester & Miller, 2003). Skills
training has also been used in drug-cessation programs. A wide range of
coping strategies or skills have been found to be helpful in reducing
temptations and aversion therapy conditioning urges in smoking
(O'Connell et al., 2007). These skills may involve techniques for

treatment for cigarette smoking is nicotine fading (Foxx & Brown, for

as going "cold turkey" (abruptly ceasing smoking) or gradually reducing
smoking without any fixed and systematic plan. The scheduledinterval
method also appeared to be superior in decreasing tension and withdrawal
symptoms. The investigators suggest that individuals using this method
could plan and bring to bear coping mechanisms to deal with urges to
smoke. Other Cognitive-Behavioral Treatments Relaxation and systematic
desensitization may be useful in reducing anxiety. Almost any aversive
conditioning procedure may be effective in treating alcoholism if there
is also a focus on enhanced social functioning, resistance to stress,
and reduction of anxiety. Some programs incorporate social learning
techniques. Cox and Klinger (1988) developed a motivational approach in

these goals and develop a satisfying life without alcohol. Motivational
approaches have been used for other substances, such as marijuana, and
their success is enhanced if they are a part of a larger package that
includes other treatment strategies (Carroll & Onken, 2005). Finally,
virtual-reality therapy has been used on addictions such as smoking.
Smokers may wear head-mounted displays, 3-D earphones, or wired gloves
to experience a smoking environment. Smokers in such therapy perceive
other smokers, smells of smoke and coffee, alcoholic drinks, or other
cues that are associated with smoking. Their craving to smoke
dramatically increased during exposure to the virtual-reality experience
(Bordnick et al., 2005). The purpose of the therapy is to understand the
circumstances in which cravings occur, the brain reactions during
craving, and the effects of behavioral training or medication in
reducing cravings even during the virtual experience.
Cognitive-behavioral treatments, based on analyses of why addicts
experience relapse, have also been tried. Niaura and colleagues (1988)
believe that certain cues are strongly associated with substance use
(smoking while having coffee, drinking alcohol at a party, and so
forth). They suggested that addicts be placed in these situations or in
the presence of the cues and prevented from using the substance. In this
way, the consumption response to these cues is extinguished. To prevent
relapse, some treatment programs help addicts restructure their thoughts
about the pleasant effects of drug use (Cooper et al., 1988). Addicts
are taught to substitute negative thoughts for positive ones when
tempted to drink. For example, instead of focusing on the euphoria felt
from taking cocaine, a person might be taught to say, "I feel an urge to
take the substance, but I know that I will feel depressed later on, that
many of my friends want me to stop taking it, and that I may get
arrested." Rohsenow, Monti, Martin, and their colleagues (2000) found
that training cocaine users to cope with temptations and high-risk
situations was beneficial not only in lowering cocaine use but also in
lowering the amount of cocaine used during a relapse.

Self-Help Groups Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a self-help organization
composed of alcoholics who want to stop drinking. Perhaps a million or
more alcoholics worldwide participate in the AA program, which is
completely voluntary. There are no fees, and the only membership
requirement is the desire to stop drinking. AA assumes that once a
person is an alcoholic, he or she is always an alcoholic---an assumption
based on

controversy

Controlled Drinking

A

great deal of debate has been generated by the suggestion that it is
possible for alcoholics to control their intake and learn to become
social drinkers. Proponents of controlled drinking assume that, under
the right conditions, alcoholics can learn to limit their drinking to
appropriate levels. The ﬁnding that alcoholics tend to gulp drinks
rather than sip them (as social or moderate drinkers do), to consume
straight rather than mixed drinks, and to drink many rather than a few
drinks gave investigators clues to behaviors that require modiﬁcation.
Alcoholics were then trained to drink appropriately. In a setting
resembling a bar, they were permitted to order and drink alcohol, but
they were administered an aversive stimulus for each inappropriate
behavior. For example, alcoholics who gulped drinks or ordered too many
were given painful electric shocks. There is evidence that controlled
drinking may work for some alcohol abusers (Emmelkamp, 2004). However,
one problem with this technique is that patients need to receive
periodic retraining or to learn alternative responses to drinking.
Otherwise, they tend to revert to

their old patterns of consumption on leaving the treatment program
(Marlatt, 1983). The major task is to discover the conditions under
which controlled drinking or abstinence interventions work. Opponents of
controlled drinking generally believe that total abstinence should be
the goal of treatment, that controlled drinking cannot be maintained
over a period of time, and that alcoholism is a genetic-physiological
problem. Furthermore, by trying to teach alcoholics that they can resume
and control drinking, proponents are unwittingly contributing to the
alcoholics' problems. There have even been questions about the validity
of the ﬁndings in controlled drinking programs (Pendery, Maltzman, &
West, 1982). For Further Consideration 1. Do you think alcoholics can

the disease model of alcoholism. Members must recognize that they can
never drink again and must concentrate on abstinence, one day at a time.
As a means of helping members abstain, each may be assigned a sponsor
who provides individual support, attention, and help. Group meetings
encourage fellowship, spiritual awareness, and public self-revelations
about past wrongdoings because of alcohol. Some people believe that
membership in AA is one of the most effective treatments for alcoholism.
A few studies with methodological limitations have found an association
between AA attendance and positive treatment outcome (McCrady, 1994),
although the success rate of AA is probably not as high as AA members
claim it is (Brandsma, 1979). Approximately one-half of the alcoholics
who stay in the organization are still abstinent after two years
(Alford, 1980), but many drop out of the program and are not counted as
failures. In one of the most rigorous studies of AA, Morganstern et
al. (1997) investigated the effects of affiliation with AA among
individuals who had undergone treatment for alcoholism. Greater
affiliation with AA did predict better treatment outcomes. However, the
involvement with AA was associated with increased feelings of
self-efficacy, active coping, and motivation to stop drinking, which
were, in turn, predictors of outcome. Finally, in a direct comparison of
the effects of AA compared with mental health treatment, Moos and Moos
(2006) found that people with alcohol-use disorders who were
professionally treated or who participated in AA had better outcomes
during a sixteen-year followup period than those who were untreated.
Given the success of AA, spinoffs of AA, such as Al-Anon and Alateen,
have been established, and they appear to be valuable in providing
support for adults and teenagers living with alcoholics (Kanas, 1988).
There are similar self-help groups for drug abuse (Narcotics Anonymous),
although they have not gained the widespread attention and participation
seen in AA.

Multimodal Treatment In view of the many factors that maintain drug-use
disorders, some treatment programs make systematic use of combinations
of approaches, especially with approaches that have been shown to be
effective (Haaga, McCrady, & Lebow, 2006). For example, alcoholics may
be detoxified through Antabuse treatment and

260

C H A P T E R 9 • SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS

simultaneously receive behavioral training (via aversion therapy,
biofeedback, or stress management), as well as other forms of therapy.
In one outpatient treatment program, alcohol-dependent men were given
standard care (life-skills training, relapse prevention and coping
skills, after-care meetings, and counseling). A group of these men was
randomly assigned to another condition, the contingency management
group. In this group, the men were given the opportunity to win prizes
(ranging from small gift certificates to larger gifts, such as a
television) if they tested negative for alcohol consumption on a
Breathalyzer. Those patients who had the combined treatment involving
contingency management and standard care were more likely to be
abstinent than patients who were exposed solely to standard care (Petry
et al., 2000). Other therapies may include combinations of Alcoholics
Anonymous, educational training, family therapy, group therapy, and
individual psychotherapy. For example, opioid-dependent patients have
been helped by the use of behaviorally oriented family counseling,
individual psychotherapy, and daily ingestion of naltrexone, an opioid
antagonist that blocks the subjective reinforcing properties of
opioid-based drugs (Fals-Stewart & O'Farrell, 2003). Gulliver and his
colleagues (2007) also found that broadspectrum interventions that
include different treatment modalities were more effective than
confining treatment to a single modality. Proponents of multimodal
approaches recognize that no single kind of treatment is likely to be
totally effective and that successful outcomes often require major
changes in the lives of alcoholics. The combination of therapies that
works best for a particular person in his or her particular

encouraged to continue attending the support group, along with his or
her spouse, and to become involved in individual outpatient therapy.
Family therapy is the treatment of choice for adolescent substance users
(Haley, 1980; Reilly, 1984; Rueger & Liberman, 1984), and it is highly
recommended for adults as well. The outpatient program typically
continues for about two years. One multimodal project involved six
hundred youths being treated for marijuana use, the largest experiment
ever conducted on outpatient adolescent treatment (Clay, 2001). The
youths were exposed to a number of different treatments that included
the adolescents, their families, schools, and other systems. Preliminary
results showed dramatic changes in the adolescents' drug use. For
example, the percentage of youths reporting no marijuana abuse or
dependence in the previous month increased from 19 percent before
treatment to 61 percent six months after treatment. Problems with the
criminal justice system, their families, and schools also decreased.

Prevention Programs Prevention programs have been initiated to
discourage drug and alcohol use before it begins or to reduce
consumption among users (Brown et al., 2005). Campaigns to educate the
public about the detrimental consequences of substance use, to
reestablish norms against drug use, and to give coping skills to others
who are tempted by drug use are waged in the media. Other prevention
programs take place in schools, places of worship, youth groups, and
families. Such programs are having some effect. For example, Marlatt and
others (1998) assigned heavy-drinking college students to either a brief
intervention group or a

Intervention and Treatment of Substance-Use Disorders

no-intervention control group for three months of the first year of
college. The intervention consisted of providing students with feedback
on the extent of their drinking and on possible consequences, without
confrontation or direct advice. The investigators conducted one-year and
two-year follow-up assessments of drinking, which indicated that the
intervention was successful. Students receiving the intervention
reported lower alcohol consumption and fewer problems resulting from
drinking, and the self-reports from students were consistent with those
of friends of the students who were also asked to provide ratings of the
students. In another study, Dent and his colleagues (1995) evaluated the
outcome of a junior high school smoking-prevention program. A group of
students received one of four possible training programs: (1) resistance
to social influence (for example, resisting peer pressure to smoke), (2)
information (such as correcting misperceptions of the social image of
smokers), (3) the physical consequences of smoking, or (4) a combination
of the three other approaches. A control group of students was not
involved in the training program. The participants received three
initial training sessions and a booster training session given a year
later. Two years after the initial three sessions, the students exposed
to the training were generally less likely to show increases in smoking
or in trying smoking than were students not exposed to the training. The
investigators warn that longer term success may depend on additional
training in high school or at some other future time. Attitudes toward
drug use can be altered. Cruz and Dunn (2003) exposed fourthgrade
students to one-session alcohol prevention presentations that emphasized
the sedating effects of alcohol, challenged the positive effects of
alcohol, or alerted them to the dangerous consequences of consumption.
Compared with students assigned to a no-prevention group, those who
participated in the alcohol presentations had less favorable attitudes
toward alcohol use. Because of the public's constant exposure to
television, radio, and newspapers, some researchers have used these
media as a means to prevent drug use, as noted earlier. Jason (1998) has
found that media programs to prevent or reduce drug use and to maintain
abstinence have been very successful. Finally, interventions using the
Internet seem quite promising. Munoz and his colleagues (2006) used the
Internet to gain the participation of individuals in a smoking cessation
program. The program, using a Web-based brochure, covered reasons to
stop smoking, how to prepare to quit, what to do in case of relapse, how
to refuse cigarettes from friends and family, and information on
pharmacological aids such as nicotine replacement agents and bupropion.
Additional advice for smoking cessation was individually tailored based
on responses to the baseline questionnaires. In their random controlled
study, the abstinence rates from the program were similar to those found
in traditional interventions (for example, psychotherapy). Even more
striking was the fact that more than four thousand smokers from
seventy-four countries participated. The study raises the possibility
that it may be possible to devise Internet interventions that can affect
the lives of a large number of people in different parts of the world.

Effectiveness of Treatment Research evidence indicates that treatment
programs are effective in reducing substance abuse and dependence,
although outcomes have been small to moderate (Sussman, Sun, & Dent,
2006) and estimates vary from study to study. Currently, approximately
half a million Americans are under treatment for alcoholism (Nitzkin &
Smith, 2004). About one-third of alcoholic clients remain abstinent one
year after treatment. Most opiate-dependent clients and heroin addicts
become readdicted within the first year following treatment. The
majority of treated smokers return to smoking within one year. Again,
relapse occurs most frequently during the first several months of
abstinence, and the type of substance is important to consider. Part of
the problem in delivering effective treatment is that many individuals
with substance-use disorders do not continue treatment (Stark, 1992). In
an analysis of a treatment program for teen smokers, Sussman and
colleagues (2006) found that smokers in programs that required more than
four treatment sessions were more likely to quit than were smokers in
programs with fewer sessions. It should be noted that some individuals
recover on their own, without treatment. Other individuals

261

262

C H A P T E R 9 • SUBSTANCE-RELATED DISORDERS

who relapse after treatment subsequently undergo treatment again and
become abstinent or develop an ability to control their intake. The
research suggests that treatment can be helpful. In a review of the
treatment outcomes for adolescents, Williams and Chang (2000) and
Carroll and Onken (2005) found that treatment for substance abuse was
generally beneficial, especially if the adolescents completed treatment
and if parental and peer support for nonuse was available. Read, Kahler,
and Stevenson (2001) conclude that there is probably no single "best"
treatment for substance use disorders, although a number of different
treatment approaches exist and are helpful. The task is to find the best
combination of treatments for particular individuals with substance use
disorders.

I M P L I C AT I O N S

All human beings consume substances that alter moods, affect performance
and skills, and change body and brain processes. In substance-use
disorders, individuals cannot refrain from using drugs or use them
despite harmful effects. We now know that drugs alter brain processes
and functioning in long-lasting ways. These altered processes include
changing brain reward systems and cognitive functioning in ways that
affect cravings for the substance. In turn, behaviors such as repeated
drug use and finding ways to obtain the substances become dominant. As
can be seen, the behaviors and repeated consumption then affect the
brain further, so that a vicious cycle occurs. Substance use and
dependence are clearly multipath phenomena. Research is continuing to
search for brain changes in substance use. The difficulty is finding
such changes and then determining whether they cause addiction or
whether they are simply byproducts or correlates of addiction.
Interesting research is also needed in discovering possible
commonalities across different addictions (drugs and compulsive
behaviors such as gambling and overeating), the means by which behaviors
can change brain processes, and the efficacy of medication,
psychological and behavioral treatments, and prevention of drug abuse
and dependence.

Summary 1. What are substance-use disorders? ■ People often use chemical
substances that alter moods, levels of consciousness, or behaviors. The
use of such substances is considered a disorder when abuse or dependence
occurs. Substance abuse is defined as a maladaptive pattern of recurrent
use over a twelvemonth period, during which the person is unable to
reduce or cease intake of a harmful substance, despite knowledge that
its use causes social, occupational, psychological, medical, or safety
problems. Substance dependence is a more serious disorder, involving not
only excessive use but also tolerance and withdrawal in many cases. ■
Substances are largely classified on the basis of their effects. Three
major categories have been created: depressants, stimulants, and
hallucinogens. ■ Alcohol, which is widely used, is considered a
depressant. Other depressants include narcotics, barbiturates, and
benzodiazepines. They can cause psychological, physiological, or legal
problems. ■ Stimulants energize the central nervous system, often
inducing elation, grandiosity, hyperactivity,

agitation, and appetite suppression. Amphetamines and cocaine/crack
cocaine, as well as widely used substances such as caffeine and
nicotine, are considered stimulants. ■ Hallucinogens, another category
of psychoactive substances, often produce hallucinations, altered states
of consciousness, perceptual distortions, and sometimes violence.
Included in this category are marijuana, LSD, and PCP. 2. Why do people
develop substance-use disorders? ■ There appears to be no single factor
that can account for drug abuse or for dependence on other substances,
such as depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. Biological/genetic,
psychological, social, and sociocultural factors are all important. ■ In
terms of biological factors, research has demonstrated that heredity is
important in abuse and dependency of some substances such as alcohol.
Chronic drug use seems to alter brain chemistry, and it crowds out other
pleasures, reduces good decisions, and produces a consuming, compulsive
desire for the drug.

Summary ■ Psychological approaches to substance-use disorders

have emphasized learning about drug-use patterns, the tension- and
anxiety-reducing properties of drugs, and expectancies about the effects
of drug use. ■ Social or interpersonal factors are important in the
consumption of substances. Teenagers and adults have been found to use
drugs because of parental models, social pressures from peers, and
increased feelings of comfort and confidence in social relationships. ■
Sociocultural

factors such as gender, ethnicity, and culture are related to alcohol
and drug use. Cultural norms, attitudes, and practices affect the
availability of, access to, and tolerance of substances.

3.  What kinds of interventions and treatments are available for
    substance-use disorders, and does treatment work? ■ A variety of
    treatment approaches have been used, including detoxification, drug
    therapies, psychotherapy, and behavior modification. The treatment

263

prescribed for drug users depends on the type of drug and on the user.
Heroin addicts usually undergo detoxification, followed by methadone
maintenance and forms of treatment such as residential treatment
programs, psychotherapy, cognitive or behavior therapy, and group
therapy. Many alcoholics are helped by treatment, and some achieve
abstinence by themselves. For addiction to cigarette smoking, aversive
procedures such as "rapid smoking," nicotine fading (the use of brands
containing less and less nicotine), and transdermal nicotine patches
have had some success. Prevention programs have also been extensively
used in an attempt to discourage substance use. ■ Treatment for
substance-use disorders has had mixed

success. Multimodal approaches (the use of several treatment techniques)
are probably the most effective. Evidence indicates that relapse is
particularly likely during the first three months after treatment. The
risk of relapse decreases as a function of time.

hristina and Jeremiah had been referred for sex therapy by their primary
care physician after only eight months of marriage. Both were extremely
dissatisﬁed with their lovemaking: (1) Jeremiah complained that
Christina never initiated sex, found excuses to avoid it, and appeared
to fake her orgasms during intercourse, and (2) Christina complained
that Jeremiah's lovemaking was often brief, perfunctory, and without
affection. During the sessions, it became clear that Christina had never
had a strong desire for sex and would seldom become aroused during
intercourse. Although Jeremiah had never had difﬁculty with maintaining
an erection, sex with Christina had become progressively worrisome, as
he often had difﬁculty getting hard enough for penetration. Prior to
initiating sex, Jeremiah drank heavily to give him "courage" to approach
Christina and to alleviate his guilt in "forcing her to have sex." These
encounters were often humiliating, as he felt that Christina only agreed
to sex due to pity and sufferance. In 2007, Yvonne Buschbaum, a German
pole-vaulter who took third place in the European Championships and
sixth in the Sydney Olympics, announced that she was going to undergo
sex-reassignment therapy to become a man. As a young child, she had
always seemed more interested in "boy" activities. Yvonne often believed
she was a boy, played like a boy, and had no interest in girls' games.
On her website she stated: "I feel as if I am a man and have to live my
life in the body of a woman." Yvonne believes that nature played a cruel
hoax on her, that she was a man trapped in a woman's body. On her
website, she announced her decision to "come out" by stating "I am aware
of the fact that transsexuality is a fringe issue, and I do not want to
be responsible for it remaining on the fringe." From early childhood,
Peter F, a forty-one-year-old man, had fantasies of being mistreated,
humiliated, and beaten. He recalls how he would become sexually excited

when envisioning such activities. As he grew older, he experienced
difﬁculty achieving an orgasm unless he was able to experience pain
inﬂicted by his sexual partners. He was obsessed with masochistic sexual
acts, which made it difﬁcult for him to concentrate on other matters. He
had been married and divorced three times because of his proclivity for
demanding that his wives engage in "sex games" that involved having them
hurt him. These games involved being bound spread-eagled on his bed and
tortured by whippings, biting of his upper thighs, the sticking of pins
into his legs, and other forms of torture. During these sessions, he
could ejaculate.

These cases illustrate some of the sexual dysfunctions and disorders we
present in this chapter. We discuss the following categories listed in
DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a): • Sexual
dysfunctions, which involve problems in the normal sexual response cycle
that affect sexual desire, arousal, and response. The case of Christina
and Jeremiah seems to fall into this category. • Gender-identity
disorder, which involves an incongruity or conflict between one's
anatomical sex and one's psychological feeling of being male or female.
Buschbaum had such a conflict. • Paraphilias, which involve sexual urges
and fantasies about situations, objects, or people that are not part of
the usual arousal pattern leading to reciprocal and affectionate sexual
activity. Peter F.'s activities place him in this category. Before we
begin these discussions, however, let's consider another question: How
do we decide what constitutes "normal" sexual functioning?

What Is "Normal" Sexual Behavior? Of all the psychological or
psychiatric disorders discussed in this text, sexual dysfunctions and
disorders present the greatest difficulty for those attempting to
distinguish between "abnormal" (maladaptive) behavior and nonharmful
variations that reflect personal values and tastes markedly different
from social norms (Balon, Segraves, & Clayton, 2007). The definitions of
normal sexual behavior vary widely and are influenced by both moral and
legal judgments. For example, the laws of some states define
oral-genital sex as a "crime against nature." This view is reflected in
a California statute that was repealed as late as 1976: Oral Sex
Perversion---Any person participating in an act of copulating the mouth
of one person with the sexual organ of another is punishable by
incarceration in the state prison for a period not exceeding fifteen
years, or by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year.

CHAPTER 10 • SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS

CULTURAL INFLUENCES AND SEXUALITY Sexuality is inﬂuenced by how it is
viewed in different cultures. Some societies have very rigid social,
cultural, and religious taboos associated with exposure of the human
body, whereas other societies are more open. Note the contrast between
the teens from Muslim and American societies shown here.

exual activities vary widely among people of different ages, marital
status, and nationalities. • People across the world have sex an average
of 97 times a year. • 59 percent claim to have sex at least once a week;
4 percent claim to have sex every day. • 21- to 34-year-olds have sex
the most (113 times/year) compared with 70 for those over 45. •
Unmarried people living together have more sex (113 times/year) than
those married (100) or single (86). • One in 10 people have never had
sex. Source: Durex (2001, 2005).

sexual addiction a popular term referring to a person's desire and need
to engage in constant and frequent sexual behavior (frequently labeled
compulsive sexual behavior) compulsive sexual behavior

a term used by many sex therapists to describe individuals who seem to
crave constant sex at the expense of relationships, work productivity,
and daily activities

It would be difficult today to justify the classification of oral sex as
a "perversion." The pioneering work of Alfred Kinsey and colleagues
revealed that oral sex is widespread, especially among the more highly
educated part of the population (Kinsey, Pomeroy, Martin, & Gebhard,
1953). Surveys (Andersen & Cyranowski, 1995; Mosher, Chandra, & Jones,
2005) have found that among adults 25 to 44 years of age, 97 percent of
men and 88 percent of women have engaged in oral sex with an
opposite-sex partner. The codification of sexual behavior into law is
often based on lack of information regarding normal sexual practices.
For example, in the 1943 Dittrick v. Brown County Minnesota Supreme
Court ruling, the court upheld the conviction of a father of six as a
sexual psychopath because he had an "uncontrollable craving for sexual
intercourse with his wife." This "craving" amounted to three or four
times a week. If he were tried today, Mr. Dittrick could base his
defense on the views of some current researchers who believe that not
having sex often enough indicates a sexual desire disorder.
Classification of normal and abnormal behavior becomes especially
difficult when one compares western and nonwestern cultures or different
time periods within a particular culture (Rathus, Nevid, &
Fichner-Rathus, 2005). For example, the Japanese have significantly less
sexual intercourse than Americans (70 percent less), as is the case in
many Asian countries (Durex, 2005). Should we conclude that Asians are
more prone to sexual desire disorders, or do cultural factors account
for the lower rate? In ancient Greece, homosexuality was not only
accepted but encouraged (Arndt, 1991). In many countries, sex with
animals is fairly common among rural youths but is rare among urban
boys. Thus it is clear that definitions of sexual disorders are also
strongly influenced by cultural norms and values. If legal, moral, and
statistical models fall short of the viable definition of normal sexual
behavior that is needed, can we resolve the controversy by simply
stating that sexual behavior is deviant if it is a threat to society,
causes distress to participants, or impairs social or occupational
functioning? Using this definition, there would be no objection to our
considering rape as deviant behavior; it includes the elements of
nonconsent, force, and victimization. But what about sexual arousal to
an inanimate object (fetishism), or low sexual drive, or gender identity
conflict? These conditions are not threats to society, they may not
cause distress to people who experience them, and they may not result in
impaired social or occupational functioning. They are deviant simply
because they do not fall within "normal arousal and activity patterns."
And they are considered deviant even though what constitutes a normal
sexual pattern is the subject of controversy (Balon et al., 2007;
Gierhart, 2006). In short, ambiguities surround all the classification
systems, and the controversies will

s there such a thing as sexual addiction? Can a person be oversexed and
have a sexual appetite that requires frequent sex in order to be
satisﬁed? Over 4 percent of people claim to have sex every day; 2
percent of married men and 1 percent of married women have intercourse
more than once a day (Durex, 2001, 2005; Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, &
Michaels, 1994). By statistical standards, would these people be
considered abnormal? The term compulsive sexual behavior (CSB) is used
by many sex therapists to describe individuals who seem to crave
constant sex at the expense of relationships, work productivity, and
daily activities. DSM-IV-TR does not recognize the existence of sexual
addiction; otherwise, it might be logically classiﬁed as a sexual desire
disorder. Yet most sex therapists are in agreement that some individuals
seem obsessed with sex, feel compelled to engage in frequent sexual
activity, and ﬁnd their behavior causing them personal distress
(Holloway, 2003; Money, 1996). Even the Masters and Johnson Therapy
Clinic has a residential treatment center for sexual addiction, and
sexual scientists have used such terms as hypersexuality, erotomania,
nymphomania, and satyriasis to refer to this phenomenon. Arguments
against creating a sexual disorder category called "sexual addiction"
come from several directions. 1. In his early work, Carnes (1983)
popularized the concept of CSB as an addiction when he concluded that it
is possible for people to become addicted to sex as they would to
alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. The Masters and Johnson Residential
Center in St. Louis even uses the 12-step recovery model (similar to
that of Alcoholics Anonymous) to treat "sexual addicts." Many
psychologists, however, do not believe that the comparison between
sexual addiction and substance addiction is analogous. For one thing,
drug usage, alcohol intake, and cigarette smoking are not basic
expressions of life, as sex is. They also caution that labeling
"extreme" behaviors, such as "workaholism," is not based on scientiﬁc
criteria and implies a distinct category that cannot be accounted for by
a more appropriate classiﬁcation. For example, although CSB may exist,
it is unclear whether it is an impulse-control disorder or an
obsessive-compulsive disorder. An equally strong case can be made that
it is an obsessive-compulsive disorder that fulﬁlls the criteria of
obsessions and compulsions. The symptoms of CSB---compulsive ﬁxation on
an unattainable partner, compulsive masturbation, compulsive love
relationships, or compulsive sex in a relationship---may

be little different from the intrusive-recurrent sexual thoughts or
frequent hand washing found in OCD (Holloway, 2003). 2. Individuals vary
considerably in the frequency of their sexual activity. Some have sex
several times a day and others a few times a year (Rathus et al., 2005).
Interestingly, a strong sexual libido is often valued by our society
because it connotes potency, power, attractiveness, sensual pleasure,
and health. Indeed, the search for aphrodisiacs in the form of powdered
animal genitals, herbs, secret concoctions, and even drugs such as
Viagra is a multibillion-dollar industry. So there are many in our
society who would value a strong sex drive, especially if they do not
experience personal distress over their behaviors and if it does not
interfere with their ability to function in their many roles in life.
Adolescents are known for being "obsessed" with sex for long periods of
time, and adults in the early stages of a romance can become obsessed
with their partners, seek out their company, and express their sexual
feelings quite often. These thoughts and activities are normal and
healthy developmental processes and must be distinguished from CSB. 3.
The diagnosis of CSB is often fraught with the danger that the clinician
may overpathologize sexual behaviors that are driven by antisexual
attitudes or a conﬂict over values. A clinician who is not comfortable
with the wide range of normal sexual expression (frequency and practice)
must distinguish between his or her own internal standards of normality
and abnormality and the sexual behavior of others. At one time,
homosexuality was considered a sexual disorder; many people continue to
see sadomasochistic practices, oral sex, and even masturbation as
abnormal. Likewise, clients can often diagnose their own sexual thoughts
and feelings as abnormal because they are in conﬂict with their own
restrictive values. Many adolescents, for example, feel guilty about
masturbating. It is their discomfort with their sexual behavior and
internal values, not the possibility of CSB, that should be the focus of
treatment. For Further Consideration 1. Do you believe there is such a
thing as a sexual addiction? How does one determine normal sexual
desires from abnormal sexual desires? 2. How often do you think about
sex? Has it ever become so problematic that you ﬁnd yourself unable to
concentrate on other life duties?

more obvious as we discuss the three groups of sexual disorders and
sexual aggression in the remainder of this chapter.

The Study of Human Sexuality Because sexual behavior is such an
important part of our lives and because so many taboos and myths
surround it, people have great difficulty dealing with the topic in an
open and direct manner (Ohl, 2007). To some extent, Freud made the
discussion of sexual topics more acceptable when he made sex (libido) an
important part of psychoanalytic theory. His knowledge of sexual
practices and behavior, however, was largely confined to his clinical
cases and his speculations from the understanding of social mores. Our
contemporary understanding of human sexual physiology and sexual
practices and customs is based on the works of Alfred Kinsey and his
colleagues (Kinsey, Pomeroy, & Martin, 1948; Kinsey et al., 1953), of
William Masters and Virginia Johnson in their seminal works Human Sexual
Response (1966) and Human Sexual Inadequacy (1970), on the Janus Report
(Janus & Janus, 1993), and on the work of other contemporary sex
researchers. Although the nature of the subject matter and the means
used to obtain the information proved controversial and provocative,
these studies dispelled myths and provided explicit evidence of human
sexual responsiveness, attitudes, and practices.

The Sexual Response Cycle

HELEN SINGER KAPLAN In her book Disorders of Sexual Desire (1979),
renowned sexuality researcher Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan proposed an
alternative to the Masters and Johnson model of human sexual response,
employing a four-stage psychophysical model: (1) desire, (2) excitement,
(3) orgasm, and (4) resolution. By including desire as the ﬁrst stage,
Dr. Kaplan broadened our understanding of the role emotions play in the
sexual experience.

Treating human sexual dysfunction requires an understanding of the
normal sexual response cycle, which consists of four stages: appetitive
(desire), arousal, orgasm, and resolution (see Figure 10.1). Originally,
Masters and Johnson (1966) proposed only three stages; they included the
appetitive stage with the arousal phase. The work of sex therapist Helen
Singer Kaplan (1974) gave us an understanding of how important it is for
a person to desire and to be sexually ready, thus legitimizing the
addition of another distinct (appetitive or desire) stage of sexual
response ("Study Confirms Importance of Sexual Fantasies," 2007). 1. The
appetitive phase is characterized by the person's desire for sexual
activity. The person begins to have thoughts or fantasies surrounding
sex. He or she may begin to feel attracted to another person and to
daydream increasingly about sex.

RESPONSE CYCLE Although we often focus on the differences between men
and women, Masters and Johnson found that the physiological responses of
both to sexual stimulation are quite similar (compare this ﬁgure with
Figure 10.3).

2.  The arousal phase moves out of the appetitive phase when specific
    and direct---but not necessarily physical---sexual stimulation
    occurs. Heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate increase.
    In the male, blood flow increases in the penis, resulting in an
    erection (see Figure 10.2). The ridge around the head of the penis
    turns deep purple, and the testes enlarge and elevate in preparation
    for ejaculation. In the female, the breasts swell, nipples become
    erect, blood engorges the genital region, and the clitoris expands
    (see Figure 10.3). Vaginal lubrication reflexively occurs, and a sex
    flush may appear on the skin (usually later in this phase).
3.  The orgasm phase is characterized by involuntary muscular
    contractions throughout the body and the eventual release of sexual
    tension. In the man, muscles at the base of the penis contract,
    propelling semen through the penis. In the woman, the outer third of
    the vagina contracts rhythmically. Following orgasm, men enter a
    refractory period during which they are unresponsive to sexual
    stimulation for a period of time. However, women are capable of
    multiple orgasms with continued stimulation.
4.  The resolution phase is characterized by relaxation of the body
    after orgasm. Heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration return to
    normal.

10.3 GENITAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH STAGES OF THE HUMAN FEMALE SEXUAL
RESPONSE CYCLE Problems may occur in any of the four phases of the

If problems related to arousal, desire, or orgasm are recurrent and
persistent, they may be diagnosed as dysfunctions.

Sexual Dysfunctions

sexual dysfunction a disruption of any part of the normal sexual
response cycle that affects sexual desire, arousal, and response

A sexual dysfunction is a disruption of any part of the normal sexual
response cycle that affects sexual desire, arousal, and response.
Problems in sexual functioning, such as premature ejaculation, low
sexual desire, and difficulties in achieving orgasm, are quite common in
our society. Epidemiological data suggest that 40 to 45 percent of adult
women and 20 to 30 percent of adult men suffer from at least one sexual
dysfunction (Lewis et al., 2004). Lifetime prevalence of sexual problems
in young adults at some time in their lives is summarized in Table 10.1.
To be diagnosed as a dysfunction, the disruption must be recurrent and
persistent. DSM-IV-TR also requires that such factors as frequency,
chronicity, subjective distress, and effect on other areas of
functioning be considered in the diagnosis. As indicated in Table 10.2,
the DSM-IV-TR categories for sexual dysfunctions are sexual desire
disorders, sexual arousal disorders, orgasmic disorders, and sexual pain
disorders. Prevalence of the sexual dysfunctions is summarized here as
well.

Sexual Desire Disorders Sexual desire disorders are related to the
appetitive phase and are characterized by a lack of sexual desire. There
are two types: hypoactive sexual desire disorder, characterized by
little or no interest in sexual activities, either actual or fantasized,
and sexual aversion disorder, characterized by an avoidance of and
aversion to sexual intercourse. Both of these disorders can be lifelong
or acquired and may be due to psychological factors or a combination of

sexuality. About 20 percent of the adult population (20--35 percent of
women and 15 percent of men) are believed to be suffering from
hypoactive sexual desire disorder (American Psychiatric Association,
1994; LoPiccolo, 1995; Rosen & Leiblum, 1995; Spector & Carey, 1990).
Some clinicians estimate that 40 to 50 percent of all sexual
dysfunctions involve deficits in desire, and it is now the most common
complaint of couples seeking sex therapy (McAnulty & Burnette, 2004;
Spector & Carey, 1990). Although people with sexual desire disorders are
often capable of experiencing orgasm, they claim to have little interest
in, or to derive no pleasure from, sexual activity. In the following
case, relationship problems contributed to the sexual dysfunction:

Case Study A thirty-six-year-old woman and her thirty-eight-year-old
husband were referred by her psychotherapist for sex therapy. The couple
had had little or no sexual contact over the preceding three years, and
the sexual relationship had been troubled and unsatisfactory since the
day they met. Kissing and gentle fondling were enjoyable to both of
them, but as their relationship progressed to genital caressing, the
woman became more anxious, despite her being easily orgasmic. . . . She
explained the difﬁculty as being due to conﬂict in the relationship. She
saw him as angry, controlling, and demanding and very critical of her.
Naturally, she did not feel loving or sexually receptive.
Correspondingly, he felt angry, resentful, and cheated of a "normal sex
life." (Golden, 1988, p. 304)

In this case, the woman was diagnosed as having inhibited sexual desire.
According to DSM-IV-TR, a sexual dysfunction should be diagnosed in such
cases because the interpersonal problem is the primary cause of the
disturbed functioning. Many people question the legitimacy of these
criteria and of the categories themselves, however. They challenge the
idea that sexual problems stemming from a troubled relationship or from
job or academic stress are sufficient to indicate a disorder (Balon et
al., 2007).

There is an even larger issue in diagnosing these problems. As noted
earlier in this chapter, we do not really know what constitutes "normal"
sexual desire, and we know little about what frequency of sexual
fantasies or what activities are "normal." Kinsey and colleagues (1948)
found tremendous variation in reported total sexual outlet, or release.
One man reported that he had ejaculated only once in thirty years;
another claimed to have averaged thirty orgasms per week for thirty
years. However, using some average frequency of sexual activity does not
seem appropriate for categorizing people as having inhibited sexual
desire. One person may have a high sex drive but not engage in sexual
activities; another may not have sexual interest or fantasies but may
engage in frequent sexual behaviors for the sake of his or her partner.

Sexual Dysfunctions

Furthermore, using number of orgasms (intercourse or masturbation) or
desire for orgasms may introduce gender bias into the definition of
"normal" sexual desire. The Janus Report indicated that, for all age
groups, men masturbate and experience orgasms more than women do (Janus
& Janus, 1993). Does this mean that women's sexual desire is less than
that of men? Until we can decide on a normal range of sexual desire, we
can hardly discover the causes of sexual desire disorders or develop
treatment programs for them.

Sexual Arousal Disorders Sexual arousal disorders are problems that
occur during the excitement phase and that relate to difficulties with
feelings of sexual pleasure or with the physiological changes associated
with sexual excitement. Male Erectile Disorder In men, inhibited sexual
excitement takes the form of male erectile disorder (ED), an inability
to attain or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse
and/or psychological arousal during sexual activity. The man may feel
fully aroused, but he cannot finish the sex act. In the past, such a
dysfunction has been attributed primarily to psychological causes ("it's
all in the head"). Masters and Johnson (1970), for example, estimated
that only about 5 percent of erectile dysfunctions were due to physical
conditions. However, studies indicate that from 30 percent to as many as
70 percent of erectile dysfunctions are caused by some form of vascular
insufficiency, such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, or traumatic groin
injury, or by other physiological factors (Hooper, 1998; Lewis et al.,
2004). A primary reason that DSM-IV-TR includes general medical
conditions as a factor in sexual dysfunctions is that a man may also
have a minor organic impairment that makes him more vulnerable to
experiencing ED because of other psychological, social, or sexual
stressors. Distinguishing between erectile dysfunctions that are
primarily biological and those that are primarily psychological has been
difficult (see Table 10.3). For example, one procedure involves
recording nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT). During sleep, men have
frequent erections. If, however, they suffer from an organic problem,

CHAPTER 10 • SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS

they are not able to have erections during the waking state.
Psychological distress is minimized during sleep and should not impair
erections. Thus men who do not display adequate spontaneous erections
during sleep suffer from an organic impairment, and psychological causes
are thought to predominate in men who have such erections.
Unfortunately, considerable overlap in NPT scores has been found between
samples of diabetic men with erectile difficulties and normally
functioning men in control groups (LoPiccolo & Stock, 1986). Therefore,
some people diagnosed with organic impotence may actually have a
psychologically based impotence. The reverse could also be true. Primary
erectile dysfunction is the diagnosis for a man who has never been able
to engage successfully in sexual intercourse. This difficulty often has
a clear psychological origin, because many men with this dysfunction can
get an erection and reach orgasm during masturbation and can show
erection during the REM (rapid eye movement) phase of sleep. In
secondary erectile dysfunction, the man has had at least one successful
instance of sexual intercourse but is currently unable to achieve an
erection and penetration in 25 percent or more of his sexual attempts
(Masters & Johnson, 1970).

Case Study A twenty-year-old college student was suffering from
secondary erectile dysfunction. His ﬁrst episode of erectile difﬁculty
occurred when he attempted sexual intercourse after drinking heavily.
Although to a certain extent he attributed the failure to alcohol, he
also began to have doubts about his sexual ability. During a subsequent
sexual encounter, his anxiety and worry increased. When he failed in
this next coital encounter, even though he had not been drinking, his
anxiety level rose even more. The client sought therapy after the
discovery that he was unable to have an erection even during petting.

The prevalence rate of ED is difficult to determine because it is often
unreported. Clinicians estimate that approximately 50 percent of men
have experienced transient impotence (Feldman, Goldstein, Hatzichristou,
Krane, & McKinlay, 1994). Of 448 men with sexual dysfunctions treated at
the Masters and Johnson sex clinic, 32 were suffering from primary ED
and 213 from secondary ED. Prior to the introduction of drugs such as
Cialis, Levitra, and Viagra, the generally accepted figure of ED among
men was between 10 million and 15 million (Leary, 1992). Current
estimates of erectile problems place the figure at approximately 30
million (Hooper, 1998). Several factors may be contributing to this
increase in the number of reported cases: (1) an increasing acceptance
that the dysfunction may be caused by some physical condition and not by
feelings of "psychological inadequacy"; (2) the availability of drugs
such as Viagra as a nonintrusive successful treatment; (3) an increasing
willingness among men to talk about this problem; and (4) a greater
acceptance of women's right to expect satisfaction in sexual
relationships.

female sexual arousal disorder

the inability to attain or maintain physiological response and/or
psychological arousal during sexual activity

Female Sexual Arousal Disorder Female sexual arousal disorder is an
inability to attain or maintain physiological response and/or
psychological arousal during sexual activity. It is characterized by a
lack of physical signs of excitement, such as vaginal lubrication or
erection of the nipples, or complaints of a lack of pleasure during
sexual interactions (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). As with
other sexual dysfunctions, this disorder may be lifelong or acquired and
is often the result of negative attitudes about sex or early sexual
experiences. Receiving negative information about sex, having been
sexually assaulted or molested, and having conflicts with a sexual
partner can contribute to the disorder (Perlman et al., 2007). Estimates
of this disorder vary widely, from 10 to 50 percent of the female
population; accurate numbers are difficult to obtain because it is
extremely difficult to distinguish this condition from other sexual
disorders (Laumann et al., 1994; LoPiccolo, 1997). Indeed, female sexual
arousal disorder is rarely diagnosed alone and usually is accompanied by
or submerged with other desire or orgasmic disorders.

Sexual Dysfunctions

275

Orgasmic Disorders An orgasmic disorder is an inability to achieve an
orgasm after entering the excitement phase and receiving adequate sexual
stimulation. Female Orgasmic Disorder A woman with female orgasmic
disorder, or inhibited female orgasm, experiences persistent delay or
inability to achieve an orgasm with stimulation that is "adequate in
focus, intensity, and duration" after entering the excitement phase.
Whether the lack of orgasm is categorized as a dysfunction or as a
"normal variant" is left to the judgment of the clinician. Again, the
criteria that define adequate functioning during sexual intercourse are
quite controversial. Inhibited female orgasm may be termed primary, to
indicate that orgasm has never been experienced, or secondary, to show
that orgasm has been experienced. Primary orgasmic dysfunction is
considered relatively common in women: approximately 10 percent of all
women have never achieved an orgasm (Rosen & Lieblum, 1995; Spector &
Carey, 1990). This disorder is not equivalent to primary orgasmic
dysfunction in males, who often can achieve orgasm through masturbation
or by some other means. Male Orgasmic Disorder Male orgasmic disorder,
or inhibited male orgasm, is the persistent delay or inability to
achieve an orgasm after the excitement phase has been reached and sexual
activity has been adequate in focus, intensity, and duration. The term
is usually restricted to the inability to ejaculate within the vagina,
even with full arousal and penile erection. As noted, men who have this
dysfunction can usually ejaculate when masturbating. Inhibited orgasm in
males is relatively rare, and little is known about it (McAnulty &
Burnette, 2004). Treatment is often urged by the wife, who may want to
conceive or who may feel (because of the husband's lack of orgasm) that
she is unattractive. An examination of the backgrounds of men with this
disorder may reveal either the occurrence of some traumatic event or a
severely restrictive religious background in which sex is considered
evil. Masters and Johnson (1970) gave an example of a man who discovered
that his wife had engaged in sexual intercourse with another man.
Although they remained married, he could no longer ejaculate during
intercourse. Premature Ejaculation The inability to satisfy a sexual
partner is a source of anguish for many men. Premature ejaculation is
ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, during, or shortly
after penetration. It is believed to be the most common type of male
sexual dysfunction, affecting 21 to 33 percent of men (Walling, 2007).
Sex researchers and therapists, however, differ in their criteria for
prematurity. Kaplan (1974) defined prematurity as the inability of a man
to tolerate high (plateau) levels of sexual excitement without
ejaculating reflexively. Kilmann and Auerbach (1979) suggested that
ejaculation less than five minutes after coital entry is a suitable
criterion of prematurity. Masters and Johnson (1970) contended that a
man who is unable to delay ejaculation long enough during sexual
intercourse to produce an orgasm in the woman 50 percent of the time is
a premature ejaculator. The difficulty with the latter definition is the
possibility that a man may be "premature" with one partner but entirely
adequate for another. From the perspective of males, approximately one
in three men admit to occasional premature ejaculation problems (Spector
& Carey, 1990).

Sexual Pain Disorders Sexual pain disorders can be manifested in both
males and females in a condition termed dyspareunia, which is a
recurrent or persistent pain in the genitals before, during, or after
sexual intercourse. Table 10.4 identifies possible biological or medical
reasons for both men and women. It is estimated that the lifetime
prevalence rate is 17 to 19 percent (Paik & Laumann, 2006). Dyspareunia
is not caused exclusively by lack of lubrication or by vaginismus, which
is an involuntary spasm of the outer third of the vaginal wall,
preventing or interfering with sexual intercourse. The incidence

of vaginismus is not known, but it is considered very rare. Several
causal factors have been identified in vaginismus. Masters and Johnson
(1970) found one or more of the following conditions among many women
with this dysfunction: (1) a husband or partner who was impotent; (2)
rigid religious beliefs about sex; (3) prior sexual trauma, such as rape
or childhood molestation; (4) prior homosexual identification; and (5)
painful intercourse. DSM-IV-TR also recognizes the diagnoses of sexual
dysfunction due to a general medical condition and substance-induced
sexual dysfunction. For example, a man may suffer from an erectile
disorder caused by a general medical condition, such as diabetes, as
noted earlier, or by a substance-induced condition, such as alcohol
abuse.

Etiology of Sexual Dysfunctions There is perhaps no other group of
mental disorders in which the interaction of biological, psychological,
social, and sociocultural dimensions are as clearly demonstrated as in
the etiology of sexual dysfunctions. Nor are there disorders that so
directly illustrate how these dimensions can interact with one another
to create sexual problems (Heiman, 2002; Ohl, 2007). Let's return to the
case of Jeremiah and Christina in our chapter opener to illustrate how
various etiological factors can contribute to sexual dysfunctions. (You
may wish to reread the case in order to follow our multipath analysis.)
Recall that both came for sex therapy because Christina did not seem to
desire nor enjoy sex and Jeremiah was experiencing erection difficulties
during their lovemaking. Christina was diagnosed as suffering from a
hypoactive sexual desire disorder

Etiology of Sexual Dysfunctions

FIGURE MULTIPATH MODEL FOR SEXUAL DYSFUNCTIONS The dimensions interact

and Jeremiah from a male erectile disorder. The possibility that
Christina could also be suffering from an arousal or orgasmic disorder
was entertained but eliminated as therapy progressed. It appeared that
she was quite capable of being aroused and orgasmic under the right
conditions. Studies suggest that sexual desire is due to a combination
of biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural factors
(Heard-Davison, Heiman, & Briggs, 2004). On the biological level,
hormones such as prolactin, testosterone, and estrogen affect high or
low levels of sexual desire (Hyde, 2005). On a psychological level,
negative childhood experiences such as sexual abuse, strict moralistic
upbringing, and positive or negative attitudes toward sex affect fantasy
and desire ("Study Confirms Importance of Sexual Fantasies," 2007).
Likewise, social and sociocultural factors such as a dysfunctional
partner or marital relationships that are full of anger or resentment
and gender scripts ("good girls do not initiate sex" or "they enjoy it
as much as men") can affect desire. A similar analysis can be applied to
Jeremiah and his problems with maintaining an erection during
intercourse. His past sexual history revealed no significant erectile
problems until his marriage to Christina. Although his increasing ED
seems more related to psychological causes, his heavy drinking affects
his biological sexual response cycle. Although consumption of alcohol
might decrease inhibition (and thereby increase his courage), it is a
central nervous system suppressant that makes it more difficult for any
man to achieve an erection. For Jeremiah, it is clear that he is also
suffering from guilt, humiliation, and anger toward Christina, whom he
may blame for his problem. As a man, he may also operate from a cultural
script---a social and cultural belief and expectation that guides our
behaviors regarding sex---that equates masculinity with sexual potency.
Given these facts, the following multipath explanation of the couple's
sexual difficulties might be operative (see also Figure 10.4).

Case Study Jeremiah and Christina's sexual disorders are intertwined in
their relationship (social) and cannot be viewed in isolation
(interactive). Christina's low sexual desire (biological) makes Jeremiah
doubt his own sexual attractiveness (psychological) and increases his
anxiety levels so that it affects his ability to achieve an erection. He
drinks heavily to reduce his anxiety and to decrease his inhibitions
about initiating sex. Alcohol and his anxiety affect his ability to
achieve and maintain

278

CHAPTER 10 • SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS

an erection (biological). When he does achieve an erection, he quickly
enters Christina for fear of losing it (psychological), and in turn
becomes "brief and perfunctory in lovemaking." The brevity of the sexual
encounter does not allow Christina to become sexually aroused, to become
sufﬁciently lubricated (biological; intercourse becomes painful), or to
achieve an orgasm, so she "fakes it" in order to please him. Jeremiah,
however, knows it is faked and not only blames himself for the failure
(psychological) but feels humiliated by her "pity." He may begin to
equate his inability to satisfy Christina with "not being a real man"
(sociocultural). Both ﬁnd the encounter unpleasant (social). The cycle
then repeats itself.

Biological Dimension As has been indicated, lower levels of testosterone
or higher levels of estrogens such as prolactin (or both) have been
associated with lower sexual interest in both men and women and with
erectile difficulties in men (Hyde, 2005; Kresin, 1993). Drugs that
suppress testosterone levels appear to decrease sexual desire in men
(Schiavi & Segraves, 1995). Conversely, the administration of androgens
is associated with reports of increased sexual desire in both men and
women. However, the relationship between hormones and sexual behavior is
complex and difficult to understand. Many people with sexual
dysfunctions have normal testosterone levels (Hyde, 2005). Medications
given to treat ulcers, glaucoma, allergies, and convulsions have also
been found to affect the sex drive. Drugs such as hypertensive
medication and alcohol are also associated with sexual dysfunctions, as
are illnesses and other physical conditions (McAnulty & Burnette, 2003,
2004). Indeed, some believe that alcohol abuse is the leading cause of
erectile disorders, as well as of premature ejaculation (Arackal &
Benegal, 2007). But again, not everyone who takes hypertensive drugs,
consumes alcohol, or is ill has a sexual dysfunction. In some people
these factors may combine with a predisposing personal history or
current stress to produce problems in sexual function. A complete
physical workup---including a medical history, physical exam, and
laboratory evaluation---is a necessary first step in assessment before
treatment decisions are made. For some, a lack of sexual desire may be
physiological (Paik & Laumann, 2006). In one early study (Wincze, Hoon,
& Hoon, 1978), a group of women who reported no feelings of anxiety
about or aversion to sexual intercourse showed significantly lower
sexual arousal during exposure to erotic stimuli than did sexually
active women and no increase in responsiveness after participation in
therapy. The researchers concluded that the absence of sexual arousal in
these women was biological and that the appropriate treatment for this
condition was unknown. Hypersensitivity to physical stimulation may also
affect sexual functioning. Men who ejaculate prematurely may have
difficulty determining when ejaculation is inevitable once the
sympathetic nervous system is triggered. The amount of blood flowing
into the genital area is also associated with orgasmic potential in
women and erectile functioning in men. In women, masturbation training
and Kegel exercises (tightening muscles in the vagina) may increase
vascularization of the labia, clitoris, and vagina. In men, vascular
surgery to increase blood flow to the penis is successful when used
appropriately. Unfortunately, if the problem is due to arteriosclerosis,
which affects a number of the small blood vessels, vascular surgery
meets with little success (Hooper, 1998).

Psychological Dimension Sexual dysfunctions may be due to psychological
factors alone or to a combination of psychological and biological
factors. They may be mild and transient or lifelong and chronic. Studies
indicate that neurological, vascular, and hormonal factors are important
in many cases of sexual dysfunctions, and they may also render sexual
functioning more susceptible to psychological or social stresses.
Psychological causes for sexual dysfunctions may include predisposing or
historical factors, as well as more current problems and concerns.
Guilt, anger, or resentment toward a partner, fear of pregnancy, fear of
catching a sexually transmitted disease, and anxiety can all interfere
with sexual performance (Westheimer & Lopater, 2005).

Etiology of Sexual Dysfunctions

Traditional psychoanalysts have stressed the role of unconscious
conflicts in sexual dysfunctions. For example, erectile difficulties and
premature ejaculation represent a man's hostility to women due to
unresolved early developmental conflicts involving his parents.
Likewise, a woman's lack of desire or arousal may also represent
repressed hostility toward her partner or an attempt to punish him.
Cognitive theorists stress the interaction of performance anxiety and
the spectator role in the etiology of sexual dysfunctions. For example,
a man may experience a rare erection problem and begin to worry that it
will happen again. Instead of enjoying the next sexual encounter and
becoming aroused, he monitors or observes his own reactions ("Am I
getting an erection?") and becomes a spectator who is anxious and
detached from the situation. The result is potential failure and greater
anxiety for future sexual encounters. Men with psychological erectile
dysfunction often report anxiety over sexual overtures, including a fear
of failing sexually, a fear of being seen as sexually inferior, and
anxiety over the size of their genitals. One early study found that
patients with ED reported marked increases in subjective anxiety and
displayed somatic symptoms, such as sweating, trembling, muscle tension,
and heart palpitations, when asked to imagine engaging in sexual
intercourse (Cooper, 1969). In a sample of 275 college men, sexual
pressure from a partner was associated with sexual dysfunction (Spencer
& Zeiss, 1987). The men most affected were those who identified most
heavily with the traditional masculine role. Situational or coital
anxiety can also interrupt sexual functioning in women. Factors
associated with orgasmic dysfunction in women include having a sexually
inexperienced or dysfunctional partner; a crippling fear of performance
failure, of never being able to attain orgasm, of pregnancy, or of
venereal disease; an inability to accept the partner, either emotionally
or physically; and misinformation or ignorance about sexuality or sexual
techniques.

Social Dimension Social upbringing and current relationships have been
identified as important in sexual functioning. It seems plausible that
the attitudes parents display toward sex and affection and toward each
other can influence their children's attitudes. For example, women with
sexual desire disorders rated their parents' attitudes toward sex more
negatively than did women without sexual desire disorders (Stuart,
Hammond, & Pett, 1987). Being raised in a strict religious environment
is also associated with sexual dysfunctions in both men and women
(Masters & Johnson, 1970). Traumatic sexual experiences involving
incestuous molestations during childhood or adolescence or rape are also
factors to consider (Burgess & Holmstrom, 1979; LoPiccolo & Stock,
1986). As we saw in the case study of Jeremiah and Christina, current
marital or relationship problems may interfere with sexual function. A
relationship problem is often a contributing factor, even in the
apparent absence of predisposing factors. In a study of fifty-nine women
with sexual desire disorders, only eleven had had the problem before
marriage; the other forty-eight had developed it gradually after being
married. The women voiced dissatisfaction about their relationships with
their husbands, complaining that their spouses did not listen to them.
Marital dissatisfaction may have caused them to lose their attraction
toward their husbands (Leiblum & Rosen, 1991).

Sociocultural Dimensions From our earlier discussion, it is clear that
sexual behavior and functioning are influenced by gender, age, cultural
scripts, educational level, and country of origin. Although the human
sexual response cycle is similar for women and men, gender differences
are clearly present: women (1) are capable of multiple orgasms, (2)
entertain different sexual fantasies than men, (3) have a broader
arousal pattern to sexual stimuli, (4) are more attuned to relationships
in the sexual encounter, and (5) take longer than men to become aroused
(Safarinejad, 2006; "Study Suggests Difference Between Female and Male
Sexuality," 2003; "Study Confirms Importance of Sexual Fantasies,"
2007). Likewise, sexual dysfunctions differ because of biological

CHAPTER 10 • SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS

differences and gender role expectations: women are more likely than men
to suffer from sexual desire disorders, and they differ as to the
manifestation of an arousal disorder (erectile disorder for men
vs. lubrication problems for women). In our society, men are taught to
be the sexual aggressors, whereas women are taught not to initiate sex
directly but in a more subtle and indirect manner. Earlier, we mentioned
how cultural scripts, the social and cultural beliefs and expectations
that guide our behaviors regarding sex, can have a major impact on
sexual functioning (Gagnon, 1990). This perspective states that most of
us are socialized into both domestic and international cultural scripts
that vary from being quite explicit to being implicit. Some domestic
scripts for men in the United States may be "sexual potency in men is a
sign of masculinity," implying that "impotence" is a sign of not being a
"real man"; "the bigger the sex organ, the better"; and "strong and
virile men do not show feelings." For women, scripts include "nice women
don't initiate sex"; "nice women are restrained and proper in
lovemaking"; and "it is the woman's responsibility to take care of
contraception." Likewise, nations also vary in the cultural scripts they
communicate to their citizens. For example, people in Asian countries
consistently report the lowest frequency of sexual intercourse. It would
be a serious mistake to believe that an entire nation can suffer from a
sexual desire disorder. Rather, some suggest that these countries are
more conservative, restrained, and restrictive in their attitudes toward
sex (Sue & Sue, 2008a). In conclusion, it is clear that sexual
functioning (and dysfunction) may be strongly influenced by
sociocultural forces.

Treatment of Sexual Dysfunctions Many approaches have been used to treat
sexual dysfunctions, including biological interventions and
psychological treatment approaches.

Biological Interventions Biological interventions may include hormone
replacement and special medications or mechanical means to improve
sexual functioning. For example, men with organic erectile dysfunction
may be treated with vacuum pumps, suppositories, or penile implants. The
penile prosthesis is an inflatable or semirigid device that, once
inflated, produces an erection sufficient for intercourse and
ejaculation (see Table 10.5). It has been found that approximately 89
percent of men and 70 percent of their partners expressed satisfaction
with penile implants (Center for Male Reproductive Medicine and
Microsurgery, 2005) and that 90 percent would choose the treatment again
(Steege, Stout, & Carson, 1986). As indicated in the following case,
however, some men report dissatisfaction with the procedure and minimal
improvement in their desire for sex.

Case Study Mr. F was a ﬁfty-four-year-old recovered alcoholic who had
received a surgical implant following a diagnosis of organic impotence.
Despite the patient's newfound ability to perform intercourse at will,
in the two years following surgery he made infrequent use of the
prosthesis. His wife became increasingly distressed by his
disinclination to either initiate or respond with any enthusiasm to her
overtures for sexual contact. In reviewing the history, it became
apparent that Mr. F 's loss of sexual desire had preceded the erectile
failure and that the absence of desire appeared to be the primary
problem for treatment. Unfortunately, both the urologist and the
patient's wife had assumed that once the capacity for intercourse was
restored, sexual interest would reemerge unassisted. (Rosen & Leiblum,
1987, p. 153)

Another form of medical treatment for ED is the injection of substances
into the penis (Mohr & Beutler, 1990). Within a very short time the man
will obtain a very stiff erection, which may last from one to four
hours. Although men and their mates have reported general satisfaction
with the method, it does have some side effects. There is often bruising
of the penis and the development of nodules. Some men find the prolonged
erection disturbing in the absence of sexual stimulation.

TREATING ERECTILE DISORDERS: MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS TREATMENT

PRIMARY AGENT

EFFECTS

DRAWBACKS

Oral medication

Viagra (sildenaﬁl)

Taken as a pill. Some 70 to 80% of users achieve erections normal for
their ages. Viagra enhances blood ﬂow and retention by blocking an
enzyme found primarily in the penis. The drug must be taken an hour
before sex, and stimulation is needed for an erection.

Possible headaches and diarrhea. A drop in blood pressure. Temporary
bluegreen-tinted vision.

Surgery

Vascular surgery

Corrects venous leak from a groin injury by repairing arteries to boost
blood supply in the penis. Restores the ability to have a normal
erection.

Minimal problems when used appropriately with diagnosed condition.

Suppository

Muse (alprotadil)

A tiny pellet is inserted into the penis by means of an applicator 5 to
10 minutes before sex. Erections can last an hour. Some 65% of users
show some tumescence.

Penile aching, minor urethral bleeding or spotting, dizziness, and
legvein swelling.

Injection therapy

Vasodilating drugs, including Caverject (alprotadil), Edex
(alprostadil), and Invicorp (VIP and phentolamine)

Drug is injected directly into the base of the penis 10 minutes to 2
hours before sex, depending on the drug. The drug helps relax
smooth-muscle tissues and creates an erection in up to 90% of patients.
Erection lasts about an hour.

Pain, bleeding, and scar tissue formation. Erections may not readily
subside.

Devices

Vacuum pump

Creates negative air pressure around the penis to induce the ﬂow of
blood, which is then trapped by an elastic band encircling the shaft.
Pump is used just before sex. Erection lasts until band is removed.

Some difﬁculty in ejaculation. Penis can become cool and appear
constricted in color. Apparatus can be clumsy to use.

Penile implants

Considered a court of last resort. A penile prosthesis is implanted in
the penis, enabling men to literally "pump themselves up" by pulling
blood into it.

Destruction of spongy tissue inside the penis.

CHAPTER 10 • SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS

Oral medications such as Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis have been found to
be an attractive alternative in minimizing the negative effects of
injection therapy. Viagra made headlines in 1998 as a "miracle cure" for
the 30 million men suffering from erectile dysfunctions (Tuller, 2004).
The early clinical trials on 4,500 men indicated between 50 and 80
percent effectiveness; users' testimony of its "instantaneous success"
has added to the hype (Hooper, 1998; Leland, 1997). There have even been
reports that, by increasing blood flow to the genital areas, the pill
can increase sexual desire in women. Recently, Pfizer reported that
Viagra has not proven effective for women. Unlike injectables, Viagra
and its competitors do not produce an automatic erection in the absence
of sexual stimuli. If a man becomes aroused, the drugs enable the body
to follow through the sexual response cycle to completion. Urologists
claim that for individuals with no sexual dysfunction, taking Viagra,
for example, will not improve their erections; in other words, Viagra
will not provide physiological help that will enable normally
functioning men to improve their sexual functioning, nor will it lead to
a stiffer erection. These drugs may aid sexual arousal and performance
by stimulating men's expectations and fantasies; this psychological
boost may then lead to subjective feelings of enhanced pleasure.

Psychological Treatment Approaches In addition to biological forms of
treatment, most general psychological treatment approaches include the
following components: PENILE IMPLANTS In this picture, a physician •
Education The therapist replaces sexual myths and misconceptions with

sexual anatomy and functioning. work. Because of its intrusive nature,
implants • Anxiety reduction The therapist uses procedures such as
desensitization or are usually considered a last resort. graded
approaches to keep anxiety at a minimum. The therapist explains that
constantly "observing and evaluating" one's performance can interfere
with sexual functioning. • Structured behavioral exercises The therapist
gives a series of graded tasks that gradually increase the amount of
sexual interaction between the partners. Each partner takes turns
touching and being touched over different parts of the body except for
the genital regions. Later the partners fondle the body and genital
regions without making demands for sexual arousal or orgasm. Successful
sexual intercourse and orgasm is the final stage of the structured
exercises. • Communication training The therapist teaches the partners
appropriate ways of communicating their sexual wishes to each other and
also teaches them conflict resolution. Some specific nonmedical
treatments for other dysfunctions are as follows: 1. Female orgasmic
dysfunction The general approach just described has been successful in
treating sexual arousal disorders in women and erectile disorders in
men. Masturbation appears to be the most effective way for orgasmically
dysfunctional women to have an orgasm. The procedure involves education
about sexual anatomy, visual and tactile self-exploration, using sexual
fantasies and images, and masturbation, both individually and with a
partner. Success rates of 95 percent have been reported with this
procedure for women with primary orgasmic dysfunction (LoPiccolo &
Stock, 1986). This approach does not necessarily lead to the woman's
ability to achieve orgasm during sexual intercourse. 2. Premature
ejaculation In one technique, the partner stimulates the penis while it
is outside the vagina until the man feels the sensation of impending
ejaculation. At this point, the partner stops the stimulation for a
short period of time and then continues it again. This pattern is
repeated until the man can tolerate increasingly greater periods of
stimulation before ejaculation. Masters and Johnson (1970) and Kaplan
(1974) used a similar procedure, called the "squeeze

Homosexuality

283

technique." They reported a success rate of nearly 100 percent. The
treatment is easily learned. Although the short-term success rate for
treating premature ejaculation is very high, relapses were very common.
3. Vaginismus The results of treatment for vaginismus have been
uniformly positive (Kaplan, 1974; LoPiccolo & Stock, 1986). The
involuntary spasms or closure of the vaginal muscle can be deconditioned
by first training the woman to relax and by then inserting successively
larger dilators while she is relaxed, until insertion of the penis can
occur.

Homosexuality Although the American Psychiatric Association and the
American Psychological Association no longer consider homosexuality to
be a mental disorder, some individuals still harbor this belief. In 1998
Trent Lott, then the U.S. Senate majority leader, described
homosexuality as a disorder akin to alcoholism and kleptomania---a
condition that should be treated (Mitchell, 1998). Jerry Falwell, on the
Pat Robertson program, stated that the September 11, 2001, terrorist
attack that took thousands of lives was punishment for the growing
influence of gay and lesbian groups. Falwell was later forced to
apologize for his remarks. It is clear from the tone of these statements
that homophobia---the irrational fear of homosexuality---continues to be
a major part of these objections. Given the level of public
misunderstanding and misinformation, we believe it is important to
discuss briefly what homosexuality is not. Is homosexuality a mental
disorder? The answer is no. The American Psychiatric Association did not
include homosexuality as a disorder in DSM-III-R or in any future
editions. This view of homosexuality stems from two main views
(Halderman, 2002). First, many clinicians felt that heterosexual
sexuality should not be the standard by which other sexual behaviors are
judged. Second, many gays and lesbians argue that they are mentally
healthy and that their sexual orientation reflects a normal variant of
sexual expression. Research supports these views. Studies on male and
female homosexuals suggest that most accepted their sexual orientation
and indicated no regrets at being homosexual (Croteau, Lark, Lidderdale,
& Chung, 2005; Greenan & Tunnell, 2003). In a move indicative of
changing international views of homosexuality as well, the Chinese
Psychological Association in 2001 removed it as an illness. This move is
even more meaningful because China has always been conservative toward
sexual orientation matters, and its recognition that homosexuality is
not an illness may mean that the estimated 30 million gays and lesbians
may become increasingly visible in Chinese society. It is also important
to note that although the human sexual response cycle appears equally
applicable to a homosexual population, the sexual issues may differ
quite dramatically. For example, problems among heterosexuals most often
focus on sexual intercourse, whereas gay and lesbian sexual concerns
focus on other behaviors (aversion toward anal eroticism and
cunnilingus). Lesbians and gay men must also deal with societal or
internalized homophobia, which often inhibits open expression of their
affection toward one another (Schneider, Brown, & Glassgold, 2002).
Finally, gay men are forced to deal with the association between sexual
activity and HIV infection. These broader contextual issues may create
diminished sexual desire, sexual aversion, and negative feelings toward
sexual activity. In summary, the overwhelming available studies (Croteau
et al., 2005; Greenan & Tunnell, 2003; Hu, Pattatucci, & Patterson,
1995; Laird & Green, 1996; Masters & Johnson, 1979; Strong & DeVault,
1994; Turner, 1995) on homosexuals and heterosexuals lead to the
following conclusions: • There are no physiological differences in
sexual arousal and response between homosexuals and heterosexuals. • On
measures of psychological disturbance, homosexuals and heterosexuals do
not differ significantly from each other.

GAY MARRIAGE AND FAMILY LIFE Jessie and Stacey Harris were married in
Massachusetts in 2004 where samesex couples have a right to marry. Here

• Homosexuals do not suffer from gender identity confusions; rather, any
gender conflicts they experience are due to societal intolerance to
their lifestyles. • Because of the societal context in which they live
(homophobia, health concerns, and other such issues), the sexual
concerns of homosexuals may differ significantly from those of
heterosexuals. • Research suggests that homosexuality is not simply a
lifestyle choice but is rather a naturally occurring phenomenon linked
to a biological disposition. Nothing more need be said. Homosexuality is
not a psychological disorder.

Aging, Sexual Activity, and Sexual Dysfunctions In the most
comprehensive study of sexuality and health among older adults in the
United States ages fifty-seven to eighty-five, 3,005 participants (1,550
women and 1,455 men) were surveyed, with the following findings (Lindau
et al., 2007): • Sexual activity declined with age (73 percent among
fifty-seven- to sixty-fouryear-olds; 53 percent among sixty-five- to
seventy-four-year-olds; 25 percent among seventy-five- to
eighty-five-year-olds). • Women were far more likely to report less
sexual activity at all ages. • Among men and women who were sexually
active, approximately 50 percent reported at least one bothersome sexual
problem. • The most frequently reported sexual problems for women
included low sexual desire (43 percent), problems with vaginal
lubrication (39 percent), and inability to climax (34 percent). • Among
men the most frequent problems were erectile difficulties (37 percent).
It is important for us to understand how the aging process affects
sexuality. When women reach menopause, estrogen levels drop, and women
may experience vaginal dryness and thinning of the vaginal wall. This
may result in discomfort during sexual activity. Likewise, older men are
at higher risk for prostate problems that may increase the risk of ED.
Both sexes are also at higher risk for illnesses that affect sexual
performance and interest (diabetes, high blood pressure, rheumatism, and
heart disease). Hormone replacement therapy, drugs (Cialis, Levitra, and
Viagra), and other medical procedures may help minimize the effects of
these organic problems

Aging, Sexual Activity, and Sexual Dysfunctions

on sexual activity. For example, older men and women who rate their
health as poor are less likely to be sexually active, and 14 percent of
men report using medication to improve their sexual performance (Lindau
et al., 2007).

Myth vs Reality Myth: Sex is unimportant to the elderly. They are averse
to being sexually active, become asexual beings, and are conservative in
sexual behavior. Reality: Although sexual activity does decline with
age, a 2007 major survey of adults ages ﬁfty-seven to eighty-ﬁve found
that many older people are sexually active well into their sixties,
seventies, and eighties. Fifty-four percent reported having sex at least
twice a month, and 23 percent reported once a week or more.
Approximately 50 percent of men and women under age seventy-ﬁve had
engaged in oral sex in the previous two months.

Some additional findings reported by the American Association of Retired
Persons (AARP, 1999) were the following: • Although most men and women
report that satisfying sex is important in their lives, they found
relationships to be more important than sex. • Sexual activity is
affected by the "partner gap." Whereas 80 percent of those surveyed
between the ages of forty-five and fifty-nine have partners, only 58
percent of men and 21 percent of women seventy-five and older do. • Both
men and women report that sexual activity declines with advancing age
due to health problems; yet 64 percent of men and 68 percent of women
with sexual partners report being satisfied with their sex lives.
Sexuality during old age is an area of intolerance in our youth-oriented
society, in which sexual activity is simply not associated with the
elderly. Nevertheless, a large percentage of older Americans clearly
have active sex lives. In one study (Diokno, Brown, & Herzog, 1990),
investigators found a clear relationship between the reported frequency
of intercourse at younger ages and at the present time among sixty- to
seventy-nine-year-old married men. The most active respondents reported
a present frequency that was 61 percent of their frequency between ages
forty and fifty-nine, whereas the least active reported a present
frequency of only 6 percent of that between ages forty and fifty-nine.
The most active also indicated that they became aroused on seeing women
in public situations and in response to visual stimuli. The vast
majority (69 percent) felt that sex was important for good health, and
most (63 percent) looked on masturbation as an acceptable outlet. Sexual
dysfunctions were also more prevalent in the older groups than in
younger ones, and the prevalence was affected by the individuals' prior
and present sexual activity levels. Of the least active, 21 percent
suffered from premature ejaculation, and 75 percent were either impotent
or had erectile difficulties. For the most active group, the
corresponding percentages were 8 and 19 percent. The results of this
study are summarized in Figure 10.5. A comprehensive survey (Janus &
Janus, 1993) suggested that sexual activity and enjoyment among the
older population remains surprisingly high. The Januses' survey found
that (1) the sexual activity of people ages sixty-five and older
declined little from that of their thirty- to forty-yearold
counterparts, (2) their ability to reach orgasm and have sex diminished
very little from their early years, and (3) their desire to continue a
relatively active sex life was unchanged. These findings are supported
by a recent poll of 1,292 Americans (534 men and 758 women) ages sixty
or older who reported that their interest in sex remains high, that over
half engage in

SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AMONG SENIORS Contrary to the belief that the elderly
lose their sexual desire, studies reveal that sexual desire, activity,
and enjoyment remain high in the older population.

sexual activity at least once a month, and that half rated their sexual
activity to be physically better now than in their youth (National
Council on Aging, 1998). Aside from sexual outlook and behavior,
physiologically based changes in patterns of sexual arousal and orgasm
have been found in people over age sixty-five (Masters & Johnson, 1966).
For both men and women, sexual arousal takes longer (McAnulty &
Burnette, 2003). Erection and vaginal lubrication are slower to occur,
and the urgency for orgasm is reduced. Both men and women are fully
capable of sexual satisfaction if no physiological conditions interfere.
Many elderly individuals felt that such changes allowed them to
experience sex more fully. They reported that they had more time to
spend on a seductive buildup, felt positively about their ability to
experience unhurried sex-for-joy, and experienced more warmth and
intimacy after the sex act (Janus & Janus, 1993).

Gender Identity Disorder

gender identity disorder (transsexualism) disorder

characterized by conﬂict between a person's anatomical sex and his or
her gender identity, or selfidentiﬁcation as male or female

In contrast to the sexual dysfunctions, which involve any disruption of
the normal sexual response cycle, gender identity disorder (GID)---often
called transsexualism--- is characterized by conflict between a person's
anatomical sex and his or her gender identity, or self-identification as
male or female. It is important to note that gender identity and sexual
orientation are not the same thing---the sexual orientation of a
transsexual can thus be heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual (Selvin,
1993). GID involves the person experiencing strong and persistent
cross-gender identification and persistent discomfort with his or her
anatomical sex, creating significant impairment in social, occupational,
or other important areas of functioning. People with this disorder hold
a lifelong conviction that nature has placed them in the body of the
wrong gender. This feeling produces a preoccupation with eliminating the
"natural" physical and behavioral sexual characteristics and acquiring
those of the opposite sex. People with GID tend to exhibit gender-role
conflicts at an early age and to report transsexual feelings in
childhood, some as early as two years old (Beers & Berkow, 1999;
McAnulty & Burnette, 2004). A boy may claim that he will grow up to be a
woman, may demonstrate disgust with his penis, and may be exclusively
preoccupied with interests and activities considered "feminine." Boys
with this disorder are frequently labeled "sissies" by their male peers.
They prefer playing with girls and generally avoid the rough-and-tumble
activities in which boys are traditionally encouraged to participate.
They are more likely than normal boys to play with "feminine" toys.
Girls with a GID may insist that they have a penis or will grow one and
may exhibit an avid interest in rough-and-tumble play. Female

"tomboys" during their childhoods. Although it is not uncommon for girls
to be considered tomboys, the strength, pervasiveness, and persistence
of the crossgender identification among those with a gender identity
disorder are the distinguishing features. Children who may engage in
traditional opposite sex role activities (feminine or masculine) should
not be prematurely diagnosed as GID. Nonconformity to stereotypical sex
role behavior should not, for example, be confused with the
pervasiveness of the cross-gender wishes, interests and activities of
GID.

Etiology of Gender Identity Disorder The etiology of GID is unclear.
Because the disorder is quite rare, investigators have focused more
attention on other sexual disorders. GID appears to be more common in
males than in females and may appear in both adults and children
(Laumann et al., 1994). In all likelihood, a number of variables
interact to produce GID. Again, a multipath analysis would reveal
multiple influences, but biological factors seem to be strongly
implicated.

A CASE OF SEX REASSIGNMENT Dr. Ben Barres is a renowned neurobiologist
at Stanford University who obtained a B.S. from MIT, an M.D. from
Dartmouth, and a Ph.D. from Harvard. In 1997, he became a transgendered
person, undergoing sex reassignment. Dr. Barres recalls that as a young
child he wanted to join the Boy Scouts and to ditch sewing and cooking
classes for woodworking, mechanical engineering, and "boy stuff." People
observed that he was always uncomfortable with being a woman.

Biological Inﬂuences The research in this area suggests that
neurohormonal factors, genetics, and possible brain differences may be
involved in the etiology of GID. In one oft-cited study (Ellis & Ames,
1987), male rats were castrated perinatally. This procedure reduces the
production of testosterone, which appears to influence the organization
of brain centers that govern sexual orientation. The male rats
subsequently displayed female-like gender behaviors. In human females,
early exposure to male hormones has resulted in a more masculine
behavior pattern. Thus it does appear that gender orientation can be
influenced by a lack or excess of sex hormones. Genetics and differences
in areas of the hypothalamus have also been found to correlate with the
development of GID (Henningsson et al., 2005; Zhou, Hofman, Gooren, &
Swaab, 1995). These studies suggest that GID may run in families and
that there are differences in the size of brain clusters in regions of
the hypothalamus between men with and men without GID. It is important
to note, however, that limited research in this area makes conclusions
about hormonal, genetic, and brain structure explanations very
hazardous. Some researchers believe that gender identity is malleable.
For example, most transsexual children have normal hormone levels, and
their opposite-sex orientation raises doubt that biology alone
determines male-female behaviors. Although neurohormonal levels are
important, their degree of influence on gender identity in human beings
may be minor. Psychological and Social Inﬂuences Psychological and
social explanations of GID must also be viewed with caution. In
psychodynamic theory, all sexual deviations symbolically represent
unconscious conflicts that began in early childhood (Meyers, 1991). They
occur because the Oedipus complex is not fully resolved. The male or
female child has a basic conflict between the wish for and the dread of
maternal reengulfment (Meyer & Keith, 1991). The conflict results from a
failure to deal successfully with separation-individuation phases of
life, which creates a gender identity problem. While psychodynamic
theorists adhere to such an explanation, research support is lacking.
Some researchers have hypothesized that childhood experiences influence
the development of GID (Green, 1987). Factors thought to contribute to
the disorder in

288

CHAPTER 10 • SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS

boys include parental encouragement of feminine behavior, discouragement
of the development of autonomy, excessive attention and overprotection
by the mother, the absence of an older male as a model, a relatively
powerless or absent father figure, a lack of exposure to male playmates,
and encouragement to cross-dress (Marantz & Coates, 1991).

Treatment of Gender Identity Disorder Psychotherapy and hormone therapy
have been used for many persons with GID. For some, however, sex
reassignment surgery is chosen. According to DSM-IV, 1 in 30,000 adult
males and 1 in 100,000 adult females seek sex-reassignment surgery. For
men, the surgery involves altering the male genitalia to be more similar
to the opposite sex through what can be described as "penis inversion."
Then plastic surgery constructs female genitalia, including a vagina and
clitoris. The skin of the penis is used in this construction because the
sensory nerve endings that are preserved enable most transsexuals to
experience orgasm. The male-to-female operation is nearly perfected, and
affirms the gender identity of the individual. Research suggests that
genital surgery can produce happier lives. Women who want to become men
generally request operations to remove their breasts and some ask for an
artificial penis to be constructed. This procedure is much more
complicated and expensive than the male-to-female conversion. Some
studies of transsexuals indicate positive outcomes for sex reassignment
surgery (Bradley, 1995). Most females who "changed" to males express
satisfaction over the outcome of surgery, although males who "changed"
to females are less likely to feel satisfied (Arndt, 1991). It has been
suggested that adjusting to life as a man is easier than adjusting to
life as a woman, or perhaps others may react less negatively to
woman-to-man changes than man-to-woman changes (APA, 2000).

Is GID a Valid Psychiatric Diagnosis? With the DSM being revised (fifth
edition), some experts have advocated the removal of GID as a
psychiatric diagnosis. They cite the following in support of their
contention: (a) lack of reliability and validity supporting the GID
diagnostic criteria in DSM-IV-TR, (b) the psychological distress
experienced by sons and daughters are often created by parental and
societal negative reactions and not the result of pathology, (c) some
therapeutic approaches are often similar to "reparative therapies", and
(d) there is little evidence of pathology in GID children (Hausman,
2003). Finally, there are some who believe that gender identity can best
be conceptualized along a spectrum rather than a bimodal curve. In
conclusion, gender identity is a basic and important aspect of our total
being. Gender identity disorders challenge our basic notions of the
dichotomy between male and female identities.

Paraphilias

paraphilia sexual disorder of at least six months' duration in which the
person has either acted on or is severely distressed by recurrent urges
or fantasies involving nonhuman objects, nonconsenting persons, or
suffering or humiliation

Paraphilias are sexual disorders of at least six months' duration in
which the person has either acted on or is severely distressed by
recurrent urges or fantasies involving any of the following three
categories (see Table 10.6): (1) nonhuman objects, as in fetishism and
transvestic fetishism; (2) nonconsenting others, as in exhibitionism,
voyeurism, frotteurism (rubbing against others for sexual arousal), and
pedophilia; and (3) real or simulated suffering or humiliation, as in
sadism and masochism. A person who is highly distressed by paraphiliac
urges or fantasies but has not acted on them would be diagnosed as
having a mild case of the paraphilia. All of these acts are considered
deviant because they are obligatory for sexual functioning (erection,
for example, cannot occur without the stimulus). It is not unusual for
people in this category to possess multiple paraphilias (Langstrom &
Zucker, 2005). In one study of sex offenders, researchers found that
nearly 50 percent had engaged in a variety of sexually deviant
behaviors, averaging between three and four paraphilias, and had
committed more than five hundred

CHAPTER 10 • SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS

deviant acts (Rosenfield, 1985). Men who had committed incest, for
example, had also molested nonrelatives, exposed themselves, raped adult
women, and engaged in voyeurism and frotteurism. In most cultures,
paraphilias seem to be much more prevalent in males than in females
(Beers & Berkow, 1999). This finding has led some to speculate that
biological factors may account for the unequal distribution.

Paraphilias Involving Nonhuman Objects Under this category, two forms of
paraphilias are evident: an attraction or arousal related to a nonliving
object (the "fetish") or transvestic fetishism that involves
cross-dressing. Fetishism Fetishism comprises an extremely strong sexual
attraction to and fantasies involving inanimate objects such as female
undergarments. The fetish is often used as a sexual stimulus during
masturbation or sexual intercourse. The disorder is rare among women.

Case Study Mr. M met his wife at a local church. Some kissing and
petting took place but never any other sexual contact. He had not
masturbated before marriage. Although he and his wife loved each other
very much, he was unable to have sexual intercourse with her because he
could not obtain an erection. However, he had fantasies involving an
apron and was able to get an erection while wearing an apron. His wife
was described as upset over this discovery but was persuaded to accept
it. The apron was kept hanging somewhere in the bedroom and it allowed
him to consummate the marriage. He remembers being forced to wear an
apron by his mother during his childhood years. (Kohon, 1987)

Most males find the sight of female undergarments sexually arousing and
stimulating; this does not constitute a fetish. An interest in such
inanimate objects as panties, stockings, bras, and shoes becomes a
sexual disorder when the person is often sexually aroused to the point
of erection in the presence of the fetish item, needs this item for
sexual arousal during intercourse, chooses sexual partners on the basis
of their having the item, or collects these items. In many cases, the
fetish item is enough by itself for complete sexual satisfaction through
masturbation, and the person does not seek contact with a partner.
Common fetishes include aprons, shoes, undergarments, and leather or
latex items. As a group, people diagnosed with fetishism are not
dangerous, nor do they tend to commit serious crimes. Transvestic
Fetishism A diagnosis of fetishism is not made if the inanimate object
is an article of clothing used only in cross-dressing. In such cases,
the appropriate diagnosis would be transvestic fetishism---intense
sexual arousal obtained through crossdressing (wearing clothes
appropriate to the opposite gender). This disorder should not be
confused with gender identity disorder (transsexualism), in which one
identifies with the opposite gender. Although some transsexuals and
homosexuals cross-dress, most transvestites are exclusively heterosexual
and married. Some research, however, suggests that transvestites may be
fairly hostile and self-centered, with high levels of marital discord
and a limited capacity for intimacy (Wise, Fagan, Schmidt, & Ponticas,
1991). Several aspects of transvestism are illustrated in the following
case study: fetishism sexual attraction and fantasies involving
inanimate objects such as female undergarments transvestic fetishism
intense sexual arousal obtained through cross-dressing (wearing clothes
appropriate to the opposite gender); not to be confused with
transsexualism

Case Study A twenty-six-year-old graduate student referred himself for
treatment following an examination failure. He had been cross-dressing
since the age of ten and attributed his exam failure to the excessive
amount of time that he spent doing so (four times a week). When he was
younger, his cross-dressing had taken the form of masturbating while
wearing his mother's high-heeled shoes, but it had gradually expanded to
the present stage, in which he dressed completely as a woman,
masturbating in front of a mirror. At no time had he experienced a
desire to obtain a sex-change operation. He had neither homosexual
experiences nor homosexual fantasies. Heterosexual contact had been
restricted to heavy petting with occasional girlfriends. (Lambley, 1974,
p. 101)

Paraphilias

291

Sexual arousal while cross-dressing is an important criterion in the
diagnosis of transvestic fetishism. If arousal is not present or has
disappeared over time, a more appropriate diagnosis may be gender
identity disorder. This distinction, however, may be difficult to make.
Some transsexuals show penile erections to descriptions of
cross-dressing (Blanchard, Racansky, & Steiner, 1986). The occurrence of
sexual arousal in cross-dressing, therefore, may not serve as a valid
distinction between transsexualism and transvestic fetishism. If the
cross-dressing occurs only during the course of a gender identity
disorder, the person is not considered in the category of transvestic
fetishism. Many transvestites believe that they have alternating
masculine and feminine personalities. In a feminine role, they can play
out such behavior patterns as buying nightgowns and trying on
fashionable clothes. They may introduce their wives to their female
personalities and urge them to go on shopping trips together as women.
Other transvestites cross-dress only for the purposes of sexual arousal
and masturbation and do not fantasize themselves as members of the
opposite sex. Male transvestites often wear feminine garments or
undergarments during sexual intercourse with their wives.

Paraphilias Involving Nonconsenting Persons This category of disorders
involves persistent and powerful sexual fantasies about unsuspecting
strangers or acquaintances. The victims are nonconsenting in that they
do not choose to be the objects of the attention or sexual behavior.
Exhibitionism Exhibitionism is characterized by urges, acts, or
fantasies of exposing one's genitals to a stranger, often with the
intent of shocking the unsuspecting victim:

NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK The etiology and behavioral
symptoms of gender identity disorder go far beyond enjoying dressing as
the opposite sex; more important is persistent crossgender identiﬁcation
and discomfort with one's own anatomical sex.

Case Study A nineteen-year-old single white college man reported that he
had daily fantasies of exposing and had exposed himself on three
occasions. The ﬁrst occurred when he masturbated in front of the window
of his dormitory room when women would be passing by. The other two acts
occurred in his car; in each case he asked young women for directions
and then exposed his penis and masturbated when they approached. He felt
a great deal of anxiety in the presence of women and dated infrequently.
(Hayes, Brownell, & Barlow, 1983)

Exhibitionism is relatively common. The exhibitionist is most often male
and the victim female. A high number of young women have been victims of
exhibitionists, although most women did not report any long-lasting
psychological traumas associated with the episodes. It is more likely to
cause moderate distress, although a smaller number believed the
incidents had negatively affected their attitudes toward men (Cox &
McMahon, 1978). The main goal of the exhibitionist seems to be the
sexual arousal he gets by exposing himself; most exhibitionists want no
further contact. Exhibitionists may expect to produce surprise, sexual
arousal, or disgust in the victim. The act may involve exposing a limp
penis or masturbating an erect penis. Most exhibitionists are in their
twenties---far from being the "dirty old men" of popular myth. Most are
married. Their exhibiting has a compulsive quality to it, and they
report that they feel a great deal of anxiety about the act. A typical
exposure sequence involves the person first entertaining sexually
arousing memories of previous exposures and then returning to the area
where previous exposures took place. Next, the person locates a suitable
victim, rehearses the exposure mentally, and finally exposes himself. As
the person moves through his sequence, his self-control weakens and
disappears. Many men use alcohol before exposing themselves, perhaps to
reduce inhibitions (Arndt, 1991).

Did You Know?

S

ome social scientists believe that the United States is an
exhibitionistic and voyeuristic society that contributes to such
disorders. Reality TV and access to the Internet (MySpace, Facebook,
etc.) encourage people to reveal intimate aspects of their lives to
strangers. Some even claim that modern architecture reﬂects the
"peek-a-boo effect" such that "glass walled" condominiums and ofﬁce
buildings allow residents to see out and be seen in a webcam manner.

Lewis married a thirteen-yearold girl in the 1950s, it created a furor
in Great Britain, where many considered him a pedophiliac. The public's
outrage resulted in the cancellation of many of his concerts, forcing
him to return to New York. Lewis was twenty-two at the time of this

Voyeurism Voyeurism comprises urges, acts, or fantasies of observing an
unsuspecting person disrobing or engaging in sexual activity. "Peeping,"
as voyeurism is sometimes termed, is considered deviant when it includes
serious risk, is done in socially unacceptable circumstances, or is
preferred to coitus. The typical voyeur is not interested in looking at
his wife or girlfriend; an overwhelming number of voyeurism acts involve
strangers. Observation alone produces sexual arousal and excitement, and
the voyeur often masturbates during this surreptitious activity. The
voyeur is like the exhibitionist in that sexual contact is not the goal;
viewing an undressed body is the primary motive. However, a voyeur may
also exhibit or use other indirect forms of sexual expression (American
Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Because the act is repetitive, arrest
is predictable. Usually an accidental witness or a victim notifies the
police. Potential rapists or burglars who behave suspiciously are often
arrested as voyeurs. The proliferation of sexually oriented television
programs, "romance" paperbacks, explicit sexual magazines, and
NC-17-rated movies all point to the voyeuristic nature of our society.
The growing number of "night clubs" featuring male exotic dancers and
attended by women may indicate women's increasing interest in men's
bodies and their acknowledgment that it is all right to be sexual.
Frotteurism Whereas physical contact is not the goal of voyeurism,
contact is the primary motive in frotteurism. Frotteurism involves
recurrent and intense sexual urges, acts, or fantasies of touching or
rubbing against a nonconsenting person. The touching, not the coercive
nature of the act, is the sexually exciting feature. As in the case of
the other paraphilias, the diagnosis is made when the person has acted
on the urges or is markedly distressed by them. Pedophilia Pedophilia is
a disorder in which an adult obtains erotic gratification through urges,
acts, or fantasies of sexual contact with a prepubescent child.
According to DSM-IV-TR, to be diagnosed with this disorder, the person
must be at least sixteen years of age and at least five years older than
the victim. Pedophiles may victimize their own children (incest),
stepchildren, or those outside the family. Most pedophiles prefer girls,
although a few choose prepubertal boys. Sexual abuse of children is
common (Phillips & Daniluk, 2004). Between 20 and 30 percent of women
report having had a childhood sexual encounter with an adult man. And,
contrary to the popular view of the child molester as a stranger, most
pedophiles are relatives, friends, or casual acquaintances of their
victims (Morenz & Becker, 1995). In most cases of abuse, only one adult
and one child are involved, but cases involving several adults or groups
of children have been reported. Child victims of sexual abuse show a
variety of physical symptoms, such as urinary tract infections, poor
appetite, and headaches. Reported psychological symptoms include
nightmares, difficulty in sleeping, decline in school performance,
acting-out behaviors, and sexually focused behavior. Some child victims
show the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. The effects of
sexual abuse can become lifelong. One study of women who were victims of
childhood sexual abuse revealed a "contaminated identity" characterized
by self-loathing, shame, and powerlessness (Phillips & Daniluk, 2004).
Incest DSM-IV-TR considers childhood incest to be a form of pedophilia.
Incest, however, can also occur between adults too closely related to
marry legally; it is nearly universally taboo in society. The cases of
incest most frequently reported to law enforcement agencies are those
between a father and his daughter or stepdaughter. However, the most
common incestuous relationship is brother-sister incest, not
parent-child incest. Mother-son incest seems to be rare. Sexual
activities between siblings are relatively frequent: 15 percent of women
and 10 percent of men reported that they had had sexual involvement with
their siblings. In 75 percent of these cases, mutual consent was
involved. About half considered the experience positive; the other half,
negative (Finkelhor, 1980). Although brother-sister incest is more
common, most research has focused on father-daughter incest (Masters,
Johnson, & Kolodny, 1992). This type of incestuous

Paraphilias

relationship generally begins when the daughter is between six and
eleven years old, and it continues for at least two years (Stark, 1984).
Unlike sex between siblings, father-daughter incest is always
exploitative. The girl is especially vulnerable because she depends on
her father for emotional support. As a result, the victims often feel
guilty and powerless. Their problems continue into adulthood and are
reflected in their high rates of drug abuse, sexual dysfunction, and
psychiatric problems (McAnulty & Burnette, 2003). Studies suggest that
incestuous fathers are lower in intelligence than other fathers
(Williams & Finkelhor, 1990) and often shy (Masters et al., 1992). Three
types of incestuous fathers have been described (Herman & Hirschman,
1981). The first is a socially isolated man who is highly dependent on
his family for interpersonal relationships; his emotional dependency
gradually evolves (and expands) into a sexual relationship with his
daughter. The second type of incestuous father has a psychopathic
personality and is completely indiscriminate in choosing sexual
partners. The third type has pedophilic tendencies and is sexually
involved with several children, including his daughter. In addition,
incest victims have reported family patterns in which the father is
violent and the mother is unusually powerless. Williams and Finkelhor
(1990) noted that some studies have shown that incestuous fathers were
more likely than nonincestuous fathers to have experienced childhood
sexual abuse themselves, although such abuse is absent in many cases.
They also found that incestuous fathers tend to have difficulties with
empathy, nurturance, caretaking, social skills, and masculine
identification.

TOOLS OF THE SADOMASOCHISTIC TRADE Pain and humiliation are associated
with sexual satisfaction in sadism and masochism. Sadism involves
inﬂicting pain on others; masochism involves receiving pain. Instruments
used in sadomasochistic activities include handcuffs, whips, chains, and
sharp objects.

Paraphilias Involving Pain or Humiliation Pain and humiliation do not
appear to be related to normal sexual arousal. In sadism and masochism,
however, they play a prominent role. Sadism is a form of paraphilia in
which sexually arousing urges, fantasies, or acts are associated with
inflicting physical or psychological suffering on others. The word
sadism was coined from the name of the Marquis de Sade (1740--1814), a
French nobleman who wrote extensively about the sexual pleasure he
received by inflicting pain on women. The marquis himself was so cruel
to his sexual victims that he was declared insane and jailed for
twenty-seven years. Sadistic behavior may range from the pretended or
fantasized infliction of pain through mild to severe cruelty toward
partners to an extremely dangerous pathological form of sadism that may
involve mutilation or murder. Masochism is a paraphilia in which sexual
urges, fantasies, or acts are associated with being humiliated, bound,
or made to suffer. The word masochism is derived from the name of a
nineteenth-century Austrian novelist, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, whose
fictional characters obtained sexual satisfaction only when pain was
inflicted on them. Because of their passive roles, masochists are not
considered dangerous. For some sadists and masochists, coitus becomes
unnecessary; pain or humiliation alone is sufficient to produce sexual
pleasure. As with other paraphilias, DSMIV-TR specifies that to receive
the diagnosis the person must have acted on the urges or must be
markedly distressed by them. Most sadomasochists (men and women) engage
in and enjoy both submissive and dominant roles (Moser & Levitt, 1987).
Only 16 percent were exclusively dominant or submissive. Many engaged in
spanking, whipping, and bondage (see Table 10.7). Approximately 40
percent engaged in behaviors that caused minor pain using ice, hot wax,
biting, or face slapping. Fewer than 18 percent engaged in more harmful
procedures, such as burning or piercing. Nearly all respondents reported
sadomasochistic (S&M) activities to be more satisfying than "straight"
sex. Most sadomasochists who have been studied report that they do not
seek harm or injury but that they find the sensation of utter
helplessness appealing (Baumeister, 1988). S&M activities are often
carefully scripted and involve role playing and mutual consent by the
participants. In addition, fantasies involving sexual abuse, rejection,
and forced sex are not uncommon among both male and female college
students. Most sadomasochistic behavior among college students involves
very mild forms of pain (such as in biting or pinching) that are
accepted in our society.

Note: These sadomasochistic sexual preferences were reported by both
male and female respondents. Many more men express a preference for S&M
activities, but women who do so are likely to engage in this form of
sexual behavior more frequently and with many more partners. Source:
Data from Brewslow, Evans, & Langley (1986).

Sadomasochistic behavior is considered deviant when pain, either
inflicted or received, is necessary for sexual arousal and orgasm.
According to Kinsey and his associates (1953), 22 percent of men and 12
percent of women reported at least some sexual response to
sadomasochistic stories. Janus and Janus (1993) reported that 14 percent
of men and 11 percent of women have had at least some sadomasochistic
experiences. Some cases of sadomasochism appear to be the result of an
early experience associating sexual arousal with pain. One masochistic
man reported that as a child he was often "caned" on the buttocks by a
school headmaster as his "attractive" wife looked on (Money, 1987). He
reported, "I got sexual feelings from around the age of twelve,
especially if she was watching" (p. 273). He and some of his schoolmates
later hired prostitutes to spank them. Later yet, he engaged in
self-whipping. In addition to the paraphilias covered here, DSM-IV-TR
lists many others under the category of "not otherwise specified"
paraphilias. They include telephone scatalogia (making obscene telephone
calls) and sexual urges involving corpses (necrophilia), animals
(zoophilia), or feces (coprophilia).

Etiology and Treatment of Paraphilias All etiological theories for the
paraphilias attempt to answer three questions: (1) What produced the
deviant arousal pattern? (2) Why does the person not develop a more
appropriate outlet for his or her sexual drive? (3) Why is the behavior
not deterred by normative and legal prohibitions? As the multipath model
suggests, there are multiple contributing causes, but the state of our
knowledge provides only partial answers.

Paraphilias

Earlier, we noted that investigators have attempted to find genetic,
neurohormonal, and brain anomalies that might be associated with sexual
disorders. Some of the research findings conflict; others need
replication and confirmation (Nevid, Fichner-Rathus, & Rathus, 1995).
There is evidence, however, that some men may be biologically
predisposed to pedophilia ("Are Some Men Predisposed to Pedophilia?"
2007), as they have been found to have deficits in brain activation and
less white matter. In any event, researchers need to continue applying
advanced technology in the study of the biological influences on sexual
disorders. Even if biological factors are found to be important in the
causes of sexual disorders, psychological factors are also likely to
contribute in important ways. Among early attempts to explain paraphilic
disorders, psychodynamic theorists proposed that all sexual deviations
symbolically represent unconscious conflicts that began in early
childhood (Schrut, 2005). Castration anxiety is hypothesized to be an
important etiological factor underlying transvestic fetishism,
exhibitionism, sadism, and masochism. It occurs because the Oedipal
complex is not fully resolved. Because the boy's incestuous desires are
only partially repressed, he fears retribution from his father in the
form of castration. If this is the case, many sexual deviations can be
seen as attempts to protect the person from castration anxiety. For
example, in transvestic fetishism, acknowledging that women lack a penis
raises the fear of castration. To refute this possibility, the male
transvestite "restores" the penis to women through cross-dressing. In
this manner, he unconsciously represents a "woman who has a penis" and
therefore reduces the fear of castration. An item of clothing or a
particular fetish is selected because it represents a phallic symbol
(Arndt, 1991). Similarly, according to psychodynamic theorists, an
exhibitionist exposes to reassure himself that castration has not
occurred. The shock that registers on the faces of others assures him
that he still has a penis. A sadist may protect himself from castration
anxiety by inflicting pain (power equals penis). A masochist may engage
in self-castration through the acceptance of pain, thereby limiting the
power of others to castrate him. Because castration anxiety stems from
an unconscious source, the fear is never completely allayed, however,
and so the person feels compelled to repeat deviant sexual acts. The
psychodynamic treatment of sexual deviations involves helping the
patient understand the relationship between the deviation and the
unconscious conflict that produced it. Learning theorists stress the
importance of early conditioning experiences in the etiology of sexually
deviant behaviors. For example, if a person with poor social skills
masturbates while engaged in sexually deviant fantasies, the
conditioning may hamper the development of normal sexual patterns. A
young boy may develop a fetish for women's panties after he becomes
sexually excited watching girls come down a slide with their underpants
exposed. He begins to masturbate to fantasies of girls with their
panties showing and may develop a fetish into adulthood. In another
example, two young men became sexually aroused when female passersby
surprised them as they were urinating in a semiprivate area. The
accidental association between sexual arousal and exposure resulted in
exhibitionism (McGuire, Carlisle, & Young, 1965). Another researcher
(Rachman, 1966), however, did use controlled research to demonstrate the
possible role of conditioning in the development of a fetish. The
investigators showed three men a picture of a pair of women's black
boots, followed by slides of nude women, which produced sexual arousal
(as measured by penile volume). Initially, the picture of boots did not
elicit any increases in penile volume. But after slides of boots and
nude women were paired several times (classical conditioning), all three
participants developed conditioned sexual arousal at the sight of the
boots alone. Although the conditioned responses were weak, they could
have been strengthened if the participants had masturbated while the
boots were shown. Learning approaches to treating sexual deviations have
generally involved one or more of the following elements: (1) weakening
or eliminating the sexually inappropriate behaviors through processes
such as extinction or aversive conditioning;

295

296

CHAPTER 10 • SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS

(2) acquiring or strengthening sexually appropriate behaviors; and (3)
    developing appropriate social skills. The following case illustrates
    this multiple approach:

Case Study A twenty-seven-year-old man with a three-year history of
pedophilic activities (fondling and cunnilingus) with four- to
seven-year-old girls was treated through the following procedure. The
man ﬁrst masturbated to orgasm while exposed to stimuli involving adult
females. He then masturbated to orgasm while listening to a relaxation
tape, and then masturbated (but not to orgasm) to deviant stimuli. The
procedure allowed the strengthening of normal arousal patterns and
lessened the ability to achieve an orgasm while exposed to deviant
stimuli (extinction). Measurement of penile tumescence when exposed to
the stimuli indicated a sharp decrease to pedophilic stimuli and high
arousal to heterosexual stimuli. These changes were maintained over a
twelvemonth follow-up period. (Alford, Morin, Atkins, & Schuen, 1987)

One of the more unique treatments for exhibitionism is the aversive
behavior rehearsal (ABR) program (Wickramasekera, 1976), in which shame
or humiliation is the aversive stimulus. The technique requires that the
patient exhibit himself in his usual manner to a preselected audience of
women. During the exhibiting act, the patient must verbalize a
conversation between himself and his penis. He must talk about what he
is feeling emotionally and physically and must explain his fantasies
regarding what he supposes the female observers are thinking about him.
One premise of the ABR program is that exhibitionism often occurs during
a hypnoticlike state, when the exhibitionist's fantasies are extremely
active and his judgment is impaired. The ABR method forces him to
experience and examine his act while being fully aware of what he is
doing (Kilmann, Sabalis, Gearing, Bukstel, & Scovern, 1982). The results
of behavioral treatment have been generally positive, but the majority
of the studies involved single participants. Few control groups were
included. Another problem in interpreting the results of these studies
becomes apparent when we examine the approaches that were employed. For
the most part, several different behavioral techniques were used within
each study, so evaluation of a particular technique is impossible.

Rape Did You Know?

E

arly explanations attributed rape to an unusually quick sexual arousal
response and impulsivity that was considered a natural reaction. Thus
excuses were made for men: "Boys will be boys." Conversely, women were
often blamed for enticing rape through ﬂirtatious behaviors and/or
revealing dress. In reality, rape is an act of aggression and control,
not sex. Most rapists are deliberate and often plan their attacks.

rape a form of sexual aggression that refers to sexual activity
(oralgenital sex, anal intercourse, and vaginal intercourse) performed
against a person's will through the use of force, argument, pressure,
alcohol or drugs, or authority

Although it is not considered a DSM-IV-TR disorder, we believe that the
magnitude and seriousness of problems related to rape in our society
warrant such discussion. Public awareness of these problems has
heightened in the wake of highly publicized allegations of assault or
sexual harassment made against such public figures as basketball player
Kobe Bryant, boxer Mike Tyson, conservative talk show host Bill
O'Reilly, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, and former president
Bill Clinton. Rape is a form of sexual aggression that refers to sexual
activity (oral-genital sex, anal intercourse, and vaginal intercourse)
performed against a person's will through the use of force, argument,
pressure, alcohol or drugs, or authority (McAnulty & Burnette, 2004).
With a child younger than a certain age who may consent, however, the
law recognizes what is called statutory rape---sexual intercourse with a
child younger than a certain age. Rape is an act surrounded by many
myths and misconceptions (see Table 10.8). Considerable controversy
exists over whether rape is primarily a crime of violence or of sex
(Marsh, 1988). Feminists have challenged the belief that rape is an act
of sexual deviance; they make a good case that it is truly an act of
violence and aggression against women. The principal motive, they
believe, is that of power, not sex. FBI statistics reveal that the
number of rapes in the United States has risen dramatically, with an
average of one rape every five minutes (Federal Bureau of Investigation
\[FBI\], 1996; U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 1991). However,
in past decades, only about 16 percent of reported cases resulted in a
conviction for rape, with another 4 percent of those cases producing
convictions for lesser offenses. This low conviction rate and the
humiliation and shame of a rape trial keep many women from reporting
rapes, so the actual incidence of the crime is probably much higher than
reported.

This includes women, men, girls, boys, infants, grandmothers, and
teenagers. 2. Rape is an act of violence. It is not about sex but about
the abuse of power. 3. Rape is never the fault of the victim. It is
painful, humiliating, and hurtful. No one ever enjoys being raped. 4.
Most rapes happen between people of the same race. 5. You are more
likely to be raped by someone you know than by a stranger. 6. You can be
raped by someone you've had sex with before. Each time you are asked to
have sex, you have the right to say no, even if you've said yes before.
7. Most rapists do not use weapons to force someone into having sex.
Threats or emotional and physical force are more commonly used. 8. If
you say no and someone forces you to have sex, it's rape. 9. Most
rapists plan their attacks and test their victim's tolerance of abuse
over a period of time. This includes husbands, someone you're dating,
and family members, as well as strangers. 10. Not only is rape always
wrong; it's also a crime. Rape is against the law. Source: San Francisco

Estimates based on surveys indicate that as many as one of every five
women will be a rape victim at some time during her life (Sorenson &
Siegel, 1992). Most rape victims are young women in their teens or
twenties; in approximately one-half of all rape cases, the victim is at
least acquainted with the rapist and is attacked in the home or in an
automobile. About 90 percent of rapists attack persons of the same race;
most rapes are planned and not impulsive (Beers & Berkow, 1999). The
most frequent form of rape reported is "acquaintance" or "date" rape.
Date rape may account for the majority of all rapes. Many victims may be
reluctant to report such an attack; they feel responsible---at least in
part---because they made a date with their attacker. Statistics vary as
to the incidence of date rapes. Between 8 and 25 percent of female
college students have reported that they had "unwanted sexual
intercourse," and studies have generally found that most college women
had experienced some unwanted sexual activity (Craig, 1990). Men who try
to coerce women into intercourse share certain characteristics (Craig,
1990; Hall, 1996; Hall, Windover, & Maramba, 1998). They tend to (1)
actively create the situation in which sexual encounters may occur; (2)
interpret women's friendliness as provocation or their protests as
insincerity; (3) try to manipulate women into sexual favors by using
alcohol (some 70 percent of rapes are associated with alcohol
intoxication) or "date rape drugs" such as rohypnol and GHB; (4)
attribute failed attempts at sexual encounters to perceived negative
features of the woman, thereby protecting their egos; (5) come from
environments of parental neglect or physical or sexual abuse; (6)
initiate coitus earlier than men who are not sexually aggressive; and
(7) have more sexual partners than males who are not sexually
aggressive. Many men who do not rape may also have these
characteristics. Indeed, when asked to indicate the likelihood that they
would rape if assured that they would not be caught and punished, about
35 percent of college males reported some likelihood and 20 percent
indicated fairly high likelihood (Malamuth, 1981). Sexual aggression by
men is quite common. Fifteen percent of a sample of college men reported
that they did force intercourse at least once or twice. Only 39 percent
of the men did not admit to any coerced sex (Rapaport & Burkhart, 1984).
In a survey of students enrolled in thirty-two universities in the
United States, more than 50 percent of women reported being the victims
of sexual aggression, and

n 2005, Jan Luedeckde of Toronto was tried for sexual assault for
attempting to have sex with a female acquaintance against her will. His
defense was that he suffered from a disorder called "sexsomnia" or
"sleepsex." Akin to sleepwalking, the perpetrator is unaware of his/her
actions. There have been only 31 recorded cases in the medical
literature of sexsomnia. All occurred during sleep, with individuals
having no memory of their actions. Luedeckde was acquitted of rape,
outraging many women's organizations (Underwood, 2007).

CHAPTER 10 • SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS

PROTESTING RAPE In South Africa it is reported that half a million women
are victims of sexual violence, but only 1 in 9 women who are raped will
report it. Antirape and crime activists stage a mock cruciﬁxion in
Johannesburg to protest the reported recent assault of a woman raped by
9 men and to highlight the unacceptable high numbers raped in the
country.

8 percent of men admitted to committing sexual acts that met the legal
definition of rape. Women seldom reported episodes of date rape (Hall,
1996; Koss, Gidycz, & Wisniewski, 1987). Many universities are
conducting workshops for students to help them understand that
intercourse without consent during a date or other social activity is
rape.

Effects of Rape

rape trauma syndrome

a two-phase syndrome that rape victims may experience, including such
emotional reactions as psychological distress, phobic reactions, and
sexual dysfunction

Rape victims may experience a cluster of emotional reactions known as
the rape trauma syndrome; they include psychological distress, phobic
reactions, and sexual dysfunction (Koss, 1993). These reactions appear
consistent with posttraumatic stress disorder. Two phases have been
identified in rape trauma syndrome: 1. Acute Phase: Disorganization
During this period of several or more weeks, the rape victim may have
feelings of self-blame, fear, and depression. The victim may believe she
was responsible for the rape (for example, by not locking the door or
wearing provocative clothing or by being overly friendly toward the
attacker). The victim may have a strange fear that the attacker will
return and anxiety that she may again be raped or even killed. She may
express these emotional reactions and beliefs directly as anger, fear,
rage, anxiety, and/or depression, or she may conceal them, appearing
amazingly calm. Beneath this exterior, however, are signs of tension,
including headaches, irritability, restlessness, sleeplessness, and
jumpiness (Nevid et al., 1995). 2. Long-Term Phase: Reorganization This
second phase may last for several years. The victim begins to deal
directly with her feelings and attempts to reorganize her life.
Lingering fears and phobic reactions continue, especially to situations
or events that remind the victim of the traumatic incident. A host of
reactions may be present. Many women report one or more sexual
dysfunctions as the result of the rape; fear of sex and lack of desire
or arousal appear most common. Some women recover quickly, but others
report problems years after the rape. Victims may experience selective
fears involving things such as darkness and enclosed places---conditions
likely to be associated with rape. Duration and intensity of fear also
appear to be related to perceptions of danger. Many women drastically
alter their feelings of safety and personal vulnerability; they feel
unsafe in many situations and over an extended period of time. It is
clear that the impact of rape has long-lasting consequences and that
family, friends and acquaintances need to exercise patience and
understanding of the victim as she goes through the healing process.

Rape

Etiology of Rape Rape is not specifically listed in DSM-IV-TR as a
mental disorder because the act can have a variety of motivations. In an
influential study of 133 rapists, Groth, Burgess, and Holstrom (1977)
distinguished the three motivational types: 1. The power rapist,
comprising 55 percent of those studied, is primarily attempting to
compensate for feelings of personal or sexual inadequacy by trying to
intimidate his victims. 2. The anger rapist, comprising 40 percent of
those studied, is angry at women in general; the victim is merely a
convenient target. 3. The sadistic rapist, comprising only 5 percent of
those studied, derives satisfaction from inflicting pain and may torture
or mutilate the victim. These findings tend to support the contention
that rape has more to do with power, aggression, and violence than with
sex. Researchers are raising questions about the effect that media
portrayals of violent sex, especially in pornography, have on rape
rates. Exposure to such material may affect attitudes and thoughts and
influence patterns of sexual arousal. These media portrayals may reflect
and affect societal values concerning violence and women. A "cultural
spillover" theory---namely, that rape tends to be high in cultures or
environments that encourage violence---has been proposed (Baron, Straus,
& Jaffee, 1988). The investigators studied the relationship between
cultural support for violence, as well as demographic characteristics
and rates of rapes in all fifty states. Results indicated that cultural
support for violence was significantly related to the rate of rape; when
violence is generally encouraged or condoned, there is a "spillover"
effect on rape.

Treatment for Rapists Many believe that sex offenders are not good
candidates for treatment. High recidivism rates are often associated
with sexual aggression, and the most frequent action is punishment
(incarceration). Both conventional and more controversial treatments
have been used or proposed. Conventional Treatment Imprisonment has been
the main form of treatment for rapists. However, it is more accurate to
describe it as punishment, as the majority of convicts receive little or
no treatment in prison (Goleman, 1992). Behavioral treatment for sexual
aggressors (rapists and pedophiles) generally involves the following
steps: 1. Assessing sexual preferences through self-report and measuring
erectile responses to different sexual stimuli 2. Reducing deviant
interests through aversion therapy (the man receives electric shock when
deviant stimuli are presented) 3. Orgasmic reconditioning or
masturbation training to increase sexual arousal to appropriate stimuli
4. Social skills training to increase interpersonal competence 5.
Assessment after treatment Treatments for sex offenders are becoming
increasingly sophisticated. They involve identifying risk factors and
attempting to develop intervention strategies directly attuned to them.
These risk factors include (1) dispositional, such as psychopathic or
antisocial personality characteristics; (2) historical, such as prior
history of crime and violence and developmental trauma; (3)
criminogenic, such as deviant social networks and lack of positive
social supports; and (4) clinical, such as indicators of substance
abuse, psychiatric problems, and poor social functioning (Ward &
Stewart, 2003). Treatment as previously outlined attempts to use the
most empirically sound strategies to alter or minimize the risk factors
(Polaschek, 2003). For example, if a person has a deviant social
network, attempts are made to remove the person from such an
environment. Although treatment is becoming more sophisticated,
questions remain about the effectiveness of these programs. Some
treatment programs have been effective with child molesters and
exhibitionists, but treatment outcomes have tended to be poor

Why Do Men Rape Women?

I

n 1995, former world heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson was released
from prison after serving a sentence for raping a beauty contestant in
his hotel room. During his trial, "talk radio" and the print media were
ﬁlled with speculations about his motives and responsibility for the
event. Some claimed that Tyson was only minimally responsible because
the woman had willingly gone to his hotel room. (This reasoning was also
offered to excuse Kobe Bryant of the alleged rape of a young hotel
worker.) Others placed the blame on certain sports such as boxing,
saying the activity condones aggression, even sexual aggression. Still
others speculated that Tyson was oversexed, that his testosterone levels
were high, or that he acted out because of steroid use. Sociocultural
Perspective A variety of views of the causes of rape have been proposed.
Some researchers theorized that rape was committed by mentally disturbed
men, and studies were initiated to ﬁnd personality characteristics that
might be associated with rape. The sociocultural view of rape gained
favor with the ﬁnding that a signiﬁcant proportion of men would consider
rape if they could get away with it. The view that rapists were simply
mentally disturbed individuals began to change. Many argued that rape
was a means of control and dominance whereby men keep women in a
perpetual state of intimidation. This view emphasized a "culture" of
male dominance rather than a sexual motive as a primary reason for
sexual assault (McAnulty & Burnette, 2004). Other theorists believe that
social myths embedded in our culture reinforce themes that underlie
rape: (1) that women have an unconscious desire to be overpowered and
raped; (2) that women "ask for it" by dressing in provocative clothing,
visiting a man's room, or going where they should not go; (3) that women
could avoid rape if they wanted to; (4) that only "bad girls" get raped;
and (5) that women only "cry rape" for revenge. Sociobiological
Perspective Another explanation of rape and sexual aggression is posited
by sociobiological models. Sexual aggression, according to this view,
has an evolutionary basis. Sex differences have evolved as a means of
maximizing the reproduction of the human species: men have much more to
gain in reproductive terms by being able to pass on their genes rapidly
to a

large number of women, which increases their chances of having offspring
(L. Ellis, 1991). Men's advantage is women's disadvantage, however.
Because women must bear much more of the investment in each offspring
before and after birth, natural selection would favor women whose mates
are likely to supply a greater share of the investment in offspring.
Therefore, it would be advantageous for women to avoid multiple partners
and to seek male commitment. Ellis also argued that men's sex drive is
stronger than women's and cited as evidence these three points: 1. Men
in all societies have higher self-reported desires for copulation and
other forms of sexual experiences. 2. Males (including males in other
species of primates) masturbate more, especially in the absence of sex
partners. 3. Women are more likely than men to report having sexual
intercourse for reasons other than sexual gratiﬁcation. Ellis took issue
with the view that rape is not a sexual crime. He agreed that rapists
often try to obtain sex by actions such as getting women drunk and
falsely pledging love; that they use physical force only after these
other tactics fail; and that fewer men than women believe rape is
motivated by power and anger. Nevertheless, sociobiological theories
have difﬁculty explaining differences in rates of rape in different
societies or changes in rates of rape over time without references to
cultural conditions or experiential factors. Ellis believes that the
motivation for sexual assault is unlearned but that the behavior
surrounding sexual assault is learned. Thus sexual motivation (including
the drive to rape) is innate. If sexual aggression is reinforced (or not
punished), forced copulatory attempts will persist. Isolating and
testing different propositions concerning sexual assault have been
difﬁcult. Even so, no one---not even those who believe that men have a
stronger biological sexual drive---can excuse or condone such behavior.
Research ﬁndings suggest that changes in the way men and women relate to
one another, attitudes toward violence, and cultural practices can
reduce the incidence of rape. Can you give examples that support or
disprove the sociocultural perspective? Does the sociocultural
perspective seem accurate to you? Do you think punishment is an
effective deterrent to rape? Does the sociobiological perspective seem
accurate to you?

for rapists (Marshall, Jones, Ward, Johnston, & Barbaree, 1991). Public
revulsion and outrage against incest offenders, pedophiles, and rapists
have resulted in calls for severe punishment, although there is no
agreement as to what this should entail. Controversial Treatments
Surgical castration has been used to treat sexual offenders in many
European countries, and results indicate that rates of relapse have been
low (Marshall et al., 1991). An investigation of sex offenders (rapists,
heterosexual

Summary

301

pedophiles, homosexual pedophiles, bisexual pedophiles, and a sexual
murderer) who were surgically castrated reported a decrease in sexual
intercourse, masturbation, and frequency of sexual fantasies. However,
twelve of the thirty-nine were still able to engage in sexual
intercourse several years after being castrated. The rapists constituted
the group whose members were most likely to remain sexually active.
Chemical therapy, usually involving the hormone Depo-Provera, reduces
selfreports of sexual urges in pedophiles but not the ability to show
genital arousal. Drugs appear to reduce psychological desire more than
actual erection capabilities (Wincze, Bansal, & Malamud, 1986). The
effectiveness of biological treatment such as surgery and chemotherapy
is not known, and controversy obviously continues over the appropriate
treatment for incest offenders, pedophiles, and rapists. Sexuality and
the expression of sex are considered not only normal and pleasurable
aspects of human existence but an intimate expression of life itself.
Because human sexuality plays such an important role in our lives,
sexual problems can cause great consternation. As a result, much public
and scholarly interest and attention have been directed toward
problematic sexual behaviors. Sex therapists now recognize that sexual
dysfunctions are very common in people, that most will inevitably
experience episodes in their lives, and that such incidents will be
successfully resolved without professional intervention. Adequately
dealing with them often involves realizing that they represent normal
transitory situations of short duration and/or acquiring a greater
understanding and acceptance of normal biological changes that affect
sexual functioning. Most psychologists now recognize that the complex
interaction of biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural
forces influences the etiology, manifestation, and treatment of sexual
dysfunctions. Research on sexual dysfunctions and the paraphilias has
increased significantly, often using a multipath analysis.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of gender identity disorder, for
which research into its causes lags far behind, partly because of its
rarity. Little doubt exists, however, that the general public is
becoming increasingly knowledgeable and sophisticated in their
understanding of sexual dysfunctions and disorders. It remains to be
seen how increased public awareness will affect the study and treatment
of sexual dysfunctions and disorders.

I M P L I C AT I O N S

Summary 1. What are normal and abnormal sexual behaviors? ■ One of the
difficulties in diagnosing abnormal sexual behavior is measuring it
against a standard of normal sexual behavior. No attempt to establish
such criteria has been completely successful, but these attempts have
produced a better understanding of the normal human sexual response
cycle. 2. What does the normal sexual response cycle tell us about
sexual dysfunctions? ■ The human sexual response cycle has four stages:
the

appetitive, arousal, orgasm, and resolution phases. Each may be
characterized by problems, which may be diagnosed as disorders if they
are recurrent and persistent. ■ Sexual dysfunctions are disruptions of
the normal sexual response cycle. They are fairly common in the general
population and may affect a person's ability to become sexually aroused
or to engage in intercourse. Many result from fear or anxiety regarding

sexual activities; the various treatment programs are generally
successful. 3. What causes sexual dysfunctions? ■ The multipath model
illustrates how biological (hormonal variations and medical conditions),
psychological (performance anxieties), social (parental upbringing and
attitudes), and sociocultural (cultural scripts) dimensions contribute
to sexual dysfunctions. 4. What types of treatments are available for
sexual dysfunctions? ■ Depending on the specific dysfunction, treatments
vary, from biological interventions such as hormone replacement in the
treatment of low sexual desire to penile implants or drugs like Viagra
for ED to education and communications training to combat negative
attitudes or misinformation about sex to structured sexual exercises for
learning new behaviors and warding off performance anxieties.

CHAPTER 10 • SEXUAL AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS

5.  Is homosexuality a mental disorder? ■ Many myths and
    misunderstandings continue to surround homosexuality. The belief
    that homosexuality is deviant seems to relate more to homophobia
    than to scientific findings. DSM-IV-TR no longer considers
    homosexuality to be a psychological disorder.
6.  How does aging affect the sexual activity of the elderly? ■ Despite
    myths to the contrary, sexuality extends into old age. However,
    sexual dysfunction becomes increasingly prevalent with aging, and
    the frequency of sexual activity typically declines.
7.  What causes gender identity disorder, and how is it treated? ■
    Specified GID involves strong and persistent crossgender
    identification. Transsexuals feel a severe psychological conflict
    between their sexual self-concepts and their genders. Children with
    this problem identify with members of the opposite gender, deny
    their own physical attributes, and often cross-dress. ■ Some

transsexuals seek sex-conversion surgery, although behavioral therapies
are increasingly being used. For children, treatment generally includes
the parents and is behavioral in nature.

8.  What are the paraphilias, what causes them, and how are they
    treated? ■ The paraphilias are of three types, characterized by

<!-- -->

(1) a preference for nonhuman objects for sexual arousal, (2) repetitive
    sexual activity with nonconsenting partners, or (3) the association
    of real or simulated suffering with sexual activity. ■ Biological
    factors such as hormonal or brain processes

have been studied as the cause of paraphilias, but the results have not
been consistent enough to permit strong conclusions about the role of
biological factors in the paraphilias. Psychological factors also play a
role. ■ Treatments are usually behavioral and are aimed at

eliminating the deviant behavior while teaching more appropriate
behaviors. 9. Is rape an act of sex or aggression? ■ Rape is not listed
in DSM-IV-TR, but it is a serious problem. There appears to be no single
cause of rape, and rapists seem to have different motivations and
personalities. ■ Some researchers feel that sociocultural factors can

encourage rape and violence against women; others believe that
biological factors coupled with sociocultural factors are important in
explaining rape.

Mood Disorders

A

manda was a thirty-nine-year-old homemaker with three children, ages
nine, eleven, and fourteen. Her husband, Jim, was the sales manager for
an auto agency, and the family did well ﬁnancially and lived
comfortably. For years, family life was stable, and no serious problems
existed between family members. The family could be described as
cohesive and loving. However, Jim began to notice that his wife was
becoming more and more unhappy and depressed. She constantly said that
her life lacked purpose. Jim would try to reassure her, pointing out
that they had a nice home and that she had no reason to be unhappy. He
suggested that she ﬁnd some hobbies or socialize more with their
neighbors and friends. But Amanda became progressively more absorbed in
her belief that her life was meaningless. She recalled that her mother
also had bouts of depression and feelings of low self-esteem. After a
while, Amanda no longer bothered to keep the house clean, to cook, or to
take care of the children. At ﬁrst Jim thought she was merely in a "bad
mood" and that it would pass, but as her lethargy deepened, he became
increasingly worried. He thought his wife was either sick or no longer
loved him and the children. Amanda told him that she was tired and that
simple household chores took too much energy. She said that she still
loved Jim and the children but no longer had strong feelings for
anything. Amanda did show some guilt about her inability to take care of
the children and to be a wife, but everything was simply too depressing.
Life was no longer important, and she just wanted to be left alone. At
that point she began to cry uncontrollably. Nothing Jim said could bring
her out of the depression or stop her from crying. He decided that she
had to see a physician, and he made an appointment for her. Amanda is
currently receiving medication and psychotherapy to treat her
depression.

her depression. Consistent with our multipath model, a combination of
factors may be operating to cause depression. Such factors often involve
genetic predisposition, particular early life events, and stressors.
Mood disorders are disturbances in emotions that cause subjective
discomfort, hinder a person's ability to function, or both (see Table
11.1). Unipolar depression, in which only depression occurs, is
characterized by intense sadness, feelings of futility and
worthlessness, and withdrawal from others. Bipolar disorder is
characterized by mania, a condition characterized by elevated mood,
expansiveness, or irritability, often resulting in hyperactivity. It is
usually accompanied by depression. Depression and mania, the two
extremes of mood or affect, can be considered the opposite ends of a
continuum that extends from deep sadness to wild elation. In this
chapter, we first discuss unipolar depression and its symptoms, causes,
and treatments. Then we turn our attention to bipolar disorders. In the
next chapter, on suicide, we examine a very serious problem that has
been strongly linked to depression.

We have all felt depressed or elated at some time during our lives. The
loss of a job or the death of a loved one may result in depression; good
news may make us manic (for example, ecstatic, hyperactive, and brazen).
These reactions may be a sign of a mood disorder if the reactions
pervade every aspect of our lives, persist over a long period of time,
occur for little or no apparent reason, or are markedly out of
proportion to a stressful situation.

Symptoms of Unipolar Depression Symptoms of depression can be seen in
four domains, including affective, cognitive, behavioral, and
physiological. Affective Symptoms The most striking affective symptom of
depression is depressed mood, with feelings of sadness, dejection, and
an excessive and prolonged mourning. Feelings of worthlessness and of
having lost the joy of living are common. Wild weeping may occur as a
general reaction to frustration or anger. Such crying spells do not seem
to be directly correlated with a specific situation, as was the case for
Amanda. To illustrate these affective characteristics, we present the
following statements, made by a severely depressed patient who had
markedly improved after treatment.

Case Study It's hard to describe the state I was in several months ago.
The depression was total---it was as if everything that happened to me
passed through this ﬁlter which colored all experiences. Nothing was
exciting to me. I felt I was no good, completely worthless, and
deserving of nothing. The people who tried to cheer me up were just
living in a different world.

Cognitive Symptoms Besides general feelings of futility, emptiness, and
hopelessness, certain thoughts and ideas, or cognitive symptoms, are
clearly related to depressive reactions. For example, the depressed
person has profoundly pessimistic beliefs about what he or she can do,
about what others can do to help, and about prospects for the future.
Self-accusations of incompetence and general selfdenigration are common,
as are thoughts of suicide. Other symptoms include difficulty in
concentrating and in making decisions. Depression is often reflected in
faulty thinking, such as holding irrational or unjustified beliefs. Ezra
Pound, one of the most brilliant poets of the twentieth century,
suffered a severe depression when he was in his seventies. He bitterly
told an interviewer, "I have lived all my life believing that I knew
something. And then a strange day came and I realized that I knew
nothing, nothing at all. And so words have become empty of meaning.
Everything that I touch, I spoil. I have blundered always" (Darrach,
1976, p. 81). Pound stopped writing for years; for days on end, he
ceased to speak. Behavioral Symptoms A person with depression often
shows behavioral symptoms such as social withdrawal and lowered work
productivity. Amanda felt constantly tired and complained that she had
no energy. This low energy level is one of the dominant behavioral
symptoms of depression, and it has been found to distinguish depressed
individuals from nondepressed individuals (Christensen & Duncan, 1995).
Depressed persons often show little motivation and exhibit anhedonia, or
a loss of the capacity to derive pleasure from normally pleasant
experiences. Other symptoms include sloppy or dirty clothing, unkempt
hair, and lack of concern for personal cleanliness. Speech is reduced
and slow, and responses may be limited to short phrases. This slowing
down of all bodily movements, expressive gestures, and

epression is accompanied by anxiety 45 to 75 percent of the time
(Gorman, 1996; Watson et al., 1995). Because anxiety and depression
occur in family lines with high incidences of these disorders, mood
disorders and anxiety may share genetic vulnerabilities and etiologies.

CHAPTER 11 • MOOD DISORDERS

spontaneous responses is called psychomotor retardation. Although
psychomotor retardation is typical, some people suffering from
depression manifest an agitated state and symptoms of restlessness.
Physiological Symptoms The following physiological or somatic symptoms
frequently accompany depression: 1. Appetite and weight changes. During
depression, some people may experience either increased or decreased
eating or weight changes. Those who constantly eat may do so even if
they are not hungry. For others, a loss of appetite often stems from the
person's lack of interest in eating; food seems tasteless. In severe
depression, weight loss can become life threatening. 2. Constipation.
The person may not have bowel movements for days at a time.

DEPRESSION SLOWS A MUSE Ezra Pound (1885--1972), American poet and
expatriate, developed severe depression later in life and at one point
was institutionalized. During his depression, he became extremely
pessimistic and derogated much of his own work. For a time, he even
stopped speaking and writing.

3.  Sleep disturbance. Difficulty in falling asleep, waking up early,
    waking up erratically during the night, insomnia, and nightmares
    leave the person exhausted and tired during the day. Many dread the
    arrival of night because it represents a major fatigue-producing
    battle to fall asleep. Some depressed people, however, show
    hypersomnia, or excessive sleep. They often feel continually tired
    despite excessive sleep.
4.  Disruption of the normal menstrual cycle in women. The disruption is
    usually a lengthening of the cycle, and the woman may skip one or
    several periods. The volume of menstrual flow may decrease.
5.  Aversion to sexual activity. Many people report that their sexual
    arousal dramatically declines. The core symptoms of severe unipolar
    depression are the same for children and adolescents, although the
    prominence of characteristic symptoms may change with age. In a
    longitudinal study of adolescents who experienced unipolar
    depression as they progressed into adulthood, depressive symptoms
    were found to vary considerably (Lewinsohn, Pettit, Joiner, &
    Seeley, 2003). However, certain symptoms, such as somatic
    complaints, irritability, and social withdrawal, are particularly
    common in children, whereas psychomotor retardation, hypersomnia,
    and delusions are more common in adolescence and adulthood (American
    Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Table 11.2 compares the symptoms
    for depression and mania. Mania is discussed more fully later in the
    chapter.

CRITERIA FOR DSM DIAGNOSIS OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER Presence of a
major depressive (but not manic) episode, which includes: A. Five (or
more) of the following symptoms present during the same two-week period
with at least one that includes depressed mood or loss of pleasure: 1.
depressed mood most of the day, almost every day 2. markedly diminished
interest or pleasure in all, or nearly all, activities 3. signiﬁcant
weight loss when not dieting or weight gain or decrease or increase in
appetite almost every day 4. insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day 5.
psychomotor agitation or retardation almost every day 6. fatigue or loss
of energy nearly every day 7. feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate
guilt nearly every day 8. reduced ability to think or concentrate, or
indecisiveness, nearly every day 9. recurrent thoughts of death or
suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt or a speciﬁc plan for committing
suicide B. The symptoms cause clinically signiﬁcant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other functioning. Source:

Diagnosis and Classiﬁcation of Depressive Disorders In the DSM,
depressive disorders are also called unipolar depression because of
absence of mania. Depressive disorders are divided into major depressive
disorder and dysthymic disorder. In order to receive the diagnosis of
major depressive disorder, one must have experienced a major depressive
episode or a major instance of depression. The criteria for major
depressive episode are provided in Table 11.3. About one-half of those
who experience a depressive episode eventually have another episode. In
general, the earlier the age of onset, the more likely is a recurrence
(Reus, 1988). If a disorder is characterized by depressed mood but does
not meet the criteria for major depression, dysthymic disorder may be
diagnosed. In dysthymic disorder (or dysthymia), the depressed mood is
chronic and relatively continual. Typical symptoms include pessimism or
guilt, loss of interest, poor appetite or overeating, low self-esteem,
chronic fatigue, social withdrawal, or concentration difficulties.
Unlike major depression, which may continue from a couple of weeks to
several months, dysthymia may last for years, although the symptoms are
often not as severe (Klein et al., 1998). Each year, about 10 percent of
individuals with dysthymia go on to have a first major depressive
episode. In dysthymia, the depressive symptoms are present most of the
day and for more days than not during a two-year period (or, for
children and adolescents, a one-year period). Symptom Features and
Speciﬁers To be more precise about the nature of mood disorders,
DSM-IV-TR has listed certain characteristics that may be associated with
these disorders. Specifiers may be used to more precisely describe a
major depressive episode. These specifiers may include references to the
severity, presence or absence of psychotic symptoms (such as
hallucinations or delusions), remission status, and other notable
features of the depression---for example, (1) melancholia

depressive disorders disorders that include major depressive disorder
and dysthymic disorder with no history of a manic episode; also called
unipolar depression major depressive disorder

a major depressive episode whose symptoms include a depressed mood or a
loss of interest or pleasure, weight loss or gain, sleep difﬁculties,
fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, inability to concentrate, and
recurrent thoughts of death dysthymic disorder (dysthymia)

depressed mood which is chronic and relatively continual and does not
meet the criteria for major depression

controversy

When Is One Depressed?

B

ecause of the high rates of mental disorders in general and depression
in particular, a controversy exists over the very deﬁnition of whether a
condition is a disorder or a mild, unpleasant feeling ("New Report Opens
Old Debate," 2005). For example, if a person ﬁts the minimum ﬁve DSM
criteria (see Table 11.3) for unipolar depression, the person is deﬁned
as having a disorder. However, if someone has met four but not ﬁve, is
that person free of a mental disorder? In some cases, a person may be
diagnosed as having dysthymia, which is milder but more chronic than
unipolar depression. Those who favor inclusion of even mild conditions
fear that ignoring and not treating less serious conditions is unwise.
Mental disorders may be similar to physical health disorders. In
physical health, one can have serious diseases (for example, cancer and
heart disease), as well as less serious conditions that require
attention and treatment (for example, colds and ﬂu and skin diseases).
Shouldn't the same be true of mental disorders in which a person may not
be clinically depressed (according to DSM criteria) but may have low
self-esteem, may be unable to effectively work, may feel miserable, and
so forth? Advocates of exclusion of mild cases, however, believe that
the

ﬁeld should not include the wide range of bad feelings, poor judgments,
and faulty habits in the domain of mental disorders ("New Report Opens
Old Debate," 2005). The controversy is also fueled by ﬁndings that many
of the DSM disorders are actually dimensional rather than categorical in
nature (see Hankin, Fraley, Lahey, & Waldman, 2005; Prisciandaro &
Roberts, 2005). That is, depression and depressive symptoms are a matter
of degree rather than of being present or absent. Thus the DSM practice
of categorizing behaviors as indicators of a disorder is arbitrary
because people have the behaviors to varying degrees. The controversy
has implications for research and science (what constitutes a disorder?)
as well as for policy considerations (should mild disorders be covered
in health-care plans?). For Further Consideration 1. Should the
deﬁnition of mental disorders be narrow (that is, include only severe
disorders) or broad (that is, include even mild disorders)? 2. What are
the positive and negative consequences or strengths and weaknesses of
using different deﬁnitions?

(loss of pleasure, lack of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, depression
that is worse in the morning, early morning awakening, excessive guilt,
weight loss); (2) catatonia, characterized by motoric immobility (taking
a posture and not moving), extreme agitation (excessive motor activity),
negativism (resistance to changing positions), or mutism; (3) postpartum
onset (occurring within four weeks of childbirth), or (4) seasonal
pattern (occurring during certain times or seasons of the year). In a
seasonal pattern, moods are accentuated during certain times. For
example, many depressed people find the morning more depressing than the
evening POSTPARTUM PSYCHOSIS "Postpartum onset" occurs in about 13
percent of mothers (O'Hara, 2003), and Andrea Yates, who drowned her ﬁve
children, built her defense case on this mood disorder. Why do you think
that postpartum psychosis occurs?

Unipolar Depression

(Lehmann, 1985). Many individuals also find winter, when days are
shorter and darker, more depressing than summer. In seasonal affective
disorder (SAD), serious cases of depression fluctuate according to the
season. Proposed explanations include the possibility that SAD is an
abnormal body response to seasonal changes in the length of the day,
that the dark days of winter may bring about hormonal changes in the
body that somehow affect depression levels, and that disruption of the
body's circadian rhythm produces mood fluctuations (Lee et al., 1998).
SAD appears to be related to the photoperiod (hours from sunrise to
sunset) rather than to daily hours of sunshine, mean daily temperature,
or total daily radiation (Young, Meaden, Fogg, Cherin, & Eastman, 1997).
In some cases of recurrent major depresSEASONAL PATTERNS OF DEPRESSION
In seasonal affective disorder (SAD), sion, the onset, end, or change of
an episode depressive symptoms vary with the seasons. One theory for
this is that during coincides with a particular time of the year. For
winter, reduced daylight affects hormone levels, which may induce
depression. The example, one man regularly became depressed people in
this photo are receiving light therapy at the Light Lounge, which
exposes after Christmas. Interestingly, "light therapy" them to
specially designed light boxes. The treatment appears to be helpful in

believe that most people feel happier during the a day, especially
during winter, appears to be summer than winter? helpful for many
individuals with SAD (Oren & Rosenthal, 2001), as may vacations to sunny
parts of the country. An analysis of randomized, controlled trials
suggests that bright light treatment for SAD and bright light for
nonseasonal depression are as beneficial as treatment with
antidepressant medications (Golden et al., 2005).

Prevalence of Unipolar Depression

Prevalence

Depression is the most common complaint of individuals seeking mental
health care (Gotlib, 1992; Strickland, 1992). It also ranks among the
top ten causes of worldwide disability and is a leading cause of
absenteeism and diminished productivity in the workplace (U.S. Surgeon
General, 1999). Nearly 15 million Americans will experience unipolar
depression this year. In the large-scale survey of more than 43,000
adults in the United States, twelve-month prevalence rates (the
proportion of people having depression during a twelveBipolar One and
Bipolar Two Unipolar month period) and lifetime prevalence rates (the
proportion of 20 20 people who develop the disorder at some point in
their lives) 16.2 were determined. The prevalences of twelve-month and

(President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003). Among U.S.
college students, one survey found that over half indicated that they
had experienced depression, 9 percent had had thoughts of suicide, and 1
percent had attempted suicide since the beginning of college (Furr,
Westefeld, McConnell, & Jenkins, 2001). In fact, the suicide risk of
depressed persons is at least eight times higher than that of the
general population (Nitzkin & Smith, 2004). Depression is also very
costly. About \$43 billion annually is spent on health-care services and
lost workdays in the United States because of depression (Nitzkin &
Smith, 2004).

Over the years, a number of different explanations have been proposed to
account for depression. Consistent with our multipath approach, research
seems to show that various biological, psychological, social, and
sociocultural factors interact in complex ways to cause unipolar
depression, as shown in Figure 11.2.

Biological Dimension Biological approaches to the causes of mood
disorders generally focus on genetic predisposition, physiological
dysfunction, or combinations of the two. The Role of Heredity There is
now overwhelming evidence that mood disorders carry significant genetic
components whose ultimate phenotypic expression is highly dependent on
environmental factors (Leonardo & Hen, 2006). Compared with bipolar
disorder (discussed later), major depression is much more heterogeneous
(that is, symptoms and causes seem to vary a great deal), and the
contribution of environmental factors is larger than that of genetic
factors (Kato, 2007). Depression tends to run in families, and the same
type of disorder is generally found among members of the same family
(Goldberg, 2006). As we have noted in earlier chapters, one way to
assess the role of heredity is to compare the incidence of disorders
among the biological and adoptive families of people who were adopted
early in life. If heredity is more important, then biological families
(which contributed the genetic makeup) should show a high incidence of
the disorders. If environment is more important, then adoptive families
(which provided the early

environment) should show a high incidence. The results of such a
comparison indicate that the incidence of mood disorders is
significantly higher among the biological families than among the
adoptive families; the latter showed an incidence similar to that of the
general population (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a; Levinson,
2006). Finally, when one twin has unipolar depression, what is the
likelihood that the cotwin will have the same disorder? Monozygotic or
identical twins share 100 percent of their genes, whereas dizygotic
twins share about 50 percent of their genes. Studies of monozygotic and
dizygotic twins reveal a significantly higher concordance rate for
depressive symptoms among monozygotic than among dizygotic twins (McGue
& Christensen, 1997). Goodwin and Guze (1984) believe the concordance
rate for unipolar depression is about 40 percent for monozygotic twins
and 11 percent for dizygotic twins, which supports a genetic
interpretation (Goodwin & Guze, 1984). Interestingly, concordance is
higher for female than male twins, perhaps indicating gender differences
in heritability (Goldberg, 2006). Neurotransmitters and Mood Disorders
But how is heredity involved in major mood disorders? Research shows
that dysfunctions in neurotransmission in the brain, perhaps influenced
by heredity, are associated with depression. Neurotransmitter
substances, including norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, help
transmit nerve impulses from one neuron to another. Nerve impulses are
transmitted from neuron to neuron across synapses, which are small gaps
between the axon (or transmitting end) of one neuron and the dendrites
(or receiving end) of a receptor neuron. The amount of neurotransmitter
substances affects transmission of the impulses from neuron to neuron.
The availability of these substances for neurotransmission is affected
by reuptake, or the reabsorption of the substances, and by chemical
reactions that break down the substances. Thus reuptake and chemical
depletion have the effect of reducing neural transmission. The evidence
for the importance of the level of neurotransmitters in depression comes
from a variety of sources. Some findings were made accidentally. For
example, it was discovered that when the drug reserpine was used in
treating hypertension, many patients became depressed. (Reserpine
depletes the level of neurotransmitters in the brain.) Similarly, the
drug iproniazid, given to tubercular patients, elevated the mood of
those who were depressed. (Iproniazid inhibits the destruction of
neurotransmitters.) More recently, studies of the effects of
antidepressant medication also implicated neurotransmission.
Antidepressant medications appear to increase the level of
neurotransmitters. One group, the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs),
blocks the effects of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in breaking down the
neurotransmitters. Another group, the tricyclic drugs, block the
reuptake of certain transmitter substances. Fluoxetine (Prozac) seems to
block the reuptake of serotonin, leaving more available serotonin.
Several hypotheses have been proposed for problems in
neurotransmission: 1. Depression may be caused by a deficit of specific
neurotransmitters at brain synapses; similarly, mania is presumed to be
caused by an oversupply of these substances (Bunney, Pert, Rosenblatt,
Pert, & Gallaper, 1979). 2. To travel from one neuron to another, an
electrical impulse must release neurotransmitters that stimulate the
receiving neuron. The problem may not be the amount of neurotransmitter
made available by the sending neuron but rather a dysfunction in the
reception of the neurotransmitter by the receiving neuron (Sulser,
1979). 3. Drugs that raise the level of neurotransmitters in the synapse
trigger such increases immediately, yet the alleviation of depressive
symptoms may be delayed for several weeks after this increase. This
delay may indicate that other factors, such as membrane responses to
neurotransmitters, are also important in depression (Rivas-Vazquez &
Blais, 1997). 4. Transporter proteins regulate the concentration of
neurotransmitters in synapses and therefore have effects on a receiving
neuron's receptor. Reduced serotonin transporter and dopamine
transporter proteins may decrease serotonin's "feelgood" effects (Hariri
& Brown, 2006).

CHAPTER 11 • MOOD DISORDERS

Brain Structures Davidson, Pizzagalli, Nitschke, and Putnam (2002)
believe that persons with depression often display their depression in
inappropriate contexts. It is not so much the reaction that is unusual
but the context in which it occurs. For example, great sadness may be
appropriate after the death of a loved one, but a severe period of
mourning extending for years is an example of context-inappropriate
emotional responding. Because the prefrontal region, amygdala, and
hippocampus of the brain are involved in emotional regulation,
investigators have been searching for possible leads. In depression,
abnormalities in activation of prefrontal regions in depression have
been frequently reported. Recent reports have documented decreased
activation in these brain areas in patients with major depressive
disorder. The reduction in activation appears to be at least partially a
function of a reduction or shrinking of gray matter in the brain as
revealed by magnetic resonance imaging-derived measures (Leonardo & Hen,
2006). It is also possible that depression disorders can be produced by
abnormalities in many different parts of the circuitry of the brain. The
specific subtype, symptom profile, and affective abnormalities may
systematically vary with the brain location and nature of the
abnormality (Davidson et al., 2002). Whether mood disorders are caused
by a deficiency in the production of neurotransmitter substances, by a
blunted receptor response, by a more general dysregulation in
neurotransmission, or by other brain abnormalities cannot be resolved at
this time. It is also possible that no one cause will be isolated,
especially if depression is a heterogeneous collection of subtypes of
disorders with differing biological and environmental precursors (Mann,
1989). Furthermore, the interaction effects between one's genetic makeup
and stress increase the complexities in etiological explanations.
Abnormal Cortisol Levels Considerable interest has also focused on
possible abnormalities in neuroendocrine regulation in depression.
People experiencing depression tend to have high levels of cortisol, a
hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex. Studies in different countries
have shown that people with depression register higher blood levels of
cortisol than are found in nondepressed people (World Health
Organization, 1987) and that prognosis for recovery is poorer when these
levels are not suppressed (Reus, 1988). Furthermore, in a study of rats
that were given repeated injections of the hormone corticosterone, which
is believed to simulate chronic stress, depression-like behaviors were
found (Kalynchuk, Gregus, Boudreau, & Perrot-Sinal, 2004). The
investigators believe that brain structure functioning particularly in
the hippocampus area may be affected. Whether cortisol influences
depression or is produced by depression or some other factor, however,
is still unclear, especially because some studies do not show increased
cortisol levels among depressed persons (Cowen, 2002). A somewhat
different hypothesis has been proposed by Gillespie and Nemeroff (2007).
They observe that many individuals with depression have had early life
traumas or stressors such as child abuse, neglect, or loss of a parent.
Their belief is that exposure to stress during early development affects
the cortisol and the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. This
makes one more prone to depression in later life, especially among those
who have genetic vulnerability. Thus stress, time of onset of stress,
and genetic predisposition may interact in causing depression. REM Sleep
Disturbances Findings of a different sort have also aroused interest in
the biological or physiological processes of depression. For example,
the sleep patterns of adults with depression differ from those of other
people, particularly during rapideye-movement (REM) sleep. (There are
several stages of sleep; during REM sleep, the eyes move rapidly, and
dreaming occurs.) Depression is linked with a relatively rapid onset of,
and an increase in, REM sleep (Goodwin & Guze, 1984). Moreover, reducing
the REM sleep of persons with depression seems to help (Vogel, Vogel,
McAbee, & Thurmond, 1980). Why sleep patterns are linked to depression
is unclear. Monroe, Thase, and Simons (1992) found that some patients in
depression experienced severe, acute life stress, whereas others did
not. REM latency (that is, the time before REM occurs during sleep) was
short among the individuals who did not experience severe life stress.
It may be that those with reduced REM latency have a lower threshold for
the development of depression in that less stress is needed to affect
depression.

Etiology of Unipolar Depression

313

SLEEP DISTURBANCES AND DEPRESSION Sleep patterns have been linked to
depression. For example, rapid eye movement during sleep occurs more
often among those who have depression than among those who do not. The
reasons for this are unclear. Here, a researcher is monitoring a man's
sleep. Can you ﬁnd reasons for depression being associated with sleep
disturbances?

In our discussion of how genetic effects may be reflected in
neurotransmission, neuroendocrine regulation, or brain structure
abnormalities, it must be kept in mind that the deviations found in
persons with depression provide us with possible leads on causes of
depression. However, these deviations may simply be a byproduct or
correlate of depression and not the cause of depression. With the
ongoing advances in research and technologies, we are continuing to find
more precisely the biological contributors to depression.

Psychological Dimension The biological contributors we just discussed
interact in some way with life experiences to cause depression. A number
of psychological theories have been proposed to account for the life
experiences that lead to depression. In this section we look at the
psychodynamic, behavioral, and cognitive theories of depression.
Psychodynamic Explanations The psychodynamic explanation of depression
focuses mainly on two concepts: separation and anger. Separation may
occur when a spouse, lover, child, parent, or significant other dies or
leaves for one reason or another. But depression cannot always be
correlated with the immediate loss of a loved one, and for those
instances, Freud used the construct of "symbolic loss." That is to say,
the depressed person may perceive any form of rejection or reproach as
symbolic of an earlier loss. For example, the withdrawal of affection or
support or a rejection can induce depression. Freud (1917/1955) believed
this was especially true because depressed people are fixated at the
oral stage and excessively dependent. Freud also believed that a person
in depression fails to follow through the normal process of mourning,
which he called "grief or mourning work." In this process, the mourner
consciously recalls and expresses memories about the lost person in an
attempt to undo the loss. In addition, the mourner is flooded with two
strong sets of feelings: anger and guilt. The anger, which arises from
the sense of being deserted, can be very strong. The mourner may also be
flooded with guilt feelings about real or imagined sins committed
against the lost person. Psychodynamic explanations of depression have
strongly emphasized the dynamics of anger. Many patients in depression
have strong hostile or angry feelings, and some clinicians believe that
getting clients to express their anger reduces their depression. Such a
belief has led some to speculate that depression is really anger turned
against the self (Freud, 1917/1955). Freud suggested that, when a person
experiences a loss (symbolic or otherwise), he or she may harbor
feelings of resentment and hostility toward the lost person, in addition
to feelings of love

SEPARATION AS A CAUSE OF DEPRESSION Harry and Margaret Harlow (1962)
found that infant monkeys reacted with fear and despair when separated
from their mothers. Even monkeys raised with surrogate mothers (in this
case, a wire frame covered with terrycloth) exhibited anxiety and
despair when separated from them. The psychodynamic perspective asserts
that separation can be a cause of depression. Do you think separation
anxiety and depression are genetically determined?

314

CHAPTER 11 • MOOD DISORDERS

and affection. Freud's ideas seem to be important for several reasons.
First, he stimulated the development of other psychodynamic approaches
to depression. One such approach, interpersonal therapy, has been found
to be effective in depression. Second, psychodynamic approaches may well
specify some, but not all, of the conditions that elicit depression.
Third, its emphasis on early life experiences as critical to depression
appears to be important, as discussed later. There have been relatively
few empirical tests of psychodynamic ideas. One longitudinal study
(Stroebe & Stroebe, 1991) examined whether persons whose spouses had
died were less depressed if they directly confronted the loss (that is,
performed grief work) rather than avoided dealing with it. Results were
equivocal in that performing grief work was inversely related to
adjustment for LOSS AS A SOURCE OF DEPRESSION Mourning over the death of
a loved widowers but not for widows. Other studies (such one occurs in
all cultures and societies, as illustrated by these women mourning as
Paykel, 1982) have shown that loss (death or at the funerals of 13
members of an Iraqi tae kwon do team, kidnapped and separation) of
significant others in one's life can killed in Iraq. However, in most
cultures, severe and incapacitating depression rarely continues after
the ﬁrst three months. If it does continue longer, then a precipitate
depression. However, stressors other depressive disorder may have
developed. What other characteristics or symptoms than the loss of a
significant other may bring about would help one to distinguish between
"normal" grief and a depressive disorder? depression, and the loss of a
significant other can lead to disorders other than depression, such as
anxiety and substance abuse. Behavioral Explanations Behaviorists also
see the separation or loss of a significant other as important in
depression. However, behaviorists tend to see reduced reinforcement as
the cause, rather than fixation or symbolic grief, which they view as
untestable concepts. When a loved one is lost, an accustomed level of
reinforcement (whether affection, companionship, pleasure, material
goods, or services) is immediately withdrawn. The survivor can no longer
obtain the support or encouragement of the lost person, and the
survivor's level of activity (talking, expressing ideas, working,
joking, engaging in sports, going out on the town) diminishes markedly
in the absence of this reinforcement. Thus many behaviorists view
depression as a product of inadequate or insufficient reinforcers in a
person's life, leading to a reduced frequency of behavior that
previously was positively reinforced (Lewinsohn, 1974; Wells, Sturm,
Sherbourne, & Meredith, 1996). Lewinsohn's model of depression is
perhaps the most comprehensive behavioral explanation of depression
(Lewinsohn, 1974; Lewinsohn, Hoberman, Teri, & Hautzinger, 1985). Along
with the reinforcement view of depression, Lewinsohn suggested three
sets of variables that may enhance or hinder a person's access to
positive reinforcement. 1. The number of events and activities that are
potentially reinforcing to the person. This number depends very much on
individual differences and varies with the biological traits and
experiential history of the person. For example, age, gender, or
physical attributes may determine the availability of reinforcers.
Handsome people are more likely to receive positive attention than are
nondescript people. 2. The availability of reinforcements in the
environment. Harsh environments, such as regimented institutions or
remote isolated places, reduce reinforcements. 3. The instrumental
behavior of the individual. The number of social skills a person can
exercise to bring about reinforcement is important. People in depression
lack social behaviors that can elicit positive reinforcements. They
interact with fewer people, respond less, have very few positive
reactions, and initiate less conversation. They also feel more
uncomfortable in social situations (Youngren &

Etiology of Unipolar Depression

315

Lewinsohn, 1980), and they elicit depression in others (Hammen & Peters,
1978). A low rate of positive reinforcement in any of these three
situations can lead to depression. The occurrence of stress also plays a
strong role in the theory. Lewinsohn and his colleagues (1985) believe
that an antecedent event such as stress disrupts the predictable and
well-established behavior patterns of people's lives. Such disruptions
then reduce the rate of positive reinforcements or increase aversive
experiences. If individuals are unable to reverse the impact of the
stress, they begin to have a heightened state of self-awareness (for
example, self-criticism, negative expectancies, and loss of
self-confidence) and to experience depressed affect. With depressed
moods, persons then have a more difficult time functioning
appropriately, which makes them further vulnerable to depression. Thus
Lewinsohn's model attempts to cover not only behavioral elements but
also cognitive and emotional consequences. Cognitive Explanations
Cognitively oriented psychologists have proposed that the way people
think, rather than low rates of positive reinforcement, can cause
depression. In their view, depressed persons have negative thoughts and
specific errors in thinking that result in pessimism, negative views of
themselves, feelings of hopelessness, and depression (Emmelkamp, 2004).
Depressed people often perceive themselves as inept, unworthy, and
incompetent, regardless of reality. If they do succeed at anything, they
are likely to dismiss it as pure MAGNIFICATION OF EVENTS According to
cognitive luck or to forecast eventual failure. Hence a cognitive

depression as a primary disturbance in thinking rather than a basic
disturbance in mood. How persons structure and interpret their
experiences determines their affective states. If individuals see a
situation as unpleasant, they will feel an unpleasant mood. According to
Beck, patients with depression have Did You Know? schemas---cognitive
frameworks that help organize and interpret information---that set them
up for depression. In one study, for example, Crowson and Cromwell

1.  Arbitrary inference. The person with depression tends to draw
    conclusions that are not supported by evidence. For example, a woman
    may conclude that "people dislike me" just because no one speaks to
    her on the bus or in the elevator.
2.  Selected abstraction. The individual takes a minor incident or

4.  Magnification and minimization. The individual tends to exaggerate
    (magnify) limitations and difficulties and play down (minimize)
    accomplishments, achievements, and capabilities. Asked to evaluate
    personal strengths and weaknesses, the person lists many
    shortcomings or unsuccessful efforts but finds it almost impossible
    to name any achievements. People with low self-esteem may have
    experienced much disapproval in the past from significant others,
    such as parents. Their parents or significant others may have
    responded to them by punishing failures and not rewarding successes
    or by holding unrealistically high expectations or standards, as in
    the following case.

Case Study Paul was a twenty-year-old college senior majoring in
chemistry. He ﬁrst came to the student psychiatric clinic complaining of
headaches and a vague assortment of somatic problems. Throughout the
interview, Paul seemed severely depressed and unable to work up enough
energy to talk with the therapist. Even though he had maintained a B+
average, he felt like a failure and was uncertain about his future. His
parents had always had high expectations for Paul, their eldest son, and
had transmitted these feelings to him from his earliest childhood. His
father, a successful thoracic surgeon, had his heart set on Paul's
becoming a doctor. The parents saw academic success as very important,
and Paul did exceptionally well in school. Although his teachers praised
him for being an outstanding student, his parents seemed to take his
successes for granted. In fact, they often made statements such as "You
can do better." When Paul failed at something, his parents would make it
obvious to him that they not only were disappointed but also felt
disgraced. This pattern of punishment for failures without recognition
of successes, combined with his parents' high expectations, led to the
development of Paul's extremely negative self-concept.

Evidence of a link between cognition and depression comes from studies
of memory bias. When people with depression are given lists of words
that vary in emotional content, they tend to recall more negative words
than do their control group counterparts. This may indicate a tendency
to attend to, and remember, negative and depressing events (Mineka &
Sutton, 1992). Even individuals who have recovered from depression show
a greater tendency toward negative cognitive styles than is found among
individuals who have never been depressed (Hedlund & Rude, 1995). They
presumably have developed negative schemas. Cognitive or perceptual bias
was also found when individuals were asked to identify happy faces from
a movie of morphed faces that varied in degrees of happiness (Joormann,
2006). Those with major depression, compared with nondepressed controls,
required greater facial intensities to identify happy faces. Although
the cognitive explanation of depression has merit, it seems too simple.
At times, negative cognitions may be the result, rather than the cause,
of depressed moods, as noted by Hammen (1985). That is, one may first
feel depressed and then, as a result, have negative or pessimistic
thoughts about the world. Hammen also found that a person's schema tends
to mediate the relationship between stress and depression. As discussed
more fully later, stress can lead to depression if a person has
developed a predisposing schema. Another criticism of cognitive
explanations is that many people get depressed, but they do not feel
depressed all the time. Yet negative cognitive styles are often
hypothesized to be stable or enduring.

an acquired belief that one is helpless and unable to affect the
outcomes in one's life

learned helplessness

Cognitive-Learning Approaches: Learned Helplessness and Attributional
Style Martin Seligman (1975; Nolen-Hoeksema, Girgus, & Seligman, 1992)
proposed a unique view of depression based on cognitive learning theory.
The basic assumption of this approach is that both cognitions and
feelings of helplessness are learned and that depression is learned
helplessness---an acquired belief that one is helpless and unable to
affect the outcomes in one's life. People who feel helpless make causal
attributions, or speculations about why they are helpless. These
attributions can be internal or external, stable or unstable, and global
or specific.

Etiology of Unipolar Depression

For instance, suppose that a student in a math course receives the same
low grades regardless of how much he or she has studied. The student may
attribute the low grades to internal or personal factors ("I don't do
well in math because I'm scared of math") or to external factors ("The
teacher doesn't like me, so I can't get a good grade"). The attribution
can also be stable ("I'm the type of person who can never do well in
math") or unstable ("My poor performance is due to my heavy workload").
Additionally, the attribution can be global or specific. A global
attribution ("I'm a poor student") has broader implications for
performance than a specific one ("I'm poor at math but good in other
subjects"). Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale (1978) believe that a
person whose attributions for helplessness are internal, stable, and
global is likely to have more pervasive feelings of depression than
someone whose attributions are external, unstable, and specific.
Attributions have been found to be associated with many aspects of life.
Both the learned helplessness model and the attributional style approach
have generated a great deal of research. There is evidence that people
with depression make "depressive" attributions and feel that their lives
are less controllable than others do (Raps, Peterson, Reinhard,
Abramson, & Seligman, 1982). One study has also shown that negative
self-appraisals by children can predict subsequent changes in level of
depression (Hoffman, Cole, Martin, Tram, & Seroczynski, 2000).
Cognitions and attributions may be important factors in depression, but
the disorder is complex; current models tend to include or explain only
particular facets of depression (Dubovsky & Buzan, 1999; Hammen, 1985).
Helplessness theory and attributions may explain only a certain type of
depression (Abramson, Metalsky, & Alloy, 1989; DeVellis & Blalock,
1992). Interestingly, Lewinsohn, Joiner, and Rohde (2001) have
comparatively tested the cognitive theories of Beck and Seligman. Both
theories propose a diathesis-stress process. The diathesis involves
vulnerability because of negative cognitions (Beck) or pessimistic
attributional styles (Seligman). The vulnerability in the presence of
stress (negative life events) results in depression, according to each
theory. In a longitudinal study of adolescents, the investigators
assessed (at Time 1) dysfunctional attitudes and negative attributional
styles, as well as depressive symptoms, stressful life events,
nondepressive diagnoses, past and family history of depression, and
gender. Another assessment was conducted a year later (Time 2). The
researchers wanted to find out which cognitive theory could better
predict the onset of depression from Time 1 to Time 2. They wanted to
control for initial level of depression (Time 1), family history of
depression, and gender, because these three factors have been found to
be related to the subsequent development of depression. Furthermore, it
was important to assess nondepressive diagnosis because, according to
both theories, the cognitive diathesis and stress should influence
depression specifically, not just any disorder. Results tended to
support Beck's theory over that of Seligman. High levels of negative
cognitions coupled with stress predicted subsequent depression. Negative
attributional style did not result in greater depression at high levels
of stress. Only at low levels of stress did negative attributional
styles predict depression (which is somewhat counterintuitive). The
diathesis-stress models did not predict nondepressive disorders. Because
this was a first comparative test of the two theories, further tests are
necessary, using different measures and participant samples.

Social Dimension As noted earlier, some investigators, such as
Lewinsohn, have found that stress significantly affects the occurrence
of depressive disorders. Also mentioned was the fact that exposure to
chronic injections of the hormone corticosterone, which is believed to
simulate chronic stress, resulted in depressive-like behaviors in rats
(Kalynchuk et al., 2004). Because stress has been primarily associated
with interpersonal situations, we focus on stress from social
situations. Stress and Depression The importance of stress, especially
stress that is interpersonal in nature, has been demonstrated for
depression (Hammen, 2006). In a study of individuals' self-reports of
daily stress and depressive moods, stressors

LEARNED HELPLESSNESS AND DEPRESSION According to Seligman, feelings of
helplessness can lead to depression. However, if people can control
their environment and believe in their ability to succeed, they can
begin to lead productive lives again. California Angels' one-handed
baseball pitcher Jim Abbott fought feelings of helplessness and won his
battle with depression. In Seligman's theory, what can be done to alter
feelings of helplessness?

ore people are becoming depressed, especially in western countries. Why
is this so? Seligman and his colleagues (Seligman, Reivich, Jaycox, &
Gillham, 1995) argue that changes in the depression rate were affected
by two cultural shifts in the 1960s and 1970s: a movement to achieve
higher levels of personal satisfaction and freedom and a movement away
from causes greater than the self (for example, parenthood, community,
and God). As the self becomes more important, individuals have difﬁculty
ﬁnding meaning in their lives and are more prone to depression.

318

CHAPTER 11 • MOOD DISORDERS

such as dependency (that is, having to depend on others) and
interpersonal problems (such as having an argument with someone) tended
to occur just before the onset of depressive symptoms (Stader &
Hokanson, 1998). Other studies have shown that severe psychosocial
stress, such as the death of a loved one, a lifethreatening medical
condition, or frustration of major life goals, often precedes the onset
of major depression (Brown & Harris, 1989; Lewinsohn, Hoberman, &
Rosenbaum, 1988; Mazure, 1998; Paykel, 1982). Stress also appears to be
important in relapse---the recurrence of depression after treatment
(Krantz & Moos, 1988; Lewinsohn, Zeiss, & Duncan, 1989). These findings
have led investigators to ask what kinds of stress lead to depression.
Brown and Harris (1989) concluded that (1) severity is important. One
severe stressor is more likely to cause depression than several minor
stressors. In other words, several minor stressors do not seem to have
the same effect as one very serious stressor. Moreover, in a survey of
respondents in a study of stress and depressive symptoms, McGonagle and
Kessler (1990) classified stress according to (2) chronicity. Chronic
stress was defined as beginning more than twelve months before the
study; acute stress was defined as stress beginning within twelve months
of the study. The investigators found that chronic stress was more
highly related to depression than was acute stress, even though
respondents rated both types of stress as equally severe. Perhaps stress
that persists for a long time is viewed as being uncontrollable and
stable. There is also evidence that time of (3) onset, or when stress is
experienced, is important. Experiences occurring during childhood may
affect depression in later life. Harsh discipline in childhood is
associated with levels of depression among people who experience a major
depressive episode (Lara, Klein, & Kasch, 2000). Thus vulnerability may
arise from early experiences in the family. Finally, the particular (4)
type of stress is important to consider. For example, stressors such as
loss and humiliation are associated with depression, whereas others,
such as exposure to dangerous events, are more likely to be associated
with anxiety (Kendler, Hettema, Butera, Gardner, & Prescott, 2003). Why
do some people who encounter stress develop depression, whereas others
do not? People may differ in their degrees of vulnerability to
depression. The vulnerability may be caused by biological factors,
psychosocial factors, or both. Hammen, Davilla, Brown, Ellicott, and
Gitlin (1992) argue that the relationship between stress and depression
is complex and interactive. In a longitudinal study of people with
unipolar depression, the investigators found evidence that having
dysfunctional parents who create stressful conditions in the family may
influence an individual's vulnerability to stress. Individuals from such
families may fail to acquire adaptive skills and positive self-images,
which in turn brings on more stress, which can trigger depression. Not
only does stress cause depression, but depression can also cause stress.
Hammen (2006) has found that individuals who are depressed, compared
with those who are nondepressed, are more likely to have stressors that
are within their control (for example, initiating an argument) rather
than outside of their control (for example, cancer occurring in a
sibling). She believes that depressed persons may create and generate
stress for themselves. Thus the research suggests that stress and
depression are bidirectional. Finally, stress itself may activate a
genetic predisposition for depression. Having a gene for depression may
not cause depression. Rather, certain hereditary and environmental
influences (for example, stress) in combination can elicit major
depression (Caspi et al., 2003). This explanation can also account for
the facts that people with genetic predispositions may not show major
depression (a certain stressor is absent) and that individuals
encountering the same stressors as a depressed person do not suffer from
depression (they do not have the hereditary predisposition). Adequate
social support or resources may act as a buffer against depression when
we are exposed to stress. To study the role of social resources in
stress and depression, Holahan and Moos (1991) collected data on
individuals at the beginning and end of a four-year period. Information
was included on personality characteristics, family support (such as
helpfulness of family members), stress, and depression. At the end

MAJOR STRESSORS AND DEPRESSION Stress can lead to depression. The
frustration of major life goals, ﬁnancial insecurity, loss of social
supports and relationships often precede depression. Here, people line

by the subprime mortgage crisis, has suffered thousands of layoffs in
2008.

of the four-year period, persons with positive personality traits and
family support had less depression than those without these
characteristics, even when initial level of depression (during year one)
was controlled. The researchers speculated that personal or family
resources help individuals cope and adjust to stress. A ten-year
follow-up of clients with depression (Moos, Cronkite, & Moos, 1998)
showed that social resources (such as more helpful friends, fewer family
arguments, and sharing activities with friends) were important in
remission. Further evidence of the effects of social support was found
in a study of gay men at risk for AIDS (Hays, Turner, & Coates, 1992),
which assessed their levels of depression, social supports, and
HIV-related symptoms over a one-year period. Results indicated that men
who were more satisfied with their social supports were subsequently
less likely to suffer from depression. Social supports that are more
than just "psychological" and that meet specific needs (e.g., financial
support) are especially beneficial in depression (Knowlton & Latkin,
2007).

Sociocultural Dimension Sociocultural factors include the influence of
culture, race and ethnicity, institutions, social systems, social class
and status, and group membership on depression. A number of
sociocultural factors have been found to be related to depression. They
include socioeconomic factors, culture, race and ethnicity, and gender.
For example, individuals in communities that have high rates of poverty
and that experience high social disorder, including delinquency and drug
use, have increased risk for depression (Cutrona et al., 2005). Cultural
Differences in Symptoms and Treatment As noted by Kleinman (2004),
culture influences the nature of depressive symptoms, the idioms used to
report them, decisions about treatment, doctor-patient interactions, the
likelihood of outcomes such as suicide, and the practices of
professionals. Consequently, some conditions are universal and some
culturally distinct, but all are meaningful within particular contexts.
People from different cultures differ in the extent to which they
display the symptoms listed in DSM-IV-TR. In some cultures, depression
may be experienced largely in somatic or bodily complaints, rather than
in sadness or guilt. Complaints of "nerves" and headaches (in Latino and
Mediterranean cultures), of weakness, tiredness, or "imbalance" (in
Chinese and Asian cultures), of problems of the "heart" (in Middle
Eastern cultures), or of being "heartbroken" (among the Hopi) may reveal
the depressive experience (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a).

320

CHAPTER 11 • MOOD DISORDERS

CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT People from different
cultures differ in the extent to which they display the symptoms listed
in DSM-IV-TR for disorders. Chinese people with depression often exhibit
somatic or bodily complaints instead of depressive symptoms, such as
sadness and depression. Chinese medicine and acupuncture, not
psychotherapy, are often the preferred forms of treatment for this
disorder. Are such treatments effective?

Cross-cultural studies of mood disorders have found that prevalence
rates and manifestation of symptoms vary considerably among different
cultural groups and societies (Goodwin & Guze, 1984). For example,
Native Americans and Southeast Asians living in the United States appear
to have higher rates of depression than are found among other Americans
(Chung & Okazaki, 1991; Vega & Rumbaut, 1991). Why do reactions and
symptoms differ from culture to culture? Some insight into this question
was gained from a study by Greenberger, Chen, Tally, and Dong (2000).
The investigators compared the correlates of depressed mood among
adolescents in China and the United States. In both cultures, "culture
general" stressors such as parents' illness and family economic losses
had similar effects on depressed mood. Cultural differences emerged for
other variables. For instance, the correlations between depressed mood
and poor relationships with parents, as well as poorer academic
achievement, were higher for Chinese than for Americans, perhaps
reflecting the Chinese cultural emphasis on family and achievements.
Culture may even turn out to create distinctive environments for gene
expression and physiological reaction in depression (Kleinman, 2004).
Already, research has shown that one's ethnicity is related to the way
antidepressant drugs are metabolized in the body. Gender and Depression
Besides culture, other important sociocultural factors, such as gender,
have been associated with depression. Depression is far more common
among women than among men, regardless of region of the world, race and
ethnicity, or social class (Strickland, 1992). Although men and women
have about the same rate of bipolar disorder, women's rates of major
depression are twice as high as those for men (Kessler, 2003). In
addition, women are more likely than men to be seen in treatment and to
be diagnosed with depression. Other explanations for this finding are
noted in Table 11.4. First, women may simply be more likely than men to
seek treatment when depressed; this tendency would make the reported
depression rate for women higher, even if the actual male and female
rates were equal. Second, women may be more willing to report their
depression to other people. That is, the gender differences may occur in
self-reported behaviors rather than in actual depression rates. Third,
diagnosticians or the diagnostic system may be biased toward finding
depression among women (Caplan, 1995). And fourth, depression in men may
take other forms and thus be given other diagnoses, such as substance
dependency.

EXPLAINING THE FINDINGS THAT RATES OF DEPRESSION ARE HIGHER AMONG WOMEN
THAN AMONG MEN THE GENDER DIFFERENCES ONLY APPEAR TO BE REAL BECAUSE

• Women may be more likely to seek treatment. • Women may be more
willing to report their depression to other people. • Diagnosticians or
the diagnostic system may be gender biased. • Men may exhibit depression
in different ways and may be given other diagnoses. THE GENDER
DIFFERENCES ARE REAL BECAUSE

• Genetic or hormonal differences between genders may account for higher
depression levels among women. • Women are subjected to gender roles
that may be unfulﬁlling and that limit occupational opportunities. •
Gender roles may lead to feelings of helplessness. • Traditional
feminine roles may be less successful at eliciting positive
reinforcement from others, compared with traditional male roles, which
foster assertive and forceful behavior. • Women may have been subjected
to childhood traumas (sexual abuse, child abuse, neglect) that lead to
depression.

These four possibilities may account for only part of the gender
difference in depression. Evidence indicates that women do have higher
rates of depression than men and that the differences are real rather
than an artifact of self-reports or biases (Rieker & Bird, 2005). The
higher rates seem to occur regardless of age, although the gender gap
appears to be the greatest during reproductive years. Attempts to
explain these differences have focused on physiological or social
psychological factors. Biological factors, such as genetic or hormonal
differences between the sexes, may account for the gender differences in
depression. Heritability of depression appears to be higher among women
than men, as noted earlier (Goldberg, 2006). Hormonal changes occur in
women during puberty, premenstrual periods, pregnancy, and menopause.
These changes may affect systems associated with depression (for
example, the neurotransporter system or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
system), although little research has been conducted on these factors.
Social or psychological factors have also been proposed, one of which is
women's traditional gender role. Women have been encouraged to present
themselves as attractive, sensitive to other people, and passive in
relationships (Strickland, 1992). This subservience to men, combined
with a lack of occupational opportunities, may have produced more
depression in women (Bernard, 1976). Women who fulfill the genderrole
expectations may be more likely than men to experience lack of control
in life situations. They may then attribute their "helplessness" to an
imagined lack of personal worth. Interestingly, women who are not
employed outside the home and who are raising children are particularly
vulnerable to depression (Gotlib, 1992). The traditional feminine gender
role behaviors (gentleness, emotionality, and self-subordination) may
not be so successful in eliciting reinforcement from others as the
assertive and more forceful responses typically associated with males.
Finally, sexual and child abuse has been associated with depression in
later life, which may affect women more than men. In a review of
different explanations for the gender differences in rates of
depression, Nolen-Hoeksema (1987) concluded that none truly accounts for
the observed differences. She hypothesized that the way a person
responds to depressed moods contributes to the severity, chronicity, and
recurrence of depressive episodes. In her view, women tend to ruminate
and amplify their depressive moods, and men tend to dampen or find means
to minimize dysphoria. Nolen-Hoeksema (1991) found that when individuals
tracked their depressed moods and responses to these moods for

CHAPTER 11 • MOOD DISORDERS

GENDER AND DEPRESSION Among the Amish, men and women appear to have
similar rates of depression. Egeland and Hostetter (1983) believe that
gender roles may affect depression rates. Gender roles, such as working
together in the ﬁelds, are similar for Amish men and women and may
account for the lack of gender differences in rates of depression. What
are the implications of the ﬁndings for a genetic or environmental
explanation of depression?

one month, women were more likely than men to ruminate in response to
depressed moods. Those who tended to ruminate had longer periods of
depressed moods, and when tendency to ruminate was statistically
controlled, gender differences in duration of depressed moods
disappeared. Egeland and Hostetter (1983) also speculated that responses
to depressive moods may affect observed rates of depression. In their
study of an Amish religious community in Pennsylvania, they found that
males and females have the same rates of depression. The researchers
noted that because Amish men do not show alcoholism or antisocial
behaviors, their depression cannot be masked. Additionally, Amish women,
like the men, must work outside the home, so engaging in a sick
(depressed) role is discouraged. Although role behavior may help explain
some of the differences in rates of depression between women and men, it
is not clear whether the explanation is enough to account for the vast
differences that have been recorded. The findings suggest that some
aspect of the environment may interact with a woman's biology to account
for the disproportionate incidence of depression among women (U.S.
Surgeon General, 1999).

Treatment for Unipolar Depression What can be done to alleviate
depression? We now turn to various treatment tactics aimed at
depression.

Myth vs Reality Myth: Saint John's wort has been proven to be effective
in alleviating depression. Reality: Saint John's wort (Hypericum
perforatum plant) has been popularly used by consumers to treat
depression. It can be found in the herbal supplement section of most
pharmacies in the United States. Despite its popularity, little rigorous
research has been conducted to establish its effectiveness or possible
side effects. Research, primarily in Germany, has obtained positive
results in alleviating mild to moderate depression with only mild
gastrointestinal side effects. However, most of these studies have had
methodological weaknesses, and basic questions concerning the mechanisms
of action of the substance remain (U.S. Surgeon General, 1999). The
National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (2007)
considers St. John's wort to be an unproven treatment for depression.

Treatment for Unipolar Depression

Biomedical Treatments for Depressive Disorders Biomedical treatments are
interventions that alter the physical or biochemical state of the
patient. They include the use of medication and electroconvulsive
therapy. Medication According to the U.S. Surgeon General (1999),
antidepressant medications are effective across the full range of
severity of depressive episodes, although effectiveness is greater with
less severe depressive episodes. There are four kinds of antidepressant
medication: tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), heterocyclic
antidepressants (HCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Each medication is
designed to heighten the level of a target neurotransmitter at the
neuronal synapse. This heightening can be accomplished by (1) boosting
the neurotransmitter's synthesis, (2) blocking its degradation, (3)
preventing its reuptake from the synapse, or (4) mimicking its binding
to postsynaptic receptors. For example, TCAs (for example, Elavil, or
amitriptyline) seem to block the reuptake of norepinephrine, thereby
leaving more norepinephrine at the synapses. These higher levels of
residual norepinephrine seem to be linked with reduced depressive
symptoms. The tricyclics, however, may cause side effects. Reactions
include drowsiness, insomnia, agitation, fine tremors, blurred vision,
dry mouth, and reduced sexual ability. MAOIs (e.g., Nardil, or
phenelzine) also work by increasing the levels of norepinephrine at the
brain synapses. Rather than blocking reuptake as the tricyclics do, the
MAOIs prevent the MAO enzyme (which is normally found in the body) from
breaking down norepinephrine that is already available at the synapse.
Both MAOIs and tricyclic antidepressants may act in ways more
complicated than previously believed. There is growing suspicion that
these drugs may affect not only the levels of neurotransmitters at
synapses but also the sensitivity of receptors on the receiving
(postsynaptic) neurons. MAOIs are currently prescribed for patients with
depression who have not responded well to treatment with tricyclics. But
MAOIs also have many side effects, including insomnia, irritability,
dizziness, constipation, and impotence. The most serious side effect,
however, is tyramine-cheese incompatibility. One normal function of the
MAO enzyme is to break down tyramine, a substance found in many cheeses,
as well as in some beers, wines, pickled products, and chocolate.
Because the MAOIs interfere with this function, people using these drugs
must severely restrict their intake of tyramine. Failure to do so
triggers the tyramine-cheese reaction, which begins with increased blood
pressure, vomiting, and muscle twitching and can, if untreated, result
in intracranial bleeding, followed by death. Such side effects are a
major drawback of these antidepressant drugs, and careful monitoring of
the patient's reactions is thus absolutely necessary. Another drawback
is that these antidepressant drugs are essentially ineffective during
the first two weeks of use, which is a serious concern, particularly in
cases in which suicide is a danger. As mentioned earlier, the
effectiveness of antidepressant drugs may be caused by changes in the
sensitivity of postsynaptic receptors. These changes in sensitivity,
however, seem to require a couple of weeks to develop. Tricyclics and
MAOIs were used primarily from the 1960s through the 1980s. They have
subsequently fallen out of favor because of their side effects. SSRIs,
which block the reuptake of serotonin, are now increasingly popular. The
SSRIs include the drugs Prozac (fluoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), and
Zoloft (sertraline). They seem to have fewer side effects and to be at
least as effective as the other tricyclics. In fact, SSRIs are "favored"
as the first-line medication for depression because of their ease of
use, more manageable side effects, safety in overdose, and cost (U.S.
Surgeon General, 1999). Many patients report much relief after taking
the medication. However, it should be noted that SSRIs, as well as other
drugs used to treat mood disorders, restore functioning of patients but
may not "cure" them (Delgado & Gelenberg, 2001). One issue that has
recently arisen over the use of certain SSRIs is whether suicide risk,
especially among young people who take the drugs, is increased. Under

Should We Increasingly Turn to Drugs in the Treatment of Depression?

I

n October 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned
physicians, patients, and the general public about the increased risk of
suicide, particularly among children and teenagers, following the
initiation of antidepressant treatment (Berenson, 2006). It ordered drug
companies to add strong warnings to labels of antidepressants. Some feel
that society is overly medicated because we have drugs for all sorts of
conditions and people use medications, perhaps too freely. Others argue
that medications have freed patients from the long hospital stays found
in the past and that newer medications have been increasingly effective
in treatments. What kinds of factors must be considered in addressing
the question of whether people should take antidepressant medications?
Try to answer the following questions. First, how prevalent is
depression? Effective treatment must be found, especially for disorders
that are very common versus those that rarely occur. Second, is
depression a signiﬁcant disorder that has serious consequences? Third,
how effective is the treatment, and what are side effects from the
treatment? Obviously, if treatment is not effective

or has major side effects, its value decreases. Fourth, is the treatment
readily available and relatively inexpensive? All of these factors must
be considered before recommending a particular treatment. With respect
to the third question concerning side effects, one study with more than
sixty-ﬁve thousand patients examined the risk of suicide after
antidepressant medication was used to treat patients (Simon, Savarino,
Operskalski, & Wang, 2006). Suicide attempts and deaths were analyzed
before and after treatment. Results indicated that the risk of suicide
was highest in the month preceding treatment, and there was no evidence
that the risk increased after treatment started. Such a ﬁnding applies
not only to drug treatment but also to psychotherapy (Simon & Savarino,
2007). Another study examined suicide rates for children and adolescents
before and after the FDA warning about possible suicide risks following
the use of SSRI drugs. The study found that prescriptions for SSRI drugs
decreased whereas the suicide rate increased for children and youths
after the FDA warning (Gibbons et al., 2007).

Electroconvulsive Therapy Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is generally
reserved for patients with severe unipolar depression who have not
responded to antidepressant medications. Also known as electroshock
therapy, ECT is a treatment that consists of applying a moderate
electrical voltage to the person's brain for up to half a second. The
patient's response to the voltage is a convulsion (seizure) lasting
thirty to forty seconds, followed by a five- to thirty-minute coma. Most
patients with serious depression show at least a temporary improvement
after about four ECT treatments (Campbell, 1981). The ECT mechanism is
not fully understood; it may operate on neurotransmitters at the
synapses, as do antidepressants. Some of the decrease in symptoms may
also be due to the amnesia that develops for a short time after the
treatment. One major advantage of ECT is that the response to treatment
is relatively fast (Gangadhar, Kapur, & Kalyanasundaram, 1982). In fact,
many clinicians believe that ECT is the most rapid and effective
treatment for major depressive episodes (Weiner & Krystal, 2001), and
the U.S. Surgeon General (U.S. Surgeon General, 1999) considers ECT
among those treatments that are effective for severe depression.
However, the treatment is not without side effects, including headaches,
confusion, and memory loss. And many patients are terrified of ECT. In
about one of every thousand cases, serious medical complications occur
(Goldman, 1988). For these and other reasons, ECT is controversial, and
critics have urged that it be banned as a form of treatment.

Psychotherapy and Behavioral Treatments for Depressive Disorders Because
the use of antidepressant medication or ECT involves a number of
disadvantages, clinicians have sought other approaches to either
supplement or replace medical treatment of depression. A variety of
psychological forms of treatment have been used, such as psychoanalysis,
behavior therapy, group psychotherapy, and family therapies---all with
some success. Treatment strategies reflect the theoretical orientation
of the therapists. For example, psychodynamic therapists attempt to help
their clients gain insight into

Treatment for Unipolar Depression

unconscious and unresolved feelings of separation or anger. To this end,
the therapist interprets the client's free associations and reports of
dreams, resistances, and transferences (see Chapter 2). Psychodynamic
therapies of depression have not been rigorously studied, but some
investigations suggest that brief dynamic therapy appears to be
effective in reducing the depressive symptoms of patients (Gabbard,
2001). In contrast to psychodynamic therapists, behavioral therapists
may believe that reduced reinforcement is responsible for depression.
They would attempt to teach clients to increase their exposure to
pleasurable events and activities and to improve their social skills and
interactions. One type of behavioral treatment, called behavioral
activation, has been shown in one study to be as efficacious as
medication and more efficacious than cognitive therapy (Dimidjian et
al., 2006). Two types of treatment---interpersonal psychotherapy and
cognitive-behavioral therapy---have been intensively examined for their
effectiveness in depressive disorders. There is evidence that these two
treatments are effective (and in some studies just as beneficial as, or
more so than, antidepressant medications), particularly in the treatment
of less severe cases of unipolar depression (Cardemil & Barber, 2001;
Dubovsky & Buzan, 1999; Hollon, Stewart, & Strunk, 2006; President's New
Freedom Commission on Mental Health, 2003). Interpersonal Psychotherapy
Interpersonal psychotherapy is a short-term, psychodynamic-eclectic
(i.e., based on psychodynamic procedures but flexible in the use of
therapeutic techniques) type of treatment for depression. It targets the
client's interpersonal relationships and uses strategies found in
psychodynamic, cognitivebehavioral, and other forms of therapy (Klerman,
Weissman, Rounsavelle, & Chevron, 1984). The assumptions underlying
interpersonal psychotherapy are that depression occurs within an
interpersonal context and, accordingly, that interpersonal relationship
issues must be addressed. The focus is on conflicts and problems that
occur in these relationships. Clients gain insight into conflicts in
social relationships and strive to change these relationships. For
example, by improving communications with others, by identifying role
conflicts, and by increasing social skills, clients come to find
relationships more satisfying and pleasant. Although interpersonal
psychotherapy resembles psychoanalysis and psychodynamic approaches in
acknowledging the role of early life experiences and traumas, it is
oriented primarily toward present, not past, relationships.
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy As its name implies, cognitive-behavioral
therapy combines cognitive and behavioral strategies. The cognitive
component involves teaching the patient the following (Beck, Rush, Shaw,
& Emery, 1979): • To identify negative, self-critical thoughts
(cognitions) that occur automatically • To note the connection between
negative thoughts and the resulting depression • To carefully examine
each negative thought and decide whether it can be supported • To try to
replace distorted negative thoughts with realistic interpretations of
each situation Cognitive therapists believe that distorted thoughts
cause psychological problems such as depression and that changing the
distorted thoughts can eliminate the depression. At the outset of the
cognitive therapy, the client is usually asked to begin monitoring his
or her negative thoughts and to list them on a chart. It is important
for the client to include all the thoughts and emotions associated with
each distressing event that takes place each day. In an intensive study,
clients suffering from depression were randomly assigned to one of four
treatment conditions for four months: interpersonal psychotherapy,
cognitive-behavioral therapy, imipramine (a tricyclic drug) plus
clinical management, and pill-placebo plus clinical management (Elkin,
1994; Elkin et al., 1995). Imipramine was included in the design because
its effectiveness has been studied

325

326

CHAPTER 11 • MOOD DISORDERS

and because the other treatments could be compared with it. The
imipramine and pill-placebo conditions were paired with clinical
management (in which minimal supportive therapy was provided) because of
the ethical need to provide some therapy for clients in the pill-placebo
and imipramine conditions. Results indicated that, in general, the
interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral, and imipramine
treatments were equally effective in reducing depression. All were
significantly more effective than the pill-placebo condition. However,
specific effects were influenced by the initial severity of disturbance.
In addition, many of the clients who showed major improvement at the end
of treatment (regardless of treatment condition) had relapsed and were
suffering from depression again eighteen months following treatment.
Thus interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and
imipramine all appear to be effective, although some of the effects
diminish over time. Hollon, DeRubeis, and Seligman (1992) found that
cognitive therapy may reduce the risk of episodes of depression
occurring after treatment. Clients treated with cognitive therapy were
less likely to develop subsequent symptoms of depression than were
clients treated pharmacologically. The researchers believe that
cognitive changes in explanatory styles and attributions among the
clients in cognitive therapy may help prevent depressive symptoms. In
fact, cognitive-behavioral techniques have been used in prevention
programs. Munoz and his colleagues (1995) found that teaching
cognitive-behavioral skills can be helpful in preventing depression.
Indeed, the majority of programs that attempt to prevent depression have
been cognitive-behavioral in orientation. The reason is not that other
approaches cannot be effective. Rather, cognitive-behavioral
orientations have been shown to be effective and can be used as an
intervention for many people at the same time (Cardemil & Barber, 2001).
In a review of depression-focused psychotherapies, Thase (2001) notes
that behavioral, cognitive, and interpersonal therapies share common
features: they are nontraditional (the focus is not on the unconscious)
and short term in nature (two to four months of treatment), and their
theoretical models of depression are linked with intervention tactics.
These three therapies have demonstrated their effectiveness and
practicality in the treatment of mild to moderately severe depressive
disorders. Both psychotherapy and drug therapy are effective, with some
evidence that antidepressant medications may be particularly
advantageous with severe cases of depression (Lambert & Ogles, 2004).
However, cognitive and behavioral treatments have enduring effects that
reduce risk for subsequent symptom return following treatment. That is,
the effects of psychological treatments tend to last, whereas
medications relieve depression only during active treatment (Hollon et
al., 2006). The kinds of changes in cognitive treatment (modifying
schemas, correcting negative thoughts, cognitive restructuring) may
enable patients to think differently, even after treatment has been
terminated. Cognitive-behavioral treatment has also not only
demonstrated reductions in symptoms but also shown effects in brain
changes. After cognitive-behavioral treatment, the functioning of limbic
and cortical regions of patients' brains was changed, as revealed in PET
scans (Goldapple et al., 2004). These affected brain sites are also
affected after drug treatment using an SSRI such as paroxetine. Finally,
neuronal changes in the brain were found to vary as a function of
favorable or unfavorable responders to cognitive-behavioral treatment
(Siegle, Carter, & Thase, 2006). Thus cognitive changes influence brain
processes, and brain processes influence cognitions. Our understanding
of how psychological treatments work must include cognitive, behavioral,
emotional, and brain structure elements. There do appear to be
advantages in combined treatments that involve medication and
psychotherapy. Medication tends to produce rapid and reliable reductions
in symptoms among chronic or severely depressed patients, and
psychotherapy can enhance social functioning or reduce subsequent risk
and relapse (Friedman et al., 2004; Hollon & Fawcett, 2001).
Furthermore, research has indicated that if patients do not show
significant improvement with one type of medication, they may respond to
other types (Rush et al., 2006). This increases the overall
effectiveness of medications.

Bipolar Disorders

Bipolar Disorders Earlier we defined mood disorders as disturbances in
emotions that cause subjective discomfort, hinder a person's ability to
function, or both. Up to this point, we have discussed unipolar
depression, in which only depression occurs. In this section, we discuss
bipolar disorder, in which depression is usually accompanied by mania.

Symptoms and Characteristics of Bipolar Disorders As in depression,
symptoms of bipolar disorders can be seen in four domains: affective,
cognitive, behavioral, and physiological. Affective Symptoms In mania,
affective symptoms include an elevated, expansive, or irritable mood.
Social and occupational functioning is impaired, as shown in the
following case.

Case Study Alan was a forty-three-year-old unmarried computer programmer
who had led a relatively quiet life until two weeks before, when he
returned to work after a short absence for illness. Alan seemed to be in
a particularly good mood. Others in the ofﬁce noticed that he was
unusually happy and energetic, greeting everyone at work. A few days
later, during the lunch hour, Alan bought a huge cake and insisted that
his fellow workers eat some of it. At ﬁrst everyone was surprised and
amused by his antics. But two colleagues working with him on a special
project became increasingly irritated because Alan didn't put any time
into their project. He just insisted that he would ﬁnish his part in a
few days. On the day the manager had decided to tell Alan of his
colleagues' concern, Alan behaved in a delirious, manic way. When he
came to work, he immediately jumped onto a desk and yelled, "Listen,
listen! We aren't working on the most important aspects of our data! I
know, since I've debugged my mind. Erase, reprogram, you know what I
mean. We've got to examine the total picture based on the input!" Alan
then spouted profanities and made obscene remarks to several of the
secretaries. Onlookers thought that he must have taken drugs. Attempts
to calm him down brought angry and vicious denunciations. The manager,
who had been summoned, also couldn't calm him. Finally the manager
threatened to ﬁre Alan. At this point, Alan called the manager an
incompetent fool and stated that he could not be ﬁred. His speech was so
rapid and disjointed that it was difﬁcult to understand him. Alan then
picked up a chair and said he was going to smash the computers. Several
coworkers grabbed him and held him on the ﬂoor. Alan was yelling so loud
that his voice was quite hoarse, but he continued to shout and struggle.
Two police ofﬁcers were called, and they had to handcuff him to restrain
his movements. Within hours, he was taken to a psychiatric hospital for
observation.

People with mania, like Alan, show boundless energy, enthusiasm, and
self-assertion. If frustrated, they may become profane and quite
belligerent, as he did. Cognitive Symptoms Cognitive symptoms of mania
include grandiosity, flightiness, pressured (or intrusive) thoughts,
lack of focus and attention, and poor judgment. The verbal processes of
patients with mania reflect their cognitive state. For example, their
speech is usually quite accelerated and pressured. They may change
topics in mid-sentence or utter irrelevant and idiosyncratic phrases.
Although much of what they say is understandable to others, the
accelerated and disjointed nature of their speech makes it difficult to
follow their train of thought. They seem incapable of controlling their
attention, as though they are constantly distracted by new and more
exciting thoughts and ideas. Behavioral Symptoms In terms of behavioral
symptoms, individuals with mania are often uninhibited, engaging
impulsively in sexual activity or abusive discourse. Two levels of manic
intensity have been recognized---hypomania and mania (American
Psychiatric Association, 2000a). In the milder form, hypomania-affected
people seem to be "high" in mood and overactive in behavior. Their
judgment is usually poor, although delusions are rare. They start many
projects but complete few, if any. When they interact with others,
people with hypomania dominate the conversation and are often grandiose.

327

328

CHAPTER 11 • MOOD DISORDERS

People who suffer from mania display more disruptive behaviors,
including pronounced overactivity, grandiosity, and irritability. Their
speech may be incoherent, and they do not tolerate criticism or
restraints imposed by others. In the more severe form of mania, the
person is wildly excited, rants, raves (the stereotype of a raving
"maniac"), and is constantly agitated and on the move. Hallucinations
and delusions may appear. Because these individuals may be
uncontrollable and are frequently dangerous to themselves or to others,
physical restraint and medication are often necessary. Physiological
Symptoms The most prominent physiological or somatic symptom is a
decreased need for sleep, accompanied by high levels of arousal. The
energy and excitement these patients show may cause them to lose weight
or to go without sleep for long periods. Whereas hypomania is not severe
enough to cause marked impairment or hospitalization, the mood
disturbance in mania is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment
in social or occupational functioning.

Classiﬁcation of Bipolar Disorders In DSM, the essential feature of
bipolar disorders is the occurrence of one or more manic or hypomanic
episodes; the term bipolar is used because the disorders are usually
accompanied by one or more depressive episodes. Criteria for diagnosing
bipolar disorder in DSM specify that manic episodes last at least one
week in the case of mania and four days in the case of hypomania.
Bipolar disorders include subcategories that describe the nature of the
disorder. Bipolar I subcategories include single manic episode, most
recent episode hypomanic, most recent episode manic, most recent episode
mixed, most recent episode depressed, and most recent episode
unspecified. Bipolar II disorder includes recurrent major depressive
episodes with hypomania. Persons in whom manic but not depressive
episodes have occurred are extremely rare; in such cases, a depressive
episode will presumably appear at some time. Table 11.5 lists the
general criteria for mania. One specifier for bipolar disorders is
whether the manic or depressive episodes have occurred four or more
times during the previous twelve months. Such episodes may appear with
periods of relative normality in between. In some cases, there may be
only partial remission in between the episodes. One patient was reported
to demonstrate manic behaviors for almost exactly twenty-four hours,
immediately followed by depressive behaviors for twenty-four hours. At
the manic extreme, the TA B L E

patient was agitated, demanding, and constantly shouting; the next day,
he was almost mute and inactive. The alternating nature of the disorder
lasted eleven years (Jenner et al., 1967). Typical manic episodes appear
suddenly and last from a few days to months. Depressive episodes tend to
last longer.

Prevalence of Bipolar Disorders A large-scale national survey of bipolar
disorders was conducted in order to determine prevalence rates
(Merikangas, 2007). The twelve-month and lifetime prevalence rates were
0.6 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, for bipolar I, and 0.8
percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, for bipolar II (see Figure 11.1).
Thus bipolar disorders are less prevalent than major depression. Unlike
depression, there appear to be no major overall gender differences in
the prevalence of bipolar disorders (Dubovsky & Buzan, 1999). If
differences do exist, they do not appear to be very marked (Merikangas,
2007), especially in comparison with gender differences for unipolar
depression. Interestingly, although bipolar disorders are much less
prevalent than unipolar depression, their costs are high. Bipolar
disorder was associated with 65.5 annual lost workdays per ill worker
and major depressive disorder with 27.2. The higher work loss was due to
more severe and persistent depressive episodes in those with bipolar
disorder than in those with major depressive disorder (Kessler et al.,
2006). Furthermore, the course of bipolar disorder is characterized by
frequent relapse and recurrence (Hollon, Stewart, & Strunk, 2006).
Comorbidity is high (Leahy, 2007) because bipolar disorder is commonly
associated with other medical conditions (heart disease, hypertension,
diabetes, and so forth) and mental health problems (anxiety, smoking,
drug abuse, suicides, and so forth). Some people have hypomanic episodes
and depressed moods that do not meet the criteria for major depressive
episode. If the symptoms have been present for at least two years, the
individuals are diagnosed with cyclothymic disorder. (For children and
adolescents, one year rather than two years is the criterion.) As in the
case of dysthymia, cyclothymic disorder is a chronic and relatively
continual mood disorder in which the person is never symptom free for
more than two months. With lifetime prevalence between 0.4 and 1
percent, cyclothymia is less common than dysthymia. The risk that a
person with cyclothymia will subsequently develop a bipolar disorder is
15 to 50 percent (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a).

M

ichelangelo, Van Gogh, Tchaikovsky, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest
Hemingway, and Walt Whitman all experienced mood disorders. We do not
know why an association between artists and mood disorders occurs,
although it should be noted that most people with mood disorders are not
especially creative. Perhaps the elevated energy, expansiveness, and
uninhibited mood may contribute to productivity and novel ideas.

Comparison Between Depressive and Bipolar Disorders Several types of
evidence seem to support the distinction between depressive (unipolar)
and bipolar disorders (Dubovsky & Buzan, 1999; Goodwin & Guze, 1984).
First, genetic studies have revealed that blood relatives of patients
with bipolar disorders have a higher incidence of manic disturbances
than do relatives of patients with unipolar disorders. In addition,
stronger evidence of genetic or psychophysiological influences exists
for bipolar disorders than for unipolar disorders. Second, the age of
onset is somewhat earlier for bipolar disorders (the early twenties)
than for unipolar disorders (the late twenties). Third, individuals with
bipolar disorder display psychomotor retardation and a greater tendency
to attempt suicide than do individuals with unipolar disorder, whose
depressive symptoms often include anxiety. Fourth, bipolar disorders
respond to lithium, whereas the drug has little effect on unipolar
disorders. Finally, the prevalence of bipolar disorder is many times
lower than that of major depression (see Figure 11.1).

Etiology of Bipolar Disorders As in the case of unipolar depression, a
number of biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural theories
have been proposed for bipolar disorders. The contribution of genetic
factors to bipolar disorder is well established from twin, adoption, and
family studies (Kato, 2007). For example, the concordance rates for
bipolar disorders has been found to be 72 percent for identical
(monozygotic---MZ) twins and 14 percent for fraternal (dizygotic---DZ)
twins. The evidence suggests that heredity influences are important in
bipolar disorders, and more strongly so than in unipolar

depression. However, the rate of bipolar disorders in the families of
patients with unipolar depression is three to four times the rate in
control families (Dubovsky & Buzan, 1999), and relatives of those with
bipolar disorders have an increased chance of having not only bipolar
disorders but also unipolar disorders (Faraone, Kremen, & Tsuang, 1990).
These studies suggest that the two disorders are somehow related or
under the influence of common factors. Some researchers believe, as in
the case of unipolar depression, that bipolar disorders are caused by
dysfunctions in neurotransmission. Tolmunen and his colleagues (2004)
have found that mania was associated with elevated serotonin transporter
availability and this availability declined with psychotherapy. However,
among depressed controls, serotonin availability actually increased with
psychotherapy. Others feel that dysregulation in the brain activation
system results in inappropriate affect (Davidson et al., 2002).
Consistent with a dysregulation model, Johnson and her colleagues (2000)
found that individuals with bipolar disorders show elevated manic
symptoms after experiencing goal-attainment life events (but not just
any positive life events). They speculate that bipolar individuals
cannot regulate motivation and that goal-attainment events trigger manic
symptoms. In contrast, persons without the disorder tend to "coast" or
decrease activation after these events. Behaviorists have made major
contributions to the understanding of depression, but they and many
other theorists have not really given much attention to mania. Although
they acknowledge that biological factors may be important in bipolar
disorders, Staats and Heiby (1985) believe that learning principles can
contribute to the understanding of mania. They hypothesize that
individuals may receive praise and admiration because of some behavior
(such as performing well using social or interpersonal skills). The
euphoria from receiving the praise may elicit further use of the skills,
resulting in even more positive consequences. The behaviors then become
accelerated, and euphoria increases even more---as in a manic state. At
some point, however, the behaviors elicit negative reactions, which set
up conditions for depression. In any case, much more is known about what
causes unipolar depression than about what causes the bipolar disorders,
and psychological-sociocultural perspectives focus primarily on
depression rather than on mania. As indicated earlier, biological
factors may play a more prominent role in the etiology of bipolar
disorders than in unipolar disorders. Another possibility is that the
category of unipolar disorders is more heterogeneous and that some of
these disorders are caused by internal conditions within the organism,
whereas others are caused by external precipitating events.

Treatment for Bipolar Disorders Although the drugs used for depressive
disorders are also used for bipolar disorders (e.g., MAOIs and SSRIs),
lithium and depakote are typically given to bipolar clients. Since it
was introduced to the United States in 1969, lithium (in the form of
lithium carbonate) has been the treatment of choice for bipolar and
manic disorders. Response rates with lithium range from 60 to 80 percent
in "classic" bipolar disorder (Delgado & Gelenberg, 2001). Lithium is
also used as a mood-stabilizing drug to prevent or reduce future
episodes of bipolar disorder (National Institute of Mental Health, 1985)
and has an antisuicide effect (Goldberg, 2007). As noted, the manic
phase of bipolar disorder may be caused by too much neurotransmitter
(primarily norepinephrine) at brain synapses or by neurotransmitter
dysfunction. Lithium decreases the total level of neurotransmitters in
the synaptic areas by increasing the reuptake of norepinephrine into the
nerve cells. Thus medication forms the core of treatment. Most patients
are maintained indefinitely on lithium or other mood stabilizers to
forestall symptom onset (especially mania), with antidepressants often
included to deal with depressive symptoms (Hollon et al., 2006). The
generally positive results achieved with lithium have been overshadowed
somewhat by reports of distressing side effects (Dubovsky, Franks,
Lifschitz, & Coen, 1982). The earliest danger signals are
gastrointestinal complications (such as vomiting and diarrhea), fine
tremors, muscular weakness, and frequent urination.

The more serious side effects, associated with excessive lithium in the
blood, are loss of bladder control, slurred speech, blurred vision,
seizures, and abnormal heart rate. Fortunately, accurate measurements of
lithium blood levels are easily obtained, and dosages can be adjusted
accordingly. Another problem associated with lithium is lack of patient
compliance with the treatment program. For some reason, this problem is
consistently worse with patients taking lithium for bipolar disorder
than with any other group of patients taking any other drug. Patients
with bipolar disorder often report that they have tried to adjust their
lithium dosage by themselves so that they will experience the mania but
not the depression of bipolar disorder. Unfortunately, lithium levels
cannot be manipulated in this manner. When the dosage is decreased, the

We know that depression is relatively widespread and seriously affects
people throughout the world. No single theory can adequately account for
depression or bipolar disorder. Increasingly, researchers have proposed
multipath explanatory models. They try to link genetic findings,
brain-body functioning, and psychological, social, and sociocultural
factors in mood disorders. For example, genetic predisposition coupled
with critical early life stress and subsequent life experiences seems to
affect depression. The interactions of various factors is also evident
in the mind-body relationship found in studies that show changes in
physiological and brain functioning indicators as a result of
psychotherapy. The complexities in finding the causal linkages in
depression are complicated by the real possibility that many different
factors can cause depression and that depression may be a group of
heterogeneous conditions. In the case of bipolar disorder, heredity
seems to play a stronger role than in the case of depression. Finally,
we also know that psychological and psychopharmacological treatment is
effective, although treatment effects vary. Psychotherapy tends to
prevent relapses, whereas medication appears to work well with seriously
disturbed patients, but only if medication is continued.

Summary 1. What are the symptoms of unipolar depression? ■ Depression

involves affective, cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms,
such as sadness, pessimism, low energy, and sleep disturbances. ■
Unipolar depression, the broad name for depressive disorders, involves
the occurrence of depression without any history of mania. In DSM, two
types of depressive disorders can be diagnosed: major depression, in
which the depression is severe, and dysthymic disorder, in which the
depression is less severe but long term. 2. What causes unipolar
depression? ■ Evidence shows that biological factors, including
heredity, are important in predisposing one to depression. The
functioning of neurotransmitters, brain structure activities, and
cortisol levels in the body are associated with depression. ■
Psychological theories of depression have been pro-

posed by adherents of the psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive,
cognitive-learning, and sociocultural viewpoints. Psychodynamic
explanations focus on separation and anger. Behavioral explanations
focus on reduced reinforcement following losses. Cognitive explanations
see low self-esteem as an important factor. According to the learned
helplessness theory of depression, susceptibility to depression depends
on the person's experience with controlling the environment. The
person's attributional style---speculations about why he or she is
helpless---is also important. ■ Social explanations focus on
relationships and interpersonal stressors and social supports that make
one vulnerable to, or resilient against, depression. ■ Sociocultural
explanations have focused on cultural, demographic, and socioeconomic
factors that influence the rates and symptoms of mood disorders. For
example, women have a higher prevalence for depression than men, and
various biological and social psychological factors have been proposed
for this gender discrepancy. 3. What kinds of treatment are available
for people with unipolar depression, and how effective are they? ■
Different forms of psychological and behavioral treat-

ments have been found to be effective with depressive disorders. These
include cognitive-behavioral

332

treatment, which seeks to replace negative thoughts with more realistic
(or positive) cognitions, and interpersonal therapy, which is a
short-term treatment focused on interpersonal issues. Biomedical
approaches to treating depression focus on increasing the amounts of
neurotransmitters available at brain synapses or affecting the
sensitivity of postsynaptic receptors through either medication or
electroconvulsive therapy. Antidepressant medication is effective, but,
unlike some psychological treatments, its effects last only as long as
one continues with medication. 4. What are the symptoms of bipolar, or
manic-depressive, disorder? ■ Bipolar disorder is characterized by the
occurrence of mania, in which a person shows elation, lack of focus,
impulsive actions, and almost boundless energy. ■ In bipolar mood
disorders, manic episodes occur or alternate with depressive episodes.
DSM-IV-TR recognizes two levels of manic intensity: hypomania and mania.
Hypomania is the milder form, in which affected people seem to be "high"
in mood and overactive in behavior. People suffering from mania display
more disruptive behaviors, including pronounced overactivity,
grandiosity, and irritability. Their behaviors may be so extreme as to
require restraint and medication. 5. What causes bipolar disorder? ■ In
finding the causes of bipolar disorders, researchers have also focused
on biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural factors.
However, much more research has been devoted to unipolar depression.
Research has shown that bipolar disorders seem to have a stronger
genetic basis and a smaller gender difference than those found in
unipolar depression. Nevertheless, consistent with a multipath model,
bipolar disorder is affected by a number of different factors. 6. What
are the primary means of treating bipolar disorder? ■ The most effective
treatment for bipolar and manic

disorders is lithium, a drug that lowers the level of neurotransmitters
at synapses by increasing the reuptake of norepinephrine, although other
drugs are being tested for use in these disorders. Research has
increasingly shown that psychotherapy is also effective in treating
bipolar disorders.

Suicide

L

ate one evening, Carl Johnson, M.D., left his downtown ofﬁce, got into
his Mercedes 500 SL, and drove toward his expensive suburban home. He
was in no particular hurry because the house would be empty anyway; the
year before, his wife had divorced him and, with their two children, had
moved back east to her parents' home. Carl was deeply affected. Although
he had been drinking heavily for two years before the divorce, he had
always been able to function at work. For the past several months,
however, his private practice had declined dramatically. He used to ﬁnd
his work rewarding, but now he found people boring and irritating.
Although he had suffered from depressive episodes in the past, this time
he knew things were different. The future looked bleak and hopeless.
Carl knew he had all the classic symptoms of depression---he was, after
all, a psychiatrist. The garage door opened automatically as he rolled
up the driveway. Carl parked carelessly, not even bothering to press the
switch that closed the door. Once in the house, he headed directly for
the bar in his den; there he got out a bottle of bourbon and three
glasses, ﬁlled the glasses, and lined them up along the bar. He drank
them down, one after the other, in rapid succession. For a good half
hour, he stood at the window staring out into the night. Then Carl sat
down at his mahogany desk and unlocked one of the drawers. Taking a
loaded .38-caliber revolver from the desk drawer, Dr. Carl Johnson held
it to his temple and pulled the trigger.

Why would someone like Dr. Carl Johnson take his own life? Granted, he
was depressed and obviously feeling the loss of his family, but most
people under similar circumstances are able to cope and choose life over
death. Unfortunately, we will never know the answer, but our multipath
model, as shown in Figure 12.1, does offer clues: there is a strong
possibility that the combined influence of biological, psychological,
social, and sociocultural factors contributed to his suicide. Confining
our explanations to only one factor would be a serious
oversimplification

and mistake (Leenaars, 2008). First, there is evidence that Carl had a
history of depression, and strong biological factors (biochemical or
genetic) are implicated in suicide. For example, cerebrospinal fluid
levels of people who kill themselves reveal that they have lower levels
of 5-HIAA serotonin, found to predict a ten to twenty times higher rate
of suicide (Leonardo & Hen, 2006; Roy, 1992). Second, psychological
factors such as alcohol abuse (Bryan & Rudd, 2006), hopelessness, and
depression are often associated with suicide (Jobes, 2006). Third,
social factors were evident in Dr. Johnson's pain; a divorce and loss of
his family made his life no longer meaningful. As we shall see, people
who are divorced and lack social relationships are more likely to commit
suicide (Rudd, Joiner, & Rajab, 2004). Finally, there are major
sociocultural correlates of Dr. Johnson's decision to take his own life.
His gender and occupation are significant factors. We know, for example,
that men are more likely to kill themselves than women and that,
occupationally, psychiatrists have among the highest rates of suicide
(Comtois & Linehan, 2006; Klott & Jongsma, 2004). It is clear that
Dr. Johnson was at high risk for suicide on a number of risk dimensions.
How these four dimensions interact, however, is difficult to ascertain.
Suicide---the intentional, direct, and conscious taking of one's own
life---is not only a tragic act, it is a baffling and confusing one as
well. Most of us have been raised to believe in the sanctity of life,
and we operate under strong moral, religious, and cultural sanctions
against taking our own lives. Yet suicide is as old as human history
itself, and its occurrence no longer seems a rarity. Although
explanations abound for suicide, we can never be entirely certain why
people knowingly and deliberately end their own lives (Leenaars, 2008;
Rudd et al., 2004). The easy and most frequent explanation is that
people who kill themselves are suffering from a mental disorder. Yet our
increasing understanding of suicide suggests that a single explanation
is simplistic. Suicide has many causes, and people kill themselves for
many different reasons (Rosenfeld, 2004).

act. Once the action has been taken, there is no going back, no
reconsideration, and no reprieve. Regardless of the moral stand one
takes on this position, the decision to commit suicide is often an
ambivalent one, clouded by many personal and social stressors. Many
mental health professionals believe that the suicidal person, if taught
how to deal with personal and social crises, would not consciously take
his or her own life. As a result, understanding the causes of suicide
and what can be done to prevent such an act becomes extremely important
to psychologists (Berman, 2006).

12.1

Correlates of Suicide People who commit suicide---who complete their
suicide attempts---can no longer inform us about their motives, frames
of mind, and emotional states. We have only indirect information, such
as case records and reports by others, to help us understand what led
them to their tragic act. The systematic examination of existing
information for the purpose of understanding and explaining a person's
behavior before his or her death is called a psychological autopsy
(Jacobs & Klein, 1993; Roberts, 1995). It is patterned on the medical
autopsy, which is an examination of a dead body to determine the cause
or nature of the biological death. The psychological autopsy attempts to
make psychological sense of a suicide or homicide by compiling and
analyzing case histories of victims, recollections of therapists,
interviews with relatives and friends, information obtained from crisis
phone calls, and messages left in suicide notes. Unfortunately, these
sources are not always available or reliable. Only 12 to 34 percent of
victims leave suicide notes, many have never undergone psychotherapy,
and the intense feelings of loved ones often cloud their judgments
(Black, 1993; Leenaars, 1992).

CHAPTER 12 • SUICIDE

Why Do People Kill Themselves?

I

t is a very common belief that people who choose to commit suicide are
mentally disturbed and suffer from psychological factors such as
depression. Studies do support a high correlation between depression and
the presence of mental disorders in both those who attempt suicide and
those who are successful in committing suicide. There are commonalities
among those who kill themselves, but it is also true that people take
their lives for many different reasons. Let's look at four examples of
individuals who committed suicide. 1. Kurt Cobain was the founder, lead
singer, guitarist and songwriter for the band Nirvana. The band was in
the forefront of grunge and alternative rock, and Cobain was considered
the spokesman for Generation X. His marriage to Courtney Love was not
well received by Cobain's fans, who felt she had a negative inﬂuence
over him and was using him to enhance her own fame. It is well known
that the two heavily abused drugs during their marriage, and even when
Love was pregnant with Cobain's child. Throughout their courtship and
marriage, Love and Cobain were under constant critical scrutiny by the
media. Adding to the pressures he felt, Cobain had great difﬁculty
reconciling his huge success and fame in the music world with his
underground roots. He felt hounded by the media but was even more
disturbed by fans who seemed not to understand his music. Throughout his
childhood until his death, Cobain was prone to depression and drug abuse
and suffered from medical problems. On April 5, 1994, after writing a
suicide note, he killed himself by a self-inﬂicted shotgun wound to the
head. 2. In 1990, the psychology community was shocked by the suicide of
one of their very own, Bruno Bettelheim. Bettelheim was a renowned
psychologist whose work on autism inﬂuenced the ﬁeld of mental health
and treatment immensely. In his personal and professional life he had
dedicated himself to helping others and improving the quality of their
lives, but he began to experience declining health. In a very personal
interview with a reporter, Bettelheim expressed his thoughts on death
and suicide. He stated that he did not fear death but was frightened at
the prospect of suffering. At the age of eighty-six, he had lived a
productive and enjoyable life and was fearful he would be kept alive
without a purpose. Bettelheim had recently suffered a stroke, was
fearful that he would suffer another, did not want to be a burden to his
family or friends, and could no longer take part in many of the
activities that had

brought joy and meaning to his life. He believed that he was living on
borrowed time and met with a doctor in the Netherlands who was willing
to give him a lethal injection. 3. Ten-year-old Tammy Jimenez was the
youngest of three children---a loner who had attempted suicide at least
twice in the previous two years. Tammy's parents always seemed to be
bickering about one thing or another and threatening divorce. She and
her sisters were constantly abused by their alcoholic father. In
February 1986, Tammy was struck and killed by a truck when she darted
out into the highway that passed by her home. The incident was listed as
an accident, but her older sister said Tammy had deliberately killed
herself. On the morning of her death, an argument with her father had
upset and angered her. Her sister said that, seconds before Tammy ran
out onto the highway, she had said that she was unwanted and would end
her own life. 4. On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four planes;
two of them destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New
York City, one struck the Pentagon, and another crashed in Pennsylvania.
Thousands of innocent lives were lost. All the terrorists also perished
and were praised as martyrs by al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. In
televised gloating, Bin Laden indicated that the Islamic extremists
willingly gave their lives for a greater good, to combat the evil of the
United States. He stated that those responsible for the heinous act were
destined for an idyllic afterlife. The decision or impulse to take one's
life is a complex one. Suicidologists now accept the belief that no
single explanation is sufﬁcient to account for all types of suicide.
Common sense alone leads to the conclusion that Kurt Cobain's reasons
for taking his life differ from those of Bruno Bettelheim, Tammy
Jimenez, or the September 11th terrorists. Cobain had difﬁculty with the
pressures of fame and battled depression; Bettelheim wanted to avoid
further suffering, declining physical health, and being a burden to
others; Tammy Jimenez believed she was escaping an unhappy family life
and child abuse; and, although we may vigorously disagree, the 9/11
terrorists believed they sacriﬁced their lives for a greater good. Can
you discern the motives that would lead each of these individuals to
take their own lives? In what ways are they similar or different? Which
of these suicides, if any, would you consider more acceptable than the
other? What does your ranking tell you about your values and perspective
on suicides?

Correlates of Suicide

337

Another strategy involves studying those who survive a suicide attempt.
This method, however, assumes that people who attempt suicide are no
different from those who succeed. Studies suggest that these two
populations differ on many important dimensions: (1) attempters are more
likely to be white female housewives in their twenties and thirties who
are experiencing marital difficulties and use primarily barbiturates;
and (2) those who succeed are more likely to be males in their forties
or older who suffer from health and depression and shoot or hang
themselves (Diekstra, Kienhorst, & de Wilde, 1995; Furr et al., 2001;
Shea, 2002).

Myth vs Reality Myth: People who attempt suicide are not serious about
ending their lives. They are usually manipulative, attention seeking,
and have little intention of completing the act. Reality: Although this
statement may hold some truth, it is dangerous to assume that people who
attempt suicide are not serious. Indeed, most people who are successful
have made attempts in the past. A suicide attempt is a danger signal
that should not be taken lightly.

Facts About Suicide In seeking to understand suicide, researchers have
focused on events, characteristics, and demographic variables that recur
in psychological autopsies and that are highly correlated with the act
(Comtois & Linehan, 2006; Lester, 2008). Our first example, Dr. Carl
Johnson, fits a particular profile. Higher suicide rates are associated
with divorce (Berman, 2006; Bryan & Rudd, 2006) and with certain
professions (psychiatry in particular). Alcohol is frequently implicated
(Canapary, Bongar, & Cleary, 2002; Rogers, 1992), and men are more
likely to kill themselves using firearms than by other means (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2007e). Profiles such as
these, as well as others described later in this chapter, emerge from
our increasing knowledge of facts that are correlated with suicide
(Bryan & Rudd, 2006; CDC Web-based Injury Statistics, 2005; Karch,
Cosby, & Simon, 2006; Leach, 2006; Shneidman, 1993). Let's examine some
of them in greater detail. But first, look at Table 12.2, which examines
some of the characteristics shared by suicidal individuals.

Did You Know?

C

leopatra, Kurt Cobain, Ernest Hemingway, Adolf Hitler, Jim Jones (the
People's Temple leader), Marilyn Monroe, Freddie Prinze, Sr. (comedian),
King Saul, and Virginia Woolf all have one thing in common. As you may
have guessed, they all committed suicide---the intentional, direct, and
conscious taking of one's own life.

Frequency Every sixteen minutes or so, someone in the United States
takes his or her own life. Approximately 31,000 persons kill themselves
each year. Suicide is among the top eleven causes of death in the
industrialized parts of the world; it is the eighth leading cause of
death among American males and the third leading cause of death among
young people ages fifteen to twentyfour (CDC Web-based Injury
Statistics, 2005, 2007a). Some evidence shows that the number of actual
suicides is probably 25 to 30 percent higher than that recorded. Many
deaths that are officially recorded as accidental---such as single-auto
crashes, drownings, or falling from great heights---are actually
suicides. According to some estimates, eight to ten persons attempt
suicide for every one person who completes the act. Children and Young
People as Victims In 2004, suicide was the third leading cause of death
for the following age groups: children ages ten to fourteen years (1.3
per 100,000); adolescents ages fifteen to nineteen (8.2 per 100,000),
and young adults ages twenty to twenty-four (12.5 per 100,000; CDC,
2007e). Recent reports suggest that about twelve thousand children
between the ages of five and twenty-four are admitted to psychiatric
hospitals for suicidal behavior every year, and it is believed that
twenty times that number actually attempt suicide. Suicides among young
people ages fifteen to twenty-four have increased by more than 40
percent in the past decade (50 percent for males

CHAPTER 12 • SUICIDE

12.2

TEN COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF SUICIDE 1. The common purpose is to seek a
solution. People may believe that suicide represents a solution to an
insoluble problem. To the suicidal person, taking one's life is not a
pointless or accidental occurrence.

6.  The cognitive state is one of ambivalence. Although the suicidal
    person may be strongly motivated to end his or her life, there is
    usually a desire (in varying degrees) to live as well.

7.  The cessation of consciousness is a common goal. Consciousness
    represents constant psychological pain, but suicide represents a
    termination of distressing thoughts and feelings.

8.  The cognitive state is also characterized by "tunnel vision." The
    person has great difﬁculty seeing "the larger picture" and can be
    characterized as suffering from tunnel vision. People intent on
    suicide seem unable to consider other options or alternatives. Death
    is the only way out.

9.  The stimulus for suicide is generally intolerable psychological
    pain. Depression, hopelessness, guilt, shame, and other negative
    emotions are frequently the basis of a suicide.

10. The common stressor in suicide is frustrated psychological need. The
    inability to attain high standards or expectations may lead to
    feelings of frustration, failure, and worthlessness. When progress
    toward goals is blocked, some individuals become vulnerable to
    suicide.

11. A common emotion in suicide is hopelessness/ helplessness. Pessimism
    about the future and a conviction that nothing can be done to
    improve one's life situation may predispose a person to suicide.

12. The common action in suicide is escape. The goal is
    egression---escape from an intolerable situation.

13. The common interpersonal act in suicide is communication of
    intention. At least 80 percent of suicides are preceded by either
    verbal or nonverbal behavioral cues indicating their intentions.

14. The common consistency is in the area of lifelong coping patterns.
    Patterns or habits developed in coping with crisis generally are the
    same response patterns that are used throughout life. Some patterns
    may predispose one to suicide.

and 12 percent for females); suicide is now the second leading cause of
death for whites in this age group. College students appear less at risk
for suicide than their age-matched noncollege peers, although the recent
rash of highly visible suicides on the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and New York University campuses may seem to contradict these
statistics (Sontag, 2002; Swindler, 2004). Suicide Publicity and
Identiﬁcation with Victims Media reports of suicides, especially of
celebrities, seem to spark an increase in suicide (Bailey, 2003). The
twelve-month period following Marilyn Monroe's suicide saw a 12 percent
increase. Suicides by young people in small communities or schools seem
to evoke copycat suicides in some students. Publicized murder-suicides
also seem to be correlated with an increase in car accidents. It is
hypothesized that group suicides involving two or more individuals
represent an extreme form of personal identification with others.
Studies suggest that group suicides are characterized by highly
emotional involvements or settings that overcome the desire for
self-preservation. Interestingly, publicized natural deaths (as opposed
to suicides) of celebrities do not produce similar increases. Gender The
completed suicide rate for men is about four times that for women,
although recent findings suggest that the gap is closing, as many more
women are now incurring a higher risk. Further, women are more likely to
make attempts, but it appears that men are more successful because they
use more lethal means. Among people older than sixty-five, the completed
suicide rate for men is ten times that for women. However, women in the
same age range attempt suicide three times as often as men. The age
group beginning at age sixty-five has the highest suicide rate of all.
Among younger people, males commit the majority of suicides.

Correlates of Suicide

339

For example, among the fifteen-to-twenty-four age category, over 70
percent of suicides are men. Marital Status As Figure 12.2a, b, and c
indicate, being widowed as compared to divorced appears to be associated
with higher risk of suicide for white men and women and African American
men. At older ages, however, divorce rather than widowhood increases the
risk. Interestingly, the pattern reversal occurs much earlier among
white women than among men (forty to forty-nine years vs. fifty-five to
sixty-five years). Across the life span, the lowest incidence of suicide
is found among people who are married (Luoma, Pearson, & Pearson, 2002).
The suicide rates for single and widowed or divorced men are about twice
those for women of similar marital status. Attempted and completed
suicide rates are higher among those who are separated, divorced, or
widowed. They are especially high among single adolescent girls and
single men in their thirties (McIntosh, 1991). Occupation Physicians,
lawyers, law enforcement personnel, and dentists have higher than
average rates of suicide. Among medical professionals, psychiatrists
have the highest rate and pediatricians the lowest. Because medical
personnel have easy access to drugs and know what constitutes a fatal
dose, they may be more likely to complete a suicide. Interestingly, the
suicide rate of women physicians is four times higher than that of a
matched general population. Such marked differences raise the question
of whether the specialty influences susceptibility or whether a
suicide-prone person is attracted to certain specialties. Socioeconomic
Level Suicide is represented proportionately among all socioeconomic
levels. Level of wealth does not seem to affect the suicide rate as much
as do changes in that level. In the Great Depression of the 1930s,
suicide was higher among the suddenly impoverished than among those who
had always been poor. Choice of Weapon Over 50 percent of suicides are
committed by firearms, and 70 percent of attempts are accounted for by
drug overdose. Men most frequently choose firearms as the means of
suicide; poisoning and asphyxiation via barbiturates are the preferred
means for women. The violent means (which men are more likely to choose)
are more certain to complete the act; this partially explains the
disproportionately greater number of incomplete attempts by women.
Recent studies indicate, however, that women are increasingly choosing
firearms and explosives as methods (55.9 percent increase). Some have
speculated that this change may be related to a change in role
definitions of women in society. Among children younger than fifteen,
the most common suicide method tends to be jumping from buildings and
running into traffic. Older children try hanging or drug overdoses.
Younger children attempt suicide impulsively and thus use more readily
available means. Religious Afﬁliation Religious affiliation is
correlated with suicide rates. Although the U.S. rate is 12.2 per
100,000, in countries in which Catholic Church influences are
strong---Latin America, Ireland, Spain, and Italy---the suicide rate is
relatively low (less than 10 per 100,000). Islam, too, condemns suicide,
but the increase in suicide attacks in the Middle East may affect rates
in Arab countries, which are generally low. Where religious sanctions
against suicide are absent or weaker---for example, where church
authority is weaker, as it is in Scandinavian countries, in the former
Czechoslovakia, and in Hungary---higher rates are observed. Indeed,
Hungary has the highest recorded rate of suicide, at 40.7 per 100,000,
and the former Czechoslovakia's rate was 22.4 per 100,000. Ethnic and
Cultural Variables Suicide rates vary among ethnic minority groups in
the United States. As shown in Figure 12.3, American Indian groups have
the highest rate, followed by white Americans, Mexican Americans,
African Americans, Japanese Americans, and Chinese Americans. American
Indian youngsters have frighteningly high rates (26 per 100,000) as
compared with white youths (14 per 100,000). For this group, suicide is
the second leading cause of death (CDC Webbased Injury Statistics,
2005). High rates of alcoholism, a low standard of living, and an
invalidation of their cultural lifestyles may all contribute to this
tragedy.

CHAPTER 12 • SUICIDE

NATIVE AMERICAN AND PROUD OF IT Suicide rates among American Indian
youth are extremely high, due perhaps to a lack of validation of their
cultural lifestyle. One effort to replenish native pride, shown here, is
Camp Walakota, a "spiritual boot camp" for troubled teens from the
Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. Here teens are reacquainted
with their cultural heritage as they bond with their elders, who offer
many valuable life lessons.

Jails and Prisons As might be expected, suicide is the most frequent
cause of death in U.S. jails. A suicide number that ranges from 90 to
230 per 100,000 means that the suicide rate in prisons is sixteen times
higher than in the general population. The most frequent means in jails
is hanging. Most victims were arrested for nonviolent crimes, and nearly
half were intoxicated with drugs or alcohol at the time of death.
Historical Period Suicide rates tend to decline during times of war and
natural disasters, but they increase during periods of shifting norms
and values or social unrest, when traditional expectations no longer
apply. Sociologists speculate that during wars, people "pull together"
and are less concerned with their own difficulties and conflicts.
Communication of Intent More than two-thirds of the people who commit
suicide communicate their intent to do so within three months of the
fatal act. The belief that people who threaten suicide are not serious
about it or will not actually make such an attempt is ill founded. It is
estimated that 20 percent of persons who attempt suicide try again
within one year and that 10 percent finally succeed. Most people who
attempt suicide appear to have been ambivalent about death until the
suicide. It has been estimated that fewer than 5 percent unequivocally
wish to end their lives.

12.3 RATES OF

SUICIDE BY RACE/ETHNICITY Of all the groups, white men have the highest
rates of suicide when men are separated from women. However, as a group
(men and women combined), Native Americans have the highest overall
group rates, with Asian Americans lowest. Source: Adapted from American
Society of Suicidology (2008).

Other Important Facts The time of year is correlated with suicides.
Spring and summer months have the highest incidence. About one in six
persons who complete the act leave suicide notes. Western mountain
states seem to have higher rates, with Montana and Nevada being the
highest. The average physician encounters six or more potentially
suicidal persons in his or her practice per year.

A Multipath Perspective of Suicide As we have indicated throughout the
text, the only viable explanation of mental disorders must come from an
integrated and multidimensional analysis. This is truly exemplified in
the study of suicide, in which so many different factors seem involved
(Leong & Leach, 2008; Lester, 2008). Our biological, psychological,
social, and sociocultural multipath model seems especially well suited
for this purpose, as it acknowledges the multiple pathways to suicide.

Biological Dimension Most discussions of the correlates of suicide seem
to stress psychological, social, and Did You Know? sociocultural
factors. As we will shortly see, all three contribute, but biological
facuicide rates in New Orleans tors and the interplay of all four seem
to be operating in determining suicides (CDC have tripled since
Hurricane Web-based Injury Statistics, 2005). Two sets of
findings---from biochemistry and from Katrina devastated the city
genetics---suggest that suicide may have a strong biological component.
For example, (Saulny, 2006). Likewise, war you may recall that there is
strong evidence that chemical neurotransmitters are assoveterans are

shows that suicide is influenced by commit suicide as those in the low
serotonin levels in the brain. general population (Dance, 2007).
Evidence of this link began to accumulate in the mid-1970s, when
researchers Both groups share commonalities: identified a chemical
called 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA; Boldrini et al., increased

frontal cortex may be impaired. And, as noted earlier, the spinal fluid
of some depressed and suicidal patients has been found to contain
abnormally low amounts of 5HIAA (Bongar, 1991). Statistics on patients
with low levels of 5HIAA indicated that they are more likely than others
to commit suicide, more likely to select violent methods of killing
themselves, and more likely to have a history of violence, aggression,
and impulsiveness (Edman et al., 1986; Roy, 1992). Researchers believe
that the tendency toward suicide is not a simple link to depression. We
already know that patients suffering from depression also exhibit low
levels of 5HIAA. What is startling is that low levels of 5HIAA have been

as a biological marker (a warning sign) of suicide risk. Researchers
believe that low 5HIAA content does not cause suicide but that it may
make people more vulnerable to environmental stressors. And still
another caution is in order: this evidence is correlational in nature;
it does not indicate whether low levels of 5HIAA are a cause or a result
of particular moods and emotions---or even whether the two are directly
related. There is also evidence to implicate genetics in suicidal
behavior, but the relationship is far from clear. There appears to be a
higher rate of suicide and suicide attempts among parents and close
relatives of people who attempt or commit suicide

S

CHAPTER 12 • SUICIDE

than among nonsuicidal people (Brent et al., 1996; Roy, 1992). As
always, great care must be used in drawing conclusions because it can be
argued that modeling by a close member of the family might make a family
relative more prone to find suicide an acceptable alternative. Some
researchers are hopeful that the Human Genome Project might provide a
means of clarifying the genetic markers that may help identify those
individuals at risk for suicide.

Psychological Dimension There are many psychological factors that have
been found to be significantly related to suicide (Maris et al., 2000).
Findings have consistently revealed that a number of individuals who
commit suicide suffer from a DSM-IV-TR (Bryan & Rudd, 2006; Harris &
Barraclough, 1997; Sanchez, 2001). Conversely, approximately 15 percent
of individuals diagnosed with mood disorders, schizophrenia, and
substance abuse attempt to kill themselves (Brent, Perper, & Allman,
1987; Rossow & Amundsen, 1995). Those suffering from schizophrenia are
most likely to be experiencing an episode of depression, and their
suicide methods are usually violent and bizarre; those with personality
disorders are usually the emotionally immature with low frustration
tolerance (borderline and antisocial personalities). A review of the
literature on suicide also reveals a number of other contributing
factors, including such experiences as separation and divorce (Garfinkel
& Golumbek, 1983), academic pressures (Priester & Clum, 1992), shame
(Shreve & Kunkel, 1991), serious illness (Mackenzie & Popkin, 1987),
loss of a job, and other life stressors (Rosenfeld, 2004). Depression
and Hopelessness Perhaps the psychological state of mind most correlated
with suicide is depression and hopelessness (Berman, 2006; Bryan & Rudd,
2006). For example, interest in suicide usually develops gradually, as a
result of pleasure loss and fatigue accompanying a serious depressed
mood (Lester, 2008). Shneidman (1993) has described it as a "psychache,"
an intolerable pain created from an absence of joy. Among both children
and adolescents, depression seems to be highly correlated with suicidal
behavior (CDC Web-based Injury Statistics, 2005; Eaton et al., 2006).
Such data can lead to the conclusion that depression plays an important
role in suicide. But the role depression plays in suicide is far from
simple. For example, patients seldom commit suicide while severely
depressed. Such patients generally show motor retardation and low
energy, which keep them from reaching the level of activity required for
suicide. The danger period often comes after some treatment, when the
depression begins to lift. Energy and motivation increase, and patients
are more likely to carry out the act. Most suicide attempts occur during
weekend furloughs from hospitals or soon after discharge, a fact that
supports this contention (Klerman, 1982). Although depression is
undeniably correlated with suicidal thoughts and behavior, the
relationship seems very complex. Why do some people with depression
commit suicide, whereas others do not? The answer may be found in the
characteristics of depression and in the factors that contribute to it
(Jobes, 2006). For example, it has been found that an increase in
sadness is a frequent mood indicator of suicide, but heightened feelings
of anxiety, anger, and shame are also associated (Kienhorst et al.,
1995). Some researchers believe that hopelessness, or negative
expectations about the future, may be the major catalyst in suicide and,
possibly, an even more important factor than depression and other moods
(Lester, 2008; Weishaar & Beck, 1992). In a classic ten-year study,
Beck, Emery, and Greenberg (1985) investigated 207 psychiatric patients
who had suicidal thoughts but no recent history of suicide attempts.
During the ten-year period, fourteen patients committed suicide, and the
test scores of these people were compared with those of the others. The
investigators found that the two groups did not differ in terms of
depression and suicidal ideation, but they did differ in terms of
hopelessness. Those who died were more pessimistic about the future than
were those who survived. Although the overall results obtained by the
scale did not predict suicide risk, the hopelessness item within the
measure did. Some sample statements indica-

A Multipath Perspective of Suicide

tive of hopelessness are "My future seems dark for me"; "I might as well
give up because there's nothing I can do about making things better for
myself"; "I never get anything I want, so it's foolish to want
anything." These findings suggest that therapists should assess all
depressed patients' attitudes toward their futures to determine how
hopeless they feel. Alcohol Consumption One of the most consistently
reported correlates of suicidal behavior is alcohol consumption
(Canapary et al., 2002; Schuckit, 1994; Shea, 2002). As many as 60
percent of suicide attempters drink alcohol before the act, and
autopsies of suicide victims suggest that 25 percent are legally
intoxicated (Flavin, Franklin, & Frances, 1990; Suokas & Lonnqvist,
1995). Indeed, a successful suicide unconnected to alcohol abuse is a
rare event. Alcohol-implicated suicide rates may be as high as 270 per
100,000, which is an astounding 27 times higher than the rate found in
the general population (Stillion, McDowell, & May, 1989). Heavy alcohol
consumption, like binge drinking, also seems to deepen feelings of
remorse during dry periods, and the person may be at risk even when
sober (Beers & Berkow, 1999). Many theorists have traditionally argued
that alcohol may lower inhibitions related to the fear of death and make
it easier to carry out the fatal act. Recent formulations, however,
suggest another explanation of the effects of alcohol: the strength of
the relationship between alcohol and suicide is the result of
alcohol-induced myopia (a constriction of cognitive and perceptual
processes; Rogers, 1992). Alcohol use by an individual in psychological
conflict may increase rather than decrease personal distress by focusing
his or her thoughts on negative aspects of his or her personal
situation. Steele and Josephs (1990) found that alcohol does constrict
cognitive and perceptual processes. Although alcohol-induced myopia may
relieve depression and anxiety by distracting the person from the
problem, it is equally likely to intensify the conflict and distress by
narrowing the person's focus on the problem. Thus the link between
alcohol and suicide may be the result of the myopic qualities of alcohol
exaggerating a previously existing constrictive state. If this is true,
alcohol is most likely to increase the probability of a suicide in an
already suicidal person.

Social Dimension Case Study Bill, You have killed me. I hope you are
happy in your heart, if you have one which I doubt. Please leave Rover
with Mike. Also leave my baby alone. If you don't I'll haunt you the
rest of your life and I mean it and I'll do it. You have been mean and
also cruel. God doesn't forget those things and don't forget that. And
please no ﬂowers; it won't mean anything. Also keep your money. I want
to be buried in Potter's Field in the same casket with Betty. You can do
that for me. That's the way we want it (Shneidman, 1968, pp. 5--8).

The influence of social factors in suicides is clearly evident in this
suicide note. There is great anger and resentment directed toward the
recipient of the note, leading us to conclude that the suicide is filled
with anger and retaliation. Indeed, psychodynamic theorists believe that
suicides are hostilities turned inward. Whether or not we accept the
Freudian interpretation, it is clear that many suicides are
interpersonal in nature and are influenced primarily by unfulfilled
wishes or needs involving a significant other (Jobes, 2006; Leenaars,
2008). Frustration, rage, manipulation, and attempts to elicit guilt or
even to alleviate guilt are common. There were many reasons why Bruno
Bettelheim chose to end his life, but one of the strongest was his
desire not to burden his family and friends with his increasing
dependency. And suicides and attempted suicides are often related to the
quality and nature of our social relationships with people. It has been
found that unhappiness over a broken or unhappy love affair, marital
discord, disputes with parents, and recent bereavements are correlated
with suicides (Rudd et al., 2004).

345

346

CHAPTER 12 • SUICIDE

Family instability and stress and a chaotic family atmosphere are
correlated with suicide attempts by younger children as well. Tammy
Jimenez, for example, took her own life because of feeling unloved and
abused by her father. Suicidal children seem to have experienced
unpredictable traumatic events and to have suffered the loss of a
significant parenting figure before age twelve. Intensive family
therapy, including the education of parents with regard to parenting
roles, can help. Social factors that operate to separate people or to
make them somehow less connected to other people or to their families,
to religious institutions, or to their communities can increase
susceptibility to suicide (Alcantara & Gone, 2008). Suicide prevention
measures, therefore, should be vastly more effective when social support
and connectedness are increased and when social isolation is decreased.
Conversely, we would expect rates to be higher among the elderly, as
their loved ones and friends die off and as they begin to disengage from
their work and other activities through retirement. We would also expect
that in the divorced, separated, or widowed population, suicide rates
would be higher than among those who are married. As we have seen, the
research literature supports all of these expectations.

Sociocultural Dimension As we saw earlier, rates of suicide vary with
age, gender, marital status, occupation, socioeconomic level, religion,
and ethnic group. Higher rates are associated with highand low-status
(as opposed to middle-status) occupations, with urban living, with being
a middle-aged man, with single or divorced status, and with upper and
lower socioeconomic classes (CDC Web-based Injury Statistics, 2005;
Jobes, 2006). In a pioneering work, the French sociologist Emile
Durkheim related differences in suicide rates to the impact of
sociocultural forces on the person (Durkheim, 1897/1951). From his
detailed study of suicides in different countries and across different
periods, he proposed one of the first sociocultural explanations of
suicide. In Durkheim's view, suicide can result from an inability to
integrate oneself with society. Failing to maintain close ties with the
community deprives the person of the support systems that are necessary
for adaptive functioning. Without such support, and unable to function
adaptively, the person becomes isolated and alienated from other people.
Some suicidologists believe that modern, mobile, and highly
technological society has deemphasized the importance of extended
families and the sense of community. The result, even among young
people, has been an increase in suicide rates. Suicides can also be
motivated by the person's desire to further group goals or to achieve
some greater good. Someone may give up his or her life for a higher
cause (in a religious sacrifice or the ultimate political protest, for
example). Group pressures may make such an act highly acceptable and
honored. During World War II, Japanese kamikaze pilots voluntarily dove
their airplanes into enemy warships "for the Emperor and the glory of
Japan." The self-immolation of Buddhist monks during the Vietnam War are
likewise in this category. Although likely to arouse considerable
disagreement, a strong case can be made that the suicide bombings now so
prevalent in the Middle East and in Iraq qualify for this category. From
the perspective of those who condone such acts, the perpetrators do not
perceive themselves as terrorists but as freedom fighters who willingly
give their lives for a greater good. Sociocultural factors have been
shown to account for the differential rates and manifestations of
suicides among Asian/Pacific AN ALTRUISTIC SUICIDE During the Vietnam
War, Americans (Leong & Leach, 2008), African Americans (Utsey, Stenard
people were horriﬁed by scenes of self-immolation & Hook, 2008),
Latino/Hispanic Americans (Duarte-Velez & Bernal, by Buddhist monks as a
form of protest against the 2008), Native Americans (Alcantara & Gone,
2008), and gays and government. This altruistic suicide in 1963 was
witnessed lesbians (Leach, 2006). As mentioned previously, American
Indians by passersby in the central market of Saigon.

Victims of Suicide

have much higher rates of suicide than are found among all other groups
in American society, including European Americans (except white males).
One in six American Indian teenagers has attempted suicide, a rate four
times higher than that of the general teenage population (Resnick,
Yehnuda, & Pitts, 1992). Among fifteen- to twenty-four-year-old American
Indian youths, the suicide rate (completed, not attempted) is twice that
for white youngsters. Asian American and Hispanic American rates are
significantly lower than that of the white group (Duarte-Velez & Bernal,
2008; Leong & Leach, 2008). Although rates for African American
youngsters have also been traditionally lower than for their white
counterparts, recent reports reveal a dramatic increase over the past
two decades (Utsey et al., 2008). Social change and disorganization,
which leads to a breakup in integration with one's community, often
predisposes a group to suicide. Suicidologists point to the
disorganization imposed on American Indians by Western society: deprived
of their lands, forced to live on reservations, and trapped between the
margins of two different cultural traditions, many American Indians
become alienated and isolated from both their own communities and the
larger society. Similarly, the increased suicide rate among African
American youths may be due to movement to middle-class life,
"accompanied by a splintering of community and family support networks,
a weakening of bonds to religion and the pressure of trying to compete
in historically white-dominated professions and social circles"
("Suicide Rate Climbing for Black Teens," 1998, p. A17).

347

SUICIDE BOMBINGS These events have become an all too common sight in
Iraq. In the aftermath of a suicide bombing in Baghdad on April 2007,
two men try desperately to move a car away to clear the way for help.
The incident was triggered by a suicide truck bomb in an attempt to
destroy a satellite television station to take as many lives as
possible.

Victims of Suicide In this section we briefly discuss two groups of
people who are especially victimized by suicide: the very young and the
elderly. It is important, however, to realize that those who are left
behind may be considered victims as well. Indeed, it is estimated that
for every suicide, six others are intimately affected as survivors
(family members and friends; CDC Web-based Injury Statistics, 2005).

Children and Adolescents Suicide among the young is an unmentioned
tragedy in our society. We have traditionally avoided the idea that some
of our young people find life so painful that they consciously and
deliberately take their own lives. As in the case of Tammy Jimenez, it
may feel easier to call a suicide "an accident." The suicide rate for
children younger than fourteen is increasing at an alarming rate, and
the rate for adolescents is rising even faster. Among fifteen- to
twenty-four-year-olds, 73 percent of suicides are committed by white
males, but the rise in suicides is most rapid among black males (CDC,
2007e; CDC Web-based Injury Statistics, 2005). Suicide is now second
only to automobile accidents as the leading cause of death among
teenagers, and some automobile "accidents" may also really be suicides
(Rudd et al., 2004). In one Gallup poll of teenage respondents, 6
percent admitted to a suicide attempt, and another 15 percent said they
had come close to trying (Freiberg, 1991). Experts on adolescent
suicide, however, believe these to be gross underestimates (Berman,
2006). The Gallup Organization polled middle-class families (median
family income of \$41,500) and thus missed certain high-risk groups,
such as school dropouts. The Gallup study suggested that between 8 and 9
percent of teenagers have engaged in self-harming behavior. Figures
reveal that officially recorded suicides for young people between the
ages of fifteen and twenty-four are more than triple the rate in 1957
(Freiberg, 1991; Maris et al., 2000).

348

CHAPTER 12 • SUICIDE

The clinical symptoms most often shown by both children and adolescents
are changes in mood and aggressiveness, hostility, or both. Most suicide
attempts (73 percent) occurred at home, 12 percent in public areas, 7
percent at school, and 5 percent at a friend's house (Garfinkel, Froese,
& Hood, 1982; United States Public Health Service, 1991). In 87 percent
of the suicide attempts, someone else was nearby---generally parents.
The fact that most suicide attempts occur at home implies that parents
are in the best position to recognize and prevent suicidal behavior.
Drug overdose was the primary means of attempted suicide, accounting for
88 percent of the attempts. Next, in order, were wrist laceration,
hanging, and jumping from heights or in front of moving vehicles.
Families of suicidal children are generally under greater economic
stress and have twice the rate TEENS AND SUICIDE As more and more teens

that are preoccupied with economic concerns are less suicide among high
school students is reaching epidemic proportions. To readily available
to support their children in time prevent more suicides, schools
sometimes initiate programs to help students of need. Furthermore, fewer
than half the families and faculty cope with their feelings of loss and
anger. of those who attempted suicide were two-parent families. The
families of suicide attempters also had higher rates of medical
problems, psychiatric illness, and suicide than did the control group
families. The dominant psychiatric problem was alcohol or drug abuse
(Cosand, Bourque, & Kraus, 1982). Copycat Suicides Considerable
attention has been directed at multiple or so-called copycat suicides
(suicide contagion), in which youngsters in a particular school or
community seem to mimic a previous suicide (Alcantara & Gone, 2008;
Phillips, Van Voorhees, & Ruth, 1992). For example, within a three-month
period in 1985, nine youths ages fourteen to twenty-five killed
themselves, all by hanging. All were members of the Shoshone tribe, and
all lived in Wind River, Wyoming. In another incident in Omaha,
Nebraska, seven high school students attempted suicide within a very
short span of time; three were successful. Likewise, the Bergenfield,
New Jersey, suicides grabbed headlines in 1987, when two male and two
female students killed themselves by inhaling fumes from their car.
Their deaths followed that of a friend who had also committed suicide.
This event was unusual because the four signed a suicide pact on a brown
paper bag. Tragically, their deaths were in turn followed by those of
two other young women, who used the same method of death ("Suicide
Belt," 1986). More recently, New York University student Joanne Michelle
Leavy leaped to her death from a twelve-story building on September 6,
2004. This would not have been noticed on a national level were it not
that it represented the sixth fatal fall by students leaping to their
deaths in the preceding year (Swindler, 2004). Although many events,
beliefs, and feelings may have contributed to these tragic deaths,
suggestion and imitation seem to have played an especially powerful
role. Young people may be especially vulnerable, but studies indicate
that highly publicized suicides---such as those of a celebrity, close
friend, relative, coworker, or other well-known person---can increase
the number of subsequent suicide attempts (Gould, 2007; Stack, 1987). As
we noted earlier, in the months following Marilyn Monroe's death,
suicides increased by some 12 percent. When Nirvana's Kurt Cobain
committed suicide in 1994, many youth counselors warned about potential
imitations by fans. Thus it appears that grief, depression, and mourning
are not the culprits that induce copycat behaviors. Although imitative
suicides may not be as common as the media suggest, research has
indicated that publicizing the event may have the effect of glorifying
and drawing

Victims of Suicide

349

attention to it. Thus depressed people may identify with a colorful
portrayal, increasing the risk of even more suicides. This pattern
appears to be especially true for youngsters who may already be thinking
about killing themselves. The stable, welladjusted teenager does not
seem to be at risk in these situations. Adolescence and young adulthood
are often periods of confusing emotions, identity formation, and
questioning. It is a difficult and turbulent time for most teenagers,
and suicide may seem to be a logical response to the pain and stress of
growing up. A suicide that occurs in school brings increased risk of
other suicides because of its proximity to students' daily lives. In
such instances, a suicide prevention program should be implemented to
let students vent their feelings in an environment equipped to respond
appropriately---and perhaps even to save their lives. Encouragingly,
approximately 41 percent of schools have programs aimed at suicide
prevention (professional counseling services, peer counseling, and
special seminars). It is no longer unusual to hear about school programs
that are immediately implemented when a tragedy strikes (such as student
suicide, violent death of a student or teacher, or natural disaster, for
example; Freiberg, 1991).

Elderly People Aging inevitably results in generally unwelcome physical
changes, such as wrinkling and thickening skin, graying hair, and
diminishing physical strength. In addition, we all encounter a
succession of stressful life changes as we grow older. Friends and
relatives die, social isolation may increase, and the prospect of death
becomes more real. Mandatory retirement rules may lead to the need for
financial assistance and the difficulties of living on a fixed and
inadequate income. Such conditions make depression one of the most
common psychiatric complaints of elderly people. And their depression
seems to be involved more with "feeling old" than with their actual age
or poor physical health (Rosenfeld, 2004). Suicide seems to accompany
depression for older people. Their suicide rates (especially rates for
elderly white American men) are higher than those for the general
population (McIntosh, 1992); indeed, suicide rates for elderly white men
are the highest for any age group (CDC Web-based Injury Statistics,
2005). From 1980 through 1997, the largest relative increases in suicide
rates occurred among those eighty to eighty-four years of age. Firearms
were the most common method of suicide for both men and women sixty-five
years or older. The elderly make fewer attempts per completed suicide,
being among the most likely to succeed in taking their lives. In one
study comparing rates of suicide among different ethnic groups, it was
found that elderly white Americans committed almost 18 percent of all
suicides, although they composed only about 11 percent of the
population. Suicide rates for elderly Chinese Americans, Japanese
Americans, and Filipino Americans are even higher than the rate for
elderly white Americans. American Indians and African Americans show the
lowest rates of suicide among older adults (although both groups are at
high risk for suicide during young adulthood). Of the Asian American
groups, first-generation immigrants were at greatest risk of suicide.
One possible explanation for this finding is that newly arrived Asian
immigrants intended to earn money and then return to their native
countries. When they found they were unable to earn enough either to
return home or to bring their families to the United States, they
developed A MATTER OF RESPECT Suicide is less likely to occur among

CHAPTER 12 • SUICIDE

Preventing Suicide In almost every case of suicide, there are hints that
the act is about to occur. Suicide is irreversible, of course, so
preventing it depends very much on early detection and successful
intervention (Comtois & Linehan, 2006; Klott & Jongsma, 2004). Mental
health professionals involved in suicide prevention efforts operate
under the assumption that potential victims are ambivalent about the
act. That is, the wish to die is strong, but there is also a wish to
live. Potential rescuers are trained to exert their efforts to preserve
life. Part of their success in the prevention process is the ability to
assess a client's suicide lethality---the probability that a person will
choose to end his or her life (Bryan & Rudd, 2006; Rudd et al., 2004).

Preventing Suicide

Working with a potentially suicidal individual is a three-step process
that involves (1) knowing which factors are highly correlated with
suicide; (2) determining whether there is high, moderate, or low
probability that the person will act on the suicide wish; and (3)
implementing appropriate actions (Canapary et al., 2002; see Table
12.3). People trained in working with suicidal clients often attempt to
quantify the "seriousness" of each factor. For example, a person with a
clear suicidal plan who has the means (e.g., a gun) to carry out a
suicide threat is considered to be in a more lethal state than a
recently divorced and depressed person.

Clues to Suicidal Intent The prevention of suicide depends very much on
the therapist's ability to recognize its signs. Clues to suicidal intent
may be demographic or specific. We have already discussed a number of
demographic factors, such as the fact that men are three times more
likely to kill themselves than are women and that increased age is
associated with an increased probability of suicide (Bryan & Rudd,
2006). And, although the popular notion is that frequent suicidal
gestures are associated with less serious intent, most suicides do have
a history of making suicide threats; to ignore them is extremely
dangerous. Any suicidal threat or intent must be taken seriously
(Berman, 2006). General characteristics often help detect potential
suicides, but individual cases vary from statistical norms. What does
one look for in specific instances? The amount of detail involved in a
suicide threat can indicate its seriousness. A person who provides
specific details, such as method, time, and place, is more at risk than
one who describes these factors vaguely. Suicidal potential increases if
the person has direct access to the means of suicide, such as a loaded
pistol. Also, sometimes a suicide may be preceded by a precipitating
event. The loss of a loved one, family discord, or chronic or terminal
illness may contribute to a person's decision to end his or her life. A
person contemplating suicide may verbally communicate the intent. Some
people make very direct statements: "I'm going to kill myself," "I want
to die," or "If such and such happens, I'll kill myself." Others make
indirect threats: "Goodbye," "I've had it," "You'd be better off without
me," and "It's too much to put up with." On the other hand, some cues
are frequently very subtle. Behavioral clues can be communicated
directly or indirectly. The most direct clue is a "practice run," an
actual suicide attempt. Even if the act is not completed, it should be
taken seriously; it often communicates deep suicidal intent that may be
carried out in the future. Indirect behavioral clues can include actions
such as putting one's affairs in order, taking a lengthy trip, giving
away prized possessions, buying a casket, or making out a will,
depending on the circumstances. In other words, the more unusual or
peculiar the situation, the more likely it is that the action is a cue
to suicide. Clinicians often divide up warning signs into two
categories: (1) early signs, such as depression, statements or
expressions of guilt feelings, tension or anxiety, nervousness,
insomnia, loss of appetite, loss of weight, and impulsiveness; and (2)
critical signs, such as sudden changes in behavior (calmness after a
period of anxiety), giving away belongings or putting affairs in order,
direct or indirect threats, and actual attempts.

Crisis Intervention Suicide prevention can occur at several levels, and
the mental health profession has now begun to move in several
coordinated directions to establish prevention efforts. At the clinical
level, attempts are being made to educate staff at mental health
institutions and even at schools to recognize conditions and symptoms
that indicate potential suicides (Kaslow & Aronson, 2004). For example,
a single man older than fifty years of age suffering from a sudden acute
onset of depression and expressing hopelessness should be recognized by
mental health professionals as being at high risk. When a psychiatric
facility encounters someone who fits a particular risk profile for
suicide, crisis intervention strategies will most likely be used to
abort or ameliorate the processes that could lead to a suicide attempt.
Crisis intervention is aimed at providing intensive short-term help to a
patient in resolving an immediate life crisis. Unlike traditional
psychotherapy, in which sessions are spaced out and treatment is
provided on a more leisurely long-term basis, crisis intervention
recognizes the immediacy of

THE PROCESS OF PREVENTING SUICIDE Suicide prevention involves the
careful assessment of risk factors to determine lethality---the
probability that a person will choose to end his or her life. Working
with a potentially suicidal individual is a three-step process that
involves (1) knowing what factors are highly correlated with suicide;
(2) determining whether there is high, moderate, or low probability that
the person will act on the wish; and (3) implementing appropriate
actions.

the patient's state of mind. The patient may be immediately
hospitalized, given medical treatment, and seen by a psychiatric team
for two to four hours every day until the person is stabilized and the
immediate crisis has passed. In these sessions, the team is very active
not only in working with the patient but also in taking charge of the
person's personal, social, and professional life outside of the
psychiatric facility. Many suicide intervention strategies have been
developed through clinical work rather than research because the nature
of suicide demands immediate action (Bryan & Rudd, 2006). Waiting for
empirical studies is not a luxury the clinician can afford. Figure 12.4
summarizes the process of assessing risk and determining lethality.
After patients return to a more stable emotional state and the immediate
risk of suicide has passed, they are then given more traditional forms
of treatment, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. In addition to
the intense therapy they receive from the psychiatric team, relatives
and friends may be enlisted to help monitor patients when they leave the
hospital. In these cases, the responsible relatives or friends are
provided with specific guidelines about how to deal with the patient
between treatment team contacts, whom to notify should problems arise
outside of the hospital, and so forth.

Suicide Prevention Centers Crisis intervention can be highly successful
if a potentially suicidal patient is either already being treated by a
therapist or has come to the attention of one through the efforts of
concerned family or friends. Many people in acute distress, however, are
not formally being treated. Although contact with a mental health agency
may be highly desirable, many people are unaware of the services
available to them. Recognizing that suicidal crises may occur at any
time and that preventive assistance on a much larger scale may be
needed, a number of communities have established suicide prevention
centers. The first suicide prevention center was established in Los
Angeles in 1958 by psychologists Norman L. Farberow and Edwin S.
Shneidman. The center first sought patients from the wards of hospitals.
Soon, however, its reputation grew, and in little more than a decade, 99
percent of its contacts were by phone (Farberow, 1970). In the past
forty years, hundreds of suicide prevention centers patterned after the
first one have sprung up throughout the United States. These centers are
generally adapted to the particular needs of the communities they serve,
but they all share certain operational procedures and goals. Telephone
Crisis Intervention Suicide prevention centers typically operate
twentyfour hours a day, seven days a week. Because most suicide contacts
are by phone, a wellpublicized telephone number is made available
throughout the community for calls at any time of the day or night.
Furthermore, many centers provide inpatient or outpatient crisis
treatment. Those that lack such resources develop cooperative programs
with other community mental health facilities. Most telephone hot lines
are staffed by paraprofessionals. All workers have been exposed to
crisis situations under supervision and have been trained in crisis
intervention techniques such as the following: 1. Maintain contact and
establish a relationship. The skilled worker who establishes a good
relationship with the suicidal caller not only increases the caller's
chances of working out an alternative solution but also can exert more
influence. Thus it is important for the worker to show interest,
concern, and self-assurance. 2. Obtain necessary information. The worker
elicits demographic data and the caller's name and address. This
information is very valuable in case an urgent need arises to locate the
caller. 3. Evaluate suicidal potential. The staff person taking the call
must quickly determine the seriousness of the caller's self-destructive
intent. Most centers use lethality rating scales to help the worker
determine suicide potential. These usually contain questions on age,
gender, onset of symptoms, situational plight, prior suicidal behavior,
and the communication qualities of the caller. Staffers also elicit
other demographic and specific information that might provide clues to
lethality, such as the information discussed in the section on clues to
suicidal intent. 4. Clarify the nature of the stress and focal problem.
The worker must help callers to clarify the exact nature of their
stress, to recognize that they may be under so much duress that their
thinking may be confused and impaired, and to realize that there are
other solutions besides suicide. Callers are often disoriented, so the
worker must be specific to help bring them back to reality. 5. Assess
strengths and resources. In working out a therapeutic plan, the worker
can often mobilize a caller's strengths or available resources.
INTERVENING BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE Suicide In their agitation, suicidal
people tend to forget their own strengths. prevention centers (SPCs)

CHAPTER 12 • SUICIDE

6.  Recommend and initiate an action plan. Besides being supportive, the
    worker is highly directive in recommending a course of action.
    Whether the recommendation entails immediately seeing the person,
    calling the person's family, or referring the person to a social
    agency the next day, the worker presents a plan of action and
    outlines it step by step. This list implies a rigid sequence, but in
    fact both the approach and the order of the steps are adjusted to
    fit the needs of the individual caller. The Effectiveness of Suicide
    Prevention Centers Today, approximately two hundred suicide
    prevention centers function in the United States, along with
    numerous "suicide hot lines" in mental health clinics. Little
    research has been done on their effectiveness, however, and many of
    their clients want to remain anonymous. Nevertheless, some data are
    available, although dated. One early study indicates that 95 percent
    of callers to suicide prevention centers never use the service again
    (Speer, 1971). This finding may indicate that the service was so
    helpful that no further treatment was needed or, just as possibly,
    that callers do not find the centers helpful and feel it is useless
    to call again. Worse yet, they may have killed themselves after the
    contact. Another study has shown that potential suicides do not
    perceive contact with a prevention center as more helpful than
    discussion with friends (Speer, 1972). And if the justification for
    such centers is based on their ability to offer services to a large
    number of clients, then the fact that only 2 percent of the people
    who kill themselves ever contact such a service is disturbing
    (Weiner, 1969). Furthermore, studies of cities with hot line
    services provide mixed findings (Lester, 1989, 1991). Some studies
    found that suicides decreased in a community with hot line services
    (Miller, Coombs, & Leeper, 1984), some found no change (Barraclough,
    Jennings, & Moss, 1977), and others found an increase (Weiner,
    1969). However, in cities without prevention centers, the rates
    increased even more (Lester, 1991). Despite the conflicting
    evidence, there is always the possibility that suicide prevention
    centers do help. Because life is precious, the mental health
    profession continues to support them.

The Right to Suicide: Moral, Ethical, and Legal Issues The following
letter captured worldwide attention when a twenty-one-year-old
paraplegic, Vincent Humbert, wrote a special appeal to French President
Jacques Chirac asking to end his own life:

Case Study Mr. Chirac, My respects to you, Mr. President. My name is
Vincent Humbert, I am 21. I was in a trafﬁc accident on 24 September
2000. I spent nine months in a coma. I am currently in Helio-Marins
hospital in Berck, in the Pas-de-Calais region. All my vital organs were
affected, except for my hearing and my brain, which allows me a little
comfort. I can move my right hand very slightly, putting pressure with
my thumb on each letter of the alphabet. These letters make up words and
the words form sentences. This is my only method of communication. I
currently have a nurse beside me, who spells me the alphabet separating
vowels and consonants. This is how I have decided to write you. The
doctors have decided to send me to a specialised clinic. You have the
right of pardon and I am asking you for the right to die. I would like
to do this clearly for myself but especially for my mother; she has left
her old life to be by my side, here in Berck, working morning and
evening after visiting me, seven days out of seven, without a day of
rest. And all this to be able to pay the rent for her miserable studio
ﬂat. For the moment she is still young. But in a few years, she will not
be able to keep up such a pace of work, that is to say she will not be
able to pay her rent and so will be obliged to go back to her apartment
in Normandy.

355

But it is impossible to imagine my remaining here without her by my
side, and I think that all patients who are sound of mind are
responsible for their actions and have the right to want to continue to
live or to die. I would like you to know that you are my last chance.
You should also know that I was a fellow citizen without a history,
without any judicial record, a sportsman and a volunteer ﬁreman. I do
not deserve a scenario as terrible as this and I hope that you will read
this letter, which is specially addressed to you. Please accept,
Mr. President, my warmest compliments.

In September 2003, after the release of his book I Ask the Right to Die,
Vincent Humbert's mother administered an overdose of sedatives into his
intravenous line, causing his death (Smith, 2003). The case of Vincent
Humbert set off a national debate about the morality and legality of
euthanasia. Do people have the right to end their own lives if their
continued existence would result in psychological and physical
deterioration? Surveys of the American public indicate that a majority
believe terminally ill individuals should be allowed to take their own
lives; in a 1995 survey of physicians working with AIDS patients, over
half indicated that they have prescribed lethal doses of narcotics to
suicidal patients (Clay, 1997; Drane, 1995). Advocates contend that
people should be allowed the choice of dying in a dignified manner,
particularly if they suffer from a terminal or severely incapacitating
illness that would cause misery for their families and friends
(Rosenfeld, 2004). The act of suicide seems to violate much of what we
have been taught regarding the sanctity of life. Many segments of the
population consider it immoral and provide strong religious sanctions
against it. Suicide is both a sin in the canonical law of the Catholic
Church and an illegal act according to the secular laws of most
countries. Within the United States, many states have laws against
suicide, and some consider it illegal. Of course, such laws are
difficult to enforce because the victims are not around to prosecute.
Many are beginning to question the legitimacy of such sanctions,
however, and are openly advocating a person's right to suicide. In 1976,
the California State Assembly became one of the first state legislatures
to provide that right to people with terminal illnesses. Since then,
many other states have passed "living will" laws that offer protection
against dehumanized dying and confer immunity on physicians and hospital
personnel who comply with a patient's wishes. In November 1998, Oregon
voters passed a physician-assisted suicide act granting physicians the
legal right to help end the lives of terminally ill patients. In 2001,
however, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft issued a directive intended
to overturn the law. In May 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit upheld Oregon's law, ruling that the attorney general
had overstepped his authority in trying to punish doctors who prescribed
suicide drugs. Recent legislation has intensified the debate over
whether it is morally, ethically, and legally permissible to allow
relatives, friends, or physicians to provide support, means, and actions
to carry out a suicide (Rosenfeld, 2004). Two highprofile individuals
have fueled the debate by virtue of their actions. Derek Humphrey,
former director of the Hemlock Society (an organization that advocates
people's right to end their lives), published a best-selling book, Final
Exit (1991). It is a manual that provides practical information, such as
drug dosages needed to end one's life; when published, it created a
national stir. Another individual who has become a household name is
Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a physician who has helped nearly 130 people to end
their own lives using a device he calls a "suicide machine." Those who
see Kevorkian as a courageous physician willing to help others in their
search for a dignified death call him a savior; those who oppose his
actions refer to him as "Dr. Death." Ironically, the success of medical
science has added fuel to the right-to-die movement. As a part of our
remarkably successful efforts to prolong life, this society has also
begun to prolong the process of dying. And this prolongation has caused

identiﬁed themselves as foes of individual liberty and responsibility.

Do People Have a Right to Die?

O

n November 22, 1998, over 15 million viewers of 60 Minutes watched in
either horror or sadness the death by lethal injection of
ﬁfty-two-year-old Thomas Youk. This was not, however, a death sentence
carried out for a murder conviction but the enactment of a conscious
desire and decision of a man suffering from the latter stages of Lou
Gehrig's disease. Youk's wife stated she was "so grateful to know that
someone would relieve him of his suffering. . . . I consider it the way
things should be done." The man who videotaped the event was Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, a retired physician, who has carried on a ten-year battle
with the U.S. legal system and society over the right to die. It is
estimated that, since 1989, Kevorkian has assisted in the suicides of
nearly 130 people (most of them women) with chronic debilitating
diseases. The means of death was Kevorkian's "suicide machine," composed
of bottles containing chemicals that could be fed intravenously into the
arm of the person. The solution could bring instantaneous
unconsciousness and quick painless death. His ﬁrst client, Mrs. J.
Adkins, suffered from Alzheimer's disease. She did not want to put her
family through the agony of the disease, believed that she had a right
to choose death, stated that her act was that of a rational mind, and
had the consent of her husband. Many others whom Kevorkian helped commit
suicide did not have diseases that threatened to kill them in the
immediate future. Before the CBS taping, charges of homicide had been
brought against Kevorkian four previous times, and in each case either
the charges were ultimately dropped or he was found innocent. Because of
his actions, a Michigan law outlawing "physician-assisted suicides" was
passed and used to charge him with manslaughter. Prosecutors contended
that Kevorkian's actions in the death of Youk went far beyond what many
consider "assistance." Because Thomas Youk

administer the dose himself, Kevorkian administered it for him. For that
act, in 1999, the retired physician was charged with and convicted of

a controlled substance. After serving eight years in prison, he was
released in 2007 because of failing health after promising not to engage
in assisted suicides. For Further Consideration 1. Did Thomas Youk have

Why or why not?

many elderly or terminally ill people to fear the medical decision maker
who is intent only on keeping them alive, giving no thought to their
desires or dignity. They and many others find it abhorrent to impose on
a dying patient a horrifying array of respirators, breathing tubes,
feeding tubes, and repeated violent cardiopulmonary
resuscitations---procedures that are often futile and against the wishes
of the patient and his or her family. Humane and sensitive physicians,
who believe that the resulting quality of life will not merit such
heroic measures but whose training impels them to sustain life, are
caught in the middle of this conflict. A civil or criminal lawsuit may
be brought against the physician who agrees to allow a patient to die.
Proponents of the right to suicide believe that it can be a rational act
and that mental health and medical professionals should be allowed to
help such patients without fear of legal or professional repercussions
(Corey, 2001; Rosenfeld, 2004; Werth, 1996). Others argue, however, that
suicide is not rational or that determining rationality is fraught with
hazards. They cite studies indicating that suicide is a symptom of
mental illness and that allowing this final act may result in "a duty to
die" (Hendin, 1995; Seale & Addington-Hall, 1995). Some are voicing the
fear that one result of legalizing suicide may be that patients will
fall victim to coercion from

relatives intent either on collecting inheritances or on convincing
patients that they will overburden their loved ones and friends or
become a financial drain on them. Other critics of assisted suicide fear
that in this time of medical cost control, medical professionals might
encourage the terminally ill to choose to die and that those who are
poor and disadvantaged would receive the most encouragement (Werth,
1996). Major problems also exist in defining the subjective terms
quality of life and quality of humanness as the criteria for deciding
between life and death. At what point do we consider the quality of life
sufficiently poor to justify terminating it? Should people who have been
severely injured or scarred (through loss of limbs, paralysis,
blindness, or brain injury) be allowed to end their own lives? What
about mentally retarded or emotionally disturbed people? Could it be
argued that their quality of life is equally poor? Moreover, who will
decide whether a person is or is not terminally ill? There are many
recorded cases of "incurable" patients who recovered when new medical
techniques or treatments arrested, remitted, or cured their illnesses.
Such questions deal with ethics and human values, and they cannot be
answered easily. Yet the mental health practitioner cannot avoid these
questions. Like their medical counterparts, clinicians are trained to
save people's lives. They have accepted the philosophical assumption
that life is better than death and that no one has a right to take his
or her own life. Strong social, religious, and legal sanctions support
this belief. Therapists work not only with terminally ill clients who
wish to take their own lives but also with disturbed clients who may
have suicidal tendencies. These latter clients are not terminally ill
but may be suffering severe emotional or physical pain; their deaths
would bring immense pain and suffering to their loved ones. Moreover, as
noted previously, most people who attempt suicide do not want to die,
are ambivalent about the act, or find that their suicidal urges pass
when their life situations improve (Bongar, 1991, 1992; Clay, 1997).
Clearly, suicide and suicide prevention involve a number of important
social and legal issues, as well as the personal value systems of
clients and their families, mental health professionals, and those who
devise and enforce our laws (Rosenfeld, 2004). And just as clearly, we
need to know much more about the causes of suicide and the detection of
people who are at high risk for suicide, as well as the most effective
means of intervention (Rudd et al., 2004). Life is precious, and we need
to do everything possible, within reason, to protect it.

There is a saying that goes like this: "We know much about suicide but
we know very little about it." Although this may sound contradictory,
this chapter has been filled with an impressive array of facts,
statistics, and information about many aspects of suicide. We are able
to construct fairly accurate portraits of individuals most as risk,
delineate protective factors, and even develop intervention strategies
in working with suicidal individuals. We know that people commit suicide
for many reasons. We know that biological, psychological, social, and
sociocultural factors are related to suicides. Yet suicide continues to
be a mystery. We are not sure that our explanations, formed from the
many correlates of suicide, are accurate. Although we believe strongly
in the multipath model, we know little about how the four major
dimensions of suicide interact with one another nor whether one is more
important than the other and under which conditions. For example,
sociocultural explanations may be valid to an extent, but attributing
suicide to a single sociological factor (race, culture, gender, economic
class, place of residence, or occupation) is too simplistic and
mechanistic. As we have noted throughout this text, correlations do not
imply cause-and-effect relationships. Purely sociocultural explanations
that take into account only one sociocultural factor---group cohesion,
for example---omit the psychological dimension of the person's inner
struggles (psychological dimension) or his or her biological makeup
(biological dimension). They fail to explain why only certain members of
a group commit suicide and others do not. Hopefully, future research
will begin to add clarity to our question: Why do people commit suicide?

relatives and friends of the victim did not speak of it. Mental health
professionals now realize that understanding the causes of suicide is
extremely important. ■ Much is known about the facts of suicide, but

frequent method used.

increased at an alarming rate. A lack of research has limited our
understanding of why children take their own lives. ■ Many people tend
to become depressed about "feeling old" as they age, and depressed
elderly people often think about suicide.

2.  What are the major explanations of suicide? ■ In keeping with the
    multipath model, suicides appear to be an interaction of biological,
    psychological, social, and sociocultural factors. ■ More recent
    evidence has indicated that biological factors may be important:
    genetics and biochemical factors are implicated in suicides. ■
    Psychological factors include mental disturbance, depression,
    hopelessness, and excessive alcohol consumption; all are highly
    correlated with suicide. ■ Lack of positive social relationships can
    lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection. The elderly are
    prone to the loss of loved ones and friends, and divorce or lack of
    a life partner increases the chances of suicide. ■ Sociocultural
    factors such as race, culture, ethnicity, social class, gender, and
    other such demographic variables can either increase or decrease the
    risk of suicide. ■ The complex relationship between these four
    dimensions and suicide is not simply one of cause and effect but of
    an interaction among them.

4.  How can we intervene or prevent suicides? ■ Perhaps the best way to
    prevent suicide is to recognize its signs and intervene before it
    occurs. People are more likely to commit suicide if they are older,
    male, have a history of attempts, describe in detail how the act
    will be accomplished, and give verbal hints that they are planning
    self-destruction. ■ Crisis intervention concepts and techniques have
    been

used successfully to treat clients who contemplate suicide. Intensive
short-term therapy is used to stabilize the immediate crisis. ■ Suicide
prevention centers operate twenty-four hours a day to provide
intervention services to all potential suicides, especially people who
are not undergoing treatment. Telephone hot lines are staffed by
welltrained paraprofessionals who will work with anyone who is
contemplating suicide. In addition, these centers provide preventive
education to the public. 5. Are there times and situations in which
suicide should be an option? ■ This question is difficult to answer,
particularly when the person is terminally ill and wishes to end his or
her suffering. Nevertheless, therapists, like physicians, have been
trained to preserve life, and they have a legal obligation to do so.

Schizophrenia: Diagnosis, Etiology, and Treatment

A

t the age of eight, Elyn Saks had already begun to suffer from the
hallucinations and the fears of being attacked that accompanied her
throughout her life. Only through self-control could she hide the impact
of delusional thoughts and hallucinations while maintaining top grades
in college. Even with these disturbing thoughts, Elyn still vaguely
understood the importance of not talking about what ran through her
mind. When she entered graduate school, she had full-blown psychotic
episodes (believing that someone had inﬁltrated her research; dancing on
the roof of the law library) that resulted in her being hospitalized and
diagnosed with schizophrenia. She believed her therapist was replaced by
an evil person with an identical appearance. In her book The Center
Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness, she recounts her lifelong
struggle with mental illness, describing schizophrenia as a "slow fog"
that becomes thicker over time (Saks, 2007). Elyn's struggle with the
disorder, as well as her experience of forced treatment, resulted in her
interest in mental health and the law. Her doctors had painted a bleak
picture of her future. They believed that she would not complete her
degree nor be able to hold a job or get married. However, Elyn Saks did
get married and is an associate dean and professor of law, psychology,
and psychiatry at the University of Southern California.

Schizophrenia is a group of disorders characterized by severely impaired
cognitive processes, personality disintegration, affective disturbances,
and social withdrawal. Like Elyn Saks, people with schizophrenia may
lose contact with reality, may see or hear things that are not actually
present, or may develop false beliefs about themselves or others.
According to the DSM-IV-TR criteria (American Psychiatric Association,
2000a), a diagnosis of schizophrenic disorder includes symptoms such as
delusions, auditory hallucinations, or marked disturbances in thinking,
affect, or speech (see Table 13.1). The patient must also have
deteriorated from a previous level of functioning in areas such as work,

relationships, or self-care. Diagnosis requires symptoms to have been
present most of the time for at least one month, and some of the time
for at least six months. Organic mental disorders and affective
disorders must be ruled out as causes of the patient's symptoms.
Schizophrenia receives a great deal of attention for several reasons.
For one, it can be a severely disabling disorder that has a profound
impact on the individual and on family members and friends. The
prognosis is often much different from the productive life experienced
by Elyn Saks. In the following first-person account, Eric Sundstrom
presents a personal perspective on the changes he witnessed in his older
sister after she developed schizophrenia.

Case Study My family spent 3 years in Holland when my sister was in
middle school. I think she was truly happy then, forming friendships and
teaching me about the things she loved. It seems incredible she was once
an ordinary girl, full of vibrant personality. I still remember how she
taught me to read, using a now-ancient copy of The Cat in the Hat. When
our family returned to America, all of her friends signed the clogs for
her to remember them by. The clogs and a few memories are my only window
into who she was then and who she should be now. (Sundstrom, 2004,
p. 191)

Eric recalls how his sister developed delusions and violent behavior
during her sophomore year in high school. Auditory hallucinations
insulted her and commanded her to break things. One day, after a change
of medication resulted in an intensification of symptoms, his sister
destroyed items around the house and had to be hospitalized. After he
and his brother cleaned up the broken glass, they ate dinner in silence
and realized that their sister had baked quiche for them; one side
filled with vegetables for his brother and the other side plain for him.
For the relatives of individuals with schizophrenia, the psychotic
symptoms shown by their loved ones can be confusing, frightening, and
heart wrenching. At times, reality becomes so distorted that those
affected by schizophrenia cannot trust their own perceptions and
thoughts. Schizophrenia also receives considerable attention because the
financial costs of hospitalization, treatment, and loss of productivity
caused by schizophrenia are huge---estimated to be 62.7 billion dollars
annually (Wu et al., 2005). And the lifetime prevalence rate of
schizophrenia in the United States is about 1 percent, so it affects
millions of people (McGrath, 2005; National Institute of Mental Health
\[NIMH\], 2007e). In addition, the causes of schizophrenia are not well
understood, and it has been difficult to find effective treatments.
Although

The Symptoms of Schizophrenia

361

DSM-IV-TR tries to present schizophrenia as a distinct disorder,
evidence suggests that it is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with
different etiologies and outcomes (Braff, 2007; Heinrichs, 1993; Roth et
al., 2004). Although many individuals with schizophrenia do not recover
from the illness, some do, as in the case of Elyn Saks. Indeed, there is
currently a move away from the view that schizophrenia is a chronic
disorder with an inevitably poor prognosis. In fact, there has been
recent attention to a recovery model that strives for substantial return
of function for many individuals with schizophrenia. The recovery model
views schizophrenia as a chronic medical condition, such as diabetes or
heart disease, in which there might be interference with optimal
functioning but in which the condition does not define the individual.
The recovery model is based on the following assumptions regarding
schizophrenia (Bellack, 2006): 1. Recovery or improvement in functioning
is possible. 2. Healing involves separating one's identity from the
illness and developing the ability to cope with the symptoms. 3.
Empowerment of the individual helps correct the sense of powerlessness
and dependence that results from traditional mental health care. 4.
Establishing or strengthening social connections with others can
facilitate healing. The recovery model has resulted in comprehensive
action with respect to schizophrenia that includes fighting policies
that neglect the rights of individuals with the disorder, identifying
the impact of stigma and discrimination on mental health, and promoting
healing, growth, and respect for patients (Glynn et al., 2006). In this
chapter, we present findings regarding the diagnosis, etiology, and
treatment of schizophrenia.

The Symptoms of Schizophrenia

FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE Elyn Saks has written about the forced treatment
of the mentally ill based, in part, on her experiences. She teaches
mental health law, has academic appointments at the University of
Southern California and the University of California, San Diego, and is
the associate dean at USC. She is training to be a psychoanalyst.

The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three categories: positive
symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive symptoms.

Positive Symptoms Positive symptoms of schizophrenia involve unusual
thoughts or perceptions such as delusions, hallucinations, thought
disorder (shifting and unrelated ideas that produce incoherent
communication), and bizarre behavior. These symptoms increase with
stress and tend to disappear with treatment. They differ in intensity as
a function of stressors and are also influenced by an individual's mood
state (Smith et al., 2006). Delusions Delusions are false personal
beliefs that are firmly and consistently held despite disconfirming
evidence or logic. Delusions reflect a loss of distinction between one's
private thoughts and external reality. In the following case of Erin,
his therapists are trying to determine how a graduate student in
neuroscience could not understand the illogic behind his belief that
rats were inside his brain and consuming a section of his brain.

Case Study "Erin, you are a scientist," they'd begin. "You are
intelligent, rational. Tell me then, how can you believe that there are
rats inside your brain? They're just too big. Besides, how could they
get in?" (Stefanidis, 2006, p. 422)

Erin did retain some rational ability. He reasoned that he would soon
lose the function controlled by the area of the brain that the rats were
consuming. To prevent this from happening, he banged his head so that
the "activated" neurons would "electrocute" the rats. Because he was not
losing his sight even though he believed that the rats were eating his
visual cortex, he entertained two possible explanations. First, his
brain had a capacity for rapid regeneration, or second, the remaining
brain cells compensated for the loss. Whenever information became too
discrepant, Erin depended on his enhanced thought processes or "Deep
Meaning," a system he believed transcended scientific logic. Although
individuals with schizophrenia may struggle with the logical nature of
their beliefs, most individuals are either unaware or only moderately
aware of the illogical nature of their hallucinations or delusions or
question their symptoms (Amador et al., 1994; see Figure 13.1). Poor
insight is related to negative symptoms and disorganized thought
processes (Mutsatsa et al., 2006). A variety of delusional themes are
seen in those with schizophrenia: • Delusions of grandeur A person's
belief that he or she is a famous or powerful person (from the present
or the past). Individuals with schizophrenia may assume the identities
of these other people. • Delusions of control A person's belief that
other people, animals, or objects are trying to influence or take
control of him or her. • Delusions of thought broadcasting A belief that
others can hear the individual's thoughts. • Delusions of persecution A
person's belief that others are plotting against, mistreating, or even
trying to kill him or her. • Delusions of reference A person's belief
that he or she is always the center of attention or that all happenings
revolve about himself or herself---for instance, that others are always
whispering behind his or her back. • Thought withdrawal A person's
belief that his or her thoughts are being removed from his or her mind.
A rare delusion is Capgras's syndrome (named after the person who first
reported it). It is the belief in the existence of identical "doubles"
who may coexist with or replace significant others or the patient, such
as Elyn Saks's belief that her therapist had been replaced by an evil
double. Similarly, one daughter would phone her mother and ask questions
such as what she had worn as a Halloween costume at the age of twelve or
who had attended one of her birthday parties. "She was testing me
because she didn't think I was her mother. ... No matter what question I
answered, she was just sobbing" (Stark, 2004, p. A1). The daughter
believed that her mother had been replaced by an imposter in a body suit
and that her real mother had been kidnapped. Delusions can produce
strong emotional reactions such as fear, depression, or anger among
those experiencing them. Those with persecutory delusions may respond to
perceived threats by leaving "dangerous" situations, avoiding areas
where they

The Symptoms of Schizophrenia

might be attacked, or becoming more vigilant. Paradoxically, these
"safety" behaviors may prevent the processing of disconfirmatory
evidence, as the lack of a catastrophe may be attributed to their
cautionary behaviors (Freeman et al., 2007). Delusions may be
unconnected or may involve a single theme. One woman had multiple
delusions, including a belief that celebrities were talking to her
through the television, that her deceased husband was still alive and
cheating on her, and that her internal organs were getting infected
(Mahgoub & Hossain, 2006b). Delusions may vary from those that are
plausible, such as being followed or spied on, to those that are bizarre
(removal of internal organs or thoughts being placed in their minds). In
one study (Harrow et al., 2004), nearly half of individuals with
delusions had some questions regarding their beliefs, and 21 percent
were fully aware that others might view their beliefs as atypical. The
strength of delusional beliefs and their effects on the person's life
vary. Delusions have less impact when the individual is able to suggest
an alternate hypothesis regarding the delusion or acknowledge that his
or her belief may be incorrect (Warman et al., 2007).

363

A BEAUTIFUL MIND John Nash, a Princeton University professor whose
battle with schizophrenia was portrayed in a ﬁlm, struggled with his
psychotic symptoms and learned to ignore hallucinations. Even today, he
occasionally hears voices.

Myth vs Reality Myth: Individuals experiencing delusions or
hallucinations steadfastly accept them as reality. Reality: The strength
of hallucinations and delusions among individuals with schizophrenia
varies during the course of the illness and among speciﬁc individuals.
Some believe in them 100 percent, whereas others acknowledge being less
certain. Even without treatment, many attempt to develop means of
reestablishing contact with reality or testing out the reality of their
thinking. Some individuals with schizophrenia, such as Elyn Saks and
mathematician John Nash, who was portrayed in the movie A Beautiful
Mind, are able to struggle with their illness through a combination of
will power and medication. However, most need to supplement medications
with speciﬁc cognitive training to develop the skills necessary to
question their own hallucinations and delusions.

Individuals with schizophrenia sometimes reach conclusions based on
limited information, which may lead to the development of unusual
beliefs. Delusional individuals appear to make errors during the stages
of hypothesis formation and evaluation. They develop unlikely hypotheses
from limited information and then overestimate the probability that the
hypotheses are true (Warman et al., 2007). In one study, delusional
individuals demonstrated a reasoning bias by rating narratives of
twenty-five actual delusions involving themes of grandiosity,
persecution, thought broadcasting, or thought insertion as "more likely
to be true" than nondelusional patients. Interestingly, they did not
display this reasoning bias when presented with neutral narratives
(themes that involved the probability that red or black balls could be
picked blindly from a bag with differing proportions of colored balls).
To account for these differences, the researchers hypothesized that
delusional individuals may have an attentional bias for emotionally
salient or threat-related information (McGuire et al., 2001). People
with schizophrenia can be trained to challenge their delusions. One
fiftyone-year-old patient believed---with almost 100 percent
certainty---that she was younger than twenty and that she was the
daughter of Princess Anne. Her therapist asked her to view her delusion
as only one possible interpretation. Then they discussed evidence for
her belief, and the therapist presented the inconsistencies and
irrationality of the belief, as well as alternative explanations. After
this procedure, the

364

I O LO G Y, A N D T R E AT M E N T

controversy

Should We Challenge Delusions and Hallucinations? The doctor asked of a
patient who insisted that he was dead: "Look. Dead men don't bleed,
right?" When the man agreed, the doctor pricked the man's ﬁnger, and
showed him the blood. The patient said, "What do you know, dead men do
bleed after all." (Walkup, 1995, p. 323)

Clinicians have often been unsure about whether to challenge psychotic
symptoms. Some contend that the delusions and hallucinations serve an
adaptive function and that any attempt to change them would be useless
or even dangerous. The example of the patient who believed he was dead
illustrates the apparent futility of using logic in treating people with
schizophrenia. However, Coltheart, Langdon, and McKay (2007) found that
a "gentle and tactful offering of evidence" was successful in treating a
man who believed his wife was not his wife but was, instead, his
business partner. The man was asked to entertain the possibility that
the woman was actually his wife. The therapist pointed out that the
woman was wearing a wedding ring identical to the one he had bought for
his wife. The man said that the woman probably bought the ring from the
same shop. He was then shown the initials engraved in the ring as being
those of his wife. Within one week, he accepted the fact that the woman
was his wife. Other clinicians (Bak et al., 2003; Beck & Rector, 2000;
Chadwick et al., 2000; Freeman et al., 2007) have also found that some
clients respond well to challenges to their hallucinations and
delusions. The approach has two phases. In the ﬁrst, hypothetical
contradictions are used to assess how open the patients are to
conﬂicting information. During this phase, patients are introduced to
information that might contradict their beliefs, and it is here that
their delusions are often weakened.

• A woman, H.J., with auditory hallucinations was asked if her belief in
the "voices" would change if it could be determined that they were
coming from her. She agreed. She was given a set of industrial earmuffs,
which she wore. She still reported hearing voices. • A woman believed
that God was commanding her to kill. She was asked if her belief would
be lessened if a priest informed her that God would not ask anyone to
kill another person. In the second phase, the therapist issues a verbal
challenge, asking clients to give evidence for their beliefs and to
develop alternative interpretations. For example, one client claimed
that voices were accurate in telling her when her spouse would return.
The therapist asked how she might determine her husband's return if the
voices were unable to foretell the future. Another patient who claimed
he would be killed if he did not comply with auditory commands was told
that he could resist the voices and would not die. Alternative
explanations are proposed for the hallucinations, including the
possibility that the voices are thoughts or "self-talk." After
cognitive-behavioral treatment, most patients report a decreased belief
in their psychotic symptoms. In H.J.'s case, her degree of certainty
about her auditory hallucinations dropped from 100 percent to 20
percent. Although she still heard voices telling her she would die, she
learned to disregard them and attributed them as "coming from her head."
For Further Consideration 1. Should we challenge psychotic symptoms? If
so, what is the best way of doing so? 2. Could some psychotic symptoms
have an adaptive function?

patient reported a large drop in the conviction of her beliefs, stating
"I look 50 and I tire more quickly than I used to; I must be 50" (Lowe &
Chadwick, 1990, p. 471). She agreed that she was probably older than
Princess Anne and therefore could not be her daughter. Belief
modification appears to be a helpful procedure for some individuals with
schizophrenia, though there is some controversy surrounding this
approach. Hallucinations The following patient is experiencing auditory

smelling (olfactory hallucinations), feeling (tactile hallucinations),
and tasting (gustatory hallucinations). Auditory hallucinations are most
common and can range from being malevolent to being benevolent or having
both qualities (Copolov, Mackinnon, & Trauer, 2004). The greatest
distress is expressed when the voices are dominant and insulting and the
patient cannot communicate with the voices (Vaughan & Fowler, 2004).
Auditory hallucinations appear to be "real" to the individual
experiencing them. In one study, 61 percent reported that the voices had
a distinct gender, 46 percent believed that the voice was that of a
friend, family member, or acquaintance, and 80 percent reported having
back-and-forth conversations with the voices. The voices, in some cases,
introduced themselves to the patients and acted like real persons. As
one individual responded, "They are not imaginary. They see what I do.
They tell me that I'm baking a cake. They must be there. How would they
know what I'm doing?" (Garrett & Silva, 2003, p. 447). Most believed the
voices were independent entities, and some had conducted "research" to
test the reality of the voices. One had said she initially thought that
the voice might be her own but rejected it when her voice called her
"mommy," something she would not call herself. Disorganized Thought and
Speech Disordered thinking is a primary characteristic of schizophrenia.
During communication, the individual may jump from one topic to another,
speak in an unintelligible manner, or reply tangentially to questions.
Loosening of associations, also referred to as cognitive slippage, is
the continual shifting from topic to topic without any apparent logical
or meaningful connection between thoughts. It may be shown by incoherent
speech or bizarre, idiosyncratic responses, as indicated in the
following example.

DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR Assuming the identity of another, powerful person
can be a sign that an individual suffering from schizophrenia is
experiencing delusions of grandeur.

Case Study INTERVIEWER: "You just must be an emotional person, that's
all." PATIENT (1): "Well, not very much I mean, what if I were dead.
It's a funeral age. Well I um. Now I had my toenails operated on. They
got infected and I wasn't able to do it. But they wouldn't let me at my
tools." (Thomas, 1995, p. 289)

The beginning phrase in the patient's first sentence appears appropriate
to the interviewer's comment. However, the reference to death is not.
Slippage appears in the comments referring to a funeral age, having
toenails operated on, and getting tools. None of these thoughts are
related to the interviewer's observation, and they have no hierarchical
structure or organization. People with schizophrenia may also respond to
words or phrases in a very concrete manner and demonstrate difficulty
with abstractions. A saying such as "a rolling stone gathers no moss"
might be interpreted as "moss can't grow on a rock that is rolling."
These communication difficulties may result from an inability to inhibit
contextually irrelevant information (Titone, Levy, & Holzman, 2000).
Disorganized Motor Disturbances The symptoms of schizophrenia that
involve motor functions can be quite bizarre, as is evident in the
following case:

Case Study At age 20, patient A ... was found sitting at the edge of the
bed for hours, displaying simple repetitive movements of the right hand,
and simultaneously holding his left hand in a bizarre posture. This was
accompanied by verbigerations ("I do, I do, I do . . . ")
(verbigerations are compulsive repetitions of meaningless words and
phrases). (Stober, 2007, pp. 38--39)

Did You Know?

sychotic-like experiences are not uncommon among the general population.
In a sample of 591 participants ages twenty and twenty-one, Rossler and
colleagues (2007) found: • 38 percent endorsed the statement "someone
else can control my thoughts" • 20 percent endorsed the statement
"others are aware of my thoughts" • 18 percent endorsed the statement "I
have thoughts that are not my own" • 3.2 percent reported "hearing
voices other people don't hear" In most cases, these beliefs were
transient and not clinically relevant unless they become persistent,
excessive, or associated with signiﬁcant distress.

Persons with schizophrenia may show extremes in activity level (either
unusually high or unusually low), peculiar body movements or postures,
strange gestures and grimaces, or a combination of these. Like
hallucinations, a patient's motoric behaviors may be related to his or
her delusions. For example, during a clinical interview, one patient
with schizophrenia kept lowering his chin to his chest and then raising
his head again. Asked why he lowered his head in that way, the patient
replied that the atmospheric pressure often became too great to bear,
and it forced his head down. Some individuals may display extremely high
levels of motor activity, moving about quickly, swinging their arms
wildly, talking rapidly and unendingly, or pacing constantly. At the
other extreme, others hardly move at all, staring out into space (or
perhaps into themselves) for long periods of time. The inactive patients
also tend to show little interest in others, respond only minimally, and
have few friends. During periods of withdrawal, they are frequently
preoccupied with personal fantasies and daydreams. The assumption and
maintenance of an unusual (and often awkward) body position is
characteristic of the catatonic type of schizophrenia (to be discussed
shortly). A catatonic patient may stand for hours at a time, perhaps
with one arm stretched out to the side, or may lie on the floor or sit
awkwardly on a chair, staring, aware of what is going on around him or
her but not responding or moving. If someone tries to change the
patient's position, the patient may either resist stubbornly or may
simply assume and maintain the new position. Catatonic symptoms are not
specific to schizophrenia and may also occur with mood disorders or
medical conditions. See Figure 13.2 for the prevalence of specific
symptoms in a group of individuals with catatonic schizophrenia.

Negative Symptoms Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with
an inability or decreased ability to initiate actions or speech, express
emotions, or feel pleasure. Such symptoms include avolition (an
inability to take action or become goal-oriented), alogia (a lack of
meaningful speech), and flat affect (little or no emotion in situations
in which strong reactions are expected). A delusional patient, for
instance, might explain in detail how parts of his or her body are
rotting away but show absolutely no concern or worry through voice tone
or facial expression. Clinicians are careful to distinguish between
primary symptoms (symptoms that arise from the disease itself) and
secondary symptoms (symptoms that may develop as a response to
medication, institutionalization, or as a result of a mood PAINTING THE

symptoms endorsed beliefs such as "Having friends is not as important as
many say," "I attach very little importance to having close friends,"
"Taking negative symptom even a small risk is foolish because the loss
is likely to be a disaster," "If a person in schizophrenia, a symptom
avoids problems, the problem tends to go away," "If I show my feelings,
others will associated with an inability or see my inadequacy," and "Why

lack of motivation to interact with others. or speech, express emotions,

their symptoms. Greater pleasure; includes avolition, alogia, awareness
of their difficulties is related to more severe depression, whereas
poorer and ﬂat affect insight is associated with more severe negative
symptoms (Mutsatsa et al., 2006).

Cognitive Symptoms Cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia include problems
with attention and memory and difficulty in developing a plan of action.
As compared with healthy controls, those with schizophrenia have severe
to moderately severe cognitive impairments, as evidenced by poor
"executive functioning"---deficits in the ability to absorb and
interpret information and make decisions based on that information; to
sustain attention; and to retain recently learned information and use it
right away (NIMH, 2007e). Cognitive symptoms are generally present even
prior to the onset of the first psychotic episode (Pflueger et al.,
2007), tend to persist even with treatment, and are found to a lesser
degree among nonpsychotic relatives of patients with schizophrenia
(Reichenberg & Harvey, 2007). Many researchers consider these cognitive
impairments to be a core component of schizophrenia and should be added
as a criterion for the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the next revision
of the DSM (they are not currently part of the diagnostic criteria for
schizophrenia) (Keefe & Fenton, 2007).

Cultural Issues Culture may affect how symptoms of schizophrenia are
displayed or interpreted. In Japan, for example, schizophrenia is highly
stigmatized. Part of the problem is that the condition is called
seishin-bunretsu-byou, which roughly translates as a split in mind or
spirit. The term conjures up an irreversible condition. Because of this
connotation, the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology is
considering finding a less negative term (Sugiura, Sakamoto, Tanaka,
Tomada, & Kitamura, 2001). A negative reaction to the term schizophrenia
is also part of the reason that many psychiatrists in Turkey will not
mention the diagnosis to patients and family members (Ucok, 2007). In
western countries, individuals with schizophrenia tend to show more
depressive symptoms and to report thought broadcasting and insertion,
whereas those in nonwestern countries tend to report more visual and
directed auditory hallucinations (Jilek, 2001). The content of delusions
also seems to be influenced by culture and society. In the 1960s, during
the social and political upheaval of the period known as the Cultural
Revolution in China, a number of different delusions appeared among
Chinese patients with schizophrenia (Yu-Fen & Neng, 1981). These
included the delusion of leadership lineage, in which patients insisted
that their parents were people in authority; the delusion of being
tested, in which patients believed that their superiors were assessing
them to determine whether they were suitable for promotion; the delusion
of impending arrest, in which patients assumed that they were about to
be arrested by authorities; and the delusion of being married, in which
a female patient insisted that she had a husband even though she was
unmarried.

Ethnic group differences have also been found regarding the prevalence
of schizophrenia. However, between-group differences are difficult to
interpret. As DSM-IV-TR notes, "There is some evidence that clinicians
may have a tendency to overdiagnose Schizophrenia in some ethnic groups.
Studies conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States suggest
that Schizophrenia may be diagnosed more often in individuals who are
African American and Asian American than in other racial groups"
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a, p. 307). It is not clear
whether these are actual differences in rates of the disorder or whether
they represent clinician bias. Cultural differences between patient and
clinician may produce diagnostic errors---the greater the difference,
the greater the likelihood of error. Additionally, misdiagnosis can
result from racial stereotyping or bias or from applying diagnostic
systems based on white middle-class norms to other racial groups.

Types of Schizophrenia Five types of schizophrenic disorders are
traditionally recognized: paranoid, disorganized, catatonic,
undifferentiated, and residual (see Table 13.2).

Types of Schizophrenia

Paranoid Schizophrenia The most common form of schizophrenia is the
paranoid type. Paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by one or more
systematized delusions or auditory hallucinations and by the absence of
such symptoms as disorganized speech and behavior or flat affect. In
this group, high levels of anxiety and worry over persecutory delusions
are common (Startup, Freeman, & Garety, 2006), as are angry reactions to
perceived persecution. Some delusions may function to protect the
self-concept by turning personal problems into an accusation that
"others are responsible for the bad things that are happening to me."
Several studies have found that individuals with paranoid delusions
externalize their problems (Kinderman & Bentall, 1996, 1997). The
deluded individuals believe that others are plotting against them, are
talking about them, or are out to harm them in some way. They are
constantly suspicious, and their interpretations of the behavior and
motives of others are distorted. A friendly, smiling bus driver is seen
as someone who is laughing at them derisively. A busy clerk who fails to
offer help is part of a plot to mistreat them. A telephone call that was
a wrong number is an act of harassment or an attempt to monitor their
comings and goings. Interestingly, as compared with nonparanoid
schizophrenic patients and control participants, patients with paranoid
schizophrenia were more accurate in recognizing genuine nonverbal
expressions of emotions (Davis & Gibson, 2000).

Case Study A 49-year-old woman, Janice, was convinced that she had been
raped, even though her husband had been in bed with her and the dead
bolt on the bedroom door was undisturbed. The woman was brought by the
husband to the emergency room where she asked the medical staff to check
her throat for signs of a sexual assault involving oral sex. None was
found. Janice was convinced that furniture in the bedroom had been moved
during the "break-in." She also indicated a belief that her computer was
controlled by unknown people and that programs had been deleted from the
hard drive. She refused treatment, saying that "I came to the ER to see
if this was due to something medical. If it's psychological, I can deal
with it myself." (Muller, 2006, p. 43)

The prognosis for the paranoid type tends to be more positive than for
other types of schizophrenia.

Disorganized Schizophrenia Disorganized schizophrenia (formerly called
hebephrenic schizophrenia) is characterized by grossly disorganized
behaviors manifested in disorganized speech and behavior and flat or
grossly inappropriate affect. Behaviors may begin at an early age.
People with this disorder act in an absurd, incoherent, or very odd
manner that conforms to the stereotype of "crazy" behavior. Their
emotional responses to reallife situations are typically flat, but a
silly smile and childish giggle may appear at inappropriate times
(Kumperscak et al., 2005). The hallucinations and delusions of patients
with disorganized schizophrenia tend to shift from theme to theme rather
than remaining centered on a single idea. Because of the severity of the
disorder, many people affected with disorganized schizophrenia are
unable to care for themselves and are institutionalized. People with
this disorder usually exhibit extremely bizarre and seemingly childish
behaviors, such as masturbating in public or fantasizing aloud.

Catatonic Schizophrenia Marked disturbance in motor activity---either
extreme excitement or motoric immobility---is the prime characteristic
of catatonic schizophrenia. Diagnostic criteria include two or more of
the following symptoms: motoric immobility or stupor; excessive,
purposeless motor activity; extreme negativism (resisting direction) or
physical resistance; peculiar voluntary posturing or movements; or
echolalia (repetition of other people's speech) or echopraxia
(repetition of other people's movements; Stober, 2007). This disorder is
quite rare but somewhat more prevalent in nonwestern countries.

CHARACTERISTICS OF DISORGANIZED SCHIZOPHRENIA Grossly disorganized
behavior in which an individual dresses or behaves in an unusual manner
is displayed in some people with schizophrenia. Here, a hospitalized
patient showers in her clothes. Would the woman understand that this
behavior is odd?

undifferentiated schizophrenia

a schizophrenic subtype in which the person's behavior shows prominent
psychotic symptoms that do not meet the criteria for paranoid,
disorganized, or catatonic schizophrenia residual schizophrenia

a subtype of schizophrenic disorder reserved for people who have had at
least one previous schizophrenic episode but are now showing an absence
of prominent psychotic features; there is continuing evidence of two or
more symptoms, such as marked social isolation, peculiar behaviors,
blunted affect, odd beliefs, or unusual perceptual experiences

CHARACTERISTICS OF CATATONIC SCHIZOPHRENIA Individuals with catatonic
schizophrenia experience a variety of disturbances in motor activity.
Those who are excited exhibit great agitation and hyperactivity; those
who are withdrawn may exhibit extreme unresponsiveness or adopt strange
postures.

People with excited catatonia are agitated and hyperactive. They may
talk and shout constantly, while moving or running until they drop from
exhaustion. They sleep little and are continually "on the go." Their
behavior can become dangerous, and violent acts are not uncommon. People
in withdrawn catatonia are extremely unresponsive with respect to motor
activity. They show prolonged periods of stupor and mutism, despite
their awareness of all that is going on around them. Some may adopt and
maintain strange postures and refuse to move or change position. Others
exhibit a waxy flexibility, allowing themselves to be "arranged" in
almost any position and then remaining in that position for long periods
of time. During periods of extreme withdrawal, people with catatonic
schizophrenia may not eat or control their bladder or bowel functions.
Alternating periods of excited motor activity and withdrawal may occur
in this disorder (Caroff et al., 2007).

Undifferentiated and Residual Schizophrenia Undifferentiated
schizophrenia is diagnosed when the person's behavior shows prominent
psychotic symptoms that do not meet the criteria for the paranoid,
disorganized, or catatonic categories. These symptoms may include
thought disturbances, delusions, hallucinations, incoherence, and
severely impaired behavior. Sometimes undifferentiated schizophrenia
turns out to be an early stage of another subtype. The diagnosis of
residual schizophrenia is reserved for people who have had at least one
previous schizophrenic episode but who are now showing an absence of
prominent psychotic features. There is continuing evidence of two or
more symptoms, such as marked social isolation, peculiar behaviors,
blunted affect, odd beliefs, or unusual perceptual experiences. The
disorder may be in remission. In any case, the person's symptoms are
neither strong enough nor prominent enough to warrant classification as
one of the other types of schizophrenia.

Psychotic Disorders That Were Once Considered Schizophrenia Exposure to
psychological trauma such as combat can produce brief psychotic
reactions. In a study of ninety-one men who had fought in Croatia, 20
percent reported hallucinations and delusions (Kastelan et al., 2007).
Brief reactive psychosis has also been reported in cases of
Guillain-Barré syndrome, during which the body and the muscles used for
breathing can become paralyzed. Of forty-nine individuals who suffered
severe forms of this syndrome, 25 percent developed a psychotic reaction
(Weiss et al., 2002). Brief psychotic episodes were considered to
represent acute forms of schizophrenia in DSM-II. With DSM-III-R and
DSM-IV-TR, people who have "schizophrenic" episodes that last fewer than
six months are now diagnosed as having either brief psychotic disorder
(duration of at least one day but less than one month) or
schizophreniform disorder (duration of at least one month but less than
six months). In contrast to schizophrenia, a diagnosis of
schizophreniform disorder does not require impairment in social or
occupational functioning. Differences between these disorders and
schizophrenia are shown in Table 13.3. Although they appear to be
distinct, the disorders are often highly similar in characteristics.
DSM-IV-TR recommends that the diagnoses of brief psychotic disorder and
schizophreniform disorder be "provisional." For example, an initial
diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder may change to schizophreniform
disorder if it lasts longer than one month and to schizophrenia if it
lasts longer than six months. In a follow-up study of fifty-six
individuals with schizophreniform disorders, 46 percent later received a
diagnosis of schizophrenia, 35 percent a mood disorder, 18 percent a
nonschizophrenic psychotic disorder, and 2 percent no disorder (Marchesi
et al., 2007). Because duration is the only accurate means of
distinguishing among the disorders, questions about the validity of
categories have been raised.

Other Psychotic Disorders Other psychotic disorders include delusional
disorder, shared psychotic disorder, and schizoaffective disorder.

Delusional Disorder Delusional disorder is characterized by persistent,
nonbizarre delusions that are not accompanied by other unusual or odd
behaviors. It is not a form of schizophrenia, although it is often
confused with paranoid schizophrenia. In both, thought processes are
disturbed. Nevertheless, some differences do exist. Delusional disorder
involves "nonbizarre beliefs" (situations that could actually occur)
that have lasted for at least one month. Also, except for the delusion,
the person's behavior is not odd. In schizophrenia, additional
disturbances in thoughts and perceptions are involved. People with
delusional disorder behave normally when their delusional ideas are not
being discussed. Common themes in delusional disorders involve: •
Erotomania---the belief that someone is in love with the individual;
usually the love is romanticized rather than sexual. • Grandiosity---the
conviction that one has great, unrecognized talent or some special
ability or relationship with an important individual. • Jealousy---the
conviction that one's spouse or partner is being unfaithful. •
Persecution---the belief in being conspired or plotted against. •
Somatic complaints---convictions of having body odor, being malformed,
or being infested by insects or parasites. The following cases
illustrate some features of delusional disorders: • A woman was
convinced that people were watching her and following her because she
saw the same people day after day in her neighborhood and the stores in
which she shopped (Muller, 2006). • A fifty-two-year-old woman
complained of insects that wandered in her body. Especially when she
scratched her legs, she insisted she saw insects (Mecan et al., 2007). •
A homeless man was arrested after lounging naked by a swimming pool he
believed belonged to former tennis pro Anna Kournikova. He explained to
the police that Anna loved him and had left the door unlocked and laid
out clothing for him ("Man Accused," 2005). A decreased ability to
obtain corrective feedback, combined with a preexisting personality type
that tends toward suspiciousness, may increase susceptibility to
developing delusional beliefs. Delusional disorder can be treated with
antipsychotic medications and/or cognitive behavior therapy (Mecan et
al., 2007)

delusional disorder a disorder characterized by persistent, nonbizarre
delusions that are not accompanied by other unusual or odd behaviors
shared psychotic disorder

disorder in which a person who has a close relationship with an
individual with delusional or psychotic beliefs comes to share those
beliefs schizoaffective disorder

a disorder characterized by both a mood disorder (major depression or
bipolar disorder) and the presence of psychotic symptoms "for at least
two weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms"

Shared Psychotic Disorder Both a twenty-eight-year-old woman and her
mother shared the delusion that the daughter had been given poisoned
food and was hypnotized by a man so that he could rape her. They
appeared at an emergency department together with the mother requesting
that the daughter be "de-hypnotized" (Mahgoub & Hossain, 2006a). In
shared psychotic disorder, a person who has a close relationship with an
individual with delusional or psychotic beliefs comes to accept those
beliefs (Wehmeier, Barth, & Remschmidt, 2003). Shared psychotic disorder
is relatively rare and is more prevalent among those who are socially
isolated. In the preceding case, the daughter never married, lived with
and was submissive to her mother, and had no close relationships with
others. The pattern generally involves a family member or partner
acquiring the delusional belief from the dominant individual. In many
cases, an individual who shares another person's delusional or psychotic
beliefs loses faith in those beliefs when the two individuals are
separated. Schizoaffective Disorder Schizoaffective disorder includes
both a mood disorder (major depression or bipolar disorder) and the
presence of psychotic symptoms "for at least two weeks in the absence of
prominent mood symptoms" (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a,
p. 323). The disorder is more common in females and usually begins in
early adulthood. The prognosis appears to be more positive for this
disorder than for schizophrenia.

Delusional Parasitosis or Physical Disease?

F

our years ago, "Mary Leitao plucked a ﬁber that looked like a dandelion
ﬂuff from a sore under her two-yearold son's lips. . . . Sometimes the
ﬁbers were white, and sometimes they were black, red, or blue"
(DeVitaRaeburn, 2007, p. 1). Leitao was frustrated by the inability of
physicians to diagnose the problem in her son. In fact, many indicated
that they could ﬁnd no evidence of a disease or infection. Frustrated by
the medical establishment, Mary put a description of the condition on a
Web site in 2004 and called it Morgellons disease. More than eight
thousand individuals responded to the Web site with reports of this
condition either in themselves or in their children. Sufferers reported
ﬁber-like threads emerging from the skin at the site of itching and
sensations of crawling, stinging, or biting and nonhealing rashes and
skin lesions (Paquette, 2007). What could cause this disorder? Many
dermatologists and physicians believe that cases of Morgellons disease
are actually a somatic type of delusional disorder or the result of
self-inﬂicted wounds. In examining the bodies of patients with the
disorder, physicians report being unable to ﬁnd ﬁbers at the sites of
"infection" but often report

inﬂamed skin due to being scratched or picked at (DeVitaRaeburn, 2007).
Stephen Stone, the current president of the American Academy of
Dermatology, does not believe Morgellons disease is real and indicates
that patients with this condition often respond well to treatment with
antipsychotics. He warns that the Internet community may reinforce and
help individuals with somatic delusions band together (Marris, 2006).
Because of numerous complaints to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
from those who believe they suffer from this condition, the CDC began
conducting an investigation of this unexplained skin condition in 2007.
For Further Consideration 1. Is the Morgellons disease Web site feeding
into a population of vulnerable delusional individuals who can now
receive reinforcement for their illness, or is it providing comfort for
those with an actual disease? 2. If an actual physical condition is
found, what will it mean in regard to the skepticism shown by the
medical community?

The Course of Schizophrenia It is popularly believed that overwhelming
stress can cause a well-adjusted and relatively normal person to
experience a schizophrenic breakdown. There are, in fact, recorded
instances of the sudden onset of psychotic behaviors in previously
wellfunctioning people (Kastelan et al., 2007). In most cases, however,
the person's premorbid personality (personality before the onset of
major symptoms) shows some impairment. Similarly, most people with
schizophrenia recover gradually rather than suddenly. The typical course
of schizophrenia consists of three phases: prodromal, active, and
residual. The prodromal phase includes the onset and buildup of
schizophrenic symptoms. Social withdrawal and isolation, peculiar
behaviors, inappropriate affect, poor communication patterns, and
neglect of personal grooming may become evident during this phase. Of
eleven patients who were interviewed in one study (Campo et al., 1998),
nine indicated that they had drastically changed their appearances
(cutting or changing hairstyles, wearing multiples of the same type of
clothing) just before the onset of the schizophrenic episode. They said
the changes were an attempt to maintain their identities. Friends and
relatives often considered such behavior odd or peculiar. Often,
psychosocial stressors or excessive demands on an individual with
schizophrenia in the prodromal phase result in the onset of prominent
psychotic symptoms, or the active phase of schizophrenia. In this phase,
the person shows the full-blown symptoms of schizophrenia, including
severe disturbances in thinking, deterioration in social relationships,
and flat or markedly inappropriate affect. At some later time, the
person may enter the residual phase, in which the symptoms are no longer
prominent. The severity of the symptoms declines, and the individual may
show the milder impairment found in the prodromal phase. (At this point,
the diagnosis would be residual schizophrenia.) Although long-term
studies have shown that many people with schizophrenia can lead
productive lives, complete recovery is rare (see Figure 13.3 for
different courses of the disease).

Course 3 (17.1 percent of patients) Impairment increasing with each of
several episodes followed by negative symptoms

What are the chances for recovery from or improvement in schizophrenia?
According to DSM-IV-TR, "Complete remission (i.e., a return to full
premorbid functioning) is probably not common in this disorder"
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a, p. 309). The chances for
improvement or recovery are difficult to evaluate because of the
changing definitions of schizophrenia over the years and recent
improvements in both psychotherapy and medication. In a ten-year
follow-up study of individuals hospitalized for schizophrenia, the
majority of patients improved over time, while a minority appeared to
deteriorate (Rabinowitz et al., 2007). Similarly, during a fifteenyear
follow-up period of 274 patients with schizophrenia, the following were
found (Harrow et al., 2005): • Over 40 percent showed one or more
periods of recovery (defined as the absence of psychotic activity and
negative symptoms, working half time or more, absence of very poor
social activity levels, and no psychiatric hospitalization during the
period of evaluation). • A sizable minority were not on any medication.

An earlier follow-up study (Wiersma et al., 1998) also reported that
about one-quarter of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia showed
complete remission of symptoms, although about half of Impairment with

13.3

Etiology of Schizophrenia Case Study A thirteen-year-old boy who was
having behavioral and academic problems in school was taking part in a
series of family therapy sessions. Family communication was negative in
tone, with a great deal of blaming. Near the end of one session, the boy
suddenly broke down and cried out, "I don't want to be like her." He was
referring to his mother, who had been receiving treatment for
schizophrenia and was taking antipsychotic medication. He had often been
frightened by her bizarre behavior, and he was concerned that his
friends would "ﬁnd out" about her condition. But his greatest fear was
that he would inherit the disorder. Sobbing, he turned to the therapist
and asked, "Am I going to be crazy, too?"

If you were the therapist, how would you respond? At the end of this
section on the etiology of schizophrenia, you should be able to reach
your own conclusion about what to tell the thirteen-year-old boy.
Schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions are best understood using a
multipath model that integrates heredity (genetic influences on brain
structure and neurotransmitters), personal vulnerability such as
depression or other characteristics, cognitive appraisal (faulty
psychological processes that maintain delusional ideas), and social
adversities (such as low social or economic status; Van der Gaag, 2006).
To develop an accurate etiological framework, all of these dimensions
must be taken into consideration, as shown in Figure 13.4.

Etiology of Schizophrenia

FIGURE MULTIPATH MODEL FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA The dimensions interact with
one another and combine in different ways to result in schizophrenia.

• Childhood traumas • Depression and low self-esteem • Aberrant

SCHIZOPHRENIA

375

Social Dimension • Exposure to abuse • Dysfunctional family interactions
• Expressed emotions

In the following section, we discuss the biological, psychological,
social, and sociocultural dimensions separately, remembering that each
dimension interacts with the others. For example, emotional,
psychological, or sexual abuse, cannabis use, and exposure to trauma
(physical threat, serious accident) have all been hypothesized to affect
dopamine levels or mechanisms in the brain. In one sample, the
probability of persistent psychotic symptoms was influenced by each of
these factors, especially among individuals who were exposed to all
three influences (Cougnard et al., 2007).

Biological Dimension It is now recognized that single genes do not
directly cause schizophrenia; rather more than a dozen "susceptibility"
genes code for subtle molecular abnormalities that hypothetically
provide a genetic "bias" toward inefficient information processing in
brain circuits that mediate the symptoms of schizophrenia. ... The
coupling of sufficient genetic bias with stressful input from the
environment is the modern formulation of how nature and nurture conspire
to produce schizophrenia. (Stahl, 2007, p. 583)

Past research was focused on the attempt to identify the specific gene
or genes that cause schizophrenia (Williamson, 2007). The disorder is
now understood as the result of multiple genes and their interactions;
specific genes appear to make only minor contributions toward the
illness. That schizophrenia is a result of genetic influences is not
disputed. Researchers have found the disorder more often among close
relatives of people diagnosed with schizophrenia than among more distant
relatives. Figure 13.5 demonstrates this relationship. The data are
summarized from several major studies on the prevalence of schizophrenia
(Gottesman, 1978, 1991). They show that closer blood relatives of people
diagnosed with schizophrenia run a greater risk of developing the
disorder. Thus the boy described earlier who was concerned about
becoming schizophrenic like his mother has a 16 percent chance of being
diagnosed with schizophrenia, but his mother's nieces or nephews have
only a 4 percent chance. (It should be noted that the risk for the
general population is 1 percent.) However, even among monozygotic
(identical) twins who share the same genetic material, if one twin
receives the diagnosis of schizophrenia, the risk is less than 50
percent that the second twin will develop the disorder. Thus
environmental influences also play a role in the expression of the
disorder.

This ﬁgure reﬂects the estimate of the lifetime risk of developing
schizophrenia---a risk that is strongly correlated with the degree of
genetic inﬂuence. Source: Data from Gottesman (1978, 1991).

Endophenotypes Currently, the strategy in genetic research has moved
from demonstrating that heredity is involved in schizophrenia to
attempts to identify the genes that are responsible for specific
characteristics or traits that are evident in this disorder. This
approach involves the identification and study of
endophenotypes---characteristics that are quantifiable, heritable, and
trait-related (Braff, Freedman, Schork, & Gottesman, 2007).
Endophenotypes, which are being studied with respect to an array of
mental and physical disorders, are hypothesized to underlie the illness
and exist in the individual before, during, and following remission of
the disorder. It would be expected that these characteristics would be
found with higher frequency, although in milder forms, among the
"non-ill" relatives of individuals with schizophrenia (Gur et al.,
2007). Researchers have identified several possible endophenotypes
related to impairment in function in both the schizophrenic patient and
unaffected biological relatives. The traits involved include working
memory, executive functions, sustained attention, and verbal memory
(Reichenberg & Harvey, 2007; Turetsky et al., 2007). Currently,
researchers are attempting to identify the genes responsible for
specific endophenotypes.

risk (percentage) have reported that individuals with schizophrenia have
smaller cortical structures (hippocampal and medial temporal lobes,
orbitofrontal cortices, and prefrontal lobes) and ventricle enlargement
(enlarged spaces in the brain; Lawrie et al., 2008; Staal et al., 2001).
Ventricular enlargement may indicate only an increased susceptibility to
schizophrenia, because healthy siblings of patients with schizophrenia
also show ventricle enlargement (Staal et al., 2001). In an interesting
longitudinal study of brain changes among youths with and without
schizophrenia, those with the disorder showed a striking loss of gray
brain matter over a period of six years. The loss was so rapid that it
was likened to a "forest fire" (Thompson et al., 2001). The regions of
the brain in which the loss occurred are related to symptoms associated
with the disorder. It is not clear how generalizable these findings are
because the sample involved adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia.
How might decreased volumes in cortical structures and enlarged
ventricles predispose someone to the development of schizophrenia? These
structural characteristics may result in aberrant or weak connectivity
between the various brain regions, leading to reductions in the
integrative function of the brain and impaired cognitive processing
(Salgado-Pineda et al., 2007). RATE OF GRAY MATTER LOSS IN TEENAGERS

CORONAL SECTIONS OF THE BRAIN IN A PATIENT WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA Structural
brain abnormalities have been found in most individuals with
schizophrenia. The degree and extent of the abnormalities appear to be
related to outcome. Patients with poor outcome (represented by the left
photo) show signiﬁcantly greater loss of cerebral gray matter and
greater enlargement of the ventricles than patients with a good outcome
(represented by the photo on the right; Staal et al., 2001).

with and without schizophrenia are relatively small, and decreased
cortical volumes have also been found in healthy individuals and
individuals with other disorders. Neurotransmitters Abnormalities of
neurotransmitters (chemicals that allow brain cells to communicate with
one another) such as dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate have also been
linked to schizophrenia (Tan et al., 2007). Considerable attention has
been focused on the neurotransmitter dopamine and its involvement in
schizophrenia (Borda & Sterin-Borda, 2006; Davis, Kahn, & Ko, 1991).
According to the dopamine hypothesis, schizophrenia may result from
excess dopamine activity at certain synaptic sites. Support for the
dopamine hypothesis has come from research with three types of drugs:
phenothiazines, L-dopa, and amphetamines. • Phenothiazines are
conventional antipsychotic drugs that decrease the severity of thought
disorders, alleviate withdrawal and hallucinations, and improve the mood
of patients with schizophrenia. Evidence shows that the phenothiazines
reduce dopamine activity in the brain by blocking dopamine receptor
sites in postsynaptic neurons. • L-dopa is generally used to treat
symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as muscle and limb rigidity and
tremors. The body converts L-dopa to dopamine, and the drug sometimes
produces schizophrenic-like symptoms. In contrast, the phenothiazines,
which reduce dopamine activity, can produce side effects that resemble
Parkinson's disease. • Amphetamines are stimulants that increase the
availability of dopamine and norepinephrine (another neurotransmitter)
in the brain. When individuals not diagnosed with schizophrenia are
given continual doses of amphetamines, they show symptoms very much like
those of acute paranoid schizophrenia. Also, very small doses of
amphetamine can increase the severity of symptoms in patients diagnosed
with schizophrenia. Other stimulants, such as caffeine, do not produce
these effects. Thus one group of drugs that is believed to block
dopamine reception has the effect of reducing the severity of
schizophrenic symptoms, whereas two drugs that increase dopamine
availability either produce or worsen these symptoms. Such evidence
suggests that excess dopamine may be responsible for schizophrenic
symptoms. The evidence is not clear-cut, however. For example, the
dopamine hypothesis might lead us to expect that treating schizophrenia
with phenothiazines would be effective in almost all cases of
schizophrenia, which is not the case. Additionally, whereas conventional
antipsychotics influence dopamine levels by binding tightly to

or those at risk for schizophrenia, the ﬁve characteristics that most
sharply increased the likelihood of actually developing the disorder
were (1) having a genetic risk, (2) showing a recent deterioration in
functioning, such as withdrawing socially or a drop in grades, (3)

characteristic

concordance rate

dopamine receptors, second-generation (newer) antipsychotics---most of
which work on serotonin receptors, as well as increasing dopamine
availability by loosely binding with dopamine receptors---are also
effective in treating schizophrenia (Canas, 2005). This would indicate
that researchers may be looking for an oversimplified explanation by
focusing on dopamine alone without considering the interactive
functioning of the brain and the biochemical system as a whole. As was
indicated earlier, the neurotransmitter glutamate also plays a major
role in schizophrenia (Tan et al., 2007). Because the concordance
rate---the likelihood that both members of a twin pair will show the
same characteristic---is less than 50 percent when one identical twin
has the disorder, nonshared environmental influences (physical,
psychological, social) between the twins must also play a role. Many of
these may be physical in nature, such as damage to a susceptible fetus
from prenatal infections, obstetric complications, or early trauma
(Jablensky et al., 2005; Sanders & Gejman, 2001). Retroviruses have also
been found in some cases of recent-onset schizophrenia (Karlsson et al.,
2001). Although these findings may be coincidental, they illustrate the
importance of attempting to identify early physical factors, such as
injuries or infections during fetal development or during the birth
process. Patients with schizophrenia often have histories of maternal
complications during pregnancy and birth, factors that might have
produced structural brain abnormalities (Compton, 2005; Ohman & Hultman,
1998). Several studies have reported that individuals whose mothers were
exposed to the influenza virus during the second trimester of pregnancy
have higher than expected rates of schizophrenia (Machon, Mednick, &
Huttunen, 1997). These conditions may affect the neurodevelopment of the
fetus by interfering with the normal development of neurons or
connections in the brain (Stahl, 2007). Although genetic/biological and
physical injuries or influences may increase one's susceptibility to
schizophrenia by changing or altering brain structures or
neurotransmitters, so may the impact of specific psychological, social,
and sociocultural variables. We now examine these as possible
contributors to the disorder.

Psychological Dimension The psychological dimension includes behaviors,
attitudes, and attributes that contribute to the symptoms of
schizophrenia by increasing the vulnerability of predisposed
individuals. For example, having depression or negative self-evaluations
can trigger or worsen psychotic symptoms (Smith et al., 2006). Reports
of childhood trauma have also been associated with the occurrence of
psychotic symptoms (O'Brien et al., 2006; Whitfield, Dube, Felitti, &
Anda, 2005). In addition, exposure to adverse psychological events may
bias neuronal circuits toward schizophrenia. Certain cognitive patterns
or unusual beliefs that precede the onset of the disorder have been
reported in individuals with schizophrenia (Solano & DeChavez, 2000).
Subclinical disordered thinking may transition into the development of a
clinical disorder (Coltheart, Langdon, & McKay, 2007). For example,
negative symptoms such as avolition, anhedonia, and flat affect may be
due to individuals' beliefs that they are "worthless" or "failures" and
that their condition is "hopeless" (Rector, Beck, & Stolar, 2005). The
combination of low expectancy for success, low expectancy due to their
illness, and low expectancy for pleasure may maintain the negative
symptoms. In fact, some researchers believe that it is the
interpretation of events that causes the distress and disability rather
than the experience itself (Garety et al., 2007). These pessimistic
interpretations can produce and maintain negative symptoms. See Table
13.4 for patterns of thinking associated with negative symptoms. Other
individual characteristics have also been associated with schizophrenia.
The use of cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol, and especially cannabis seems
to increase the chances of developing a psychotic disorder. Several
interpretations are possible to explain this relationship. First, those
who abuse substances may be at a higher risk for developing psychosis
due to the substance abuse itself. Second, individuals with a
predisposition for psychosis have a higher risk of abusing drugs
(Thirthalli & Benegal, 2006). Additionally, individuals might
self-medicate in an attempt to relieve symptoms. Use of substances may
influence dopamine levels and increase the vulnerability of an
individual to environmental stressors.

Social Dimension Social relationships have long been considered to have
etiological importance in the development of schizophrenia. Until the
1900s, biological factors were not considered to be of etiological
importance (Walker & Tessner, 2008). Instead, it was believed that
schizophrenia was the result of exposure to specific dysfunctional
family patterns. However, as Lehman and Steinwachs (1998) note,
"Research has failed to substantiate hypothesized causal links between
family dysfunction and the etiology of schizophrenia. ... The
presumption that family interaction causes schizophrenia... has led to
serious disruptions in clinician/family trust" (p. 8). These researchers
believe that unless a person has a genetic predisposition toward
schizophrenia, social factors have little impact on the development of
the disorder. In this section, we consider social factors as either the
cause of or a contributor to schizophrenia. Some researchers continue to
believe that the family environment may be involved in the onset and
course of the disorder. Several prospective studies---long-term studies
of a group of people, beginning before the onset of a disorder, to allow
investigators to see how the disorder develops---have found that
high-risk children who develop schizophrenia are more likely to have
negative family relationships than are high-risk children who do not
develop the disorder. Among one high-risk group of children (offspring
of a parent with schizophrenia), none who had received "good parenting"
from a parent with schizophrenia developed schizophrenia (Burman et al.,
1987; Marcus et al., 1987; Tienari et al., 1994). Similarly, among
adolescents who were "at imminent risk" for the onset of psychosis,
positive remarks and warmth expressed by caregivers were associated with
improvement in negative and disorganized symptoms and social functioning
(O'Brien et al., 2006). Children at higher biological risk for
schizophrenia may be more sensitive to the effects of both adverse and
healthy rearing patterns (Tienari et al., 2004). However, parenting
style may also be a result of how "sick" the child is, a possibility we
consider later in the chapter. Research has been directed to expressed
emotion (EE), a negative communication pattern that is found among some
relatives of individuals with schizophrenia and that is associated with
higher relapse rates. The EE index is determined by the number of
critical comments made by a relative (criticism); the number of
statements of dislike or resentment directed toward the patient by
family members (hostility); and the number of statements reflecting
emotional overinvolvement, overconcern, or overprotectiveness made about
the patient. For example, relatives high in EE are likely to make a
greater number of statements such as "You are a lazy person" or "You've
caused our family a lot of trouble" (Rosenfarb et al., 1995). Relatives
high in EE may be more critical because they are more likely than
relatives low in EE to believe that the psychotic symptoms are under the
personal control of the patient (Weisman et al., 2000). The EE construct

American relatives (Rosenfarb et al., 2006). Lopez and his associates
(2004) concluded that family communication processes among ethnic
minority members with schizophrenia must be examined according to a
sociocultural perspective. Communication patterns such as emotional
overprotection or overinvolvement may be interpreted differently by
different cultural groups. In fact, therapists who focus on reducing
critical and intrusive communication patterns in African American
families may inadvertently increase family stress. Although these
studies were better designed than some of the research discussed
earlier, they are still correlational in nature and are therefore
subject to different interpretations. Figure 13.6 indicates three
possible interpretations: 1. A high-EE environment is stressful and may
lead directly to relapse in the family member who has schizophrenia.
Patients whose parents are rated high in EE are more likely to recount
negative and stressful memories involving their parents than those whose
parents are low on EE (Cutting & Docherty, 2000). 2. A more severely ill
individual may cause more negative or high-EE communication patterns in
relatives. The severity of the illness means that the chances of relapse
are high. Schreiber, Breier, and Pickar (1995) found some support for
this pattern. They examined the parental emotional response in families
who had children both with and without schizophrenia. The parents
reacted differently, with more EE communication being directed toward
the child with schizophrenia. The researchers hypothesize that expressed
emotions may be a response of parents to the "chronic disabling aspect
of this illness, and a belief by the parents that increased involvement
would facilitate increased functioning of the child" (p. 649). 3. In the
bidirectional model, the patient's odd behaviors or symptoms may cause
family members to attempt to exert control and to react to the symptoms
with frustration, which in turn produces more psychotic symptoms in the
patient. An examination of communication patterns in families of
patients with schizophrenia also shows some support for this view
(Rosenfarb et al., 1995).

13.6

High-EE communication does not appear to be peculiar to schizophrenia.
These patterns have also been found in the families of patients with
depression, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders (Butzlaff & Hooley,
1998; Kavanagh, 1992). And although EE has been found to be related to
relapse, little evidence supports the idea

Etiology of Schizophrenia

381

that deviant family communication patterns are, by themselves,
sufficient to produce schizophrenia. Not all studies have supported the
EE hypothesis, and some researchers are voicing concern that the EE
hypothesis may be used to blame families for the disorder. Miklowitz
(1994) points out that the use of terms such as "high expressed
emotions" seem to imply that the relatives are excessively emotional or
disturbed in some way. He recommends substituting a term such as
"negative affective relationships" to indicate the bidirectional nature
of interactions.

Sociocultural Dimension Although the prevalence of schizophrenia is
roughly equal between men and women, gender differences in the age of
onset of the disorder have been found. The age of onset of schizophrenia
occurs earlier in males than in females. The gender ratio shifts by the
mid-forties and fifties, when the percentage of women receiving this
diagnosis exceeds that of men. This trend is especially pronounced in
the mid-sixties and later (Howard et al., 2000; Thorup et al., 2007).
Researchers have hypothesized that the later age of onset found in women
is due to the protective effects of estrogen, which diminish after
menopause (Grigoriadis & Seeman, 2002; Hafner et al., 1998). In a study
of premenopausal women with schizophrenia, significant improvements in
psychotic symptoms were observed during the luteal phase of their
menstrual cycle (the period after ovulation) when estradiol (a type of
estrogen) levels were higher (Bergemann et al., 2007). Estrogen may
affect either dopamine levels or dopamine sensitivity, which have been
associated with schizophrenia. Besides the possible protective function,
higher estrogen levels are also associated with better cognitive
functioning among women with schizophrenia (Hoff et al., 2001). A number
of social factors have been identified as risk factors for
schizophrenia, such as lower educational level of parents, lower
occupational status of fathers, and living in poorer residential areas
at birth (Werner, Malaspina, & Rabinowitz, 2007). These forms of social
adversity, especially in children who are exposed to a larger number of
adverse factors, appear to produce a threefold increase in the risk of
developing schizophrenia as opposed to children who are exposed to none
of these adversities (Wicks, Hjern, Gunnell, Lewis, & Dalman, 2005).
Migration is also a risk factor in schizophrenia among first- and
second-generation immigrants to the United Kingdom, especially for
African Caribbean and African sections of the population (Selten,
Cantor-Graae, & Kahn, 2007). Similarly, the incidence of schizophrenia
has

AN ABANDONED BUILDING IN CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY Schizophrenia is much more
prevalent in poorer neighborhoods. Some believe that the increased
stress from living in poverty may be the cause; others believe that
individuals with schizophrenia move into poor neighborhoods because of
their decreased ability to function in society. How would you determine
which view has the most support?

been found to be very high among several ethnic groups in the
Netherlands, particularly Moroccan immigrants (Veling et al., 2007).
Experiences with social adversity may contribute to the increased
incidence of the disorder. Among migrants, the evidence is not
supportive of selective migration of individuals with a predisposition
to schizophrenia (Selten et al., 2007), but migration may act as an
additional stressor to predisposed individuals. How social stress might
increase the risk for the disorder is not known, although there is a
belief that stressors may cause dopamine deregulation or sensitization
(Selten & Cantor-Graae, 2007). Culture also affects the way disorders
are viewed, as evidenced in the case of a thirteen-year-old child of a
Tongan mother and Caucasian father living in the United States. The girl
appeared to have visual hallucinations, had become isolative, exhibited
echolalia, could be observed conversing with herself, and reported
hearing voices of a woman who sounded like her mother and a man who
sounded like her dead grandfather. Although some improvement was
observed with antipsychotic medication, the girl still reported being
disturbed by ghosts and reported ideas of reference---that people were
talking about her. The mother decided that her daughter suffered from
"fakama-haki," a culture-bound syndrome in which deceased relatives can
inflict illness or possess the living when customs have been neglected.
She took her daughter to Tonga to be treated. For five days, a
traditional healer ("witch doctor") treated the girl with herbal
potions. Vomiting was induced to remove toxins from the body. She also
visited her grandfather's grave site to allow proper mourning. The girl
returned to the United States and was reevaluated. No symptoms of
psychosis could be found. Follow-up contact revealed that the girl was
continuing to do well. This case is interesting because medication was
only minimally successful, whereas traditional healing seemed to be
effective. Again, it might have been just that the disorder was
time-limited, but how can we account for the seemingly successful
treatment of severe mental disorders through folk medicine (Takeuchi,
2000)? As noted throughout this book, the study of cross-cultural
perspectives on psychopathology is important because indigenous belief
systems influence views of etiology and treatment. In India, for
example, the belief in supernatural causation of schizophrenia is very
widespread, leading to consultation and treatment by indigenous healers
(Banerjee & Roy, 1998). In a study of four ethnic groups of patients
with schizophrenia (U.K. whites, African Caribbeans, Bangladeshi, and
West Africans), distinct differences in explanatory models were found
for the disorder (McCabe & Priebe, 2004; see Table 13.5). The different
models included biological (physical illness/substance abuse); social
(interpersonal problems/stress/negative childhood events/personality);
supernatural (evil forces, evil magic); and nonspecific (do not
know/other). The white group as compared to the other ethnic groups was
the most likely to attribute biological causes for their condition. None
identified supernatural causes as a potential causal factor---an
explanation selected by a substantial minority of individuals from the
other ethnic groups. The particular etiological model also influenced
the response to treatment type. Those who cited biological causes
believed they were receiving the right treatment (medications).

a supernatural explanatory model wanted more alternative forms of
treatment, such as religious activities. Thus views of etiology affect
an individual's ideas regarding the nature of his or her problem, its
severity, prognosis, and appropriate treatment.

The Treatment of Schizophrenia Through the years, schizophrenia has been
"treated" by a variety of means, including prefrontal lobotomy, a
surgical procedure in which the frontal lobes are disconnected from the
remainder of the patient's brain, and "warehousing" severely disturbed
patients in overcrowded asylums. Such radical procedures were generally
abandoned in the 1950s, when the beneficial effects of antipsychotic
drugs were discovered. Today schizophrenia is typically treated with
antipsychotic medication, along with some type of psychosocial therapy.
In recent years, the research and clinical perspective on people with
schizophrenia has shifted from a focus on disease and deficit to one of
recovery and promotion of health, competencies, independence, and
self-determination (Bellack, 2006). This change of focus is affecting
therapists' roles, their views of clients and their families, and
appropriate treatments (Glynn et al., 2006). We first discuss medication
in the treatment of schizophrenia and then the psychological and social
therapies.

Antipsychotic Medication Case Study Peter was a twenty-nine-year-old man
with chronic paranoid schizophrenia. . . . When on medication, he heard
voices talking about him and felt that his phone was bugged. When off
medication, he had constant hallucinations and his behavior became
unpredictable. . . . He was on 10 milligrams of haloperidol (Haldol)
three times a day. . . . Peter complained that he had been quite
restless, and did not want to take the medication. Over the next six
months, Peter's psychiatrist gradually reduced Peter's medication to 4
milligrams per day. . . . At this dose, Peter continued to have
bothersome symptoms, but they remained moderate. . . . He was no longer
restless. (Liberman, Kopelowicz, & Young, 1994, p. 94)

The use of medication in Peter's case illustrates several points. First,
antipsychotic medications (also called neuroleptics) can reduce symptom
levels; second, dosage levels should be carefully monitored; and third,
side effects can occur as a result of medication. Most mental health
professionals consider the 1955 introduction of Thorazine, the first
antipsychotic drug, to be the beginning of a new era in treating
schizophrenia. For the first time, a medication was available that
sufficiently relaxed even violent patients with schizophrenia and helped
organize their thoughts to the point that straitjackets were no longer
needed for physical restraint. Although these medications have improved
the lives of patients, they do not cure the disorder. Nearly five
decades later, conventional antipsychotics (Thorazine and related
medications called the phenothiazines) are still viewed as effective
treatments for schizophrenia, although their use has been largely
supplanted by newer, atypical antipsychotics. Conventional or older
antipsychotic medications (chlorpromazine/Thorazine, haloperidol/Haldol,
perphenazine/Trilafon, and fluphenazine/Prolixin) have dopaminergic
receptor-blocking capabilities (they reduce dopamine levels), which led
to the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. The newer atypical
antipsychotics (such as clozapine/Clozaril, risperidone/Risperdal,
olanzapine/Zyprexa, quetiapine/Seroquel, and ziprasidone/Geodon) act on
multiple receptor sites in the central nervous system and are less
likely to produce side effects such as rigidity, persistent muscle
spasms, tremors, and restlessness that are found with the older
antipsychotic medications (Canas, 2005). Both types of antipsychotic
medications can effectively reduce the severity of the positive symptoms
of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations, delusions, bizarre speech, and
thought disorders. Most, however, offer little relief from the negative
symptoms of social withdrawal, apathy, and impaired personal hygiene

Conley, Buchanan, Breier, & Tamminga, 1995; Strous et al., 2004). As
Green (2007) noted, "Optimism that second-generation antipsychotics
would yield cognitive improvements has progressively been tempered ...
the high hopes for beneficial cognitive effects from antipsychotic
medications are now hanging by threads" (p. 992). Moreover, a
"relatively large group" of people with schizophrenia do not benefit at
all from antipsychotic medication (Wiesel, 1994; Silverman et al.,
1987). Because of the side effects of the medications, treatment
adherence is poor, especially among younger patients and African
American patients (Valenstein et al., 2004). Newer antipsychotic
medications cost ten times more than older antipsychotics. Are these
newer antipsychotic medications more effective than first-generation
antipsychotics? Are they less likely to produce side effects? Answers to
these questions were sought in the largest, most comprehensive
nationwide comparative drug study, known as CATIE (Clinical
Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness). The effectiveness
of an older antipsychotic (perphenazine) was compared with several newer
antipsychotic medications (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or
ziprasidone) in the treatment of chronic schizophrenia (average length
of illness in the participants was 14.4 years). The following
conclusions were reached (Lieberman et al., 2005): • Surprisingly, the
older, less expensive medication (perphenazine) used in the study
generally performed as well as the four newer medications. Newer
antipsychotics did not have an advantage over older antipsychotics in
treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. • With all antipsychotics, there
were high rates of discontinuation due to intolerable side effects or
failure to control symptoms. (Nearly three-quarters of the patients
discontinued their assigned drugs and switched to another.) • Olanzapine
was slightly more effective but was associated with significant weight
gain. • Contrary to expectations, extrapyramidal symptoms (movement side
effects, rigidity, stiff movements, tremor, and muscle restlessness)
were not seen more frequently with the older drug than with the newer
drugs. These findings question the assumption that the newer
antipsychotic medications are more effective and produce fewer side
effects than older antipsychotic medications. (It should be noted that
the older antipsychotic, perphenazine, was chosen for its more limited
side effects.) Some of the earlier findings that showed
second-generation antipsychotics to be superior in alleviating cognitive
problems may be due to assessment practice effects. For example, healthy
individuals showed the same "improvement" on cognitive tasks as
individuals with schizophrenia when undergoing repeated testing
(Goldberg et al., 2007), presumably because of practice effects. The
findings from the CATIE study prompted one researcher, Green (2007), to
suggest the need to identify new drugs that work through different
neuropharmacological mechanisms. As was mentioned earlier, most
individuals treated with antipsychotic medications will develop
extrapyramidal symptoms, which include Parkinsonism (muscle tremors,
shakiness, and immobility), dystonia (slow and continued contrasting
movements of the limbs and tongue), akathesis (motor restlessness), and
neuroleptic malignant syndrome (muscle rigidity and autonomic
instability, which can be fatal if untreated). Other symptoms may
involve the loss of facial expression, immobility, shuffling gait,
tremors of the hand, rigidity of the body, and poor postural stability;
these symptoms are usually reversible (Casey, 2006). A more chronic or
permanent condition, tardive dyskinesia, may develop. This condition is
characterized by involuntary and rhythmic movements of the tongue;
chewing, lip smacking, and other facial movements; and jerking movements
of the limbs. At risk for this disorder are people who have been treated
with antipsychotic medications over a long period of time. The elderly
appear to be especially vulnerable to neuroleptic side effects (Meltzer,
2000; Zayas & Grossberg, 1998). Women tend to have both more frequent
and more severe tardive dyskinesia than do men (American Psychiatric
Association, 1997; Yassa & Jeste, 1992).

The Treatment of Schizophrenia

controversy

Balancing Prevention and Harm I am concerned that the article entitled
"Randomized, double-blind trial of olanzapine versus placebo in patients
prodomally symptomatic for psychosis" lacked discussion regarding the
ethics of treating young (average age = 18.2 years) and nonpsychotic
patients with the neuroleptic olanzapine for 1 year. (Block, 2006,
p. 1838)

Block was responding to a study by McGlashan and colleagues (2006) in
which the researchers identiﬁed a group of prodromal patients
(individuals with early symptoms of schizophrenia that are associated
with a heightened vulnerability to developing psychosis) and randomly
assigned them to a medication or a placebo treatment. The study was
controversial for several reasons. First, one group of prodromal
individuals was given antipsychotic medications for one full year, while
the other group of prodromal individuals received a placebo. Questions
were raised regarding the use of an antipsychotic medication for an
extended duration in individuals who had not yet developed the disorder
and, conversely, the advisability of giving prodromal individuals only a
placebo. In response to the criticism, McGlashan (2006) gave the
following rationale for the study: • The individuals were prodromal and
had a substantial risk of becoming psychotic within a year. • Medication
might prevent the progression to psychosis. • It is probably more
harmful to develop psychosis than to suffer the side effects of
medication.

• Although false positives (mistakenly labeling an individual as ill)
may occur, it is common in other medical interventions. What were the
ﬁndings of the study? Of the two prodromal groups, 16.1 percent of the
medication group and 37.9 percent of the placebo group developed
psychosis during the one-year period. However, during an additional
followup period, many more in the medication group developed psychosis.
Medication seemed only to delay rather than to prevent the occurrence of
psychosis. Additionally, the majority of the participants did not
develop schizophrenia during the study nor within two follow-up periods.
Another eight-month follow-up study (Niendam et al., 2007) of untreated
prodromal individuals found that about 50 percent showed improvement in
social and role functioning without treatment, whereas the other half
showed either stability or decline in functioning. In other words, the
emergence of psychosis is not inevitable among individuals during the
prodromal period. For Further Consideration 1. In view of the fact that
McGlashan and colleagues (2007) believe that the prodromal period should
be a target for early identiﬁcation and for treatment, what forms of
intervention should be utilized, and how can you reduce the number of
diagnostic false positives? 2. If early intervention is an important
goal, does it make sense to expose prodromal individuals to a lengthy
placebo condition?

Regulation and monitoring of antipsychotic drugs is especially
important, as is using the minimum effective dose possible (Lehman et
al., 2004). However, a study of 719 patients diagnosed with
schizophrenia revealed that the dosage levels of their antipsychotic
medications were often outside the recommended treatment ranges and that
minority patients were more likely to be on higher levels than white
patients (Lehman & Steinwachs, 1998). Equally disturbing, clinicians are
often unaware of possible reactions to the drugs, which include tremors,
motor restlessness, anxiety, agitation, extreme terror, and even
impulsive suicide attempts (Drake & Ehrlich, 1985; Hirose, 2003; Lehman
& Steinwachs, 1998). In one study (Weiden et al., 1987), clinicians did
not identify motor symptoms such as restlessness, rigidity, and tremors
produced by medications. Clinicians accurately identified only one of
ten patients showing tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movement disorder).
Therefore, although antipsychotic medications are still considered to be
an effective treatment for schizophrenia, they must be carefully
monitored in terms of dosage, effectiveness, and side effects.

Psychosocial Therapy Case Study Philip's psychotic symptoms had been
reduced with medication. However, he was unable to obtain employment
because of cognitive and behavioral peculiarities. Philip did not seem
to understand what was considered to be appropriate conversational
topics and attire. The counselor suggested that his clothing
(sweatshirt, exercise pants, head band, and worn sneakers) might be

386

C H A P T E R 1 3 • S C H I Z O P H R E N I A : D I A G N O S I S , E T
I O LO G Y, A N D T R E AT M E N T

inappropriate for a job interview. In addition, his ﬁrst-impression
skills for interviews were lacking. Field trips allowed Philip to
observe attire worn by individuals in different businesses. He was
trained in conversational topics and practiced job interviews with his
counselor. Philip decided to apply for landscape work, wore a work
shirt, blue jeans, and construction boots, and was hired by a
landscaping contractor. (Heinssen & Cuthbert, 2001)

Many individuals with schizophrenia behave "strangely," do not have
positive conversational skills, and display faulty thinking. Social
communication is problematic because many exhibit consistent deficits in
emotional perception and in understanding the beliefs and attitudes of
others (Combs et al., 2007). Heinssen and Cuthbert (2001) found that
eccentricities in appearance, attire, and communication patterns and
lack of discretion in discussing their illness can impede employment or
the establishment of social networks. Psychotherapeutic approaches have
been tailored to address these issues, allowing many individuals with
schizophrenia to acquire competitive employment. Most clinicians today
agree that the most beneficial treatment for schizophrenia is some
combination of antipsychotic medication and therapy. But even as
scientists continue to introduce drugs that effectively reduce many
symptoms of schizophrenia, one vital fact is clear: medicated and
adequately functioning people with schizophrenia discharged from
protective hospital environments often return to stressful home or work
situations. The typical result is repeated rehospitalization; medication
alone is often not enough to help those with schizophrenia function in
their natural environments. Clinicians realize that antipsychotic
medication must be supplemented with psychotherapy. Such therapy
includes traditional institutional approaches, cognitive-behavioral
therapies, and interventions based on family communication.
Institutional Approaches Traditional institutional treatments providing
custodial care and medication for patients with schizophrenia have
yielded poor results, although milieu therapy and behavioral therapy
have been found to be more effective. In milieu therapy, the hospital
environment operates as a community, and patients exercise a wide range
of responsibilities, helping to make decisions and to manage the wards.
This type of therapy sharply contrasts with the passive role patients
with schizophrenia have had in traditional settings. Social learning
programs focus on increasing appropriate self-care behaviors,
conversational skills, and role skills, such as job training and ward
activities. Undesirable behaviors such as "crazy talk" or social
isolation are decreased through reinforcement and modeling techniques.
Both approaches have been shown to be effective in helping many people
with schizophrenia achieve independent living (Falloon, Boyd, & McGill,
1984). Living in community homes also has produced positive results. In
a study of nearly 100 patients with chronic schizophrenia placed in
community facilities, almost all improved. They reported more
friendships and fewer symptoms than those who remained institutionalized
(Leff, 1994). Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Major advances have been made
in the use of cognitive and behavioral strategies in treating the
symptoms of schizophrenia, especially among those who have not been
fully helped through medications. The therapeutic interventions tend to
share the same format. Positive and negative symptoms are targeted with
the goal of reducing their frequency and severity and the associated
distress. Coping skills are enhanced to allow the patient to manage both
positive and negative symptoms and the cognitive deficits found in
schizophrenia (Hansen, Kingdon, & Turkington, 2006; Zimmermann et al.,
2005). The following is an example of the use of cognitive-behavioral
treatment in an individual with schizophrenia. Note the strategies used
to treat her symptoms: a therapy program in which the hospital
environment operates as a community and patients exercise a wide range
of responsibility, helping to make decisions and to manage wards

to stop while in her apartment). . . . When she did leave her home, she
often covered her head with a black kerchief and wore dark sunglasses,
partly in an effort to disguise herself from her persecutors. . . .
(Cather, 2005, p. 260)

In dealing with the symptoms of schizophrenia, the following steps are
often utilized (Hansen et al., 2006). • Engagement The therapist
explains the therapy and works to foster a safe and collaborative method
of looking at causes of distress, drawing out the person's own
understanding of the situation and ways of coping with it. The
relationship between stress, anxiety, and the worsening of symptoms in
discussed. • Assessment Patients are encouraged to express their own
thoughts about the fears and anxiety they experience; the therapist
shares information about how symptoms are formed and maintained. In the
preceding case, the case formulation, shared with the patient, was to
help her make sense of her persecutory experiences. She was informed
that victims of abuse often internalize beliefs that they are
responsible for the abuse (such as a belief that only a bad person would
be punished in such a manner). Her view that she was "bad" led to
expectations of negative reactions from others and the need to disguise
herself. • Identification of negative beliefs The therapist explains the
linkage between the emotional distress the patient is experiencing and
the beliefs he or she holds. The patient's own beliefs, such as "Nobody
will like me if I tell them about my voices" (p. 50), can be disputed
and changed to "I can't demand that everyone like me. Some people will
and some won't" (p. 50). This reinterpretation often leads to less
sadness and isolation. • Normalization The therapist works with the
patient to decatastrophize the psychotic experiences. Information that
many people can have unusual experiences reduces the patient's sense of
isolation. • Collaborative analysis of symptoms Once a strong
therapeutic alliance has been established, the therapist begins critical
discussions of the patient's symptoms, such as "If voices come from your
head, why can't others hear them?" Evidence for and against the
maladaptive beliefs is discussed, combined with information about how
beliefs are maintained through cognitive distortions or inferences. •
Developing alternative explanations The therapist helps the patient
develop alternatives to previous maladaptive assumptions, using the
patient's ideas whenever possible. If needed, the therapist helps
collaboratively develop new explanations.

I O LO G Y, A N D T R E AT M E N T

A newer form of cognitive therapy, integrated psychological therapy
(IPT), has also produced promising results. IPT specifically targets
deficits found in individuals with schizophrenia, such as basic
impairments in neurocognition (e.g., attention, verbal memory, cognitive
flexibility, concept formation), deficits in social cognition (social
and emotional perception, emotional expression), interpersonal
communication (e.g., verbal fluency and executive functioning), and
problem-solving skills. In a meta-analysis of IPT, Roder and colleagues
(2007) concluded: "IPT is an effective rehabilitation approach for
schizophrenia that is robust across a wide range of patients and
treatment conditions" (p. 81).

Interventions Focusing on Family Communication and Education A serious
mental illness such as schizophrenia can have a powerful effect on the
patient's family members, who may feel stigmatized or responsible for
the disorder. As one woman stated:

ARTWORK TO DEMONSTRATE CREATIVE TALENTS A self portrait by artist
William Scott is displayed at the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland,
California. The artist, diagnosed with schizophrenia and autism, has had
his paintings and sculptures sold around the world in the trendiest
galleries. The program hopes to decrease the stigma associated with
mental illness by highlighting the creative talents of patients.

All family members are affected by a loved one's mental illness. The
entire family system needs to be addressed. To assure us that we are not
to blame and the situation is not hopeless. To point us to the people
and places that can help our loved one. The impact still lingers on
(Marsh & Johnson, 1997).

Siblings without the disorder also display a variety of emotional
reactions to their sick brother or sister---love ("She's really kind and
loves me so very much it's never been a problem"), loss ("Somehow I've
lost my sister the way she was before and I think I won't get her back")
anger ("Yes, it's hell. . . . She's incredibly mean to our mother and
she sure as hell doesn't deserve that"), guilt and shame ("Yes, you can
think about how he got ill and I didn't"), and fear ("You worry a lot
about getting it yourself"; Stalberg, Ekerwald, & Hultman, 2004,
p. 450). More than 50 percent of recovering patients return to live with
their families, and new psychological interventions address this fact.
Family intervention programs have not only reduced relapse rates but
have also lowered the cost of care. They have been beneficial for
families with and without communication patterns such as EE. Most
programs include the following components (Glynn et al., 2006; Mueser et
al., 2001): 1. Normalizing the family experience 2. Demonstrating
concern, empathy, and sympathy to all family members 3. Educating family
members about schizophrenia 4. Avoiding blaming the family or
pathologizing their coping efforts 5. Identifying the strengths and
competencies of the patient and family members 6. Developing skills in
problem solving and managing stress 7. Teaching family members to cope
with the symptoms of mental illness and its repercussions on the family
8. Strengthening the communication and problem-solving skills of family
members Family approaches and social skills training are much more
effective in preventing relapse than is drug treatment alone. Combining
cognitive-behavioral strategies, family counseling, and social skills
training seems to produce the most positive result (Penn et al., 2004).
The combination of medication and the new psychological interventions
has provided hope for many patients with schizophrenia; continuing
research points to an even more promising future for individuals with
the disorder and their families.

The Treatment of Schizophrenia

Research and treatment on schizophrenia is undergoing a dramatic change.
Genetic research has moved beyond attempting to identify the specific
genes underlying the disorder to the recognition that schizophrenia is a
result of dozens of genes and their interactions. Research has shifted
to identifying the endophenotypes that underlie the characteristics of
the disorder and the genes responsible. It is also increasingly
acknowledged that environmental factors may alter neurodevelopment in a
manner that increases the susceptibility to schizophrenia. New
antipsychotic medications continued to be developed, although there is
increasing pessimism about current medications because many cognitive
characteristics are not improved with their use and because the majority
of individuals on antipsychotics do not follow the treatment regimen.
Psychosocial therapies are also evolving, with greater attention focused
on treatments that address the specific deficits found in schizophrenia.
The focus on "recovery" rather than cure offers a more optimistic
philosophy in treatment.

I M P L I C AT I O N S

Summary 1. What are the symptoms of schizophrenia? ■ Positive symptoms
of schizophrenia involve unusual thoughts or perceptions, such as
delusions, hallucinations, thought disorder (shifting and unrelated
ideas that produce incoherent communication), and bizarre behavior. ■
Negative

symptoms of schizophrenia are associated with an inability or decreased
ability to initiate actions or speech, express emotions, or feel
pleasure. Such symptoms include avolition (an inability to take action
or become goal-oriented), alogia (a lack of meaningful speech), and flat
affect (little or no emotion in situations in which strong reactions are
expected). ■ Cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia include problems with
attention, memory, and difficulty in developing a plan of action. 2. How
do the specific types of schizophrenia differ from one another? ■
Paranoid schizophrenia is characterized by one or more systematized
delusions or auditory hallucinations and by the absence of such symptoms
as disorganized speech and behavior or flat affect. ■ Disorganized
schizophrenia is characterized by grossly disorganized behaviors
manifested in disorganized speech and behavior and flat or grossly
inappropriate affect. ■ Catatonic schizophrenia's major feature is
disturbance

of motor activity. Patients show excessive excitement, agitation, and
hyperactivity or withdrawn behavior patterns. ■ The undifferentiated
type includes schizophrenic behav-

ior that cannot be classified as one of the other types. ■ Residual
schizophrenia is a category for people who

have had at least one episode of schizophrenia but are

not now showing prominent symptoms. In addition, other severe disorders
may include schizophrenic-like symptoms. 3. Is there much chance of
recovery from schizophrenia? ■ Although most people assume that the
prognosis for

individuals with schizophrenia is not good, research is beginning to
show that that may not be the case. Many of these individuals experience
minimal or no lasting impairment. Most individuals with schizophrenia
recover enough to lead relatively productive lives. 4. What causes
schizophrenia? ■ The best conclusion is that genetics and environmental
factors (physical, psychological, or social) combine to cause the
disorder. Heredity is a major factor but not sufficient to cause
schizophrenia; environmental factors are also involved. Certain negative
family patterns involving parental characteristics or intrafamilial
communication processes have been hypothesized to result in
schizophrenia. There is little evidence that psychological factors in
and of themselves can cause the condition. 5. What treatments are
currently available for schizophrenia, and are they effective? ■
Schizophrenia seems to involve both biological and physiological
factors, and treatment programs that combine drugs with psychotherapy
appear to hold the most promise. ■ Drug therapy usually involves
conventional antipsychotics (the phenothiazines) or the newer atypical
antipsychotics. ■ The accompanying psychosocial therapy consists of
either supportive counseling or behavior therapy, with an emphasis on
social skills training and changing communication patterns among
patients and family members.

and that are caused by brain dysfunction. Psychiatric conditions with
associated cognitive symptoms (such as schizophrenia) are not considered
in this category or in this chapter. Particular attention is paid to
cognitive changes and disorders associated with aging because some
cognitive disorders occur primarily in old age (Gatz, 2007).

CHAPTER 14 • COGNITIVE DISORDERS

To some extent, the diagnosis of a cognitive disorder is a process of
elimination. For example, delirium is a syndrome in which someone shows
a disturbance of consciousness, an inability to maintain attention,
memory problems, disorientation, and so on. When the delirium cannot be
attributed to another mental disorder (such as a mood disorder) and when
evidence exists that a general medical condition (such as disease,
health problems, cardiovascular or neurological problems, or brain
trauma) is related to the disturbance, it is considered a cognitive
disorder. The category of cognitive disorders is somewhat arbitrary,
because other mental disorders may be associated with cognitive
dysfunction and organic involvement. As you will see, it is often
difficult to measure and assess, as well as to discern, the exact causes
of the cognitive disorders. Possible causes of cognitive disorders
include aging, trauma, infection, loss of blood supply, substance abuse,
and various biochemical imbalances. These may result in cognitive,
emotional, and behavioral symptoms that can resemble the symptoms of the
mental disorders (Abeles & Victor, 2003). Although behavioral
disturbance stems from brain pathology, it is influenced by social and
psychological factors, as well as by the specific pathology. People with
similar types of brain damage may behave quite differently, depending on
their premorbid personalities, their coping skills, and the availability
of such resources as family support systems. Furthermore, people with
cognitive impairments often are treated with insensitivity by other
people, so they experience a lot of stress. This stress may add STILL A

combination of physical/biological, medicinal, and psychological
therapy; it may include medication, behavior modification, and skills
training. For some patients who have severe and irreversible brain
damage, the only available options may be rehabilitation, modified
skills training, and the creation of a supportive environment. We
discussed the structure of the human brain in Chapter 2; here we focus
primarily on the assessment, types, major causes, and treatment of
cognitive disorders.

The Assessment of Brain Damage electroencephalograph (EEG)

a neurological test that assesses brain damage by measuring the
electrical activity of brain cells computerized axial tomography (CT) a
neurological test that

assesses brain damage by means of x-rays and computer technology
cerebral blood ﬂow measurement

a technique for assessing brain damage in which the patient inhales
radioactive gas and a gamma ray camera tracks the gas---and thus the ﬂow
of blood---as it moves throughout the brain

Two types of techniques are used to assess brain damage, and both were
discussed in Chapter 3. The first consists of psychological tests and
inventories that require behavioral responses from the patient and that
assess functions such as memory and manual dexterity. These tests have
become quite sophisticated, in that theories from neuropsychological
science and quantitative methods are being applied to find a means to
assess brain pathology. The second type of assessment tool is
neurological testing, which permits more direct monitoring of brain
functioning and structure. This tool increases diagnostic accuracy by
letting researchers and diagnosticians "look into" the living brain and
see evidence of its structure and functions. For example, the
electroencephalograph (EEG) measures electrical activity of brain cells.
Computerized axial tomography (CT) scanning assesses brain damage by
means of x-rays and computer technology. Two additional techniques
monitor a radioactive substance as it moves through the brain. In
cerebral blood flow measurement, the patient inhales a radioactive gas,
and a gamma ray camera tracks the gas---and thus the flow of blood---as
it moves throughout the brain. In a positron emission tomography (PET)
scan, the patient is injected with radioactive glucose, and the
metabolism of glucose in the patient's

brain is monitored. This method provides a very accurate means of
assessing brain function. A fifth technique produces snapshots of brain
anatomy that have striking resolution, almost like a photograph with the
skull removed---except that it is accomplished without surgery, exposure
to x-rays (as in CT scans), or ingesting radioactive materials (as in
PET scans). In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the patient is placed
in a magnetic field, and radio waves are used to produce pictures of the
brain. Continuing advances in neuroimaging, especially with MRI, have
resulted in functional brain imaging approaches such as the dynamic
functional MRI. Each of these techniques has strengths and weaknesses in
terms of costs, benefits, and possible side effects. For example,

However, the procedure is expensive and requires patients neoplasms,

brain. In initial screening for cognitive disorders, clinicians may What
advantages do you see in using the MRI over other procedures, such as
PET or CT scans? evaluate cognitive functioning by using a mental status
examination (see Chapter 3) or by simply asking a patient to give his or
her name and place of birth and to repeat phrases or write sentences
that the clinician says aloud. At that time, and equally important, the
clinician assesses the patient's general functioning, personality
characteristics, and coping skills, as well as his or her behaviors and
emotional reactions, particularly those that differ from reported
premorbid functioning. Such an assessment can provide crucial
information about brain dysfunction, and it is of utmost importance in
planning treatment and rehabilitation.

Types of Cognitive Disorders Four major cognitive disorder categories
are listed in DSM-IV-TR: dementia, delirium, amnestic disorders, and
cognitive disorders not otherwise specified. In each, clinicians
categorize the disorder according to its cause. In general, the causes
are classified as due to a general medical condition, a
substance-induced condition, multiple etiologies, or conditions not
otherwise specified. For example, a client may be given the diagnosis of
delirium. If the delirium is caused by the use of psychoactive
substances, it is considered to be a case of substance-induced delirium.
If the type of substance is identified, it is also specified (see Table
14.2). In some cases, individuals also have symptoms of other mental
disorders (such as a mood, psychotic, or anxiety disorder) for which
there is evidence that the disorder is due to a general medical
condition (e.g., disease or brain trauma). In this case, DSMIV-TR lists
the disorder within a category appropriate for the symptom pattern. For
example, a mood disorder due to a general medical condition is
classified under mood disorders, and an anxiety disorder due to a
general medical condition is found under the category of anxiety
disorders. Neither would be diagnosed as a cognitive disorder.

Dementia Dementia is characterized by memory impairment and cognitive
disturbances, such as aphasia (language disturbance that was illustrated
in the case of Albert Harris at the beginning of the chapter), apraxia
(inability to carry out motor activities despite intact comprehension
and motor function), agnosia (failure to recognize or identify objects
despite intact sensory function), or disturbances in planning and
abstracting in thought processes. The multiple cognitive deficits are
severe enough to hinder social and occupational activities and represent
a significant decline from a previous level of functioning. People with
dementia may forget to finish tasks, the names of significant others,
and past events. Some people who exhibit dementia also display impulse
control problems. They may, for example, disrobe in public or make

Dementia usually is caused by degeneration in the cerebral cortex, the
part 85+ 25--50% of the brain responsible for thoughts, memories,
actions, and personality. Death of brain cells in this region leads to
the cognitive impairment that characterizes dementia (Boustani et al.,
2003). As discussed in more detail later, dementia can occur for
numerous reasons. DSM-IV-TR lists the major etiological categories Did

he auto-driving competency of persons with dementia has been of major
safety concern. One study has shown that in simulated driving
situations, people with dementia had more speeding tickets, ran more
stop signs, and were involved in more accidents than matched control
persons with no dementia (de Simone et al., 2006). The vast majority of
people with dementia are still driving.

Delirium Delirium is characterized by disturbance of consciousness and
changes in cognition (memory deficit, disorientation, and language and
perceptual disturbances). These impairments and changes are not
attributable to dementia. The disorder develops rather rapidly over a
course of hours or days. The patient often shows a reduced ability to
focus, sustain, or shift attention and exhibits disorganized patterns of
thinking, as manifested by rambling, irrelevant, or incoherent speech.
At times patients show a reduced level of consciousness and disturbances
in the cycle of sleep and waking. The condition is usually reversible.
The following describes a case of a student who was treated for
amphetamine-induced delirium:

Case Study

changes in cognition, such as memory deﬁcit, disorientation, and
language and perceptual disturbances

An eighteen-year-old high school senior was brought to the emergency
room by police after being picked up wandering in trafﬁc on the
Triborough Bridge \[in New York City\]. He was angry, agitated, and
aggressive and talked of various people who were deliberately trying to
"confuse" him by giving him misleading directions. His story was
rambling and disjointed, but he admitted to the police ofﬁcer that he
had been using "speed." In the emergency room he had difﬁculty focusing
his attention and had to ask that questions be repeated. He was
disoriented as to time and place and was unable to repeat the names of
three objects after ﬁve minutes. The family gave a history of the
patient's regular use of "pep pills" over the past two years, during
which time he was frequently "high" and did very poorly in school.
(Spitzer et al., 1994, p. 162)

Etiology of Cognitive Disorders

Certain groups of patients are at risk for developing delirium (Wise et
al., 1999). They include the elderly, frail individuals who are
recovering in a medical setting, patients with preexisting brain
dysfunction (e.g., stroke), patients in the withdrawal phase of drug
dependency, patients with AIDS, and those with high illness burden
(e.g., burn patients and elderly patients; Edlund et al., 2007).
Obviously, some patients have multiple risk factors, as found in those
who are elderly, who have suffered a stroke, and who are recovering from
surgery. When people grow older, they have less cerebral reserve and are
more likely to develop delirium with medical illness, stress conditions,
or surgical procedures (Wise, Hilty, & Cerda, 2001). As in the case of
dementia, delirium is classified according to its cause: general medical
condition, substance-induced condition, multiple etiologies, and not
otherwise specified.

mental disorder probably involving thiamine deficiency (Wise et al.,
1999). All three conditions---dementia, delirium, and amnestic
disorders---have overlapping symptoms, especially those involving memory
deficits. Some important differences distinguish the three, however.
Dementia involves not only memory impairment but also conditions such as
aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia. In contrast, the memory dysfunctions that
occur in delirium happen relatively quickly, unlike those of dementia,
in which functioning gradually declines. Delirium also involves an
impairment of consciousness. In amnestic disorders, the primary symptom
involves memory. However, when other cognitive deficits are noted in
individuals with amnestic disorders, the risk for the subsequent
development of AD and dementia is increased (Tabert et al., 2006).
Figure 14.1 shows the unique characteristics, as well as the overlap in
cognitive symptoms, of the three conditions. Cognitive disorders that do
not meet the criteria for dementia, delirium, or amnestic disorders
would be classified as cognitive disorders not otherwise specified.

Etiology of Cognitive Disorders Cognitive disorders can be caused by
many different factors, and the same factor can result in dementia,
delirium, or amnestic disorder. Rather than dividing the etiological
discussion into our multipath model that includes biological,
psychological, social, and sociocultural factors, we focus on the
sources of cognitive disorders. The reason is that the direct causes of
cognitive disorders are usually specified, such as brain trauma;
processes associated with aging, disease, and infection; tumors;
epilepsy; and psychoactive substance-induced disorders. Table 14.4 lists
the different kinds of causes for the different cognitive disorders.

aving limited interactions with others is related to an increased risk
of dementia and mental decline. Wilson and colleagues (Wilson, Krueger,
et al., 2007) have found that emotional isolation (feeling alone rather
than being alone) increases risk for Alzheimer's disease in late life.
For some reason, loneliness appears to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's
disease, not an early sign of the disease. The ﬁndings reveal the
importance of psychological factors in disease.

Heredity is important in some cognitive disorders, especially dementia.
In twin studies, the concordance rate for all dementias in men was 44
percent for MZ (monozygotic) pairs and 25 percent for DZ (dizygotic)
pairs, and in women it was 58 percent for MZ pairs and 45 percent for DZ
pairs. However, the longer one lives, the greater the chances for
dementia to develop, and women generally have a longer life expectancy
than men. Thus, although rates were higher for women than for men, once
the age of the women was taken into account, there was no significant
difference in genetic influence by sex (Gatz, 2007).

Traumatic Brain Injury Case Study On September 13, 1848, at Cavendish,
Vermont, Phineas Gage was working as foreman of a railroad excavation
crew. A premature explosion of a blast sent a tamping iron---a
three-foot rod about an inch in diameter--through the lower side of
Gage's face and out of the top of his head. Exhibiting some convulsions
and bleeding profusely, Gage soon regained speech. He was taken to his
hotel, where he walked up a ﬂight of stairs to get to his room.
Remarkably, Gage survived the trauma, even though there must have been
extensive damage to his brain tissue. Later, he appeared to have
completely recovered from the accident with no physical aftereffects.
However, Gage began to complain that he had a strange feeling, which he
could not describe. Soon, his employers and others noticed a marked
personality change in him. Although he had been a very capable employee
prior to the accident and was known for his affable disposition, Gage
now became moody, irritable, profane, impatient, and obstinate. So
radically changed was Gage that his friends said that he was "no longer
Gage." (Adapted from J. M. Harlow, 1868)

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a physical wound or injury to the brain,
as in the case of Phineas Gage. Approximately 1.4 million people sustain
a TBI each year in the United States. Of those, 50,000 die, 235,000 are
hospitalized, and 1.1 million are treated and released from an emergency
department (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \[CDC\], 2007f).

Case Study Thirteen-year-old Ron G was a catcher for his school baseball
team. During a game, a player on the other team lost his grip on the bat
as he swung at a pitch, and the bat hit Ron on the forehead. Although
his catcher's mask absorbed some of the force, the blow knocked Ron out.
An hour elapsed before he regained consciousness at a nearby hospital,
where he was diagnosed as having a cerebral contusion. Headaches, muscle
weakness, and nausea continued for two weeks.

Lacerations are brain traumas in which brain tissue is torn, pierced, or
ruptured, usually by an object that has penetrated the skull. When an
object also penetrates the brain, death may result. If the person
survives and regains consciousness, a variety of temporary or permanent
effects may be observed. Symptoms may be quite serious, depending on the
extent of damage to the brain tissue and on the amount of hemorrhaging.
Cognitive processes are frequently impaired, and the personality may
change. Closed-head injuries are the most common form of traumatic brain
injury. They usually result from a blow that causes damage at the site
of the impact and at the opposite side of the head. If the victim's head
was in motion before the impact (as is generally the case in car
accidents), the blow produces a forward-and-back movement of the brain,
accompanied by tearing and hemorrhaging of brain tissue. Damage to brain
tissues in the left hemisphere often results in intellectual disorders,
and affective problems more frequently result from damage to brain
tissues in the right hemisphere. The cumulative impact of traumas to the
head may also affect brain functioning. Severe brain trauma has
long-term negative consequences. Many young adults who are comatose for
at least twenty-four hours later experience residual cognitive deficits
that interfere with employment and psychosocial adjustment. Recovery
from the trauma often does not ensure a return to the victim's premorbid
level of functioning. Along with any physical or mental disabilities
produced by the brain damage, motivational and emotional disturbances
result from the frustration of coping with these physical or mental
deficits.

CHAPTER 14 • COGNITIVE DISORDERS

Myth vs Reality Myth: Mild head injuries among children and adolescents
are a "silent epidemic" in terms of seriousness of cognitive,
psychosocial, and academic consequences. Reality: Although a great deal
of concern has been raised over the frequency and consequence of mild
head injuries among children, there is no compelling evidence that these
injuries have the kinds of serious consequences as was initially
believed. A thorough review of the research on children with mild head
injuries revealed that most studies did not ﬁnd major negative
consequences (Satz, 2001). (A mild head injury is deﬁned as one in which
the period of unconsciousness is less than 20 minutes, which shows no
evidence of hematoma, for which a patient is not hospitalized for more
than two days, and in which the patient achieves nonserious scores on
the Glasgow Coma Scale.) Of course, any head injury should be of
concern. However, it is also important to place such injuries in proper
perspective.

number of soldiers in the Iraq war who may have suffered brain injuries

identiﬁed. Source: Zoroya (2007).

Aging and Disorders Associated with Aging Before discussing the
cognitive disorders often associated with aging, it seems appropriate to
describe the nature of the older U.S. population (sixty-five years old
or more), as noted by the Administration on Aging (2007). • About one in
every eight people, or 12.4 percent of the population, is an older
American. • The population age sixty-five and over will increase from 35
million in 2000 to 40 million in 2010 (a 15 percent increase) and then
to 55 million in 2020 (a 36 percent increase for that decade). • Older
women outnumber older men, at 21.4 million older women to 15.4 million
older men. • In 2005, 18.5 percent of persons sixty-five and older were
minorities; 8.3 percent were African Americans. Persons of Hispanic
origin (who may be of any race) represented 6.2 percent of the older
population. About 3.1 percent of the elderly were Asian or Pacific
Islander, and less than 1 percent were American Indian or Native
Alaskan. The cognitive disorders most common among the elderly are
strokes, memory loss, and AD. These conditions are correlated with
aging, but they also occur among younger people. Unfortunately, the
elderly are less likely than younger individuals to seek help from
mental health professionals (Clarkin & Levy, 2004).

RESULTS OF STROKE ON THE BRAIN Stroke is brain damage caused by the
interruption of the brain's blood supply, or by the leakage of blood
through blood vessel walls. The two main causes are high blood pressure
and narrowing of the arteries due to fat deposition. Here, a
three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiogram scan shows a human brain
after a stroke (cerebrovascular accident). Major arteries are shown in
white, while the central region in yellow is an area of bleeding, or
hemorrhage.

Cerebrovascular Accidents or Strokes A stroke (or cerebrovascular
accident) is a sudden stoppage of blood flow to a portion of the brain,
leading to a loss of brain function. The risk of a stroke is increased
if one has hypertension, heart disease, a history of smoking and alcohol
consumption, and diabetes. Strokes are the third major cause of death in
the United States and the second leading cause of dementia, right behind
AD (Wise et al., 1999). Stroke victims who survive often require
long-term care while suffering from a variety of psychological

Etiology of Cognitive Disorders

distress and sensory-motor disabilities. Stroke victims are often
frustrated and depressed by their handicaps, and they show greater
depression and interpersonal sensitivity than other groups of patients.
Their depression, pessimism, and anxiety about their disabilities
occasionally leads to further disability (Burruss, Travella, & Robinson,
2001). The bursting of blood vessels (and the attendant intracranial
hemorrhaging) causes 25 percent of all strokes and often occurs during
exertion. Victims report feeling that something is wrong within the
head, along with headaches and nausea. Confusion, paralysis, and loss of
consciousness follow rapidly. Mortality rates for this type of stroke
are extremely high. Strokes may also be caused by the narrowing of blood
vessels owing to a buildup of fatty material on interior walls
(atherosclerosis) or by the blockage of blood vessels. In either case,
the result is cerebral infarction, the death of brain tissue from a
decrease in the supply of blood. These strokes often occur during sleep,
and the person is paralyzed when he or she awakens. The residual loss of
function after a stroke usually involves only one side of the body, most
often the left. Interestingly, one residual symptom of stroke is a "lack
of acknowledgment" of various stimuli on one side of the body. For
example, a patient who is asked to copy a pattern may draw half the
pattern and may ignore the left side of his or her body. Some functional
reorganization of the brain may occur after a stroke to compensate for
the loss of function. Three months after suffering a stroke owing to
cerebral infarction, one patient showed significantly reduced cerebral
blood flow in one area. An examination performed one year later showed
no abnormalities. The pattern of blood flow, however, suggested
increased activation in brain areas surrounding the affected area. It is
possible that the patient's clinical improvement was due to brain
reorganization, in which the function of the destroyed area was taken
over by other areas. A series of infarctions may lead to a syndrome
known as vascular dementia, which is characterized by the uneven
deterioration of intellectual abilities (although some mental functions
may remain intact). The specific symptoms of this disruption depend on
the area and extent of the brain damage. Both physical and intellectual
functioning are usually impaired. The patient may show gradual
improvement in intellectual functioning, but repeated episodes of
infarction can occur, producing additional disability. Memory Loss in
Older People Fewer than one in five people over age sixtyfive experience
moderate to severe memory impairment (see Figure 14.3). Among those
eighty-five and older, about one-third suffer from moderate to severe
memory impairment. As individuals age, their brains shrink. They
gradually lose nerve cells that they had from birth, and information is
processed more slowly. Consequently, memory begins to fail, and the
learning of new concepts becomes more difficult. Some older adults may
show pronounced deficits in perception, attention, and memory, although
others perform at least as well as younger adults or experience less of
a drop in cognitive function. Evidence suggests that the brain
reorganizes itself, using different circuitry in older adults. It
dynamically reacts to experience, showing both gains and losses with age
(Population Reference Bureau, 2007). Memory loss occurs for a variety of
reasons. It is one of the most obvious symptoms of AD, which we discuss
in depth in the next section. Loss of memory may also be shown by
elderly people suffering vascular dementia. Because memory loss is
associated with so many disorders, as well as with normal aging, it is
of concern to older adults and yet difficult for clinicians to assess.
Occasional lapses of memory are not necessarily a sign of senility. One
of the most common reasons for memory loss and confusion in older
patients is therapeutic drug intoxication. People may take several
medications that can interact with one another to produce negative side
effects. Medication often has

EXPERIENCING A STROKE Neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor is shown holding
a human brain and spinal cord. One morning a congenital abnormality of
the blood vessels in her brain burst. For several hours, she experienced
her mind deteriorating. After becoming unconscious, she later awakened
and could not talk, understand language, or remember her life. She felt
completely disabled. After recovery, Taylor felt that the experience was
in many ways delightful. It shifted her out of her left hemisphere,
which thinks in language and focuses on the past and future, to the
consciousness of her right hemisphere, which thinks in pictures and
exists in the present moment. When her left hemisphere went off-line,
her right hemisphere became dominant. Taylor became a different person.
Shifting away from a typical type-A personality focused on academics,
career, and achievement, she has become more compassionate and humane.
Her values have shifted toward helping those in need such as people with
mental disorders, the homeless, and those in jail.

a stronger effect on older people and takes longer to be cleared from
their bodies, yet dosages are often determined by testing on young
adults only. In addition, cardiac, metabolic, and endocrine disorders
and nutritional deficiencies can produce symptoms resembling dementias.
Age-related declines in cognitive functioning can be relatively large.
The declines may not be noticed because cognitive ability is only one
factor in the success of one's functioning, because very few situations
require maximum levels of performance, because people may adapt to
age-related changes by somehow compensating for these changes, and
because greater knowledge and experience may also make up for the
changes (Salthouse, 2004). A decrease in cognitive functioning may also
bring psychological problems. Mental decline has been associated with
depression, and the decline seems to cause depression rather than
depression causing decline (Ganguli et al., 2006).

Myth vs Reality Myth: As we become older, we experience negative or
undesirable cognitive changes. Reality: With age, adults experience less
negative emotion, attend less to negative than to positive emotional
stimuli, and decrease their memory of negative versus positive emotional
materials. They tend to show reduced reactivity to negative information
while maintaining or even increasing reactivity to positive information.
By using functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess amygdala
activation, Mather and her colleagues (2004) found that for older
adults, seeing positive pictures led to greater amygdala activation than
seeing negative pictures, whereas this was not the case with younger
adults. With age, the amygdala may show decreased reactivity to negative
information while maintaining or increasing its reactivity to positive
information. Perhaps this is one advantage that comes with age.

Alzheimer's Disease Among Americans ages fifty-five and older,
Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which brain tissue atrophy results in
marked deterioration of intellectual and emotional functioning, was the
most feared on a list of diseases, exceeding cancer and strokes (Gatz,
2007). Many fear becoming a "mental vegetable." AD is the most prevalent
form of dementia, and it affects about five million Americans. The risk
for the disease increases with age. However, it also can attack people
in their forties or fifties. We have become increasingly aware of the
disease because public figures such as former president Ronald Reagan
and the late actor Charlton Heston have candidly discussed their
condition.

Alzheimer's disease (AD)

a dementia in which brain tissue atrophies, leading to marked
deterioration of intellectual and emotional functioning

Characteristics of Alzheimer's Disease The natural history of AD is one
of progressive decline; cognitive, physical, and social functions
gradually deteriorate. Thus "improvement" due to an intervention for AD
means slowing the rate of decline (Boustani et al., 2003). Early
symptoms---memory dysfunction, irritability, and cognitive
impairment---gradually worsen, and other symptoms, such as social
withdrawal, depression, apathy, delusions, impulsive behaviors, and
neglect of personal hygiene may eventually appear. At present, no
curative or disease-reversing interventions exist for AD (Rivas-Vazquez,
2001). From the time of diagnosis, people with AD survive about half as
long as those of similar age without dementia (Larson et al., 2004).

AGING WELL Members of laughter clubs participate in a laughter
competition for the elderly to celebrate World Laughter Day in Mumbai,
India. Laughter Yoga is a physically oriented technique that uses simple
laughter exercises and is believed to improve health and increase
well-being.

Case Study Elizabeth R, a forty-six-year-old woman diagnosed as
suffering from AD, is trying to cope with her increasing problems with
memory. She writes notes to herself and tries to compensate for her
difﬁculties by rehearsing conversations with herself, anticipating what
might be said. However, she is gradually losing the battle and has had
to retire from her job. She quickly forgets what she has just read, and
she loses the meaning of an article after reading only a few sentences.
She sometimes has to ask where the bathroom is in her own house and is
depressed by the realization that she is a burden to her family. (Clark
et al., 1984, p. 60)

The deterioration of memory seems to be the most poignant and disturbing
symptom for those who have AD. They may at first forget appointments,
phone numbers, and addresses. As the disorder progresses, they may lose
track of the time of day, have trouble remembering recent and past
events, and forget who they are. But even when memory is almost gone,
contact with loved ones is still important.

Case Study I believe the emotional memory of relationships is the last
to go. You can see daughters or sons come to visit, for example, and the
mother will respond. She doesn't know who they are, but you can tell by
her expression that she knows they're persons to whom she is devoted.
(Materka, 1984, p. 13)

AD can also create some unusual and bittersweet situations. Retired
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's husband developed AD. While
living at a facility for people with AD, he forgot his wife and fell in
love with another woman at the facility. In a display of her love for
her husband, Sandra Day O'Connor was relieved that her husband felt
happy and was like "a teenager in love." Prior to his new romance when
he first came to the center, he basically spoke about suicide (Biskupic,
2007). Alzheimer's Disease and the Brain Comparisons of the brains of
persons with AD and those who are free of AD reveal a number of
differences. First, the brain of a person with AD becomes clogged with
two abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles and senile
plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted masses of protein fibers
inside nerve cells or neurons. Senile plaques are composed of parts of
neurons (for example, patches of degenerated nerve endings) surrounding
a group of proteins called beta-amyloid deposits. Both conditions are
believed to disrupt the transmission of impulses among brain cells,
thereby producing the symptoms of the disorder. It is hypothesized that
these plaques cause oxidative injury (damage due to release of free
radicals during cellular metabolism), inflammation, and alterations in
neurotransmitters, eventually resulting in the death of neurons and
brain atrophy. AD is notable for its insidious or gradual onset (Gatz,
2007). Second, persons with this disease have an atrophy of brain
tissue. In a prospective study using MRI scans, atrophy of the
hippocampus and amygdala among cognitively intact elderly people was
predictive of the subsequent development of AD and dementia

ne of the agonizing questions that bother the elderly is whether mild
cognitive impairments that they may experience are signs of Alzheimer's
disease. Some researchers have now developed a blood test that may be
able to identify people who have mild cognitive impairment that
progresses to Alzheimer's disease two to six years later (Ray et al.,
2007).

Moderators and Mediators: What Causes What?

I

n our discussion of cognitive disorders, we have found that the
disorders are often associated with brain anomalies. For example, in
Alzheimer's disease (AD), it was noted that senile plaques are found in
the brain, as well as atrophy of the hippocampus. Senile plaques,
hippocampus atrophy, and AD are then correlated, or related to each
other. In introductory psychology courses, students learn that when we
ﬁnd that two or more factors are related or correlated with each other,
it is not possible to come to cause-andeffect conclusions. How do we
know which anomaly, if any, causes AD? For example, perhaps senile
plaques cause AD. On the other hand, deterioration of the hippocampus
may cause AD. Or perhaps an unidentiﬁed factor causes all three
phenomena (AD, senile plaques, and hippocampus deterioration). The point
is that when factors are correlated, it is not possible to determine
cause and effect. Psychologists have made a distinction between
moderator and mediator variables in correlational relationships (Baron &
Kenny, 1986). A moderator is a variable that affects the direction
and/or strength of the relation between an independent or predictor
variable and a dependent or criterion variable. A mediator accounts for
the relation between the predictor and the criterion. Whereas moderator
variables specify when certain effects will hold, mediators speak to how
or why such effects occur. The following example illustrates moderation
and mediation. Suppose we ﬁnd that in AD brain processing problems (a
predictor) are related to AD (the criterion). Also suppose that we ﬁnd
that processing problems are more highly related to

ifﬁculty identifying smells such as lemon, banana, and cinnamon may be
the ﬁrst sign of Alzheimer's disease, according to a study that could
lead to scratch-and-sniff tests to determine a person's risk for the
disorder (Wilson, Schneider, et al., 2007). The results support previous
research showing that the lesions indicative of Alzheimer's ﬁrst appear
in a brain region related to smell.

AD when there is brain atrophy than when there is no brain atrophy. In
this case, brain atrophy is a moderator variable because it affects the
strength of the relationship between brain processing and AD. In terms
of mediation, we know that brain-processing anomalies are related to AD,
that brain atrophy is related to AD, and that processing anomalies are
related to brain atrophy. How can we try to determine what causes what?
If we ﬁnd that brain processing anomalies are related to AD only because
brain atrophy has occurred, then we can infer that brain atrophy rather
than brain processing is the more likely reason for AD. In this case,
brain processing is the predictor, AD is the criterion, and brain
atrophy is the mediator. In general, causal relations are difﬁcult to
prove, and the moderator-mediator analysis helps to decipher the nature
of relationships. Psychologists often use the experimental method to try
to determine causality. As we learned in Chapter 4, if one of two
comparable groups is given an intervention, then resulting differences
between the two groups may be caused by the intervention. Other tactics
involve time analysis (e.g., if A causes B, then A must occur before B),
theoretical-statistical ﬁt (e.g., how empirical results ﬁt one's theory
about causality or causal models; see Bentler, 2007), and the
consistency and convergence of research ﬁndings that support a causal
model. Can you give other examples of mediators and moderators? What are
advantages and disadvantages of different methods to try to establish
causality?

(den Heijer et al., 2006). Third, fundamental deficits in attention and
perception have been found that are related to brain processing.
Patients with AD and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
defined as having memory complaints and functioning below the vast
majority of others, have problems focusing their brain activity. On
brain scans, they show less activity than normal people in the "correct"
brain areas but also more activity in the "wrong" areas when processing
information (Drzezga et al., 2005). Although these three
factors---abnormal structures, brain atrophy, and different processing
of information---may well cause AD, it is very difficult to decipher
whether observed differences are a cause, an effect, or an accompanying
condition of AD. Interestingly, depression may play a role in AD. Rapp
and his colleagues (2006) found that: • People with depression had more
plaques and tangles in a part of the brain called the hippocampus. As
noted earlier, plaques and tangles are a key feature of AD. • People
with AD with a history of depression and who were depressed at the time
of diagnosis showed more marked, more pronounced neuropathological
changes in the hippocampus. • People with a lifetime history of major
depressive disorder were more likely to have a rapid decline into AD.
Etiology of Alzheimer's Disease The etiology of AD is unknown, although
it is thought to be a product of hereditary and environmental factors
(Hendrie, 2001). Many different explanations have been proposed. They
include reduced levels of the

neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain; repeated head injuries;
inflammation of the brain; infections and viruses; decreased blood flow
in the brain; toxic molecular fragments known as free radicals; diet and
nutrition; and the effect of plaques and tangles in disrupting cellular
metabolism or in reducing glucose absorption from the bloodstream. It
may be that a number of factors can cause AD or that various factors
interact with each other to put one at risk for the disease. We do know
that several genes have been associated with higher incidences of AD,
although the exact role of these genes still is unknown (Boustani et
al., 2003). The risk of developing AD is 1.8 to 4.0 times higher for
those with a family history of the disorder than for those without
(Gatz, 2007). In a comparison of DZ and MZ twins for AD, several
important findings emerged: (1) heritability for the disease is high,
(2) gender NORMAL BRAIN AND ALZHEIMER'S BRAIN Computer graphic of a
vertical slice through the brain of an Alzheimer patient (at left)
compared with a normal brain (at right). The Alzheimer's disease brain
is considerably shrunken, due to the degeneration and death of nerve
cells. The surface of the brain is often more deeply folded. Tangled
protein ﬁlaments (neuroﬁbrillary tangles) are found within nerve cells
and patients also develop brain lesions of beta-amyloid protein.
Alzheimer's disease accounts for most cases of senile dementia. Symptoms
include memory loss, disorientation, personality change, and delusion.
It ultimately leads to death.

differences do not appear to be significant, and (3) environmental
influences are also important and should be the focus of interventions
to reduce risk or delay onset of the disease (Gatz et al., 2006). There
is some evidence that the genetic influence does not express itself
during adulthood until late in life (over age sixty-five). That is, AD
that is caused by heredity may not occur until late life (Jorm et al.,
2007). Some researchers have found that genetic predisposition to AD,
coupled with low levels of two B vitamins (B-12 and folate), may affect
memory performance, suggesting that heredity and diet may be important
(Bunce, Kivipelto, & Wahlin, 2004). What seems to be clear is that many
factors may influence AD and that heredity is important at least for
some cases of AD. Several protective factors have been identified that
may delay the onset of AD. These include genetic endowment with the
ApoE-e2 allele, which decreases the risk for the disease; higher
education and occupational attainments; use of nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs or estrogen replacement therapy; and taking
vitamin E. The reasons that these factors may provide protection are
unclear, but they may reduce the deleterious action of oxidative stress
(via antioxidants such as vitamin E or estrogen) or the action of
inflammatory mediators associated with plaque formation (U.S. Surgeon
General, 1999). Cholinesterase inhibitors have been found to reduce the
rate of cognitive decline among Alzheimer's patients (Boustani et al.,
2003). In the case of education and occupation, it may be that increased
cognitive activity associated with education and occupational status
helps to reduce the incidence of the disease (Wilson & Bennett, 2003),
as discussed later.

Other Diseases and Infections of the Brain

A variety of diseases and infections result in brain damage that leads
to behavioral, cognitive, and emotional changes, including the
development of cognitive disorders.

Parkinson's disease

a progressively worsening disorder characterized by four primary
symptoms: tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face;
rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; bradykinesia, or slowness
of movement; and postural instability, or impaired balance and
coordination

Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's disease is a progressively worsening
disorder characterized by four primary symptoms: tremor, or trembling in
hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs
and trunk; bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural
instability, or impaired balance and coordination (National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2007b). It is associated with lesions
in the motor area of the brainstem and with a loss of dopamine-producing
brain cells. The disease is the second most common neurodegenerative
disorder in the United States (Dobkin, Allen, & Menza, 2006). It affects
about 500,000 persons in the United States. Parkinson's disease strikes
about 50 percent more men than women, but the reasons for this
discrepancy are unclear. In some persons, the disorder may be caused by
infections of the brain, toxins, cerebrovascular disorders, brain
trauma, and poisoning with carbon monoxide; in other persons, no
specific origin can be determined. Genetic predisposition may play a
role in the disease (Kurth & Kurth, 1994). At present, there is no cure
for Parkinson's disease, but a variety of medications provide dramatic
relief from the symptoms. Usually, patients are given L-dopa (levodopa)
combined with carbidopa to enable nerve cells to make dopamine and
replenish the brain's dwindling supply. For some patients,
high-technology surgical procedures on the brain or the implantation of
electrodes to continuously stimulate areas of the brain have been
helpful (Hartman-Stein, 2004). AIDS Dementia Complex The general public
knows about the disastrous consequences of AIDS, or acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome---the susceptibility to diseases, the physical
deterioration, and death, often within several years of infection.
Relatively few people, however, know that dementia may be the first sign
of AIDS. The vast majority of AIDS patients have suffered from symptoms
of dementia. The symptoms may involve an inability to concentrate and to
perform complex sequential mental tasks. The person may be unable to
follow television or movie plots, may miss appointments, and may have
hand tremors. Other symptoms

include forgetfulness, impaired judgment, and personality disturbances
such as anxiety and depression. In more serious cases, a diagnosis of
AIDS dementia complex (ADC) is made. Prevalence of ADC among persons
with HIV infection is between 10 and 20 percent in western countries
(Grant, Sacktor, & McArthur, 2005) and has been seen in only 1 to 2
percent of India-based infections (Wadia et al., 2001). Dietary
differences, such as consumption of curcumin (in curry) and theaflavins
(in teas) in India, may have protective effects. ADC can be attributed
to at least three factors. First, the HIV virus itself reaches the brain
at some phase of the infection. When it becomes active, the virus can
affect mental, as well as physical, processes. Second, because AIDS
affects the immune system, AIDS-related infections may cause infected
cells to release toxic substances that cause changes in brain-controlled
physiological processes. Some degree of cerebral atrophy is present in
almost all HIV patients with dementia. Third, depression, anxiety, and
confusion can arise from simply knowing that one has AIDS, and
experiencing negative reactions from others increases stress for AIDS
victims. Antiretroviral therapy has prevented or ameliorated ADC
symptoms or delayed the onset of ADC, particularly in developed
countries. Neurosyphilis (General Paresis) Syphilis is caused by the
spirochete Treponema pallidum, which enters the body through contact
with an infected person. This microorganism is most commonly transmitted
from infected to uninfected people through intercourse or oral-genital
contact. A pregnant woman can also transmit the disease to her fetus,
and the spirochete can enter the body through direct contact with mucous
membranes or breaks in the skin. Within a few weeks, the exposed person
develops a chancre, a small sore at the point of infection, as well as a
copper-colored rash. If untreated, the infection spreads throughout the
body. There may be no noticeable symptoms for ten to fifteen years after
the initial infection, but eventually the body's organs are permanently
damaged. In about 10 percent of persons with syphilis who are untreated,
the spirochete directly damages the brain or nervous system, causing
general paresis (muscular weakness, mental deterioration, and speech
problems). Encephalitis Encephalitis is a brain inflammation that is
caused by a viral or bacterial infection and that produces symptoms of
lethargy, drowsiness, fever, delirium, vomiting, and headaches. The
infections can come from a variety of sources, including herpes viruses
and bites from mosquitoes, ticks, and animals. One form, epidemic
encephalitis, was widespread during World War I, but the disease is now
very rare in the United States. It is still a problem, however, in
certain areas of Africa and Asia. Most cases follow a rapidly developing
course that begins with headache, prostration (having to lie down), and
diminished consciousness. Epileptic seizures are common in children with
encephalitis, and these seizures may be the most obvious symptom.

CHAPTER 14 • COGNITIVE DISORDERS

Acute symptoms, as noted earlier, include lethargy, fever, delirium, and
long periods of sleep and stupor. When wakeful, the victim may show
markedly different symptoms: hyperactivity, irritability, agitation, and
seizures. A coma, if there is one, may end abruptly. Rest, having a
healthy diet, and antiviral medications can be helpful. Meningitis
Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the membrane that
surrounds the brain and spinal cord, and it can result in the localized
destruction of brain tissue and seizures. Research on meningitis is
complicated, because the disorder can be caused by three different kinds
of germs: bacterial, viral, and fungal. The symptoms of meningitis vary
with the age of the patient. In neonates and young infants, the symptoms
are nonspecific (fever, lethargy, poor eating, and irritability), which
makes diagnosis difficult. In patients older than one year, symptoms may
include stiffness of the neck, headache, and cognitive and sensory
impairment. All three forms can result in the localized destruction of
brain tissue and in seizures, but their incidence is much greater in the
bacterial form than in the others. The outcome is most serious when
meningitis is contracted during the neonatal period. Residual effects of
the disorder may include partial or complete hearing loss as a result of
tissue destruction, mental retardation, and seizures. Meningitis also
seems to attack the abstract thinking ability of some of its victims.
MAJOR DISCOVERY Dr. Nancy Wexler helped to develop the ﬁrst test to
determine who was carrying the gene for Huntington's disease. Her mother
died of the disease.

Huntington's Disease Huntington's disease is a rare, genetically
transmitted degenerative disease characterized by involuntary twitching
movements and eventual dementia. Because the disorder is transmitted
from parent to child through an abnormal gene, approximately 50 percent
of the offspring of an affected person develop it. Scientists have
identified the gene that causes the disease, so they are able to better
detect whether a person has inherited the disorder. At this time,
Huntington's disease cannot be treated, so genetic counseling is
extremely important in preventing transmission of the disease. The
symptoms can be reduced through the use of medication and physical
fitness. The first physical symptoms are generally twitches in the
fingers or facial grimaces. As the disorder progresses, these symptoms
become more widespread and abrupt, involving jerky, rapid, and
repetitive movements. Changes in personality and emotional stability
also occur. For example, individuals with Huntington's disease may
become moody and quarrelsome. They may develop a peculiar manner of
walking and find it difficult to speak normally. Huntington's disease
always ends in death, on the average from thirteen to sixteen years
after the onset of symptoms. Early misdiagnoses are given in many of the
cases; schizophrenia is a common misdiagnosis.

epilepsy

A cerebral tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue growing within the brain.
The symptoms depend on the area affected and on the amount of
intracranial pressure exerted by the tumor. Fast-growing tumors
generally produce severe mental symptoms, whereas slow growth may result
in few symptoms. Unfortunately, in the latter case, the tumor is often
not discovered until death has occurred in a psychiatric hospital. The
most common symptoms of cerebral tumors are disturbances of
consciousness, which can range from diminished attention and drowsiness
to coma. People with tumors may also show mild dementia and other
problems of thinking. Mood changes may also result from either the
direct physical impact of the tumor or the patient's reaction to the
problem. Presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms is influenced by many
factors, including the extent of tumor involvement, the rapidity of its
growth, its propensity to cause increased intracranial pressure, and the
patient's premorbid psychiatric history, level of functioning, and
characteristic psychological coping mechanisms (Price, Goetz, & Lovell,
2002). Removing a cerebral tumor can produce dramatic results.

Epilepsy Epilepsy is a general term that refers to a set of symptoms
rather than to a specific etiology. In particular, epilepsy includes any
disorder characterized by intermittent and brief periods of altered
consciousness---often accompanied by seizures---and

by excessive electrical discharge from brain cells. It is the most
common of the neurological disorders; 1 to 2 percent of the population
has epileptic seizures at some time during their lives. Epilepsy affects
an estimated 2.7 million people in the United States and costs about
\$15.5 billion in medical expenses and lost or reduced earnings and
productivity each year. Epilepsy is most frequently diagnosed during
childhood. It can be symptomatic of some primary disorder of the brain
without apparent etiology, or it can arise from such causes as
hereditary factors, brain tumors, injury, degenerative diseases, and
drugs. Epileptic seizures and unconsciousness may last from a few
seconds to several hours; they may occur only a few times during the
patient's entire life or many times in one day. And they may produce
only a momentary disturbance of consciousness or a complete loss of
consciousness---in which case they can be accompanied by violent
convulsions and a coma lasting for hours. Alcohol, lack of sleep,
infections, stroke, fever, a low blood-sugar level, hyperventilation, a
brain lesion or injury, or general fatigue can all induce an epileptic
seizure. Particular musical notes, flickering lights, and emotionally
charged situations have also been known to provoke epileptic attacks.
Often, the cause is unknown. Epilepsy can often be controlled, but it
cannot be cured. Although people with epilepsy usually behave and
function quite normally between attacks, their chronic, long-term
illness is still regarded with suspicion and repugnance by much of
society. An attack can be frightening to the afflicted person and
observers alike. Many people with epilepsy have accompanying
psychological problems (CDC, 2007a). As we have noted, epilepsy has been
attributed to a wide range of factors, including brain tumors, head
injuries, biochemical THE MOST COMMON NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER Epilepsy

408

CHAPTER 14 • COGNITIVE DISORDERS

Some researchers have investigated the hypothesis that genetic or
personality factors predispose people to epilepsy. The concordance rate
for epilepsy is greater among identical than among fraternal twins, and
seizures are much more frequent among family members of a person with
epilepsy than among unrelated people (Devinsky, 1994). However, heredity
may not be a necessary or sufficient condition for the onset of
epilepsy.

Use of Psychoactive Substances Using psychoactive substances (see
Chapter 9) can result in cognitive disorders (dementia, delirium, or
amnestic disorder). The substances have effects on the nervous system.
Most people diagnosed as having cognitive disorders involving
psychoactive substances also have problems concerning substance use. The
most common psychoactive substances that can lead to cognitive disorders
are alcohol, amphetamines, caffeine, marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens,
inhalants, nicotine, opioids, PCP, and sedatives.

Treatment/Prevention Considerations Because cognitive disorders can be
caused by many different factors and are associated with different
symptoms and dysfunctions, treatment approaches have varied widely. In
general, the major interventions for cognitive disorders have been
surgical, medical, psychological, and environmental. Surgical procedures
may be used to remove cerebral tumors, relieve the pressure caused by
tumors, or restore ruptured blood vessels. Psychotherapy may help
patients deal with the emotional aspects of these disorders. And some
patients who have lost motor skills can be retrained to compensate for
their deficiencies or can be retaught these skills. Sometimes, patients
with cognitive disorders need complete hospital care. Most treatment
programs are comprehensive in nature, providing patients with
medication, rehabilitation, therapy, and environmental modifications.
Although some potentially reversible conditions exist, few cases of mild
to moderate dementia are fully reversible (Boustani et al., 2003). For
those disorders that are reversible or treatable, the underlying cause
of the dementia may be the focus of the intervention, and rehabilitation
may be required for residual deficits. Vascular dementias may not be
reversible, but their progress can be halted in some cases.
Nonreversible dementias are usually managed by placing the patient in a
supportive environment and by using medications targeted at associated
symptoms. Treatment for stroke-related dementia begins by minimizing the
risk of further strokes---through smoking cessation, aspirin therapy,
and treatment of hypertension, for instance.

Medication Drugs can prevent, control, or reduce the symptoms of brain
disorders, as in the use of L-dopa in Parkinson's disease. Medication is
of the most benefit in controlling some symptoms of cognitive disorders.
Tacrine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, has been helpful in treating
memory loss in AD. It increases the availability of acetylcholine in the
synaptic clefts of the brain (DHHS, 1999). Antiepileptic drugs are the
most common form of treatment for epilepsy (CDC, 2007s). More than 50
percent of people with epilepsy can control their seizures with
medication such as Dilantin; another 30 percent can reduce the frequency
of seizures. However, side effects can occur, such as a decrease in the
speed of motor responding, tremors, weight gain, and swollen gums.
Sometimes medication is used to control emotional problems that may
accompany cognitive impairment. Antidepressant drugs, for example, can
alleviate the depression found in many patients with AD, and low doses
of antipsychotic medication may be used to reduce patient symptoms
involving paranoia, hallucinations, and irritability. Interestingly, the
regular use of some anti-inflammatory medications,

Treatment/Prevention Considerations

such as ibuprofen, may cut the risk of developing the disease by as much
as one-half (Nash, 1997). The goals of current treatment approaches have
been to delay the onset of symptoms, slow the progression of the
disease, improve symptoms and reduce disease morbidity, modify risk
factors, and prevent the disease (Masterman & Cummings, 2001).

Cognitive and Behavioral Approaches The cognitive therapeutic approaches
also appear to be particularly promising. They are used to reduce the
frequency or severity of problem behaviors, such as aggression or
socially inappropriate conduct; to decrease anxiety or depression; and
to improve functional skills. Strategies may include reducing complex
tasks, such as dressing, eating, or personal hygiene, HELP FOR PEOPLE

by Dobkin and colleagues (2006). The treatment involved training in
stress management, behavioral modification, getting sound sleep,
relaxation techniques, and cognitive restructuring. Treatment began by
identifying life stressors that appeared to be contributing to depressed
mood. Afterward, both long- and short-term plans to minimize stress and
maximize quality of life were formulated. The investigator found that
the intervention was feasible and effective.

Lifestyle Changes In preventing or reducing the effects of cognitive
disorders, research suggests that lifestyle changes are important. For
vascular dementia, health habits related to preventing stroke---for
example, avoiding smoking, obesity, and hypertension---are relevant to
prevention (Gatz, 2007). In a population-based study of elderly persons
in Taiwan, researchers found that participating in social activities
seems to help preserve cognitive function over a seven-year follow-up
period (Glei et al., 2005). Respondents who engaged in one or two social
activities had 13 percent fewer failures on cognitive tasks than those
with no social activities. Respondents who engaged in three or more
social activities failed one-third fewer tasks. The nine social
activities measured included playing games; volunteering; and
participating in a religious group, clan association, or organizations
for the elderly. Mental stimulation has been found to be important. A
large-scale, randomized trial showed that mental exercises can improve
memory, reasoning ability, and the information-processing speed for
older adults (Willis et al., 2006). Participants who received training
that targeted specific cognitive abilities---memory, reasoning, or speed
of processing---reported less difficulty with daily living activities
five years after the training compared with those in the control group
(Population Reference Bureau, 2007). Mental activity also seems to be
important in preventing Alzheimer's disease and in improving cognitive
functioning among those who already have the disorder or who have other
forms of dementia. The activities ranged from playing computer games
(Tárraga et al., 2006) to reading a newspaper, playing games such as
chess or checkers, visiting a library, or attending a play (Wilson,
Scherr, et al., 2007). The beneficial effects of mental activity in
preventing Alzheimer's disease exist independently of patient's income,
education, and social or physical activity.

CHAPTER 14 • COGNITIVE DISORDERS

Environmental Interventions and Caregiver Support The effects of many
cognitive disorders are largely irreversible. This raises the issue of
how family and friends can assist those with cognitive disorders. There
are a variety of means by which people with these disorders may be
helped to live comfortably and with dignity while making use of those
abilities that remain. Modifying the environment can increase safety and
comfort while decreasing confusion and agitation. Home modifications for
safety include removing or locking up such hazards as sharp knives, gas
appliances, and dangerous household chemicals. Long-term institutional
care may be needed for the person with dementia, as profound cognitive
losses often precede death by a number of years. The family and friends
who provide care may themselves need support. They often feel
overwhelmed, helpless, frustrated, anxious, or even angry at having to
take care of someone with a cognitive impairment. They may worry about
how to take proper care of a loved one who has a cognitive disorder or
feel guilty if the loved one is injured or deteriorates under their
care. Sometimes, agonizing decisions must be made about whether to have
persons with cognitive disorders live at home or with relatives versus
nursing homes or assisted care facilities. In all of these
circumstances, caregivers should learn as much as possible about the
disorder and the means of taking care of loved ones, realize that the
role of a caregiver is stressful, and seek out personal support (such as
through self-help groups composed of other caregivers; Dobkin et al.,
2006).

I M P L I C AT I O N S

In this chapter, we have not directly focused on the multipath model
simply because cognitive disorders are usually classified by etiology.
Because most cognitive disorders are characterized by underlying damage,
deterioration, or abnormalities to the brain or its processes,
biological factors are apparent. However, we have also noted the
importance of psychological, social, and sociocultural factors in the
disorders. For example, persons with memory problems often experience
depression, which also affects their well-being. Increasing cognitive
activities and mental stimulation, such as memory and reasoning
exercises---psychological activities---has been found to improve memory
or reduce the likelihood of developing AD. The importance of social and
sociocultural factors is revealed by findings that engaging in social
activities reduces decrements in cognitive functioning and by the fact
that the prevalence of AIDS dementia complex among persons with HIV
infection is much higher in western countries than in India, perhaps
because of cultural and dietary habits. Finally, treatment and
preventive interventions involve biological, psychological, social, and
sociocultural factors.

Summary 1. How can we determine whether someone has brain damage or a
cognitive disorder? ■ Cognitive disorders are behavioral disturbances
that

result from transient or permanent damage to the brain. The effects of
brain damage vary greatly. ■ The most common symptoms include impaired
consciousness and memory, impaired judgment, orientation difficulties,
and attentional deficits. ■ The assessment of brain damage is performed
using interviews, psychological tests, brain scans and imaging, and
other observational or biological measures. 2. What are the different
types of cognitive disorders? ■ DSM-IV-TR lists four major types of
cognitive disorders: dementia, delirium, amnestic disorders, and other
cognitive disorders. ■ In dementia, memory is impaired and cognitive
functioning declines, as revealed by aphasia (language disturbance),
apraxia (inability to carry out motor activities despite intact
comprehension and motor function), agnosia (failure to recognize or
identify objects despite intact sensory function), or disturbances in
planning, organizing, and abstracting in thought processes. ■ Delirium
is characterized by disturbance of consciousness and changes in
cognition (memory deficit, disorientation, and language and perceptual
disturbances). These impairments and changes are not attributable to
dementia. ■ Amnestic disorders are characterized by memory impairment,
as manifested by the inability to learn

new information and the inability to recall previously learned knowledge
or past events. ■ Cognitive impairments that do not meet the criteria
for the other three are classified as cognitive disorders not otherwise
specified. 3. Why do people develop cognitive disorders? ■ Many
different agents can cause cognitive disorders;

among these are physical wounds or injuries to the brain, processes of
aging, diseases that destroy brain tissue (such as neurosyphilis and
encephalitis), and brain tumors. ■ As we age, the proportions of persons
with memory problems and cognitive disorders increase. In fact, one of
the best predictors of Alzheimer's disease is being elderly. However,
many elderly people do not suffer from any major cognitive decline. ■
Epilepsy

is characterized by intermittent and brief periods of altered
consciousness, frequently accompanied by seizures, and excessive
electrical discharge by neurons. Psychoactive substances can also cause
cognitive disorders.

4.  What kinds of interventions can be used to treat people with
    cognitive disorders? ■ Treatment strategies include corrective
    surgery and cognitive and behavioral training. Medication is often
    used, either alone or with other therapies, to decrease or control
    the symptoms of the various cognitive disorders. Caregivers can
    learn to provide assistance to loved ones with cognitive disorders.

The ﬁve-and-a-half-year-old preschooler sat apart from the other
children. In his hand, Ahmed held a toy truck, and he was spinning its
wheels and humming aloud as if to mimic the sound. He then stood and
placed the truck in the corner of the room before moving to the window.
Peering out, he ran his right foreﬁnger along the sill exactly ﬁve
times. He then returned to the corner, picked up the truck, and repeated
the entire sequence again, as he had been doing all morning. If by
chance one of the other children accidentally moved or handled the
truck, Ahmed seemed panic stricken and ﬁlled with rage. Caretakers'
attempts to comfort him were unsuccessful. He showed no response when
they talked to him, and he seldom looked in their eyes. Ahmed seemed to
live in a world of his own, and he treated people as if they were
inanimate objects that stood in his way. Diagnosis: autistic disorder
"Sit Still and Pay Attention" The mother sat in the psychiatrist's
ofﬁce, watching apprehensively as her ten-year-old son ﬁdgeted in his
seat and played with the ornaments hanging from the nearby Christmas
tree. The mother explained to the psychiatrist that Adam had been
expelled from school twice for disruptive classroom behavior. He had
difﬁculty concentrating in class, and he was failing. The school
psychologist had said Adam was "hyperactive" and recommended that they
seek professional help. Throughout the interview, the mother admonished
the child, saying, "Sit still," "Don't play with those," and "Pay
attention." Each time, the child appeared remorseful and his behavior
abated brieﬂy. But remaining still seemed impossible for Adam, and he
was soon ﬁdgeting again. By the end of the session, he had been in and
out of his seat some half dozen times and had accidentally broken two
ornaments. Diagnosis: attention deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder

"No, I Won't" The father had never struck Kim before, but he was on the
verge of doing so now. He was enraged and incensed at his
fourteen-year-old son's deﬁance and argumentative nature. Standing
before his father with a scowl on his face and both hands clenched in
ﬁsts, Kim refused to come out of his room to meet friends and relatives
attending his mother's surprise birthday party. Just hours before, he
and his father had had a heated encounter over picking up his room and
helping with chores around the house. Kim had steadfastly refused. Even
when he was threatened with being "grounded," Kim only stated, "You
can't make me do anything." Diagnosis: oppositional deﬁant disorder

In this chapter, we discuss problems that arise primarily during
childhood and adolescence. Much of the public continues to cling to the
popular notion that childhood is a period relatively free of stress and
that it represents a carefree and happy existence. Because children are
less able to express unhappiness or fears verbally, their problems often
go unnoticed unless they become glaringly extreme, as in the preceding
cases. Although it is easy for us to dismiss such childhood disorders as
rare and unusual, about one in five children suffers from a serious
emotional or behavioral problem (Koppelman, 2004). Children and
adolescents are subject not only to childhood disorders but also to many
of the "adult" disorders discussed in previous chapters. Unless
effective intervention takes place early in the child's life, an
untreated disorder may develop into a lifelong pattern that creates
problems in future years.

Myth vs Reality Myth: Childhood psychiatric disorders are easy to
diagnose because symptoms in childhood and adolescence parallel
characteristics of adult disorders. Reality: It is generally more
complex to diagnose psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents:
ﬁrst, because of variations in the presentation of symptoms of disorders
between childhood and adulthood; second, because characteristics that
signify mental illness in adults may occur in normally developing
children; and third, because children may have a more difﬁcult time
articulating their thoughts and feelings. Accurate diagnosis and
treatment of psychiatric disorders requires a thorough understanding of
normal child development and issues of child temperament, as well as an
understanding of risk factors for and the symptoms of psychiatric
disorders in children and adolescents.

The disorders of childhood and adolescence encompass a wide variety of
behavioral problems, ranging from severe disturbances affecting many
aspects of behavior to those that are less severe. One of the most
disturbing is a cluster of impairments

controversy

Are We Overmedicating Children?

A

large number of medications are being prescribed to treat childhood
disorders. They include tranquilizers, stimulants, and antipsychotic
medications. As with adults, the use of medications with children and
adolescents has been increasing dramatically. Drug companies are now
advertising directly to the public via television and magazines. They
point out that many children suffer from some mental illness (Kluger,
2003) and that medication is often needed. Controversy continues over
the "quick ﬁx" nature of medication, the large number of children for
whom medications are prescribed, and the need to carefully determine
whether medication, therapy, or intervention that focuses on other
factors affecting the child (such as bullying at school or domestic
violence within the home) is the best course of action for children
experiencing difﬁculties (Marsa, 2000). Concerns about the
overprescription of psychoactive drugs for children, especially
stimulant medication, have resulted in legislative efforts to prohibit
schools from recommending, requiring, or, in some cases, even discussing
the idea of a child being evaluated for possible ADHD. ADHD is now
diagnosed at earlier ages, and subsequently medication therapy begins
earlier, resulting in more prescriptions being given (Zito et al.,
2000). Furthermore, a physician may prescribe to young children a
medication that has been approved by the FDA for use with adults or
older children rather than with young children. (This use is called

hildhood behaviors and emotional problems differ from culture to
culture. For example, in Thailand, where parenting may foster more
prolonged dependence and slower psychological maturation, certain
problems involving dependence or immaturity can be found that are not
found in the United States. Thus sociocultural factors play a role in
the kinds of problems exhibited and in how they are deﬁned. Source:

"off-label.") Yet young children's bodies handle medications differently
than those of older individuals. The brains of young children are in a
state of very rapid development, and the developing neurotransmitter
systems can be very sensitive to medications. Several questions are
raised. Are the medications being used with children safe and effective
in treating the speciﬁc disorders? Are medications being prescribed too
freely? Is adequate assessment or evaluation being done to determine
whether medication is appropriate? Are the effects of the drug being
adequately monitored and possible side effects identiﬁed? Does adequate
information exist on the use of the speciﬁc medication with children?
For example, clinicians recommend that medication for children be
prescribed only after a comprehensive diagnostic and evaluation
procedure. The particular symptom or symptoms to be treated should be
identiﬁed and the dosage modiﬁed if necessary. Prescribing any
medication also necessitates the communication of possible side effects
and contraindications to the child and parent. For Further
Consideration 1. What criteria would you use to determine whether

prescribing medication to children outweigh the risks?

called pervasive developmental disorders. Autistic disorder, such as in
the case of Ahmed at the beginning of the chapter, is a particularly
baffling and debilitating condition that all too often dooms a child to
constant dependent care. We also discuss disorders that involve
attention deficits and/or hyperactivity that become especially
pronounced during the school years, such as in the case of Adam at the
beginning of the chapter. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) has become a controversial diagnosis because of the criticisms
leveled at the frequent use of the medication Ritalin to control the
problem. The case of Kim at the beginning of the chapter is a typical
example of the class of problems called disruptive behavior disorders.
In this case, the son can be described as suffering from an oppositional
defiant disorder. Children also experience emotional disorders such as
depression (including bipolar disorders) and anxiety (such as fears over
separation from parents and school phobia). Indeed, the numbers of
childhood and adolescent disorders are plentiful. We have chosen to
concentrate on representative disorders that fall under the following
classifications: pervasive developmental disorders (especially autism),
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), disruptive behavior
disorders (oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder),
elimination disorders, learning disorders, and mental retardation.

Pervasive Developmental Disorders The pervasive developmental disorders,
also known as autism spectrum disorders, involve severe childhood
impairment in areas such as social interaction and communication skills
and the display of stereotyped interests and behaviors

(Ozonoff & Rogers, 2003). They range from a severe form, called autistic
disorder, to a milder form, called Asperger's syndrome. If a child has
symptoms of either of these disorders but does not meet the specific
criteria for either, the diagnosis is called pervasive developmental
disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Other rare, very severe
disorders that are included in the autism spectrum disorders are Rett
syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder. Estimates of the
prevalence of these disorders, as high as 6.7 per 1,000 children, have
been increasing as new diagnostic procedures have been improved (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention \[CDC\], 2007d). The impairments
shown in the pervasive developmental disorders are not simply delays in
development but are distortions that would not be normal at any
developmental stage (Kabot, Masi, & Segal, 2003). The pervasive
developmental disorders differ distinctly from the psychotic conditions
observed in adolescents and adults; they do not include symptoms such as
hallucinations, delusions, loosening of associations, or incoherence. A
child showing these symptoms probably would be diagnosed with
schizophrenia. We begin our discussion with autistic disorder.

Case Study Chicken and potatoes. Chicken and potatoes. Danny Boronat
wants chicken and potatoes. He asks for it once, twice . . . ten times.
In the kitchen of the family's suburban New Jersey home, Danny's mother,
Loretta, chops garlic for spaghetti sauce. No chicken and potatoes, she
tells Danny. We're having spaghetti. But Danny wants chicken and
potatoes. Chicken and potatoes. His twelve-year-old sister, Rosalinda,
wanders in to remind her mother about upcoming basketball tryouts. His
brother Alex, twenty-two, grabs some tortilla chips and then leaves to
check scores on ESPN. His other brother Matthew, seventeen, talks about
an upcoming gig with his band. Danny seems not to notice any of this.
"Mom," he asks in a monotone, "why can't we have chicken and potatoes?"
If Danny were a toddler, his behavior would be nothing unusual. But
Danny Boronat is twenty years old. "That's really what life with autism
is like," says Loretta. "I have to keep laughing. Otherwise, I would
cry." (Kantrowitz & Scelfo, 2006, p. 47)

At the beginning of this chapter, we introduced a child with autistic
disorder. In Danny Boronat's case, we see a young adult who grew up with
the disorder. But what is autism? In 1943, Leo Kanner, a child
psychiatrist, identified a triad of behaviors that have come to define
the essential features of autism: an extreme isolation and inability to
relate to people; a psychological need for sameness; and significant
difficulties with communication. Kanner called the syndrome infantile
autism, from the Greek autos ("self"), to reflect the profound aloneness
and detachment of these children. A typical characteristic of autistic
children is their extreme lack of responsiveness to adults. Kanner and
Lesser (1958) felt that the child who had the disorder is aware of
people but considers them not differently from the way he (or she)
considers the desk, bookshelf, or filing cabinet. The puzzling symptoms
displayed by the children Kanner described fit the diagnostic criteria
for autistic disorder in DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association,
2000a)--- qualitative impairment in social interaction and/or
communication; restricted, stereotyped interests and activities; and
delays or abnormal functioning in a major area before the age of three.
Figure 15.1 illustrates some characteristics of children with autism.
Autistic disorder occurs in about 2 in every 1,000 children (Newschaffer
et al., 2007). The prevalence of autism has not been found to vary
across socioeconomic classes (Bristol et al., 1996). Autistic disorder
occurs four to five times more frequently in boys than in girls
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Unfortunately, only one-third

CHAPTER 15 • DISORDERS OF CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE

of children with autism are able to lead even partially independent
lives as adults (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Impairments
The impairments found with this disorder occur in three major areas:
social interactions, verbal and nonverbal communication, and activities
and interests (National Institute of Mental Health \[NIMH\], 2007c). •
Social Interactions Unusual lack of interest in others is a primary
aspect of autistic disorder. Individuals with autism interact as though
other people are unimportant objects, and they show little interest in
establishing friendships, imitating behaviors, or playing games. As a
result, children with autistic disorder often fail to develop peer
relationships. Disturbances may be displayed in body postures, gestures,
facial expressions, and eye contact. Autistic children appear to be
unaware of other people's identity and emotions. They appear not to need
physical contact with or emotional responses from their caretakers. For
example, although children with autistic disorder are as likely as other
children to smile when they successfully complete a task, they are much
less likely to look at an adult to convey this feeling. The social
interactive component is missing. Infants with autism are usually
content to be left alone and do not show an anticipatory response to
being picked up. AUTISTIC GIRL WEARING HELMET Besides having problems
with social interactions and communication, autistic • Verbal and
Nonverbal Communication About 50 percent of autischildren can show a
variety of symptoms, such as impulsivity, tic children do not develop

ously been said). One child constantly repeated the words "How How do
self-injurious behaviors arise? do you spell relief?" without any
apparent reason. In addition, the child may reverse pronouns. For
example, "you" might be used for "I," and "I" for "me." Even when they
can speak, such children may be unable or unwilling to initiate
conversations. • Activities and Interests Children with autistic
disorder engage in few activities. They often have unusual repetitive
habits, such as spinning objects, whirling themselves, or fluttering or
flapping their arms. They may show intense interest in self-induced
sounds or in staring at their hands and fingers. They may stare into
space and be totally self-absorbed. Minor changes in the environment may
produce rages and tantrums. Children with this disorder also show a lack
of imaginary activities. As many as three-fourths of children with
autistic disorder have IQ scores lower than 70. However, some of them
display splinter skills---that is, they often do well on one or more
isolated tasks such as drawing, puzzle construction, and rote memory but
perform poorly on verbal tasks and tasks requiring language skills and
symbolic thinking. These children are referred to as "autistic savants."
One Chinese boy with autism could identify the day of the week for
different dates, knew the lottery numbers and their drawing dates for
the previous three months, and could cite the titles of songs in the
popular charts for the previous ten years and their dates of release
(Ho, Tsang, & Ho, 1991). Diagnosis Autism, which almost always occurs
before age three, might seem to be easy to diagnose, given its unique
characteristics (Ozonoff & Rogers, 2003). Yet diagnosis is often
complicated by several problems: 1. There are no medical tests that can
pinpoint autism. Typical evaluation procedures might include clinical
observations, parent interviews, developmental histories, psychological
testing, speech and language assessments, and possibly the use of one or
more autism diagnostic tests. 2. Different medical conditions or other
disorders can produce the behavioral characteristics of autism.

3.  The autistic symptom profile has been found in children with and
    without signs of neurological impairments.
4.  Symptoms can vary widely from child to child. In terms of age, the
    disorder can often be reliably detected by the age of three, and in
    some cases as early as eighteen months. Some studies suggest that
    many children may be accurately identified by the age of one or even
    younger. Parents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors
    in their child. In some cases, the baby seemed "different" from
    birth (Volkmar, Charwarska, & Klin, 2005), unresponsive to people,
    or focusing intently on one item for long periods of time. Children
    with autism are often diagnosed as having mental retardation, and
    the two disorders often coexist. Still, there are ways to
    distinguish children with THERAPIST SIGNS TO AUTISTIC BOY Autistic
    individuals both autism and mental retardation from children with
    mental retardation alone. For example, children with autistic
    disorder often beneﬁt from the use of sign language to enhance their

    receptive and expressive communication skills. Can you think tal
    retardation. Also, children with mental retardation are more of
    additional means of communication that might be useful in working
    with autistic individuals? likely to relate to others and to be more
    socially aware than are children with both autism and mental
    retardation. Although we are learning more about the symptoms of
    autism, many questions remain. What causes the bizarre and puzzling
    abnormalities that are seen in children with autism? Why do they
    lack social responsiveness? After a brief discussion of other
    pervasive developmental disorders, we discuss the causes, prognosis,
    and treatment of autism.

Other Pervasive Developmental Disorders Some children show some but not
all of the characteristics of autistic disorder, and they also show
severe social impairment. These children would receive a diagnosis from
one of the other categories of the pervasive developmental disorders.
The diagnosis may be Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder,
Asperger's syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise
specified. Characteristics of these disorders often overlap with those
of autistic disorder (see Table 15.1) to such a degree that some
psychologists question whether they should be considered distinctive
disorders. Some researchers believe that the various disorders are
actually variations and partial expressions of a more primary disorder.
They categorize all of the disorders as autism spectrum disorder
(Jensen, 2003). Others have argued that not all of the disorders should
be listed as a pervasive developmental disorder. Little research exists
on children with these diagnoses. To see the difficult diagnostic issues
involved, consider the following case of a girl who was videotaped by
her parents several times from birth to two years and seven months
(Eriksson & de Chateau, 1992).

Case Study During the ﬁrst year of her life the girl showed normal
development (smiled, laughed, babbled, waved bye-bye to parents, and
played peek-a-boo). During the second year she spoke few words. She sat
on the ﬂoor and played with a book in a stereotyped manner and showed
little response to her parents. After two years of age, she was
withdrawn, spoke no words except meaningless phrases from songs. She was
preoccupied with rocking or spinning her mother's hair. Computerized
axial tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and
electroencephalogram readings were normal. No physical disorder was
found to be associated with her condition.

of the following pervasive developmental disorders? 1. Asperger's

Pervasive Developmental Disorders

consistently have average to above-average cognitive skills (Newschaffer
et al., 2007). However, they exhibit significant impairment in social
interaction skills, limited and repetitive interests and activities, and
lack of emotional reciprocity. An individual may not be diagnosed with
Asperger's syndrome if, at any time, they have met the diagnostic
criteria for autistic disorder. Asperger's syndrome is diagnosed five
times more frequently in males than females (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a). Individuals with Asperger's syndrome exhibit an
"eccentric and one-sided social approach to others rather than the
social or emotional indifference seen in autistic disorder" and may even
be seen as intellectually precocious in their early years due to an
adult-like vocabulary, particularly in an area in which they have
obsessive interest (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). In view of
the symptoms of social isolation, interpersonal relationship
difficulties, communication abnormalities, desire for sameness, and
narrow interests that are so similar to autistic disorder, there is
continuing controversy as to whether Asperger's syndrome is, in fact, a
separate disorder or simply a description of high-functioning
individuals with autistic disorder. The neuropsychological profiles of
the two groups are quite similar, and many of the symptoms overlap
(Ghaziuddin & Mountain-Kimchi, 2004; Miller & Ozonoff, 2000). 2.
Childhood Disintegrative Disorder This disorder is characterized by at
least two years of normal development in social relationships, verbal
and nonverbal communication, motor skills, play, and bowel or bladder
control, with subsequent severe impairment and deterioration in two or
more of these skills beginning between two and ten years of age. The
child also develops autistic-like symptoms, including impairment in
social interaction, communication, and repetitive or stereotyped
behaviors and interests. 3. Rett Syndrome This disorder is characterized
by normal development for at least five months and an onset of symptoms
between six and eighteen months, including deceleration of head growth,
a loss of purposeful hand skills replaced by stereotyped hand movements,
severely impaired language development, and a loss of social interaction
skills. This condition is almost exclusively diagnosed in females. A
mutation in the sequence of a single gene can cause Rett syndrome. This
discovery may help doctors slow or stop the progress of the syndrome. It
may also lead to methods of screening for Rett syndrome, thus enabling
doctors to start treating these children much sooner and improving the
quality of life these children experience (NIMH, 2007c). 4. Pervasive
Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified This category is for
cases that are not typical in terms of age of onset or specific behavior
pattern. Pervasive and severe impairment in reciprocal social
interactions occurs, as do communication abnormalities and limited
interests and activities. These children do not, however, meet the full
criteria for autistic disorder. Did you have trouble choosing a
diagnosis? Based on the information given (approximately one year of
normal development, severe isolation and communication difficulties,
repetitive behaviors, no mention of deceleration of head growth), you
may have correctly concluded that autistic disorder would be the most
likely diagnosis. However, diagnosis involving the specific pervasive
developmental disorders is difficult, and the appropriate criteria for
each are still evolving.

Etiology Etiological research has focused primarily on autism rather
than other types of pervasive developmental disorders. Although
psychological, social, and sociocultural factors play a role in the
disorders, biological factors seem to be critical. Biological Dimension
Evidence points to genetic factors playing a prominent role in the
causes of autism spectrum disorders. Concordance rates for autism are

or years, some have claimed that chemicals in vaccines can cause autism.

that small amounts of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal found in
some vaccines do not cause autistic disorders.

much higher for MZ (monozygotic) than DZ (dizygotic) twins. Furthermore,
the prevalence of autistic disorder among siblings of individuals with
autistic disorder ranges from 2 to 14 percent. These rates are many
times higher than for the general population. Taken together, twin
studies and family studies clearly establish that a genetic
susceptibility to autism exists. However, because MZ concordance is less
than 100 percent and the degree of impairment and range of symptoms vary
markedly among concordant pairs, environmental factors are most likely
etiologically significant as well (Newschaffer et al., 2007). The
particular genes and mechanism involved in the disorder are unclear at
this time, although preliminary research has implicated chromosome 13,
15, 16, or 17 in some cases of autistic spectrum disorders. Genetic
problems or defects may be inherited or may be acquired by random
genetic accidents (for example, defects in the formation of the egg or
sperm). How genetic defects translate into impaired brain mechanisms or
brain processing is unclear. Neuroimaging studies have shown that a
contributing cause of autism may be abnormal brain development beginning
in the infant's first months (NIMH, 2007c). This "growth dysregulation
hypothesis" holds that the anatomical abnormalities seen in autism are
caused by genetic defects in brain growth factors. Postmortem and MRI
studies have shown that many major brain structures may be implicated in
autism. This includes the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, limbic system,
corpus callosum, basal ganglia, and brainstem. Other research is
focusing on the role of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine,
and epinephrine. Some biological hypotheses about autistic disorder have
included immune reactions, endocrine abnormalities, in utero
experiences, and environmental toxins. There is a real possibility that
autism is a heterogeneous brain disorder that can have many different
causes. Psychological Dimension Some research suggests that autism may
be a disorder involving cognitive impairments that affect perception,
particularly in the recognition and response to others. For example,
normal infants can distinguish between male and female and between child
and adult, an ability that suggests responsiveness and attention to
social cues. In contrast, children with autistic disorder have been
described as treating human beings as inanimate objects. Autistic
infants fail to socially gaze at parents or others, and they do not
engage in pretend play, even when prompted (Charman et al., 1997).
Children with autism often do not appear to seek connectedness; they are
content being alone, ignore their parents' bids for attention,

Pervasive Developmental Disorders

and seldom make eye contact or bid for others' attention with gestures
or vocalizations (Johnson et al., 2007). They do a better job of
discriminating between pictures of buildings than between faces (Boucher
& Lewis, 1992). They also have difficulty responding to people according
to qualities, such as age or gender. Individuals with autistic disorder
seem unable to understand that others think and have beliefs. This
inability to appreciate other people's mental states appears to be long
lasting. Children who showed this deficit displayed unchanged
performance seven years later, even though their experience had
increased (Holroyd & BaronCohen, 1993). Social Dimension Early
psychodynamic theories that involve social relationships of autism
stressed the importance of deviant parent-child interactions in
producing this condition. Kanner (1943), who named the syndrome,
concluded that cold and unresponsive parenting is responsible for the
development of autism. He described the parents as successfully autistic
and as cold, humorless perfectionists who preferred reading, writing,
playing music, or thinking. Kanner has since changed his position and
now believes the disorder is "innate." Although psychological and social
factors such as child-rearing practices, parentchild interactions, and
reactions from peers play a role in the child's behaviors, autism is
largely influenced by biological factors. Concern over blaming parents
and inflicting guilt on parents who already bear the burden of raising a
child with this disorder has also led to a deemphasis on psychological
and social factors in the disorder. Sociocultural Dimension Autism
appears to vary according to sociocultural and demographic
characteristics (Newschaffer et al., 2007). Studies have found higher or
equal prevalence of the disorder among African American mothers and
lower prevalence among Mexican-born mothers than among white, Asian, and
U.S.-born Hispanic mothers. Paternal age (that is, having older fathers)
is associated with high prevalence of autism. What these findings mean
is unclear. Perhaps factors such as ethnicity or age are mediated by
some other factors. (Recall that in Chapter 14 we discussed mediators.
In a situation in which age of parents is related to autism, it may be
that autism is caused by genetic damage and that age is related to
autism simply because older parents may be more likely to pass on
damaged genes.) In any event, the evidence suggests that although
psychological, social, and sociocultural factors may play a role in the
disorder, biological conditions are most important.

Prognosis The prognosis for children with pervasive developmental
disorders is mixed. Most children diagnosed with autism retain their
diagnosis at nine years of age. However, many, especially those with
initial higher levels of functioning (for example, those with Asperger's
syndrome), improve. A minority have good outcomes. They have normal
intelligence and function reasonably well in mainstream classrooms but
still may exhibit residual clinical signs of social awkwardness,
restrictive interests, or mild, infrequent stereotyped behaviors
(Johnson et al., 2007). The same is true for adult outcomes. Those with
higher levels of cognitiveadaptive functioning fare better than those
with intellectual disability and severe autistic symptoms. Many
individuals with the disorder are self-sufficient and successfully
employed. There are reports of significant intellectual success for some
with Asperger's syndrome; in fact, it is reported that compelling
evidence exists that Albert Einstein exhibited symptoms consistent with
Asperger's syndrome or highfunctioning autism (Perner, 2001).

Treatment Because patients with these disorders have communication or
social impairments, pervasive developmental disorders are very difficult
to treat. Therapy with the parents, family therapy, drug therapy, and
behavior modification techniques are

421

422

CHAPTER 15 • DISORDERS OF CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE

all currently being used, with some success (Ozonoff & Rogers, 2003).
Intensive behavior modification programs seem the most promising
treatment. Comprehensive Programs Immersing the child in a comprehensive
program with the following characteristics is beneficial: • Provision of
intensive intervention in systematically planned, developmentally
appropriate educational activities designed to address identified
objectives • Inclusion of a family component (including parent training
as indicated) • Promotion of opportunities for interaction with
typically developing peers • Incorporation of a high degree of structure
through elements such as predictable routine, visual activity schedules,
and clear physical boundaries to minimize distractions • Implementation
of strategies for applying learned skills to new environments and
situations (generalization) and for maintaining functional use of these
skills • Use of assessment-based curricula that address communication,
social skills, functional adaptive skills, disruptive or maladaptive
behavior, and cognitive and academic skills, such as perspective taking
• Use of drug therapy, including the antipsychotic medication
haloperidol, which has been found to produce modest reductions in
withdrawal, stereotypical movements, and fidgetiness; other medications,
such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotic agents,
and stimulants (Myers et al., 2007), are sometimes used to decrease
anxiety, repetitive behaviors, and impulsivity • Maintenance of behavior
modification procedures to eliminate echolalia, self-mutilation, and
self-stimulation and to increase attending behaviors, verbalizations,
and social play through social interaction training (Lovaas, 2003; Myers
et al., 2007) Autism spectrum disorders cause major disruption in
families and unfulfilled lives for many children. However, comprehensive
treatment programs have enabled some children with these disorders to
develop more functional skills.

Attention Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorders and Disruptive Behavior
Disorders Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders and disruptive
behavior disorders involve symptoms that are often socially disruptive
and distressing to others (see Table 15.2). They include attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), conduct disorder, and
oppositional defiant disorder. These disorders often occur together and
have overlapping symptoms. Without intervention, these disorders tend to
persist beyond childhood (Farmer, 1995; Fergusson, Horwood, & Lynskey,
1995; Root & Resnick, 2003). Early identification and intervention are
necessary to interrupt the negative course of these disorders. Raising a
child with a disruptive behavior disorder is difficult. Parents report
more negative feelings about parenting, higher stress levels, and a more
negative impact on their social lives than do parents of normally
developing children (Donenberg & Baker, 1993).

Attention Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorders Case Study Ron, an only child,
was always on the go as a toddler and preschooler. He had many accidents
because of his continual climbing and risk taking. Temper outbursts were
frequent. In kindergarten Ron had much difﬁculty staying seated for
group work and in completing projects. The quality of his work was poor.
In the ﬁrst grade, Ron was referred to the school psychologist for
evaluation. Although his high activity level and lack of concentration
were not so pronounced in this oneon-one situation, his impulsive
approach to tasks and short attention span were evident throughout the
interview. Ron was referred to a local pediatrician who specializes in
attention deﬁcit disorders. The pediatrician prescribed Ritalin, which
helped reduce Ron's activity level.

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by
socially disruptive behaviors---either attentional problems or
hyperactivity---that are present before age seven and persist for at
least six months. Hyperactivity is a confusing term because it refers to
both a diagnostic category and behavioral characteristics. Children who
are "overactive" or who have "short attention spans" are often referred
to as "hyperactive," even though they may not meet the diagnostic
criteria for this disorder. Whether a child is merely overactive or has
ADHD is often difficult to determine. Three types of attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorders are recognized: • ADHD, predominantly
hyperactive-impulsive type, is characterized by behaviors such as
heightened motoric activity (fidgeting and squirming), short attention
span, distractibility, impulsiveness, and lack of self-control. Children
with this type of ADHD tend to have a pattern of being rejected by peers
and more accidental injuries (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a).
• ADHD, predominantly inattentive type, is characterized by problems
such as distractibility, difficulty with sustained attention,
inattention to detail, and difficulty completing tasks. Children with
attentional deficits tend to have less severe conduct problems and
impulsivity than children with the hyperactive form of ADHD. Instead,
they are more likely to be described as sluggish, daydreamers,

CHAPTER 15 • DISORDERS OF CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE

anxious, and shy; they respond to lower doses of stimulants than do
children with hyperactivity (Frick & Lahey, 1991). This type of ADHD
affects approximately the same number of boys as girls and tends to have
the greatest impact on academic performance (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a). • ADHD, combined type, is probably the most common
form of the disorder. In this case, the criteria for both the
hyperactive and inattentive types are met. A confusing aspect of
attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is the apparent inconsistency.
Attentional deficit and excessive motor activity are not necessarily
observed in all settings. Boys with ADHD, for example, may show greater
motor activity during academic tasks but may not differ from normally
functioning children during lunch, recess, and physical education
activities. Thus a child might be identified as hyperactive in one
situation but not in others. To receive a diagnosis of ADHD, the
individual must display these characteristics in two or more situations
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). ADHD is the most common
cognitive and behavioral disorder diagnosed among schoolchildren
(Banerjee, Middleton, & Faraone, 2007). In a national sample of eight-to
fifteen-year-old children, the prevalence was 8.7 percent. Boys and poor
children were much more likely to receive this diagnosis than girls and
wealthy children, respectively (Froehlich et al., 2007). ADHD is
particularly difficult to diagnose in preschool-age children because
there is such variability in their attentional skills and activity
levels, in addition to the fact that preschoolers have fewer demands for
sustained attention. ADHD is a persistent disorder. Children with ADHD
continue to show problems with impulsivity, family conflicts, and
attention during adolescence (Gaub & Carlson, 1997) and even into
adulthood (Fischer et al., 2005). In fact, follow-up studies suggest
that between 30 and 50 percent of children diagnosed with ADHD continue
to experience symptoms such as inattention, fidgeting, difficulty
sitting still, and impulsive actions throughout adulthood (Jackson &
Farrugia, 1997). These difficulties may affect social relationships and
occupational functioning. ADHD is associated with many behavioral and
academic problems. Children with this disorder are more likely to have
poor grades, poor reading and math test scores, and increased grade
retention. ADHD is also associated with increased use of school-based
services, increased rates of detention and expulsion, and with
relatively low rates of high school graduation and postsecondary
education (Loe & Feldman, 2007). Boys with ADHD have more difficulty in
less structured situations or in activities demanding sustained
attention. Based on parent reports, boys with ADHD show more sadness,
anger, and guilt than those without ADHD (Braaten & Rosen, 2000).

INTERVENTIONS FOR ADHD A mother is shown at her home with her
six-year-old son. He is enrolled in a study called Project Achieve in
which his parents and daycare/preschool teachers are taught strategies
to control his problem behaviors. New research shows that giving more
structure to a preschooler's day can offer a non-drug alternative to
help children with attention deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder.

Etiology Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is an early-onset,
highly prevalent neurobehavioral disorder, with genetic, biological, and
environmental etiologies, that persists into adolescence and adulthood
in a sizable majority of afflicted children of both sexes (Spencer,
Biederman, & Mick, 2007). Early studies supported the hypothesis of
genetic transmission because higher prevalence rates for the disorder
were found in the first- and second-degree relatives of children with
ADHD and because higher concordance rates for this disorder existed
among identical rather than fraternal twins (Gillis, Gilger, Pennington,
& DeFries, 1992; Knopf, 1984). Twin and sibling pair studies in
Australia also provided evidence for the hypothesis that ADHD symptoms
are highly heritable in both boys and girls (Rhee et al., 1999). In
addition to genetic involvement, many researchers believe that the
symptoms of overactivity, short attention span, and impulsiveness
suggest central nervous system involvement. Different hypotheses

Attention Deﬁcit/Hyperactivity Disorders and Disruptive Behavior
Disorders

425

have arisen as to the kind of mechanisms that may be operating in the
brain of persons with ADHD (Spencer et al., 2007): 1. There may be
impaired functioning in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which may
affect organizational, planning, working memory, and attentional
processes. 2. Neuroimaging studies have found that persons with ADHD
have smaller volumes in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, and subcortical
structures, perhaps affecting frontosubcortical pathways in the brain.
In fact, children with ADHD compared with children without ADHD have
marked developmental delays in attaining peak thickness throughout most
of the cerebrum (Shaw et al., 2007). The delay was most prominent in
prefrontal regions important for control of cognitive processes,
including attention and motor planning. This may mean that, over time,
many children with ADHD outgrow the disorder as their brains mature. 3.
The frontosubcortical system pathways associated with ADHD are rich in
catecholamines such as dopamine, and ADHD may be caused by inadequate
dopamine in the central nervous system. Although heredity may affect
these brain conditions, so might lead poisoning, cigarette and alcohol
exposure, maternal smoking during pregnancy, low birth weight, oxygen
deprivation during birth, and fetal alcohol syndrome. They have all been
associated with ADHD (U.S. Surgeon General, 1999; NIMH, 2007b). Some
researchers believe that certain foods, food coloring, or food additives
produce physiological changes in the brain or other parts of the body,
resulting in hyperactive behaviors. This view was promoted by Feingold
(1977), who developed a diet excluding these substances. Sugar has also
been suspected as a causal factor in ADHD (Chollar, 1988). Many parents
have tried the recommended diets for their children, and many claim that
their children's behavior improved. But parental expectations or
treating the children differently (for example, going shopping with them
to buy only certain foods) might result in behavioral changes. To
determine whether certain chemicals or sugars are implicated in
hyperactivity, carefully controlled double-blind studies have also been
conducted. In the study, the diets of the children were alternated so
that some of the time they ate food with the additive and other times
without. The parents were not aware of the type of food they were giving
their children. Past results of such studies led some to believe that
eliminating food additives or certain chemicals from the diets of
hyperactive children had little effect on their behavior (NIMH, 2007b;
Wolraich, Wilson, & White, 1995). However, one recent study involving
three hundred British children provides some support for the influence
of food additives (McCann et al., 2007). Over three one-week periods,
the children were randomly assigned to consume one of three fruit drinks
daily: one contained the amount of dye and sodium benzoate typically
found in a child's diet, a second drink had a lower concentration of the
additives, and a third was additive-free. Parents and teachers, who did
not know which drink the kids were getting, evaluated the kids as to
general hyperactivity, restlessness, inability to concentrate,
fidgeting, and talking or interrupting too much. McCann and colleagues
(2007) found that children were significantly more hyperactive when
consuming drinks with the additives. However, not all children given
drinks with additives became more hyperactive, and the reason for this
is unclear. In any event, results from McCann et al.'s (2007) rigorously
controlled study have rekindled the debate over the effects of food
additives in ADHD. Although we have primarily been discussing biological
perspectives on ADHD, many psychological, social, and sociocultural
factors are related to the disorder. For example, the aggregate of
adversity factors (such as severe marital discord, low social class,
large family size, family conflicts, maternal psychopathology, paternal
criminality, maternal mental disorder, and foster care placement) seems
to contribute to ADHD (Spencer et al., 2007). We also know that
hyperactive kids often encounter negative reactions from others. These
negative reactions may result in stress, low self-esteem, and
rebelliousness, causing even more hyperactivity.

Did You Know?

S

ome parents claim that certain foods lead to hyperactivity in their
kids. Now, based on the study by McCann et al. (2007), Britain's Food
Standards Agency issued an immediate advisory to parents to limit their
children's intake of additives if they notice an effect on behavior.
Some foods that contain such additives are baked goods, candy, cheeses,
gum, jam, soft drinks, and soup (Wallis, 2007).

INTERVENTIONS FOR OLDER KIDS WITH ADHD Students eat while camping out at
the Center for Attention and Related Disorders camp in Connecticut. The
four-week camp matches one instructor for every two campers and provides
the structure, discipline, and social order that are helpful for
children who suffer from ADHD and similar disorders.

Treatment For decades, medications have been used to treat the symptoms
of ADHD. The medications that seem to be the most effective are
stimulants such as Ritalin. Approximately 75 to 90 percent of children
with ADHD respond positively to stimulant medication (DHHS, 1999).
Nevertheless, clinicians have suggested that both physicians and
therapists should pay more attention to family dynamics and child
management problems rather than relying solely on pharmacological
intervention. Comprehensive psychosocial and behavioral forms of
treatment, such as parent training, modeling, role playing, and
classroom, academic, and peer interventions, have also been successfully
employed. Results indicate that school-age children respond to
behavioral interventions when they are appropriately implemented both at
home and in the classroom setting. Combined treatments (behavioral
management and stimulant medication) represent the gold standard in ADHD
treatment and are often recommended as the first-line treatment option
(Daly et al., 2007). Simply providing recesses to schoolchildren with
ADHD has been found to be beneficial in reducing inappropriate behaviors
(Ridgway et al., 2003).

Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is characterized by a negativistic,
argumentative, and hostile behavior pattern. Children with this disorder
often lose their temper, argue with adults, and defy or refuse adult
requests. They may refuse to do chores and refuse to take responsibility
for their actions. The defiant behavior is directed primarily toward
parents, teachers, and other people in authority. Anger, resentment,
blaming others, and spiteful and vindictive behaviors are common.
Although confrontation often occurs, it does not involve the more
serious violations of the rights of others that are involved in conduct
disorders. Before puberty more males than females meet the criterion for
this disorder, with closer to equal numbers after puberty (American
Psychiatric Association, 2000a). ODD is one of the more controversial
childhood disorders. It is often difficult to separate this disorder
from milder forms of conduct disorder and from normal developmental
difficulties in children and adolescents. Most children and adolescents
go through a period or several periods of defiant behaviors. In
DSM-IV-TR, a criterion indicating that the problem causes "significant
impairment in social or academic functioning" was added to try to
discriminate between "normal" and "pathological" defiance. ODD tends to
be associated with depression, parent-child conflict, the espousing of
unreasonable beliefs, and negative family interactions (Barkley et al.,
1992; Costello et al., 2003).

A TROUBLED TEEN Conduct disorders involves a persistent pattern of
antisocial behaviors. Here a teenager wearing a red plaid shirt watches
for security as he shoplifts CDs in a music store.

Conduct Disorders Case Study Charles was well known to school ofﬁcials
for his many ﬁghts with peers. After a stabbing incident at school, he
was put on probation and then transferred to another junior high school.
Two months later, at age fourteen, Charles was charged with armed
robbery and placed in a juvenile detention facility. He had few positive
peer contacts at the juvenile facility and seemed unwilling or unable to
form close relationships. Some progress was achieved with a behavioral
contract program that involved positive reinforcement from adults and
praise for refraining from aggression in handling conﬂicts. He was
transferred to a maximum-security juvenile facility when he seriously
injured two of his peers, whose teasing had angered him. Charles
completed a vocational training program in this second facility, but he
couldn't hold a regular job. He was sent to prison following a
conviction for armed robbery.

Conduct disorders are characterized by a persistent pattern of
antisocial behaviors that violate the rights of others. Many children
and adolescents display isolated instances of antisocial behavior, but
this diagnosis is given only when the behavior is repetitive and
persistent. Conduct disorders may include behaviors such as bullying,
lying, cheating, fighting, destroying property, stealing, setting fires,
cruelty to people and animals, assaults, rape, and truant behavior. The
pattern of misconduct must last for at least twelve months to warrant
this diagnosis (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). The diagnosis
of conduct disorder applies only when the behaviors reflect dysfunction
in the individual rather than a reaction to the individual's social and
economic environment. Males with this disorder tend to display
confrontational aggressiveness such as fighting, stealing, and
vandalism, whereas females are more likely to display truancy, running
away, substance abuse, prostitution, or chronic lying. Approximately 6
to 16 percent of boys and 2 to 9 percent of girls meet the diagnostic
criteria for conduct disorder. The incidence of conduct disorder
increases from childhood to adolescence (Searight, Rottnek, & Abby,
2001). Two types of conduct disorder are recognized: (1) childhood-onset
type (at least one conduct problem occurs before age ten) and (2)
adolescent-onset type (conduct problem occurs after age ten). Early
onset for both boys and girls is related to more chronic and more
serious offenses. In about 40 percent of cases, childhood-onset conduct
disorder develops into adult antisocial personality disorder (Searight
et al., 2001). Although oppositional defiant disorder frequently
precedes childhood-onset conduct disorder, it is important to note that
many children with oppositional defiant disorder do not later exhibit a
conduct disorder. Although many childhood disorders remit over

oys are more likely to show direct forms of bullying--- intimidating,

more relational bullying, such as using threats of social exclusion

FIGURE

time, children are less likely to outgrow conduct disorders. Not only do
children with this disorder have the externalizing aggressive behaviors
that define the disorder, but many also display internalizing symptoms,
such as withdrawal and major depression, perhaps due to the social
alienation created by their behaviors (Lambert et al., 2001; Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \[SAMHSA\], 2003). As
noted, prognosis for conduct disorders is poor; they often lead to
criminal behavior, antisocial personality, and problems in marital and
occupational adjustment during adulthood. Many people with these
disorders show early involvement with alcohol and illegal drugs, and
many delinquent adolescents later become adult criminals. The prognosis
is poorer for male children whose conduct disorder is accompanied by
serious aggression, especially sexual aggression, and who have low IQ
scores or parents who are antisocial. Etiology Many cases of conduct
disorder begin in early childhood. Some infants who are especially
"fussy" seem to be at risk for developing conduct disorder. The etiology
of conduct disorder probably involves an interaction of
genetic/constitutional, psychological, social-familial, and
sociocultural factors. Searight et al. (2001) propose that children who
have conduct disorder may inherit decreased baseline autonomic nervous
system activity, requiring greater stimulation to achieve optimal
arousal. This hereditary factor may account for the high level of
sensation-seeking activity (increased risk taking) associated with
conduct disorder (van Goozen et al., 2007). As indicated in Figure 15.2,
a number of factors are associated with the development of conduct
disorders. We have categorized the factors into our multipath
dimensions, although some factors may belong in more than one dimension.
For example, having antisocial parents can be a genetic factor (when
genes are passed to children) or a social factor (for example, when
children imitate their parents' behavior). In any event, research has
found that many different conditions involve biological, psychological,
social, and sociocultural factors. For example, increased risk of
conduct disorders is associated with having antisocial parents (in the
case of boys), coming from large and poverty-stricken families, being
abused, and experiencing parental discord (SAMHSA, 2003). It may be that
genetic predisposition toward aggressive or antisocial behavior may be
expressed in adverse rearing environments, especially those in which the
child receives harsh or inconsistent discipline or is exposed to high
levels of interparental conflict or marital breakdown (van Goozen et
al., 2007). The child may then not experience a consistent relationship
between his or her behavior and its consequences (Searight et al.,
2001).

School Violence: A Sign of the Times?

V

iolence, theft, drugs, and ﬁrearms are prevalent in our schools (DeVoe
et al., 2004). The National Center for Children Exposed to Violence
(2006) reported that:

• One study has found that over 17 percent of high school students had
carried a weapon to school during the preceding 30 days. • Another study
found that 71 percent of public elementary and secondary schools
experienced at least one violent incident during the school year. • 12
percent of 12- through 18-year-old students reported experiencing some
form of victimization at school. • 12- through 18-year-old students
living in urban and suburban locales were equally vulnerable to serious
violent crime at school. • In one study, one in six teachers report
having been the victim of violence in or around school. • Nationwide, 15
percent of high school students were found to have participated in a
physical ﬁght.

Schools need to play a critical role in the mental health of children
(Adelman & Taylor, 2004). What can we do to enhance emotional well-being
and keep students from violence? Some remedies have been proposed. How
would you evaluate the effectiveness of the following proposed actions
in trying to reduce violence? 1. Society should enact tougher gun
control laws. 2. We should ﬁnd better means of identifying potentially
violent students and then have them undergo some sort of counseling. 3.
Make all students go through metal detectors so that weapons can be
conﬁscated. 4. Increase penalties for students who engage in violence.
Some proposals may make sense but are difﬁcult to implement. For
example, to identify potentially violent students, schools are
encouraging students to report to school ofﬁcials when they become aware
that a student has made threatening comments or has developed plans for
attacking others. Although it is recognized that potential reasons for
not reporting might include a belief that the person is "only joking,"
concerns about retaliation or getting a friend in trouble, or concern
about being labeled a "narc" or a "squealer," there is a need for
systematic research to explore why students are not reporting threats of
violence and to understand the characteristics of schools in which
students do report potential problems (Lazarus, 2001). Understanding how
to create a school environment in which students are willing to report
potential danger is particularly important in view of reports that in
over 75 percent of the cases of school violence studied by the U.S.
Secret Service, the attacker had

talked to at least one person about the plan prior to the attack. In
addition, in about 70 percent of the attacks, the violent actions were
actually encouraged by peers who knew about the plan (Vossekuil et al.,
2000). Although implementation of preventive strategies has been
difﬁcult, measures have been taken and plans have been developed to deal
with school violence. The United States Department of Education has
sponsored the Safe and Comprehensive Schools Project, an effort to
examine actions that can be taken both to prevent violence and to
recognize and intervene when there may be the potential of violence.
Schools involved in the project have focused on three levels of
intervention: (1) comprehensive planning to create a positive climate
within the school---students are taught social skills and ways of
peacefully solving conﬂicts; (2) developing procedures for early
identiﬁcation and intervention for students who may be undergoing
emotional difﬁculties or who appear to have violent tendencies or
preoccupation with violent themes; and (3) developing effective
responses to violence, with a philosophy not only of zero tolerance for
any level of harassment or aggression but also of creating procedures
for responding to these behaviors and providing support to students
about whom chronic or acute concerns exist. Some signs of the times:
students as young as kindergarten age practice lockdown procedures and
are trained in safety procedures in the event of violence in the schools
in the same manner that earthquake and ﬁre drills have been practiced
for years. Professional mental health associations have also gotten
involved. The American Psychological Association has developed a
partnership with MTV to provide a public outreach campaign to help end
school violence. The National Association of Social Workers (NASW, 2007)
issued the following policy statement concerning school violence: NASW
believes that all schools must develop comprehensive violence prevention
plans that address both risk factors for school violence and protective
factors that reduce that risk. Since violence prevention starts in
families and communities, any approach to school violence must include
parents, community resources, school staff, and the students themselves,
in order to be effective. Among the speciﬁc actions schools can take are
building an effective schoolwide behavior management system and
developing a clear code of conduct, with appropriate consequences for
infractions. Further, children can be taught tolerance and civility as
well as conﬂict resolution skills; they can be engaged in
character-building activities; and schools can recognize students who
contribute positively to a school's climate and culture.

CHAPTER 15 • DISORDERS OF CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE

Patterson (1986) formulated a psychological-behavioral model of
antisocial conduct that involves parents' failure to effectively punish
misbehavior. In his work with families of children with conduct
disorders, he noticed that these children counterattacked when a parent
requested something from them or criticized them. In the face of this
response, the parent withdrew from the conflict. The child then fails to
learn to respect authority, and this failure generalizes to the school
setting, resulting in academic failure and poor peer relations.
Patterson concluded that the specific factors that contribute to the
development of antisocial behaviors include (1) a lack of parental
monitoring (increases in unsupervised street time were associated with
increased rates of antisocial behaviors), (2) inconsistent disciplinary
practices, (3) failure to use positive management techniques or to teach
social process skills, and (4) failure to teach the skills necessary for
academic success (listening, compliance, following directions, and so
on). Although Patterson focused primarily on the learning aspects in the
etiology of conduct disorders, he also supported the view that
predisposing factors such as difficult child temperament may increase
the need for parents to learn and consistently apply appropriate
management skills. Treatment Although conduct disorders have resisted
traditional forms of psychotherapy, training in social and cognitive
skills appears promising. In a review of treatment programs for
children, several types of interventions were found to be well
established or probably efficacious with children exhibiting conduct
problems (Herschell, McNeil, & McNeil, 2004). One program (Kolko, Loar,
& Sturnick, 1990), for example, focused on helping aggressive boys
develop verbal skills to enter groups, play cooperatively, and provide
reinforcement for peers. The cognitive element included using
problem-solving skills to identify behavior problems, generate solutions
to them, and select alternative behaviors. In addition, the children
learned positive social skills through viewing videotapes and
role-playing with therapists and peers. Dishion, McCord, and Poulin
(1999) caution that group interventions involving the aggregation of
young high-risk adolescents need to be considered carefully for use with
delinquent youths because of possible "deviancy training effects" that
may occur, resulting in increases in substance abuse and in antisocial
and violent behavior. They propose mobilizing adult mentors or
interventions targeting the parents of delinquent youths as powerful
alternatives. Particularly important is for the mentors or parents to
develop a therapeutic relationship with the child involving empathy,
warmth, and acceptance. Kazdin, Whitley, and Marciano (2006) found that
it was the most important factor for a positive outcome in children with
oppositional, aggressive, or antisocial behavior. Parent management
training has also been successful (SAMHSA, 2003). These programs, which
have evolved over a period of more than twenty years of work with
problem children, teach specific skills so that parents learn how to
establish appropriate rules for the child, implement consequences, and
reward positive behaviors. The parents first practice their newly
learned skills on simple problems and gradually work on more difficult
problems as they become more proficient in management techniques. A
combination of building children's cognitive and social skills and
training parents in management techniques appears to produce the most

behavior on the playground showed clear reductions in aggressive
actions, especially for those children who were initially the most
aggressive (Stoolmiller, Eddy, & Reid, 2000). It has been suggested that
early intervention targeting young children with high aggression, in
addition to other risk factors such as low levels of parent education
and early childbearing, is particularly important (Nagin & Tremblay,
2001).

Elimination Disorders Case Study Eight-year-old Billy did not want to go
to school anymore. He was embarrassed about his inability to control his
bladder, he frequently wet his pants while in class, and he had to put
up with merciless teasing by classmates. Billy had been continent by age
ﬁve, but he started wetting the bed again around the age of seven. His
father was especially irate about his son's problem. He constantly
berated Billy for being "a baby" and said he "should wear diapers
again." The problem had become so severe that it disrupted the family's
travel plans. On long outings by automobile, Billy---fearful that he
would wet his pants---requested restroom stops every thirty minutes. For
the ﬁrst time, the family canceled their annual visit to their families
on the East Coast. The trip would require traveling by plane, and both
parents felt that the number of times Billy would visit the restroom on
the plane and his tendency to wet his pants at the most inopportune
times would ruin their pleasure in the vacation.

Most psychologists would agree with Freud that toilet training
represents a major source of potential conflict for the child. It is one
of the first times that demands for control of normal biological urges
(urinating and defecating) are placed on the child. Most children handle
this developmental milestone well, with no resulting problems. A small
percentage of children like Billy experience elimination
disorders---problems of bladder or bowel control.

Enuresis According to DSM-IV-TR, enuresis is the habitual voiding of
urine during the day or night into one's clothes, bed, or floor. The
behavior is generally involuntary, but in rare situations it may be
intentional. Enuresis is most likely to occur during sleep, but it is
not uncommon during the daytime. To be diagnosed with enuresis, the
child must be at least five years old and must void inappropriately at
least twice per week for at least three months. Enuresis is also
associated with clinically significant distress and with impairment in
social, academic, or other areas of functioning. It is a fairly common
disorder. In epidemiological studies, 4.9 to 8.0 percent of seven- to
seventeen-year-olds were found to be enuretic (Klages et al., 2005).
Most children outgrow the disorder by adolescence, although 1 percent of
individuals with enuresis continue to have symptoms in adulthood
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Many children with enuresis
experience significant distress or impairment in their social, academic,
or everyday lives, and the disorder can also drastically affect their
families. A large epidemiologic sample of more than eight thousand
children found a higher rate of parent-reported psychological problems
in children age seven and a half years with daytime wetting compared
with those with no daytime wetting. The largest differences were found
for externalizing problems, such as attention and activity problems,
oppositional behavior, and conduct problems (Joinson, Heron, & von
Gontard, 2006). Children tend to be fearful and apprehensive about not
being able to control their bladders, sensitive to imagined or real
parental disappointment and disapproval, and frightened of peer
ridicule. They may withdraw from peer relationships or may be ostracized
by other children. Unsympathetic or impatient parents can exacerbate the
problem by putting greater pressures on the child, producing further
anxiety and a sense of failure. A vicious cycle may ensue: the child
wets the bed, which leads to condemnation by one or both parents, which
causes the child to feel intense guilt and anxiety about

and 10.4 percent represent unknown or missing information. Most
fatalities from physical abuse are caused by fathers and other male
caretakers. Mothers are most often responsible for deaths resulting from
child neglect. We also know that most people who abuse were themselves
abused as children. Most are under the age of thirty and lack high
school diplomas, are rarely psychotic, may show personality disorders,
experience serious stress, have low levels of tolerance for frustration,
and often abuse alcohol and drugs (Child Welfare Information Gateway,
2005; Petersen & Brown, 1994). It is clear that many factors contribute
to abuse. Some, such as poverty, are situational; others, such as
immaturity and lack of parenting skills, are more related to individual
temperament. Prevention and Public Policy Federal and state laws require

or neglect if they suspect such a situation exists. Despite the fact
that all ﬁfty states have enacted such legislation, child abuse
persists. There have been efforts to increase public awareness of the
problem of child abuse through educational campaigns on television and
other media concerning the prevalence and impact of child abuse. A
continual debate in the ﬁeld of child protection is the balance between
child safety and maintaining the family (Dogden, 2000). Many communities
now run parent education and support groups, especially for families
identiﬁed as "at risk." Try to think through some answers to some
important questions. We hear a great deal about parental child abuse or
sexual abuse of teenagers by some priests. What are the consequences of
child abuse on its victims? Do adults who were abused as children show
psychological effects of abuse? Why would those who are abused as
children become abusers?

causing the problem, which fosters the child's belief in being unable to
control the urge to urinate, which only reinforces the child's continued
enuresis. Studies evaluating self-esteem in enuretic children show
lowered self-esteem prior to treatment but increased self-esteem
following treatment, even when the treatment was not successful
(Longstaffe, Moffatt, & Whalen, 2000). Both psychological and biological
explanations have been associated with enuresis. Psychological
stressors---unrealistic toilet training demands placed on the child,
delayed or lax toilet training, a stressful life situation (such as
death of a parent or birth of a new sibling), disturbed family patterns,
or the presence of other emotional problems---may be predisposing
factors (Haug Schnabel, 1992; Joinson et al., 2006). Biological
determinants may include delayed maturation of the urinary tract, delays
in the development of normal rhythms of urine production, decreased
production of hormones that control urination, or a hypersensitive or
small bladder. Thiedke (2003) has noted that studies have found that
when both parents were enuretic as children, their offspring had a 77
percent risk of having nocturnal enuresis. The risk declined to 43
percent when only one parent was enuretic as a child, and to 15 percent
when neither parent was enuretic. The vast majority of children with
nocturnal enuresis have a family history of the disorder. Interventions
often involve using medications that decrease the depth of sleep
(allowing the child to recognize the bladder urges) or that decrease
urine volume (thereby decreasing enuretic events; Saldano et al., 2007).
The most successful psychological procedures involve behavioral methods
(Herschell et al., 2004), such as parents giving constant reinforcement
to the child, awakening the child to use the toilet, and giving the
child responsibility for making up his or her own bed should an accident
occur. A bedtime urine alarm treatment is particularly effective
(Schulman et al., 2000), especially when used with medication (Saldano
et al., 2007).

Encopresis Although less common than enuresis, encopresis may be more
disturbing because it involves repeated defecating onto one's clothes,
the floor, or other inappropriate places. To be diagnosed with this
disorder, the child must be at least four years old and must have
defecated inappropriately at least once a month for at least three
months. The incidents must not be due to the use of laxatives.

434

CHAPTER 15 • DISORDERS OF CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE

studies found that 0.7 to 3.5 percent of seven- to seventeen-year-olds
were encopretic (Klages et al., 2005), and the disorder is much more
common in males than in females (Ingersoll & Previts, 2001).
Intermittent episodes of encopresis can persist for years. Encopresis is
most commonly seen with functional constipation. The typical pattern for
children with encopresis is a history of constipation, resulting in
painful defecation and subsequent withholding of bowel movements,
leading to additional constipation and involuntary soiling (Issenman,
Filmer, & Gorski, 1999). In rare situations in which encopresis is
deliberate, other features of oppositional defiant disorder or conduct
disorder may be present. In cases of encopresis in which constipation is
not a primary factor, it is important to identify the reason for the
resistance to using the toilet and to assess possible medical,
developmental, or behavioral contributors to the problem, to understand
the toilet refusal behavior, to ensure appropriate stools through diet
and medication, and to develop a schedule for toileting (Kuhn, Marcus, &
Pitner, 1999; LoeningBaucke, 2000). According to DSM-IV-TR, the amount
of psychological impairment associated with encopresis is in direct
proportion to its effects on the child's self-esteem. Intense social
problems can arise through shame, embarrassment, and attempts to conceal
the disorder. Ostracism by peers, anger on the part of significant
caregivers, and overall rejection can compound the problem. The most
common means of treatment include proper medical evaluation (especially
when constipation is present) and the use of behavioral and family forms
of therapy. Parent and child education about toileting regimens and a
well-organized bowel management program can produce dramatic results
(Loening-Baucke, 2000).

Learning Disorders Disorders of childhood and adolescence also include
cognitive and academic functioning. Learning disorders are characterized
by academic functioning that is substantially below that expected in
terms of the person's chronological age, measured intelligence, and
age-appropriate education. The disturbance significantly interferes with
academic achievement or with activities of daily living. Substantially
below is usually defined statistically as a severe discrepancy between
achievement and IQ. If a sensory deficit is present, the learning
difficulties must be in excess of those usually associated with the
deficit. Care should be taken to ensure that intelligence testing
procedures reflect adequate attention to the individual's ethnic or
cultural background, which may affect performance. Individualized
testing is always required to make the diagnosis of a learning disorder.
The prevalence of learning disorders ranges from 2 to 10 percent,
depending on the nature of ascertainment and the definitions applied.
Approximately 5 percent of students in public schools in the United
States are identified as having a learning disorder. The school dropout
rate for children or adolescents with learning disorders is reported at
nearly 40 percent (or approximately 1.5 times the average). Children
with learning disorders may try to hide their problem and feel stupid,
inferior, or embarrassed by poor school performance. Learning disorders
may persist into adulthood. Adults with learning disorders may have
significant problems in employment or social adjustment. Table 15.3
provides a brief overview of learning disorders.

Etiology a disorder characterized by academic functioning that is
substantially below that expected in terms of the person's chronological
age, measured intelligence, and age-appropriate education learning
disorder

Little is currently known about the precise causes of learning
disabilities. However, some etiological possibilities are: • Some
children mature and develop at a slower rate than others in the same age
group. Consequently, they may not be able to perform at the expected
level in school. There is a "maturational lag." • Some children with
normal vision and hearing may misinterpret everyday sights and sounds
because of some kind of nervous system disorder.

• Injuries, illnesses, or physical traumas before birth or in early
childhood probably account for some later learning problems. • Children
born prematurely and children who had medical problems soon after birth
sometimes develop learning disabilities. • Learning disabilities tend to
run in families, so some learning disabilities may be inherited. •
Learning disabilities are more common in boys than girls, possibly
because boys are slower to mature. • Some learning disabilities appear
to be linked to the irregular spelling, pronunciation, and structure of
the English language, because the incidence of learning disabilities is
lower in Spanish- and Italian-speaking countries.

Treatment Learning disabilities are lifelong and cannot simply go away
with treatment. However, persons with learning disabilities can adjust
and adapt in order to function effectively in society. Severity of the
disorder varies, and appropriate action involves the accurate assessment
of the limitations of the disorder and individualized interventions.
What has been helpful is to teach children with learning disabilities
skills that capitalize on their abilities and strengths while correcting
and compensating for disabilities and limitations.

Mental Retardation A teenager with mental retardation told his fellow
students, during a high school assembly, how he felt about his handicap:

Case Study My name is Tim Frederick. . . . I would like to tell you what
it is like to be retarded. . . . I am doing this so that you might be
able to understand people like me. I do chores at home. I have to take
care of all the animals---twelve chickens, three cats, a dog, three
goldﬁsh, and a horse. That's a lot of mouths to feed. . . . After I
graduate from school, I hope to live in an apartment. . . . The hardest
thing is when people make fun of me. I went to a dance a few weeks ago,
and no girl would dance with me. Can you guys imagine how you would feel
if that happened to you? Well, I feel the same way. (K. Smith, 1988,
pp. 118--119)

The perception of mental retardation, formerly considered a hopeless
condition that required institutionalization, is undergoing a
fundamental change. Tim Frederick's mother was told that her son's
development would be delayed and that he might never

any people have advocated replacing the term mental retardation with the
term intellectual and developmental disabilities (American Association
on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 2007). The latter is
simply less stigmatizing than mental retardation, mental deﬁciency,
feeble-mindedness, idiocy, imbecility, and other terminology that has
been cast aside over the years. The larger issue is one of promoting
inclusion and acceptance of people with intellectual and developmental
disabilities in society.

mental retardation (MR)

a disability characterized by signiﬁcant limitations both in
intellectual functioning and in adaptive behaviors as expressed in
conceptual, social, and practical adaptive skills

Mental retardation (MR) is a disability characterized by significant
limitations both in intellectual functioning and in adaptive behaviors
as expressed in conceptual, social, and practical adaptive skills
(American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities,
2007). Prevalence figures for the United States are 1 to 3 percent,
depending primarily on the definition of adaptive functioning (Popper &
West, 1999). As mentioned earlier, mental retardation is categorized by
DSM-IV-TR as one of the disorders usually first diagnosed in infancy,
childhood, or adolescence. Mental retardation is not considered a
cognitive disorder, although it may have characteristics that are
similar to those found in some cognitive disorders. To render a
diagnosis of mental retardation in DSM-IV-TR, the following criteria are
used: 1. Significant subaverage general intellectual functioning
(ordinarily interpreted as an IQ score of 70 or less on an individually
administered IQ test) 2. Concurrent deficiencies in adaptive behavior
(social and daily living skills, degree of independence lower than would
be expected by age or cultural group) 3. Onset before age eighteen
(subaverage intellectual functioning arising after age eighteen is
typically categorized as dementia) Common characteristics that accompany
mental retardation are dependency, passivity, low self-esteem, low
tolerance of frustration, depression, and self-injurious behavior
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Relative to the general
population, persons with mental retardation are much more likely to
suffer from psychiatric problems. The problems include a higher
incidence of aggression, self-injurious behavior, tantrums, and
stereotyped behaviors (Phelps, Brown, & Power, 2002). The more severe
levels of mental retardation are associated with speech difficulties,
neurological disorders, cerebral palsy, and vision and hearing problems.
Individuals with autism may also exhibit cognitive deficits, but mental
retardation has been distinguished from autism on various mental and
perceptual tasks (Shulman, Yirmiya, & Greenbaum, 1995). Levels of
Retardation DSM-IV-TR specifies four different levels of mental
retardation, which are based on IQ score ranges, as measured on the
revised Wechsler scales (WISC-R and WAIS-R): (1) mild (IQ score 50--55
to 70), (2) moderate (IQ score 35--40 to 50--55), (3) severe (IQ score
20--25 to 35--40), and (4) profound (IQ score below 20 or 25). Social
and vocational skills and degree of adaptability may vary greatly within
each category. Table 15.5 contains estimates of the number of people
within each level in the United States. It should be noted that the
American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
(AAIDD, 2007) does not use a classification of mental retardation

based on levels of intellectual functioning as revealed in IQ scores.
Instead, AAIDD considers concurrent limitations in both the intellectual
and adaptive skills of the individual (Kanaya, Scullin, & Ceci, 2003).
It makes five assumptions: 1. Limitations in present functioning must be
considered within the context of community environments typical of the
individual's age peers and culture. 2. Valid assessment considers
cultural and linguistic diversity, as well as differences in
communication, sensory, motor, and behavioral factors. 3. Within an
individual, limitations often coexist with strengths. 4. An important
purpose of describing limitations is to develop a profile of needed
supports. 5. With appropriate personalized supports over a sustained
period, the life functioning of the person with mental retardation
generally will improve. Adaptive skills include those required in
communication, self-care, social interactions, health and safety, work,
and leisure. Furthermore, the skills are placed in the context of one's
culture and community. Mental retardation is diagnosed only if low
intelligence is accompanied by impaired adaptive functioning. Low
intelligence alone, or deficits in adaptive behaviors alone, do not
result in a diagnosis of mental retardation according to AAIDD (Popper &
West, 1999). Although DSM-IV-TR and AAIDD use intellectual and adaptive
functioning as criteria in the diagnosis of mental retardation, AAIDD
focuses more on adaptive functioning and specifies the type and nature
of psychosocial supports needed in adaptive functioning (Harris, 2001).
Finally, AAIDD considers mental retardation to be a disability and not a
mental or medical disorder (AAIDD, 2007).

Etiology of Mental Retardation Mental retardation is thought to be
produced by biological, psychological, social, and sociocultural
factors. These factors are largely grouped into environmental conditions
(such as poor living conditions), biological conditions, or some
combination of the two (see Table 15.6). It can be caused by injury,
disease, or a brain abnormality. The etiology is dependent to some
extent on the level of mental retardation. Mild retardation is generally
idiopathic (having no known cause) and familial, whereas severe
retardation is typically related to genetic factors or to brain damage
(Popper & West, 1999). Environmental Factors Certain features of the
environment may contribute to retardation. Among these are the absence
of stimulating factors or situations, a lack of attention and
reinforcement from parents or significant others, and chronic stress and
frustration. In addition, poverty, lack of adequate health care, poor
nutrition, and inadequate education place children at a disadvantage.
For example, iodine deficiency in a baby can cause mental retardation
(Angermayr & Clar, 2004).

chromosome (trisomy 21) and resulting in mental retardation and
distinctive physical characteristics

Genetic Factors Genetic factors in mental retardation include genetic
variations and genetic abnormalities. Mental retardation caused by
normal genetic variation simply reflects the fact that in a normal
distribution of traits, some individuals will fall in the upper range
and some in the lower. Researchers have suggested that the normal range
of intelligence lies between the IQ scores of 50 and 150, and that some
individuals simply lie on the lower end of this normal range (Zigler,
1967). No organic or physiological anomaly associated with mental
retardation is usually found in this type of retardation. Most people
classified with mild retardation have normal health, appearance, and
physical abilities. One of the most common inherited forms of mental
retardation is called the fragile X syndrome because an abnormal gene is
present on the bottom end of the X chromosome (Kornman et al., 2002). It
occurs in one of every two thousand to five thousand live births (Hessl
et al., 2001). Affected by the abnormal gene are the higher control
processes of attention, such as executive functioning. The executive
cognitive functions include cognitive flexibility, planning, initiation,
behavioral and attentional regulation, feedback utilization, and
self-perception (Loesch et al., 2003). Although impairment in
functioning varies among those with inherited forms of mental
retardation, many affected persons have severe deficits (Raymond et al.,
2007). Those with profound retardation (about 1 to 2 percent of those
with the disorder) may be so intellectually deficient that they require
constant and total care and supervision. Many also have significant
sensorimotor impairment and are confined to beds or wheelchairs by the
congenital defects that produced the retardation. Even with teaching,
there is minimal, if any, acquisition of self-help skills among these
individuals. Their mortality rate during childhood is extremely high.
Associated physical problems, such as neuromuscular disorders,
impairment of vision or hearing, and seizures, may coexist. Down
syndrome is a condition produced by the presence of an extra chromosome
(trisomy 21, an autosomal, or nonsex, chromosome) and resulting in
mental retardation and distinctive physical characteristics. Most cases
of Down syndrome are not inherited but occur as random events that
affect the genes during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and
sperm). The condition may occur as often as once in every eight hundred
to one thousand live births ("Down Syndrome," 2007). About 10 percent of
children with severe or moderate retardation show

possible through different techniques, including amniocentesis, a
screening procedure in which a hollow needle is inserted through the
pregnant woman's abdominal wall and the amniotic fluid is withdrawn from
the fetal sac. This procedure is performed during the fourteenth or
fifteenth week of pregnancy. The fetal cells from the fluid are
cultivated and, within three weeks, can be tested to determine whether
Down syndrome is present. This procedure involves some risk for both
mother and fetus, so it is employed only when the chance of finding Down
syndrome is high---as, for example, with women older than age
thirty-five. Other, less common genetic anomalies---such as Turner's

Nongenetic Biological Factors Mental retardation may be caused by a
variety of environmental mishaps during the prenatal (from conception to
birth), perinatal (during the birth process), or postnatal (after birth)
period. During the prenatal period, the developing organism is
susceptible to viruses and infections (such as German measles), drugs,
radiation, poor nutrition, and other nongenetic influences. Increasing
attention is being focused on the problem of mental deficits related to
alcohol consumption during pregnancy, especially because the problem is
preventable. Some children born to mothers who drink during pregnancy
have fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS occurs in 0.2 to 1.5 per 1,000
live births (CDC, 2007d). It is a group of congenital physical and
mental defects including small body size and microcephaly, an anomaly
whose most distinguishing feature is an unusually small brain. Such
children are generally mildly retarded, but many are either moderately
retarded or of average intelligence. Those with normal intelligence seem
to have significant academic and attentional difficulties, however, as

well as a history of hyperactivity and behavioral deficits (Streissguth,
1994). Smoking and poor nutrition may increase the likelihood that an
alcoholic mother will have offspring with FAS. Among the different
ethnic groups in the United States, the rate of FAS is especially high
among American Indians (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
1995). During the perinatal period, mental retardation can result from
birth trauma, prematurity, or asphyxiation. After birth or during the
postnatal period, head injuries, infections, tumors, malnutrition, and
ingesting toxic substances such as lead can cause brain damage and
consequent mental retardation. Compared with prenatal factors, however,
these hazards account for only a small proportion of organically caused
mental retardation.\` The most common birth condition associated with
mental retardation is prematurity and low birth weight. Although most
premature infants develop normally, approximately 20 percent show signs
of neurological problems reflected in learning disabilities and mental
retardation (Pound, 1987). Low birth weight is also a risk factor for
mental retardation. The IQ scores of adolescents who had low birth
weights have been found to be in the normal range but significantly
lower than those of adolescents with normal birth weights (Whitaker et
al., 2006). Although incidence rates are decreasing for most types of
mental retardation, retardation owing to postnatal causes is on the
increase. For example, direct trauma to the head produces hemorrhaging
and tearing of the brain tissue, often as the result of an injury
sustained in an automobile accident or from child abuse. Other postnatal
causes include brain infections, neurological disease, toxic exposure,
and even extreme malnutrition (Popper & West, 1999).

Programs for People with Mental Retardation Because mental retardation
is a disability rather than a disease that can be "cured," the goal of
intervention is to develop the person's potential to the fullest extent
possible. Early Intervention Programs such as Head Start have not
produced dramatic increases in intellectual ability among at-risk
children (those from low-income families). But long-term follow-up
studies have found that they do produce positive results (U.S. Surgeon
General, 1999). Children who participated in early intervention programs
were found to perform better in school than nonparticipants. In
addition, a greater proportion of the participants in early intervention
finished high school,

Mental Retardation

441

which no doubt helped them obtain and hold better jobs. The families of
participants were also positively influenced by the programs. They rated
the programs as personally helpful, spent more time working with their
children on school tasks, and perceived their children as becoming
happier and healthier. School Services Services received by children
diagnosed with mental retardation can vary greatly between school
districts, as noted by Kanaya, Scullin, and Ceci (2003). Some of the
more common services offered to these students include modified regular
classroom assignments (for example, making the assignments shorter
and/or easier) and direct instructions that explicitly teach the skills
necessary to complete assignments (for example, organizing materials for
the student or showing the student exactly where the necessary
information is in the text). Special education services may include
removal from regular classrooms for all or part of the day to receive
instruction from special education specialists, paid aides, and
volunteers. In general, the trend is to individualize school services to
meet the needs of the child and his or her family (National
Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities, 2007).

PERSON WITH DOWN SYNDROME IN WORK ENVIRONMENT Many people with Down
Syndrome can function well in various jobs. Here, a baker is carrying
fresh bread.

Employment Programs People with mental retardation can achieve more than
was previously thought. The parents of one teenage boy, for example,
were told that he would always be childlike and that the only job he
would ever be fit for was stringing beads. Another person with moderate
retardation, who spent most of his time staring at his hands and rubbing
his face, also appeared to have a dismal future. Both of these men now
have paying jobs, one as a janitor and the other as a dishwasher.
Programs that enable people with mental retardation to learn specific
job skills, to interact with coworkers and supervisors, and to complete
work-related tasks with speed and quality are helpful (AAIDD, 2007).
Gains made in social and vocational skills appear to be maintained or
increased in follow-up studies. Living Arrangements Institutionalization
of people with mental retardation is declining, as more individuals are
placed in group homes or in situations in which they can live
independently or semi-independently within the community. The idea is to
provide the "least restrictive environment" that is consistent with
their condition and that will give them the opportunity to develop more
fully. Although the implication seems to be that institutions are bad
places, they do not have uniformly negative effects. Nor do group homes
always provide positive experiences. What seems to be most important are
program goals; programs that promote social interaction and the
development of competence have positive effects on the residents of
either institutions or group homes. Nontraditional group arrangements,
in which a small number of people live together in a home, sharing meals
and chores, provide increased opportunity for social interactions.
Although group arrangements vary considerably from setting to setting
(Perry & Felce, 2005), "normalized" living arrangements were found to
produce benefits such as increased adaptive functioning, improved
language development, and socialization. It should be noted that living
arrangements, environmental supports, and interventions should be
tailored to the type of retardation and severity of limitations found
among the individuals (Dykens & Hodapp, 1997). As mentioned earlier,
parents and family members often serve as caregivers for a significant
period of time. When this occurs, the family members may need education
and training in dealing with someone who has mental retardation.

about the disorder, finding out how to deal with the affected family

problems (such as anxiety, guilt, and anger) within the family are
important tasks for caregivers (Harris, 2001).

I M P L I C AT I O N S

In this chapter, we have discussed the symptoms, causes, and treatment
and prevention of childhood disorders. Because we are dealing with a
population (children and adolescents) and not a disorder (such as
depression), many kinds of disorders are included. Thus some, such as
autism spectrum disorders and mental retardation, have a strong
biological etiology. Heredity, conditions during pregnancy, and early
infancy factors are likely to play a strong role in these disorders.
Nevertheless, even in these and other childhood disorders, we see that
psychological, social, and sociocultural factors are implicated. For
example, in conduct disorders, we see that the prevalence is higher
among boys than girls and among children who are abused or neglected,
poor, or subjected to parental discord. Disorders that occur in
childhood are a product of many factors.

Summary 1. Which disorders fall under the category of pervasive
developmental disorders? ■ Pervasive

developmental disorders include autistic disorder, Rett syndrome,
childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive
developmental disorder not otherwise specified.

2.  What are some of the characteristics of attention deficit/
    hyperactivity disorder, and what is the difference between conduct
    disorder and oppositional defiant disorder? ■ Attention
    deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is characterized by
    overactivity, restlessness, distractibility, short attention span,
    and impulsiveness. Three types of ADHD are recognized: predominantly
    hyperactiveimpulsive, predominantly inattentive, and combined. ■
    Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is characterized by a pattern of
    hostile, defiant behavior toward authority figures. Children with
    ODD do not display the more serious violations of others' rights
    that are symptomatic of conduct disorders. Conduct disorders,
    especially those that have an early onset, show a clear continuity
    with adult problems.
3.  What are elimination disorders, and what is their prognosis? ■
    Enuresis and encopresis are elimination disorders that are diagnosed
    when children pass an age in which bladder or bowel control should
    normally exist. Enuresis is the usually involuntary voiding of urine
    into one's own clothes or bed. Encopresis is the usually involuntary
    expulsion of feces into one's own clothes or bed. Although they
    cause considerable distress to

the child, both elimination disorders usually abate with increasing age.
4. How common are learning disorders? ■ Approximately 5 percent of
students in public schools in the United States have learning disorders
in which their academic functioning is substantially below that expected
in terms of the person's chronological age, measured intelligence, and
age-appropriate education. 5. What is mental retardation, and what are
some of its causes and treatments? ■ DSM-IV-TR identifies four different
levels of mental retardation, which are based only on IQ scores: mild
(IQ score 50--70), moderate (IQ score 35--49), severe (IQ score 20--34),
and profound (IQ score below 20). ■ Causes of retardation include
environmental factors (psychological, social, and sociocultural
factors), normal genetic processes, genetic anomalies, and other
biological abnormalities, such as physiological or anatomical defects.
Most mental retardation does not have an identifiable organic cause and
is associated with only mild intellectual impairment. ■ The vast
majority of those with mental retardation can

become completely self-supporting with appropriate education and
training. Public schools provide special programs for children and
adolescents; even people with severe retardation are given instruction
and training in practical self-help skills. Various approaches---
behavioral therapy in particular---are used successfully to help people
with mental retardation acquire needed "living" skills.

Eating Disorders

I

'm not anorexic, I do eat. 3 meals a day, almost every day. Breakfast,
lunch, dinner. So I tell myself, my friends, my parents, my boyfriend,
I'm OK. "How can you accuse me? You see me eat, I'm not starving
myself." It's amazing how much lettuce you can eat and keep below 100
calories, the soups you can make at 50--100 calories per serving. The
meals you can make and show people you eat to calm them down. I'm a
master at these meals. "I'm not anorexic, I do eat." I'm 5'6 and 99
pounds, I know I'm skinny. I look at myself in the mirror, ﬁnd the fat,
ﬁnd the places where more pounds can be shed, tell myself that I'm not
unhealthy, I'm still safe, there is no reason to stop yet. . . .
(Anonymous 5, 2008) I would eat crazy amounts of food. . . . I'd eat ten
pieces of bread and butter, a box of crackers, two bowls of cereal, and
anything else that was sitting around in the kitchen. It was like I was
in an alcoholic trance and I couldn't stop myself. In the morning I'd
wake up thinking, I am so stupid. How can I be so stupid? (Jacobson &

CRITICAL THINKING

Anorexia's Web Disturbed eating patterns, including bingeing, purging,
and excessive dieting, and eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder, appear to be increasing in
frequency. In this chapter we attempt to determine the reasons for the
increase and consider the characteristics, associated features,
etiology, and treatment of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa,
binge-eating disorder, and eating disorders NOS (not otherwise
specified). We also cover obesity because it has important health
implications and has been proposed as a category for DSM-V (Volkow &
O'Brien, 2007).

Eating Disorders Eating disorders and disordered eating patterns are
becoming more prevalent in the United States, even among children and
adolescents (Marcus & Kalarchian, 2003). These behaviors appear to stem
from dissatisfaction with body weight or shape. In a sample of 4,745
middle and high school students, many were unhappy with their bodies
(41.5 percent of females; 24.9 percent of males) and had self-esteem
issues due to body shape or weight (36.4 percent of female; 23.9 percent
of males; Ackard, Fulkerson, & Neumark-Sztainer, 2007). Data from
national surveys indicate that nearly 50 percent of adolescent females
and 20 percent of adolescent males diet to control their weight. Weight
concerns are so great that a reported 13.4 percent of girls and 7.1
percent of boys have engaged in disordered eating patterns (see Table
16.1). Factors associated with disordered eating patterns include excess
weight, body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, depression, substance
use, and suicidal ideation (Neumark-Sztainer, Hannan, & Stat, 2000; T.
D. Wade, 2007). It is unclear whether these factors are the result or
the cause of disordered eating. Eating problems may be a result of the
availability of many attractive high-calorie foods, of mass media,
family, and peer influences, and of the American pursuit of thinness
(Pelletier & Dion, 2007; Tiggemann & Kuring, 2004). Paradoxically, the
increasing emphasis on thinness, especially for women, is occurring as
the population of the United States is becoming heavier. Currently
two-thirds of adults and 16 percent of children are overweight or obese
(Wang & Beydoun, 2007). Studies indicate that from 30 to 67 percent of
normal-weight adolescent girls and college females believe that they are
overweight. Weight and body shape concerns exist not only among young
white females but also among older women and minorities (Andersen, 2001;
Gilbert, 2003). Rates of eating disorders are high among Hispanic
American and Native American females and are increasing among immigrant
and Asian American females (Gilbert, 2003; Lee & Lock, 2007; Sherwood,
Harnack, & Story, 2000; Story et al., 1998; Wax, 2000). Although African
American women are less likely than white women to have eating
disorders, there is some indication that prevalence rates are increasing
(Talleyrand, 2006). Although overeating and being overweight are more
acceptable for men than for women, there is evidence of increasing body
dissatisfaction in males. Weight dissatisfaction in adolescent boys and
college males revolves around a desire to be heavier and more muscular
(Farquhar & Wasylkiw, 2007; Ricciardelli & McCabe, 2004). Similar
findings about weight were reported in a cross-cultural study involving
college men in Germany, France, and the Text not available due to
copyright restrictions United States. In the study (Pope et al., 2000),
images of men with different degrees of fatness and muscularity were
shown to a group of research participants. The males were asked to
choose images that represented their own bodies, the bodies they would
like to have, the body of an average man their age, and the male body
they thought women preferred. In all three countries, the men picked an
ideal body that was about twenty-eight pounds more muscular than their
own. The participants also believed

444

Eating Disorders

445

that women preferred a male body thirty pounds more muscular than their
current bodies. In actuality, women indicated a preference for an
ordinary male body without added muscle. The body dissatisfaction
displayed by both men and women may be due to social comparison
processes involving media images that few can achieve. In a study of
advertisements in Sports Illustrated magazine from 1975 to 2005, male
bodies portrayed were increasingly muscular and lean. When male
adolescents were exposed to these types of images, they made more
negative self-evaluations of themselves (Farquhar & Wasylkiw, 2007).
Women's magazines have also shown a dramatic increase in the number of
ads displaying the male body. In contrast to the 1970s, when photos
exposing men's bodies generally involved men on beaches advertising
bathing suits, ads today show undressed fit male bodies advertising
electronics, telephones, furniture, and beverage products (Pope,
Olivardia, Borowiecki, & Cohane, 2001). Perhaps the emphasis on the male
body is responsible for the finding that between 6 and 7 percent of boys
between the ages of fifteen and eighteen have taken anabolic steroids to
gain more muscle mass (Kanayama, Pope, & Hudson, 2001). Disordered
eating patterns because of preoccupation with weight and body dimensions
sometimes become extreme and lead to an eating disorder---anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder (see Table 16.2). The

C H A P T E R 1 6 • EATING DISORDERS

prevalence rates for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating
disorder are .9 percent, 1.5 percent, and 3.5 percent, respectively, for
women and .3 percent, .5 percent, and 2.0 percent, respectively, for men
(Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007). In addition, up to 60 percent
of individuals treated in eating disorder programs suffer from eating
disorder NOS, another eating disturbance (Fairburn et al., 2007; Dalle
Grave & Calugi, 2007). Unfortunately, disordered eating attitudes and
behaviors are becoming more common and are occurring even in young
children (Eddy et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2001).

Myth vs Reality Myth: Females and males can accurately judge the body
shape preferred by members of the opposite sex. Reality: Female
heterosexuals desire a body shape that is thinner than the body type
preferred by heterosexual males. Male heterosexuals desire to have a
more muscular body than that preferred by heterosexual females. Lesbian
females appear to have fewer body image problems than heterosexual
females, whereas gay males have greater body image concerns than
heterosexual males.

Anorexia Nervosa Case Study Marya Hornbacher is an award-winning writer
who ﬁghts a continuing battle with anorexia nervosa. She has written a
book, Wasted, that chronicles the inﬂuences of sociocultural factors in
the development of her eating disorder. At the age of eighteen, she
weighed only ﬁfty-two pounds and was so thin that she got bruises from
lying in bed. As a fourth grader, Marya had become concerned about being
"chubby," and she experimented with vomiting to control her weight. She
ate highly colored foods so that she could identify them after throwing
up. Marya is healthier now but still underweight---and she continues to
struggle with eating. Her anorexia has left her with a variety of
physical ailments: her heart muscle has been weakened, her stomach and
esophagus are lacerated, her bones are brittle, and her immune system
has been weakened. The disease has probably shortened her lifespan.
Although ﬁghting anorexia is difﬁcult, Marya still believes that "it's
your choice. . . . We are not just victims of external disease---we have
choices." (Marshall, 1998, p. D2)

an eating disorder characterized by low body weight, an intense fear of

anorexia nervosa

Anorexia nervosa is characterized by a refusal to maintain a body weight
above the minimum normal weight for one's age and height; an intense
fear of becoming obese that does not diminish with weight loss; body
image distortion; and, in females, the absence of at least three
consecutive menstrual cycles otherwise expected to occur. Individuals
with this bizarre and puzzling disorder literally engage in
selfstarvation. Those with anorexia nervosa weigh themselves repeatedly
and eat only small quantities of certain low-calorie foods (National
Institute of Mental Health \[NIMH\], 2007d). Although anorexia nervosa
has been recognized for more than one hundred years, it is receiving
increased attention owing to greater public knowledge of the disorder
and the apparent increase in its incidence. The disorder occurs
primarily in adolescent girls and young women, with most cases occurring
between the ages of fifteen and seventeen (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a; Walsh & Devlin, 1998). Although a minority of men
also develop this disorder, they are more likely to display "reverse
anorexia"---a belief that they are "too small." A major concern with
anorexia nervosa is that it is associated with serious medical
complications. The mortality rate of up to 19 percent is the highest for
any major psychiatric disorder, with many deaths occurring suddenly,
usually from ventricular arrhythmias (Andersen, 2007; Panagiotopoulos,
McCrindle, Hick, & Katzman, 2000). In fact, Sao Paulo, Brazil, received
recent attention when, within a period of two months,

Eating Disorders

four young women (two students, a manicurist, and a model) all died of
complications from anorexia nervosa (Rohter, 2006). A very frightening
characteristic of anorexia nervosa is that most people with this
disorder, even when clearly emaciated, continue to insist they are
overweight. Others will acknowledge that they are thin but claim that
some parts of their bodies are "too fat." They may measure or estimate
their body size frequently and believe that weight loss is a sign of
achievement and that gaining weight is a failure of selfcontrol
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). One eighteen-year-old woman
with anorexia nervosa vomited up to ten times daily, took laxatives, and
exercised four hours each day. Yet when her friends said, "You look
sick," or "You need to eat," she viewed their comments as a sign of
jealousy (Tarkan, 1998). Other times, peers will inadvertently provide
reinforcement by expressing admiration for thinness. One woman, Rachel,
hid her thin starving body under layers of bulky clothing. Some of her
friends commented positively on her figure, which increased her
determination to starve (Holahan, 2001). In most cases, the body image
disturbance is profound. As one researcher (Bruch, 1978, p. 209) noted
more than thirty years ago, people with this disorder "vigorously defend
their often gruesome emaciation as not being too thin. . . . They
identify with the skeleton-like appearance, actively maintain it, and
deny its abnormality." Some patients incorporate characteristics of
disordered eating into their identities and are reluctant to give up the
drive for thinness. At times, competition develops in treatment
settings, with patients competing in terms of who is the thinnest, who
ate the least, or who exercised the most (Bulik & Kendler, 2000). During
the early part of the disorder, individuals with anorexia nervosa
generally have only limited recognition of their disorder and may
consider their symptoms as ego-syntonic---that is, their symptoms seem
normal to them (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). Subtypes of
Anorexia Nervosa There are two subgroups of patients with anorexia
nervosa: the restricting type and the binge-eating/purging type. The
restricting type accomplishes weight loss through dieting or exercising.
The binge-eating/purging type loses weight through the use of
self-induced vomiting, laxatives, or diuretics, often after binge
eating. In one study of 105 patients hospitalized with this disorder, 53
percent had lost weight through constant fasting (restricting type); the
remainder had periodically resorted to binge eating followed by purging
or vomiting (binge-eating/purging type). Although both groups vigorously
pursued thinness, they differed in some aspects. Those with restricting
anorexia were more introverted and tended to deny that they suffered
hunger and psychological distress. Those with the binge-eating/purging
type were more extroverted. They reported more anxiety, depression, and
guilt; admitted more frequently to having a strong appetite; and tended
to be older (Halmi et al., 2000). Physical Complications Self-starvation
produces a variety of physical complications along with weight loss.
Patients with anorexia often exhibit cardiac arrhythmias because of
electrolyte imbalance; most have low blood pressure and slow heart
rates. They may be lethargic, have dry skin and brittle hair, show
hypertrophy of the parotid glands (from purging) that results in a
chipmunk-like face, and exhibit hypothermia (NIMH, 2007d). For example,
one woman had to wear heavy clothing even when the temperature was over
ninety degrees (Bryant, 2001). Irreversible osteoporosis, vertebra
contraction, and stress fractures are also significant complications of
the disorder. Males with the bulimic type of anorexia are also prone to
osteoporosis and are more likely than women to have comorbid substance
use disorder and antisocial personality (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a). In addition, the heart muscle is often damaged and
weakened because the body may use muscles as a source of protein during
starvation.

they are starving themselves to death?

Anorexia's Web Drink ice-cold water ("Your body has to burn calories to
keep your temperature up") and hot water with bullion cubes ("only 5
calories a cube, and they taste wonderful"; Springen, 2006, p. 1).
"Starvation is fulﬁlling. Colors become brighter, sounds sharper, odors
so much more savory and penetrating. . . . The greatest enjoyment of
food is actually found when never a morsel passes the lips" (Irizarry,
2004). "I will be thin, at all costs, it is the most important thing,
nothing else matters" (Ana Creed; Bardone-Cone & Cass, 2007).

These tips to reduce caloric intake, testimonials on the satisfaction of
not eating, and creeds or rules to remain thin are part of the numerous
pro-ana (anorexia) and pro-mia (bulimia) Web sites. Many of them
describe eating disorders as an acceptable lifestyle. Some of the names
used in online discussion groups include "thinspiration," "puking pals,"
"disappearing acts," "anorexiangel," and "chunkeee monkeee." Web
anorexia support group members contend that celebrities such as
Mary-Kate Olsen, Nicole Richie, and Kate Moss are ﬁne at their weight
and do not need to be treated for eating disorders. The Web sites
include pictures of ultra-thin models, tips for dieting, and ways to
conceal thinness from family members and friends. They provide a circle
of friends and encouragement. In one study, 43 percent of those who
visited the Web sites indicated that they received emotional support. "I
kind of lost all of my friends at school and in my neighborhood but I
still have my pro-ana and pro-mia friends" (Csipke & Horne, 2007,
p. 202). In response to before and after (thinner) pictures on the Web,
one person wrote: "You're my thinspiration! How did you do it?" Another
responded, "Your collarbones are beautiful---nice job" (Hayley, 2004,
p. 1). Participants on the Anorexic Nation Web site talk about how it is
important to have friends who are like them and argue that anorexia is a
lifestyle choice and not an illness. A woman on one site writes, "I am
very much for anorexia and this webpage is a reﬂection of that. If you
are recovered or recovering from an eating disorder, please, please,
PLEASE do not visit my site. I can almost guarantee it will trigger you!
But if you are like me and your eating disorder is your best friend and
you aren't ready to give it up, please continue" (Hellmich, 2001, p. 3).

Such Web sites are visited by thousands of people each day and used
frequently by adolescents with eating disorders, who reported learning
new weight loss and purging methods (Wilson et al., 2006). Medical
experts are deeply concerned that the sites will produce a surge in
eating-disorder cases, especially among susceptible individuals. Judy
Sargent, who is recovering from the disorder, says, "These sites don't
tell you that you're going to die if you don't get treatment"
("Anorexia's Web," 2001, p. 2). Eating disorder organizations have been
alarmed by these sites and have petitioned Yahoo! and other hosts to
remove the forums; however, many sites simply switched to other servers.
Although individuals with eating disorders generally gain a feeling of
support when visiting these Web sites, how much danger do they pose to
people with and without eating disorders? Should eating disorders be
considered a lifestyle choice? Course and Outcome Anorexia nervosa tends
to develop during adolescence, and the course is highly variable.
Individuals with the bingeing/purging type may have a better outcome.
However, the course and outcome of anorexia nervosa may also be
inﬂuenced by the reason for the behavior. People with anorexia may form
a heterogeneous group, with some developing the disorder because they
fear their impulses and want to attempt to prove they can regulate them;
others as an act of competitiveness or out of a sense of achievement;
others as a form of self-punishment or a means of demonstrating control
over one aspect of their lives. A difﬁculty in attempting to determine
outcome by anorexia nervosa type is that many patients who have the
restricting type later develop the binge-eating/purging subtype. The
course of anorexia nervosa is highly variable, with some recovering
after one episode, others showing a ﬂuctuating pattern of weight gain
and relapse, and others having a chronic and deteriorating course
(American Psychiatric Association, 2006). In a ﬁve-year follow-up study
of ninety-ﬁve female patients age ﬁfteen and older with anorexia, 59
percent of the patients initially had the restricting type and 41
percent the binge-eating/purging type. At follow-up, over 50 percent no
longer had a diagnosable eating disorder, although most still showed
disturbed eating patterns, poor body image, and psychosocial difﬁculties
(Ben-Tovim et al., 2001). A study of the ﬁve-year clinical recovery rate
(clinical recovery within ﬁve years as evidenced by absence of bingeing
and purging, restoration of weight, and menstruation for at least one
year) in Finnish women with anorexia nervosa was even more promising.
Two-thirds had reached either complete or nearly complete recovery,
resembling healthy women in weight and on psychological measures
(Keski-Rahkonen et al., 2007).

Eating Disorders

Unfortunately, even with the severe health and emotional damage
associated with the disorder, support groups advocating anorexia as a
lifestyle choice have appeared on the Internet (Wilson et al., 2006).
Associated Characteristics A number of mental disorders (depression,
anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorders) are comorbid with anorexia
nervosa. Some investigators believe that women with anorexia nervosa
strive for perfection and control over some aspect of their lives: "I'm
not eating now and it's kind of a control thing . . . at least I have
control over what I'm eating" (Budd, 2007, p. 100). Another individual
noted, "Nothing could prevent my will from controlling my body" (Segall,
2001, p. 22). Obsessive-compulsive behaviors and thoughts that may or
may not involve food or exercise are often reported (Rogers & Petrie,
2001). One woman developed obsessive thoughts and behaviors about food.
She feared that touching or even breathing around food would cause her
to gain weight (Bulik & Kendler, 2000). The manner in which these
symptoms are related to anorexia nervosa is unclear because of the
possibility that malnutrition or starvation may cause or exacerbate
obsessive symptoms. Some researchers believe that anorexia nervosa is a
variant of obsessive-compulsive disorder. In one study, a somewhat
higher frequency of obsessive-compulsive disorder was found among
first-degree relatives of anorexia probands than in a group of
comparison participants (Bellodi et al., 2001). Personality disorders
and other characteristics have also been linked to anorexia nervosa,
although the restricting and binge-eating/purging types may differ in
the characteristics with which they are linked. As noted earlier, the
restricting type is more likely to be linked to traits of introversion,
conformity, perfectionism, and rigidity, whereas the bingeing/purging
type is more likely to be associated with extroverted, histrionic,
emotionally volatile personalities, impulse control problems, and
substance abuse. Interpreting these relationships has been difficult, as
they could (1) represent the misfortune of having two or more disorders
by chance, (2) indicate that anorexia is an expression of a personality
disorder, or (3) be the result of common environmental or genetic
factors that underlie both anorexia and the personality disorder (Westen
& Harnden-Fischer, 2001).

Bulimia Nervosa Case Study "At ﬁrst, after eating too much, I would just
go to the toilet and make myself sick. I hadn't heard of bulimia. ... I
started eating based on how I was feeling about myself. If my hair
looked bad, I'd stuff down loads of candy. After a while, I started
exercising excessively because I felt so guilty about eating. I'd run
for miles and miles and go to the gym for three hours." (Dirmann, 2003,
p. 60)

Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent
episodes of binge eating (the rapid consumption of large quantities of
food) at least twice a week for three months, during which the person
loses control over eating. Two subtypes exist: the purging type, in
which the individual regularly vomits or uses laxatives, diuretics, or
enemas; and the nonpurging type, in which excessive exercise or fasting
are used in an attempt to compensate for binges. A persistent
overconcern with body image and weight also characterizes this disorder.
Eating episodes may be stopped when abdominal pain develops or when
vomiting is induced (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a).
Individuals with bulimia nervosa judge themselves almost exclusively on
their eating and in terms of body shape and weight. They have
maladaptive beliefs such as "I am a failure because I am fat" (Jones,
Leung, & Harris, 2007). Compared with women at similar weight levels but
without the disorder, women with bulimia exhibited more psychopathology,
a greater external locus of control, lower self-esteem, and a lower
sense of personal effectiveness (Shisslak, Pazda, & Crago, 1990;
Williams, Taylor, & Ricciardelli, 2000).

Those with bulimia realize that their eating patterns are not normal and
are frustrated by that knowledge. They become disgusted and ashamed of
their eating and hide it from others. The binges, characterized by rapid
consumption of food, typically occur in private. Some eat nothing during
the day but lose control and binge in the late afternoon or evening. A
loss of self-control when eating is characteristic of this disorder, and
it is difficult to stop eating once a binge has begun. Consequences of
binge eating are controlled through vomiting or the use of laxatives,
which produce feelings of relief from physical discomfort and the fear
of gaining weight, often followed by feelings of shame and despair.
Those with the nonpurging type of bulimia often follow overeating
episodes with a commitment to a severely restrictive diet, fasting, or
engaging in excessive exercising or physical activity (NIMH, 2007d).
Bulimia is much more prevalent than anorexia. The lifetime prevalence
rate for bulimia nervosa, which often begins in adolescence, is up to 2
percent in women (Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007; Van Hoeken,
Seidell, & Hoek, 2003). An additional 10 percent of women report some
symptoms but do not meet all the criteria for the diagnosis. The
incidence of bulimia appears to be increasing in women and is especially
prevalent in urban areas. Fewer males exhibit the disorder, presumably
because there is less cultural pressure for them to remain thin,
although it is estimated that about 10 percent of those affected by this
disorder are males (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). A person's
weight seems to have little to do with whether the individual develops
bulimia. Most are within the normal weight range (Mehler, 2003). Of a
sample of forty women with the disorder, twenty-five were of normal
weight, two were overweight, one was obese, and twelve were underweight.
These women averaged about twelve binges per week, and the estimated
calories consumed in a binge could be as high as 11,500. Typical binge
foods were ice cream, candy, bread or toast, and donuts (Gordon, 2001).
Physical Complications As noted earlier, people with bulimia use a
variety of measures---fasting, self-induced vomiting, diet pills,
laxatives, and exercise---to control the weight gain that accompanies
binge eating. More than 75 percent of patients with this disorder
practice self-induced vomiting (McGilley & Pryor, 1998). Side effects
and complications may result from this practice or from the excessive
use of laxatives. The effects of vomiting include erosion of tooth
enamel from vomited stomach acid; dehydration; swollen parotid glands,
which produces a puffy facial appearance; and lowered potassium, which
can weaken the heart and cause arrhythmia and cardiac arrest (American
Dietetic Association, 2001; Mehler, 2003). In rare cases, binge eating
can cause the stomach to rupture. Other possible gastrointestinal
disturbances include inflammation of the esophagus and gastric and
rectal irritation. Associated Features Individuals with bulimia eat not
only out of hunger but also as an emotionally soothing response to
distressing thoughts or external stressors. As noted earlier, women with
this disorder tend to be more likely to perceive events as stressful.
There appears to be a close relationship between emotional states and
disturbed eating patterns. As one woman stated, "Purging was the biggest
part of my day. . . . It was my release from the stress and monotony of
my life" (Erdely, 2004, p. 117). Weight preoccupation is also related to
the type of coping response an individual shows to life stressors. In a
nonclinical sample of university women, those who responded emotionally
when facing stressful situations (e.g., "Get angry," "Wish I could
change what happened") were more preoccupied with weight than women who
responded in a task-oriented style (e.g., "Outline my priorities,"
"Think about how I solved problems"; Denisoff & Endler, 2000). A
task-oriented approach may diminish stress and, therefore, reduce the
need to use food to control one's emotional state. A number of mental
disorders and features are comorbid with bulimia nervosa. Mood disorders
are common, and rates of seasonal affective disorder, a syndrome

Eating Disorders

451

characterized by depression during the dark winter months followed by
remission during the spring and summer months, are higher among those
with bulimia nervosa than in the general population (Lam et al., 2001).
Characteristics of borderline personality, such as impulsivity,
substance abuse, and affective instability, are also found in
individuals with bulimia nervosa, although many with this disorder show
little evidence of personality disturbances. There may be several
subtypes of bulimia nervosa with different etiologies (Wonderlich et
al., 2007). Interpreting the meaning of coexisting conditions is
difficult because characteristics such as depression and borderline
personality may precede the eating disorder or they may be the
consequence of the eating disorder. Course and Outcome Bulimia nervosa
has a somewhat later onset than anorexia nervosa, beginning in late
adolescence or early adult life. Outcome studies have shown a mixed
course, although the prognosis is more positive than for anorexia
nervosa. In a five-year community study of 102 participants with bulimia
nervosa, only a minority still met the criteria for the disorder at the
end of the study period. However, each year about one-third would remit,
and another one-third would relapse. Most continued to show disturbed
eating patterns and low self-esteem, and 40 percent met the criteria for
a major depressive disorder (Fairburn et al., 2000). Another five-year
study of individuals with bulimia nervosa reported a more positive
outcome. Almost three-fourths had no diagnosable eating disorder at the
end of the study (Ben-Tovim et al., 2001). The findings of a longer
follow-up study (ten years) also revealed generally positive outcomes.
About 70 percent were in either partial or full remission; 11 percent
met the full criteria for bulimia nervosa, 0.6 percent for anorexia
nervosa, and 18.5 percent for eating disorder not otherwise specified. A
history of substance use and a longer duration before treatment were
associated with a poorer outcome (Keel, Mitchell, Miller, Davis, & Crow,
1999).

Binge-Eating Disorder Case Study Ms. A was a thirty-eight-year-old
African American woman who was single, lived alone, and was employed as
a personnel manager ... she weighed 292 lb. ... Her chief reason for
coming to the clinic was that she felt her eating was out of control
and, as a result, she had gained approximately 80 lb over the previous
year. ... A typical binge episode consisted of the ingestion of two
pieces of chicken, one small bowl of salad, two servings of mashed
potatoes, one hamburger, one large serving of french fries, one large
chocolate shake, one large bag of potato chips, and 15 to 20 small
cookies---all within a 2-hour period ... she was embarrassed by how much
she was eating, and felt disgusted with herself and very guilty after
eating. (Goldfein, Devlin, & Spitzer, 2000, p. 1052)

Binge-eating disorder (BED) is a diagnostic category that has been
"provided for further study" in DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a). Further research will be conducted to determine
whether BED should be adopted as a distinct diagnostic category in
DSM-V. The disorder is similar to bulimia nervosa in that it involves
the consumption of large amounts of food over a short period of time, an
accompanying feeling of loss of control, and "marked distress" over
eating during the episodes. However, in BED, the episodes are not
generally followed by "the regular use of compensatory behaviors" such
as vomiting, excessive exercise, or fasting. As in the case of bulimia
nervosa, the individual with this disordered eating pattern eats large
amounts of food, is secretive about this activity, and may eat large
amounts even when not hungry. To be diagnosed with BED, an individual
must have a history of binge-eating episodes at least two days a week
for six months. Females are one and a half times more likely to have
this disorder than males; its lifetime prevalence rate is 3.5 percent in
women and 2.0 percent in men (Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007).
White women make up the vast majority of clinical cases, whereas in
community samples,

binge-eating disorder (BED)

an eating disorder that involves the consumption of large amounts of
food over a short period of time, an accompanying feeling of loss of
control, and distress over the excess eating without regular
inappropriate compensatory behavior.

the percentages of African American and white women with BED are roughly
equal (Wilfley et al., 2001). Differences have been found between
African American and white women with BED. The former are less likely to
have been treated for eating problems, are more likely to be obese, and
show lower levels of eating, weight concerns, and psychiatric distress
(Pike et al., 2001) (see Figure 16.1). American Indian women also appear
to be at higher risk for BED, with a 10 percent prevalence rate reported
in one study (Sherwood et al., 2000). Associated Characteristics In
contrast to those with bulimia nervosa, individuals suffering from
binge-eating disorder are likely to be overweight (Bull, 2004). It is
believed that BED is a contributor to the development of obesity in
vulnerable individuals (Yanovski, 2003). It is estimated that from 20 to
40 percent of individuals in weight-control programs have BED. The risk
factors associated with this disorder include adverse childhood
experiences, parental depression, vulnerability to obesity, and repeated
exposure to negative comments from family members about body shape,
weight, or eating (Fairburn et al., 1998; Wilfley, Wilson, & Agras,
2003). The binges are often preceded by poor mood, low alertness,
feelings of poor eating control, and cravings for sweets (Greeno, Wing,
& Shiffman, 2000; Hilbert & Tuschen-Caffier, 2007). The complications
from this disorder are due to medical conditions associated with
obesity, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol level, and Type 2
diabetes. People with BED are also likely to suffer from depression
(Hoffman, 1998; T. D. Wade, 2007). As with the other eating disorders,
comorbid features and mental disorders are associated with BED. In one
study comparing 162 individuals with BED with other psychiatric samples,
the lifetime rate for major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder, and avoidant personality disorder was higher among
those with BED. The presence of personality disorders was related to
more severe binge eating, and those with avoidant or
obsessive-compulsive personality disorders reported higher rates of
binge eating one year after treatment (Wilfley et al., 2000). (See Table
16.3 for questions you might ask to assess for an eating disorder.)
Course and Outcome The onset of binge-eating disorder is similar to that
of bulimia nervosa in that it typically begins in late adolescence or
early adulthood. The findings are mixed regarding the natural course of
BED in women. In one

Eating Disorders

sample, the average duration of the disorder was 14.4 years (Pope et
al., 2006). However, in another study, most individuals with BED made a
full recovery over a five-year period, even without treatment, with only
18 percent demonstrating an eating disorder of clinical severity versus
51 percent of the bulimia nervosa cohort. They also showed improved
self-esteem and higher social functioning. However, their weight
remained high, and 39 percent eventually met the criteria for obesity
(Fairburn et al., 2000).

Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Speciﬁed According to DSM-IV-TR (American
Psychiatric Association, 2000a), the category eating disorder not
otherwise specified (NOS) is for seriously disturbed eating patterns
that do not meet all the criteria for anorexia or bulimia nervosa. It
currently includes the proposed category of binge-eating disorder.
Examples of disordered eating that would fit in this category are
(American Psychiatric Association, 2000a): 1. A female who meets all the
criteria for anorexia nervosa but has regular menses. 2. An individual
who meets all the criteria for anorexia nervosa and has lost a
significant amount of weight but is in the normal weight range. 3. An
individual who engages in binge eating and compensatory activities less
than twice a week or who has engaged in these behaviors for less than
three months. 4. An individual of normal weight who uses compensatory
behaviors even after ingesting small amounts of food (vomiting after
eating a candy bar). 5. A person who chews or spits out large amounts of
food without ingesting the food. 6. A person with binge-eating disorder
(proposed category discussed earlier).

4.  Do you feel great distress regarding your binge eating? Note: These

    (American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). For anorexia nervosa, the
    individual's weight is less than 85 percent of the expected weight
    for age and height; for bulimia nervosa the binges must occur, on
    average, about twice a week for three months; and for binge eating
    the binges must occur, on average, at least two days a week for six
    months. If the full criteria for these disorders are not met and
    disturbed eating patterns exist, they may represent subclinical
    forms of the eating disorders or may be diagnosed as eating disorder
    not otherwise speciﬁed (NOS).

Eating disorder NOS, the diagnosis received by up to 60 percent of
individuals in eating disorders treatment programs (Andersen, Bowers, &
Watson, 2001; Dalle Grave & Calugi, 2007), is a problematic diagnostic
category. The category includes such a heterogeneous grouping of
symptoms that managed care companies often refuse to cover the
diagnosis. There have been proposals to include binge-eating disorder as
a separate diagnosis and to eliminate some of the restrictive criteria
for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Women with eating disorders
NOS have more weight and shape concerns, dietary restraints, and
depressive feelings than controls but less so than women with bulimia
nervosa (T. D. Wade, 2007).

C H A P T E R 1 6 • EATING DISORDERS

Etiology of Eating Disorders The etiology of eating disorders is
believed to be determined by biological, psychological, social, and
sociocultural factors (Becker, 2004; Tylka & Subich, 2004). Figure 16.2
presents the multipath model delineating some of the risk factors for
eating disorders. Usually, it is a combination of variables rather than
a single factor that produces an eating disorder, and this combination
may differ for specific individuals. In this section we present some of
the etiological factors involved.

Biological Dimension Genetic influences may contribute to eating
disorders, as disordered eating appears to run in families, especially
among female relatives (Hoffman, 1998; Steiger & Bruce, 2007). Strober
and colleagues (2000) examined the lifetime rates of full or partial
anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa among first-degree relatives of
patients with these eating disorders. The rate was compared with that of
relatives of matched, never-ill comparison participants. Support was
found for a genetic contribution to the disorders. Whereas anorexia
nervosa and bulimia nervosa were relatively rare among the relatives of
the never-ill group, these disorders occurred at significantly high
levels among the first-degree relatives of those with eating disorders.
Kendler, MacLean, and their associates (1991) examined identical and
fraternal twins to estimate the role of genetics in bulimia nervosa.
They reported concordance rates of 22.9 percent and 8.7 percent,
respectively, which suggested a modest genetic influence. Wade, Bulik,
Sullivan, Neale, and Kendler (2000) also believe that some common
genetic factors exist for binge eating and bulimia among female twins.
However, the genetic influences may be triggered by physical changes
such as puberty. In a sample of twins, heritability appeared to be low
among preadolescent teens but was substantial after reaching puberty.
This suggests that puberty may influence the expression of genes for
disordered eating (Klump et al., 2007). The genetic influence may
involve neurotransmitters or brain structures, such as the hypothalamus,
which are involved in eating behaviors. Current research has focused on
dopamine, which is thought to be the primary neurotransmitter

involved in the reinforcing effects of food. Low levels of dopamine are
responsible for the desire to consume more food, whereas increased
dopamine concentrations can result in a decrease in appetite. Some
studies have reported differences in the dopamine transporter gene
between individuals with eating disorders and healthy controls, with the
short allele of the gene being more prevalent among individuals with
eating disorders. The researchers (Shinohara et al., 2004) concluded
that there is an association between individuals with short or long
alleles in this gene and dopamine levels. People with lower levels of
dopamine may need greater quantities of food or other rewarding
substances, such as drugs, to obtain pleasure. The possible influence of
dopamine in eating disorders is being further investigated by examining
drugs that affect dopamine levels. For example, some stimulant
medications such as methylphenidate inhibit dopamine reuptake and appear
to decrease appetite (Epstein et al., 2007). Although dopamine seems
like a promising lead in explaining eating disorders, other
neurotransmitters and brain regions appear to be involved. Individuals
with anorexia nervosa presented with highly palpable foods showed
different activation pattern of the prefrontal region of the brain
compared with controls (Treasure, 2007). The participants with anorexia
nervosa also showed less salivation to food cues and reported a lower
preference for fat and sweet substances than did control participants.
Indeed, in the Epstein et al. (2007) study, some individuals with the
short allele of the dopamine gene tended to be ambivalent about eating,
whereas others without this genetic variation responded very strongly to
food. It is also possible that changes in eating patterns can alter the
amount of specific neurotransmitters in the brain. Although these
studies indicate the involvement of genetic and biological factors, more
research is needed to determine the precise relationship between genetic
factors, brain centers, neurotransmitters, and environmental influences.

Psychological Dimension Individuals with eating disorders often display
excess concern regarding body image, fragile or low self-esteem,
moderate levels of depression, and feelings of helplessness; they appear
to use food or weight control as a means of handling stress or anxieties
(Schwitzer et al., 2001; Walsh & Devlin, 1998). One anorexic woman
stated, "90 percent of you is miserable, and 90 percent of you is
depressed, but then there is 10 percent that has this satisfaction in
knowing that you weigh such a low weight and that you are getting
thinner" (Budd, 2007, p. 102). The element of control appears to provide
some satisfaction in dealing with stress. Alternately, binge eating as a
source of comfort can be used to counteract depression and other
negative emotions (Bergstrom & Neighbors, 2006). Dysfunctional beliefs
such as "I am a failure because I am fat" also accompany and help
maintain eating disorders (Waller et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2007).
Women with bulimia nervosa show more weight and shape concerns, dietary
restraint, lifetime major depression, and suicidality as compared with
those with eating disorders NOS (T. D. Wade, 2007). Individuals with
anorexia have been described as perfectionistic, obedient, good
students, excellent athletes, and model children. It is hypothesized
that people with eating disorders evaluate themselves according to
selfimposed personally demanding standards such as grades and
performance. Dieting and weight standards may be similarly imposed
(Bardone-Cone & Cass, 2007). Among African American women, body mass,
body dissatisfaction, and low selfesteem are related to bulimic symptoms
such as binge eating (Lester & Petrie, 1998; Talleyrand, 2006). For both
men and women, higher scores on characteristics such as passivity, low
self-esteem, dependence, and nonassertiveness are associated with higher
scores on disordered eating. Dieting may be used to demonstrate
self-control and improve self-esteem and body image (Budd, 2007; Lakkis,
Ricciardelli, & Williams, 1999). Another line of inquiry has interested
some researchers. Rates of affective disorders such as depression are
higher in the relatives of individuals with eating

Indian girls.

disorders compared with controls, and some investigators believe that
eating disorders represent an expression of an affective disorder
(Rutter, MacDonald, et al., 1990). Mood disorders often accompany eating
disorders. One interesting finding is that binge eating, purging, and
mood have been found to vary seasonally among patients with bulimia
nervosa (Blouin et al., 1992). The researchers hypothesize that, as
noted earlier, for some people, a relationship between bulimia and
seasonal affective disorder may exist. The cycle of bingeing and purging
may be associated with light availability. At this point, we still do
not know the precise relationship between affective disorders and eating
disorders. Some therapists believe that depression is the result, not
the cause, of anorexia or bulimia (Vanderlinden, Norre, & Vandereycken,
1992). Although it is widely believed that sexual abuse is a major
causal factor in eating disorders, several studies have failed to find
such a connection (Conners & Morse, 1993; Pope & Hudson, 1992; Pope et
al., 1994). Sexual abuse may be indirectly related to eating disorders
in that it produces body disparagement or bodily shame, which affects
body image (Tripp & Petrie, 2001). Individuals with eating disorders
judge themselves exclusively on their eating, shape, weight, or ability
to control these elements (Jones et al., 2007).

Social Dimension

IDEAL MALE BODIES? Most males prefer to be heavier and more muscular.
Will the exposure in the media of physically powerful men produce body
image distortion and dissatisfaction among men?

Interpersonal interaction patterns with parents and peers have also been
put forth as explanations for eating disorders. The early psychodynamic
formulation, which was based primarily on anorexia nervosa, hypothesized
the following family characteristics. The girl with the disorder has
problems with maturation. She is afraid of having to grow up, which
would lead to having to separate from her family and develop her own
identity. By staying thin and not menstruating, she fulfills the
unconscious desire to remain a child (Bruch, 1978; Halmi et al., 2000;
Sands, 2003). Unfortunately, the reported findings regarding
psychodynamic formulations are difficult to interpret. Most are based on
case studies or family systems theory or depend on the perception of
family members regarding their

Etiology of Eating Disorders

relationships---family patterns may be the result of dealing with an
eating disorder rather than the cause. Parents may become more
"controlling" in an attempt to force the person with the eating disorder
to gain weight or to establish a healthier eating pattern.
Interestingly, in one form of family therapy, the adolescent with
anorexia nervosa is seen as no longer capable of making sound choices
regarding his or her health; the therapist encourages this
responsibility to be temporarily taken over by the parents (Sim et al.,
2004). Few empirical studies involving the observation of families with
a member who has an eating disorder exist. We need to test the different
theories or observations to determine whether any of the actual or
perceived characteristics related to eating disorders are accurate. At
this point we do not know whether the described "family characteristics
should be considered cause, consequence, or means of coping with an
eating disorder" (Herzog et al., 2000, p. 360). Socialization agents
such as peers or family members can produce pressure to be thin by
engaging in criticism of weight, encouragement to diet, and the
glorification of ultra-slim models (Annus et al., 2007; Stice & Bearman,
2001). Perceived pressure from family, friends, dating partners, or the
media to have a slender figure has been associated with the
internalization of a thin ideal and feelings of depression. One woman
remembered her mother telling her to "suck in your gut" (Budd, 2007).
These messages result in body dissatisfaction and the view that "one
should be able to diet or exercise to lose weight"---in other words,
that obtaining a slim figure is under voluntary control. Later, eating
"too much," unsuccessful dieting, and guilt from purging or loss of
control contributes to depressive feelings. Being teased about weight is
also reported by women with eating disorders. A woman relayed that her
childhood nickname was "Checker." It was not until she was a teenager
that her mother told her the name came from Chubby Checker (Goldfein et
al., 2000). This revelation increased the young woman's sensitivity
about her weight. Teasing and criticism about body weight or shape by
family members has been found to predict ideal-body internalization,
body dissatisfaction, dieting, and eating problems (Vincent & McCabe,
2000). Other family and peer relationships are associated with eating
disorders. Peer relationships can either serve as a buffer against
eating disorders or produce pressure to lose weight. Girls exist in a
subculture in which thinness is emphasized and weight issues are
frequently discussed. Nearly 50 percent of adolescent girls in one study
reported being encouraged to lose weight by their mothers, friends, or
sisters (Mukai, 1996). Mothers who diet also indirectly transmit the
message of the importance of slimness and the thin ideal to their
daughters. Class differences have also been found. Adolescent girls from
higher socioeconomic status families had a greater awareness and
acceptance of societal ideals of slimness (Wardle et al., 2004). For
boys, peer and father encouragement to lose weight was related to more
severe disordered eating patterns. In general, it was the direct
influences of family and peers rather than the quality of these
relationships that predicted body dissatisfaction and disordered eating
in both adolescent boys and girls (Vincent & McCabe, 2000).

Sociocultural Dimension By far, the greatest amount of research has been
directed to sociocultural factors in the etiology of eating disorders
and the influence of unrealistic standards of beauty that are derived
from mass media portrayals. In the United States and most western
cultures, physical appearance is a very important attribute, especially
for females. The average American woman is five feet four inches tall
and weighs 162 pounds, but teenage girls describe their ideal body as
five feet seven inches, weighing 110 pounds, and fitting into a size
five dress. Although this ideal is far from the actual statistics for
body size among American women, it is consistent with the image
portrayed in mass media. It is estimated that only about 5 percent of
American women can achieve the size required for fashion models (Irving,
2001; see the height and weight table in Table 16.4).

C H A P T E R 1 6 • EATING DISORDERS

Women are socialized to be conscious of their body shape and weight. As
a result, many researchers believe that eating disorders result from the

females, which produces AND MEN (20 TO 74 YEARS) FOR 1980--2002 a
preoccupation with body image (Pelletier & Dion, 1980 1994 2000 2006;

over 60 percent reported trying to change their appearance to resemble

characteristic leads some people to interpret images of thinness in the
media as evidence of their own inadequacy? Are people who develop eating
disorders chronically self-conscious to begin with, or do they develop
eating disorders because agents in their social environment make them
chronically self-conscious? How does exposure to mass media portrayals
of thinness influence the values and norms of young people? The
development of disordered eating and preoccupation with body image may
involve multiple processes (Harrison, 2001; Tylka & Subich, 2004; see
Figure 16.3). A process of social comparison occurs in which women and
girls begin to evaluate themselves according to external standards.
Because these standards are unattainable for the vast majority of women,
body dissatisfaction occurs. This leads to a form of self-consciousness
from habitual monitoring of one's external appearance that leads to an
increase in anxiety or shame about the body. Dissatisfaction with one's
body leads to disturbed eating patterns and depression (Tiggemann &
Kuring, 2004). TA B L E

Etiology of Eating Disorders

Social comparison has been found to trigger negative reactions in women.
In one study, female restrained eaters and nonrestrained eaters
(classified based on degree of dietary restriction) read descriptions of
a peer described either as "thin," "average," or "overweight" and then
completed measures of self-evaluation. The restrained eaters showed more
negative self-perceptions in response to the description of a thin peer,
suggesting they may be more vulnerable to social comparison processes
that lead to body dissatisfaction and lower self-esteem (Trottier,
Polivy, & Herman, 2007). Although societal emphasis on thinness is
related to an increase in disordered eating, it is not a sufficient
explanation. Only a relatively small percentage of individuals in our
media-conscious society develop eating disorders. Protective variables
against the impact of media on body image include strong social bonds
and social support, personality variables such as self-determination and
autonomy, and viewing attractiveness as only one of many qualities that
are deemed important (Pelletier & Dion, 2006). Adolescent girls gave the
following reasons for dieting and concern over their bodies: mass media
(magazines, television, advertising, fashions), peer influences (wanting
to fit in), and criticisms by family members about their weight
(Wertheim et al., 1997). The beginning of dating and mixed-gender social
activities is also related to dieting and disordered eating, especially
for young women who have recently experienced menarche (Cauffman &
Steinberg, 1996). Unfortunately, high school and college females may not
be aware of the psychologically harmful effect of the superslim standard
for women. When asked to examine forty magazine ads and indicate which
ads featured potentially harmful female stereotypes, they picked out
ones that portray women as helpless or dumb, as sex objects, or as using
alcohol or cigarettes. They appeared to overlook the ultra-thin models,
possibly because they were accustomed to seeing this or have accepted it
as a social-cultural norm (Gustafson, Popovich, & Thomsen, 2001).

Did You Know? Do most women want to be ultra-thin? • Among overweight
and obese women, the amount of weight they would "ideally" like to lose
would still place them in the overweight category. • Women in the normal
weight range want to lose only a few pounds, not the amount needed to be
extremely thin. • Underweight women believe they are at the ideal
weight. This group may be most responsive to messages regarding
thinness. Source: Neighbors & Sobal (2007).

PLUS SIZE MODELS These women are wearing outﬁts made by Elena Miro for
larger sized women. More and more fashion designers are developing
attractive clothing lines for ordinary and plus size ﬁgures.

Body dissatisfaction was studied by Forbes, Adams-Curtis, Rade, and
Jaberg (2001). Both male and female college students were asked to

that asked "Do men find 'bony' women attractive?" males indicated a

than women thought men preferred (Bergstrom, Neighbors, & Lewis, 2004).
As noted in the beginning of the chapter, mass media portrayals of lean,
muscular male bodies are also increasing. For example, male centerfolds
displayed in Playgirl have become more muscular in recent times
(Bergstrom & Neighbors, 2006). There appears to be a gradual shift away
from traditional measures of masculinity that include wealth and power
to physical appearance. If this is true, there may be dramatic increases
in eating disorders among men in the near future. In fact, as noted
earlier, more cases of muscle dysphoria (dissatisfaction with one's
degree of muscularity) have been reported in men (Cafri et al., 2005;
Pope et al., 2001). The gay male subculture places a great deal of value
on physical attractiveness, resulting in more concern over body size and
appearance and a greater prevalence of disturbed eating patterns than
found among heterosexual males (Strong et al., 2000). Some studies
estimate that gay males constitute 30 percent of males with eating
disorders (Carlat, Camargo, & Herzog, 1997; Heffernan, 1994).
Subcultural influences on attractiveness are also apparent in the fact
that lesbians appear to be less concerned about physical appearance and
to have a better body image than other females (Boehmer, Bowen, & Bauer,
2007).

Ethnic Minorities and Eating Disorders Research has also been directed
to the influence of cultural standards and values on body
dissatisfaction and eating disorders among ethnic minorities. In a
meta-analysis of the impact of ethnicity and body dissatisfaction among
women in the United States, Grabe and Hyde (2006) came to the following
conclusions. First, body dissatisfaction is not just a problem among
white women; it also exists among ethnic minority women. Second,
Hispanic and Asian American women had levels of body dissatisfaction
equivalent to those of white women. Third, black women show body
dissatisfaction but at a lower level than all other comparison groups.
African American girls and women are more satisfied with their body
size, weight, and appearance than are white females, even though they
tend to be

Etiology of Eating Disorders

heavier than their white counterparts. They also have a lower level of
negative attitudes toward body size and weight and less motivation for
thinness (Gilbert, 2003; Lovejoy, 2001), and they are less distressed by
their weight gain and change in shape during pregnancy (Cameron et al.,
1996). Although some show dissatisfaction with their bodies and weight,
more African American college students report satisfaction with their
appearance, body size, and shape compared with their white peers
(Harris, 2006; Powell & Kahn, 1995). Similarly, findings from a national
survey of adolescents on dieting and disordered eating supports the view
that African American adolescent females appear to be less concerned
about their body size and shape than white adolescents (Neumark-Sztainer
et al., 2000). Ethnic comparisons suggest that dieting is lowest among
African American girls (37.6 percent) and highest among white girls
(51.3 percent). Disordered eating patterns (bingeing and purging) were
highest among Hispanic American girls (19.1 percent) and lowest among
African American girls (11.4 percent). Although the results may indicate
that African American girls appear to experience lower levels of body
dissatisfaction than girls from other ethnic groups, a substantial
percentage of them also diet and binge or purge (Story et al., 1998).
Table 16.5 compares some differences in body image and weight concerns
between African American and white women. Why is it that African
American women appear to be somewhat insulated from unrealistic
standards of thinness? It is possible that African American girls and
women are protected by several cultural factors. First, because they do
not identify with white women, media messages of thinness may have less
impact. Second, their definition of attractiveness is broad,
encompassing dress, personality, and confidence, and does not focus
solely on external characteristics such as body shape and weight.
Additionally, African American men are more willing than white men to
date heavier women (Powell & Kahn, 1995). Third, African American women
have characteristics such as being assertive and egalitarian in
relationships that allow them to have important roles in the community.
In this way, they are less influenced by gender-restrictive messages.
However, not all African American women are immune to majorityculture
messages. The prevalence of eating disorder NOS among African TA B L E

Is Our Society Creating Eating Disorders?

T

here appears to have been a dramatic increase in eating disorders over
the past twenty-ﬁve years, which is correlated with our society's
emphasis on thinness and attractiveness. As many as 64 percent of women
exhibit symptoms of eating disorders, and even more are dissatisﬁed with
their body shapes (National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and
Associated Disorders, 2004). What role has society played in eating
disorders, and why do they appear primarily in western societies? Eating
disorders are rare in China, Singapore, Malaysia, and Hong Kong (Marsh
et al., 2007; Tsai & Gray, 2000) and in other nonwestern cultures
(Bhadrinath, 1990; Miller & Pumariega, 2001). Other societies do not
place such emphasis on thinness. Some observers believe that eating
disorders are a culture-bound syndrome found only in western cultures.
Far fewer reports of eating disorders are found in Latin America, South
America, and Asia, whereas they appear to be high or increasing in
European countries, Israel, and Australia (Miller & Pumariega, 2001).
Countries or groups that have been exposed to western values show an
increasing concern over eating and body size (Becker, 2004; Steiger &
Bruce, 2007). Although the standard of beauty among women in

Did You Know?

T

hroughout history, the speciﬁc body weight of women has been less
important to males than a relatively curvy body. Men may be "hard wired"
to ﬁnd the hourglass ﬁgure in women attractive because of evolutionary
reasons---to have an intellectually superior child. Lassek and Gaulin
(2008) found that women with larger hip to waist ratio had offspring
with higher cognitive abilities. It is possible that fat stores in the
lower body may meet the special nutritional needs of the developing
brain of the fetus, especially during the third trimester (Lassek &
Gaulin, 2006).

South Africa is based on fuller ﬁgures, black teenage girls in this
region are drawn to western standards of thinness, resulting in a
dramatic increase in eating disorders among this group (Simmons, 2002).
Asian female adolescents born in Britain also have concerns over body
shape and eating (Hill & Bhatti, 1995). Among Pakistani adolescent
girls, those who were the most exposed to western culture had the
highest rates of abnormal eating attitudes (Mumford, Whitehouse, &
Choudry, 1992). As psychologists, we are interested in the etiology of
problems. Is the "pursuit of thinness" a culture-bound phenomenon? Do
contemporary women gain status or identity through their physical
appearance? Why have western cultures been so susceptible to eating
disorders? The women's movement stressed the importance of ability over
appearance. With the greater freedom and power that women have gained,
why is there an increase in the importance of appearance? If society
continues to equate desirable characteristics with thinness, how can we
change this message? In the mass media, we are beginning to see more
focus on physical attractiveness in males. Will this result in a
dramatic increase in eating disorders among men?

American women appears to be equivalent to that found in white American
women (Mulholland & Mintz, 2001). And although fewer African American
women appear to have either anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, they
are as likely as other groups of women to have binge-eating disorder
(Lovejoy, 2001; Striegel-Moore et al., 2003). As with white American
women, self-esteem and body dissatisfaction among African American women
is related to bulimic symptoms. This relationship is greatest among
those who have internalized U.S. societal values concerning
attractiveness (Grabe & Hyde, 2006; Lester & Petrie, 1998). In a study
of African American and white women with or without binge-eating
disorder, certain differences were found (Pike et al., 2001). African
American women had higher body weight than white women and had fewer
weight and shape concerns, regardless of whether they had the disorder.
Among those with binge-eating disorder, African Americans had
significantly lower scores on eating concerns, dietary restraints, and
shape and weight concerns. Thus African American women with binge-eating
disorder differed in certain eating disorder characteristics from their
white counterparts. The drive for thinness may be less an etiological
factor for African Americans than it is for white Americans. Among
Hispanic American female college students, weight and adherence to
mainstream values were positively related to bulimic symptoms (Lester &
Petrie, 1998). Some studies show that American Indian, Asian American,
and Hispanic American girls show greater body image dissatisfaction than
white females, possibly due to attempts to fit into the societal
definition of beauty (Gilbert, 2003). Thus it appears that ethnic
minorities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to societal messages
regarding attractiveness and may be at especially high risk for
developing eating disorders, as a greater percentage of ethnic minority
children and adults, especially females, are overweight (Ogden et al.,
2004). Cross-Cultural Studies on Eating Disorders Cultural values and
norms also affect views on body shape and size. Eating often plays a
role in family gatherings

and socialization. Weight normalcy is influenced by cultural beliefs and
practices. For example, Micronesians view thinness as a sign of illness.
As one parent responded, "The culture on Saipan, the fat one is the
healthy one . . . but when they are skinny, 'Oh, my goodness, nobody is
feeding that child'" (Bruss, Morris, & Dannison, 2003). Historically,
eating disorders in Chinese populations have been rare because plumpness
in females has been considered desirable and attractive. Feeding is an
extension of love and care of parents toward their children. However,
the obesity rate is low and may also result from the cultural value of
moderation. Interestingly, in a recent study in Hong Kong, adolescent
girls picked an ideal female body size that was somewhat larger than
that preferred by boys (Marsh et al., 2007). This finding is in contrast
to studies cited earlier in which American girls and women choose ideal
body sizes that were thinner than those preferred by males. What happens
when other cultures are exposed to western standards of beauty? Becker
(2004) reported on the impact of television on adolescent girls living
in a rural community in Western Fiji. Traditional cultural norms support
robust appetites and body sizes. Food and feasts are considered to be
important contributors to social exchange, and plump bodies are
considered to be aesthetically pleasing. In interviews of girls after
three years of exposure to western television programs, comments
revealed admiration for western standards: "The actresses and all those
girls, especially those European girls, I just like, I just admire them
and want to be like them. I want their body, I want their size"
(p. 546). The girls also paid attention to TV commercials advertising
exercise equipment, which portrayed the ease in which weight could be
lost. "When they show exercising on TV . . . I feel I should . . . lose
my weight" (p. 542). Becker attributes the strong impact of television
on the values of the girls to the rapid social and economic changes in
Fiji, a country that went from subsistence to a cash economy with a
related rise in consumerism. Although eating disorder increases in
developing countries have been associated with rapid transitions in
global market economies and heavy media exposure, Anderson-Fye (2004)
found that in San Andres, Belize, body size and shape preferences have
not changed because of exposure to western media. In Belize, there is
high level of contact with U.S. citizens via tourism. There is also a
long history of beauty pageants in Belize. However, girls and women
appear to eat freely and show minimum concern with their bodies. They
have a broad definition regarding BEAUTY STANDARDS African American
females have a greater acceptance of heavier body sizes than white
women. In addition, they adopt a broader deﬁnition of beauty that
includes attitude, personality, and "style."

464

C H A P T E R 1 6 • EATING DISORDERS

beauty that involves dress, hairstyle, makeup, and personality. It is
believed that adorning oneself "properly" can make nearly any female
"beautiful." Girls from different socioeconomic classes, ethnicity, and
body shapes have participated in and won pageants. Among the girls, the
shapes preferred by boys are the "Coca-Cola" (hourglass) or "Fanta"
(smaller on top and bigger on the bottom). The least preferred shape is
the "straight shape." Eating disorders are rare in Belize. It remains to
be seen whether the cultural norms and values will continue to protect
against eating disorders.

Treatment of Eating Disorders Prevention programs have been developed in
schools to reduce the incidence of eating disorders and disordered
eating patterns. A school-based group intervention program was developed
for adolescent girls who were showing some problems with eating, body
image, and self-esteem (Daigneault, 2000). The goals for the girls
involved (1) learning to develop a more positive attitude toward their
bodies, (2) becoming aware of societal messages of "what it means to be
female," (3) developing healthier eating and exercise habits, (4)
increasing their comfort in expressing their feelings to peers, family
members, and significant others, (5) developing healthy strategies to
deal with stress and pressures, and (6) increasing assertiveness skills.
These points were addressed through group discussions and the use of
videos, magazines, and examples from mass media. Similarly, Sands (1998)
believes that the social context of eating disorders needs to be
acknowledged in any type of treatment. She recommends including a gender
analysis by identifying sex role messages such as "girls must be thin,
pretty, and sexy," identifying the consequences of the gender-related
messages ("I'm going to starve myself to be thin"), choosing a statement
of change and implementing it ("Being healthy is important to me so I
will eat and exercise sensibly"), and developing assertiveness skills to
combat patterns of helplessness and submissiveness. Both of these
approaches focus on teaching girls and women to reexamine the
consequences of gender messages and on the necessity of institutional
awareness of the problem. These elements have been included in most of
the treatments for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating
disorder. Programs that are the most effective are those that involve an
interactive rather than a lecturing format, are designed specifically
for women, and that include multiple sessions (Stice & Shaw, 2004).

Treating Anorexia Nervosa Case Study A female undergoing treatment for
anorexia nervosa---who was 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighed 81 pounds
and still felt fat---reported, "I did gain 25 pounds, the target weight
of my therapist and nutritionist. But every day was really difﬁcult. I
would go and cry. A big part of anorexia is fear. Fear of fat, fear of
eating. But (my therapist) taught me about societal pressures to be
ultra-thin comes from the media, TV, advertising. . . . She talked me
through what I was thinking and how I had completely dissociated my mind
from my body. . . . I'm slowly reintroducing foods one thing at a time.
I'd like to think I am completely better, but I'm not. I'm still
extremely self-conscious about my appearance. But I now know I have a
problem and my family and I are ﬁnding ways to cope with it." (Bryant,
2001, p. B4)

As you have seen, eating disorders, especially anorexia nervosa, can be
life threatening. Treatment for anorexia nervosa can be delivered on
either an outpatient or an inpatient basis, depending on the weight and
health of the individual. Developing a therapeutic alliance through the
use of empathy, positive regard, and support is vital because readiness
for change is an important predictor of successful treatment (McHugh,
2007). Because it is a complex disorder, there is a need for teamwork

Treatment of Eating Disorders

between physicians, psychiatrists, and psychotherapists. The order of
treatment is as follows (American Psychiatric Association, 2006): 1.
Restoration of a healthy weight. For females, this involves the return
of menses and ovulation; for males, the return of normal sexual drive
and hormone levels. 2. Treatment of physical complications. These
include symptoms related to starvation and also physiological reactions
during refeeding. 3. Enhancement of motivation to participate in the
treatment program. 4. Psychoeducation about healthy eating patterns and
nutrition. 5. Identification of attitudes, dysfunctional thoughts and
beliefs, conflicts, and feelings that underlie the eating disorder. 6.
Provision of psychotherapy to deal with emotional disturbances related
to eating. 7. Mobilization of family support and use of family therapy,
when appropriate. 8. Relapse prevention. Because the individual is
starving, the initial goal is to restore weight, a process carefully
coordinated with psychological support. During the refeeding process,
the patient's feelings of apathy may begin to fade. Typically, the
individual with anorexia nervosa will become terrified of gaining weight
and need the opportunity to discuss her or his reactions. During the
weight restoration period, new foods are introduced, because the
individual's choices are often not sufficiently high in calories. The
physical condition of the person has to be carefully monitored because
sudden and severe physiological reactions can occur during refeeding. A
dental exam is often conducted to assess for damage from purging.
Psychological interventions are used to help the patient (1) understand
and cooperate with nutritional and physical rehabilitation, (2) identify
and understand the dysfunctional attitudes related to the eating
disorder, (3) improve interpersonal and social functioning, and (4)
address comorbid psychopathology and psychological conflicts that
reinforce eating-disorder behavior (American Dietetic Association, 2001;
American Psychiatric Association, 2006; Walsh & Devlin, 1998). The
behavioral approach is designed to correct irrational preoccupation with
weight and to encourage weight gain through the use of such positive
reinforcers as telephone privileges, visits from family and friends,
mail, and access to street clothes. The particular reinforcers used to
reward weight gain depend, of course, on the likes and dislikes of the
patient. Weight-gain plans are generally aimed at increases of about two
pounds per week (Wilson & Shafran, 2005). Once the patient has gained
sufficient weight to become an outpatient, family therapy sessions may
be implemented. Experience has shown that this approach helps maintain
the treatment gains achieved in the hospital. Although antidepressants
may be helpful in treating the depressive feelings in anorexia nervosa,
they were not any more useful than a placebo in preventing relapse in
patients who had achieved a healthy weight during therapy (Walsh et al.,
2006). Family therapy is often an important component of the treatment
plan. The family of an eighteen-year-old girl who was unsuccessfully
treated by inpatient treatment, dietary training, and
cognitive-behavioral therapy was enlisted to participate in a new form
of family therapy. The therapy involved (1) having the parents help
refeed the adolescent through the planning of meals, (2) reducing
parental criticism by understanding anorexia nervosa as a serious
disease, (3) negotiating a new pattern of family relationships, and (4)
assisting the family with the developmental process of separation and
individuation. Parents were encouraged to understand and help their
daughter develop the skills, attitudes, and activities appropriate to
her developmental stage. This form of family therapy resulted in the
girl's gaining over twenty-two pounds (Sim et al., 2004). Overall,
family therapy has been found to be modestly successful in treating
anorexia nervosa (Halvorsen & Heyerdahl, 2007).

C H A P T E R 1 6 • EATING DISORDERS

Treating Bulimia Nervosa In bulimia nervosa, treatment goals include (1)
reducing or eliminating binge eating and purging; (2) treating any
physical complications; (3) motivating the client to participate in the
restoration of healthy eating patterns; (4) providing psychoeducation
regarding nutrition and eating; (5) identifying dysfunctional thoughts,
moods, and conflicts that are associated with eating; (6) providing
psychotherapy to deal with these issues; (7) obtaining family support
and conducting family therapy, if needed; and (8) preventing relapse
(American Psychiatric Association, 2006). During the initial assessment
of patients with bulimia nervosa, conditions that might contribute to
purging, such as esophageal reflux disease, should be identified.
Physical conditions resulting from purging include muscle weakness,
cardiac arrhythmias, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance, as well as
gastrointestinal problems involving the stomach or esophagus. In many
patients, dental erosion can be quite serious. As with anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa should involve an interdisciplinary team that includes a
physician and psychotherapist. One important goal in treatment is to
normalize the eating pattern and to eliminate the binge/purge cycle. A
routine of eating three meals a day with one to three snacks a day is
used to break up the disordered eating pattern. Cognitive-behavioral
therapy and the use of antidepressant medication such as selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been helpful in treating this
condition (American Psychiatric Association, 2000b, 2006; Wilson &
Shafran, 2005). Cognitive-behavioral approaches have also been effective
in helping individuals with bulimia and binge-eating disorder develop a
sense of self-control (Parrott, 1998). Common components of
cognitive-behavioral treatment plans involve encouraging the consumption
of three or more balanced meals a day, reducing rigid food rules and
body image concerns, and developing coping strategies. This approach was
as successful as antidepressant medication in treating bulimia nervosa,
although combined treatment was the most effective (Agras et al., 1992).
Even with these approaches, only about 50 percent of those with the
disorder fully recover. Characteristics associated with treatment
failure include poorer social adjustment and a reduction in purging of
less than 70 percent by the sixth treatment session. For these
individuals, different treatment strategies may be required (Agras et
al., 2000). Other approaches have demonstrated some promise. Twenty-two
adolescent patients with bulimia nervosa who did not respond to
cognitive-behavioral treatment were given twelve sessions of cue
exposure. This approach is based on the classical conditioning model in
which the craving response was extinguished in the presence of food.
During each of the sessions, patients were exposed to attractive food
and allowed to touch it, raise it to their mouths, and smell it but not
actually eat it. This routine was to be performed even if the patient
developed a great deal of anxiety. The program resulted in significant
reduction in bingeing and purging behaviors (Martinez-Mallen et al.,
2007). One family-based treatment that has been moderately successful
empowers parents to disrupt binge eating, purging, and pathological
weight control measures until their adolescent can successfully assume
responsibility for healthy eating (Levine & Mishna, 2007).

Treating Binge-Eating Disorder Treatments for binge-eating disorder are
similar to those for bulimia nervosa, although binge-eating disorder
presents fewer physical complications because of the lack of purging.
Individuals with binge-eating disorder do differ in some ways from those
with bulimia nervosa. Most are overweight and have to deal with
prejudices toward overweight individuals. Due to the health consequences
of excess weight, some therapy programs also focus on healthy approaches
to weight loss. In general, treatment follows two phases (Ricca et al.,
2000; Shelley-Ummenhofer & MacMillan, 2007). First, cognitive factors
underlying the eating disorder are determined. The clients also are
taught to use strategies that reduce eating binges. One patient, Mrs. A,
had very rigid rules concerning eating that, when violated,

Obesity

would result in her "going the whole nine yards." Two types of triggers
were identified for binges---emotional distress (anger, anxiety,
sadness, or frustration) and work stress (long hours, deadlines).
Interventions were applied to help her develop more flexible rules
regarding eating and to deal with her stressors. In many of these
programs, body weight is recorded weekly, and a healthy pattern of three
meals and two snacks a day is implemented. Food diaries may be utilized
to determine type and amount of the food consumed and the psychological
states preceding eating. Information about obesity, proper nutrition,
and physical exercise is provided. These steps make up the first part of
the program. Second, cognitive strategies are employed to change
distorted beliefs about eating. The client is asked to prepare a list of
"forbidden" foods and to rank them in order of "dangerousness."
Gradually, the foods are introduced into normal eating, first beginning
with those perceived as being less dangerous. The clients are asked to
observe their own bodies in a mirror CHILDHOOD OBESITY Childhood obesity

asked to observe attractive individuals with a larger body size to help
them consider positive qualities other than focusing on the body. After
performing this "homework," Mrs. A discovered that overweight women can
look attractive, and she began to buy more fashionable clothes for
herself. She was astonished at the positive reactions and comments from
friends and coworkers. Although she had lost twelve pounds, she
attributed the attention to her confidence and improved body image
(Goldfein et al., 2000). Cognitive-behavioral therapy can produce
significant reductions in binge eating but is less successful in
reducing weight (Shelley-Ummenhofer & MacMillan, 2007; Wonderlich et
al., 2003). Few treatment programs have been developed specifically for
eating disorder NOS because of the heterogeneous disorders it
encompasses.

Obesity Case Study When I'm uptight, I often overeat. I know that I
often use food to calm me when I'm upset and even ﬁnd myself feeling
that when things don't go my way, I'll just have my way by eating
anything and all I want. Like an alcoholic who can't stop drinking once
he or she starts, I don't seem to be able to stop myself from eating
once I start. (LeCrone, 2007, p. 1)

Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI)---an estimate of body fat
calculated on the basis of a person's height and weight---greater than
30. DSM-IV-TR acknowledges eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia
as mental disorders with serious adverse outcomes but does not recognize
obesity despite its devastating medical and psychological consequences
(Volkow & O'Brien, 2007). Whether obesity will eventually be included in
DSM-V is still a matter of conjecture.

Obesity stems from many causes, including genetic and biological
factors, our sedentary modern-day lifestyle, easy access to attractive,
high-calorie foods, and the disturbed eating patterns seen in eating
disorders. In one study, the majority of obese women surveyed had
engaged in binge eating (Bulik & ReichbornKjennerud, 2003). Obesity is a
condition that is often accompanied by depression and anxiety disorders,
low self-esteem, poor body image, and unhealthy eating patterns (Eddy et
al., 2007). Obesity is second only to tobacco use in terms of being a
preventable cause of disease and death. Being overweight or obese
increases the risk of high cholesterol or triglyceride levels, Type 2
diabetes, cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease,
osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, and respiratory problems (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention \[CDC\], 2007c). Obesity also results in
annual health care costs of up to \$100 billion dollars a year
(Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn, & Wang, 2004) and a reduction of life
expectancy of between five and twenty years (Fontaine et al., 2003).
Being overweight or obese in childhood is related to an increased risk
of coronary heart disease in adulthood (Baker, Olsen, & Sorenson, 2007).
Some researchers believe that forms of obesity that are characterized by
an excessive drive for food should be recognized in DSM-V as a "food
addiction" (Volkow & O'Brien, 2007). Some of the characteristics that
they believe are similar to substance dependence include: • Development
of tolerance---the need to increase the amount consumed to maintain
satiety • Withdrawal symptoms such as distress or dysphoria when dieting
• Larger amount of food ingested than intended • Great deal of time
spent thinking about or consuming food • Overeating despite attempts to
curtail the amount consumed • Overeating despite adverse physical and
psychological consequences

According to BMI standards, 66.3 percent of American adults are either
overweight or obese (32.2 percent are obese), and 16 percent of children
and adolescents are either overweight or obese. (See Figure 16.5 on
increase in obesity from 1995 to 2005.) The prevalence of overweight and

proportions in developed nations and is a strong risk factor for adult
obesity (Singhal, Schwenk, & Kumar, 2007).

Etiology of Obesity

469

Etiology of Obesity Obesity is a product of biological/genetic,
psychological, social, and sociocultural influences, as shown in Figure
16.6. How these dimensions interact is still being investigated. For
example, one theory, termed the "thrifty genotype" hypothesis, includes
the roles of both genetics and the environment in accounting for the
rapid rise in obesity. According to this perspective, humans inherited
genes that helped our ancestors survive famines by storing fat. The same
gene, however, may be dysfunctional in an environment in which high-fat
foods are now plentiful (CDC, 2007c). Although "thrifty" genes and
access to foods can account for some cases of obesity, other factors
must be involved, because rates of obesity also vary according to
variables such as class, gender, and race/ethnicity.

Biological Dimension Estimates regarding genetic contributions to
obesity generally are derived by determining the frequency of obesity
among family members and twins. Others have investigated specific
genetic variations among the obese. Genes can influence eating behaviors
through brain structures and neurochemistry. The hypothalamus and
hormones such as leptin regulate food consumption and appetite and have
been implicated in obesity. Other brain regions, such as the cortex,
amygdala, and dopamine-sensitive nuclei, are involved in both the
inhibitory and motivational processes involved in food consumption
(Volkow & O'Brien, 2007). Scientists have begun to focus specifically on
the influence of dopamine as it affects food palatability. Epstein and
colleagues (2007) found that about 50 percent of people carry a gene
variation affecting dopaminergic activity---a gene that appears to
increase pleasure in eating. This gene is also associated with
addictions such as gambling and the abuse of alcohol and other
substances. In their study, obese individuals with this genotype worked
harder to be able to get food as a reward. It is hypothesized that
individuals with this genetic variation may have to take in more of a
substance to achieve the same level of satisfaction or reward as those
without this variation. The importance of dopamine has been found in
several other studies. Obese individuals were found to have fewer
dopamine receptors than those of normal weight, and this decrease was
proportional to their BMI (Wang et al., 2001). Similar findings

extra pounds. (Associated Press, 2007) Underweight \<19.1 \<20.7 \<18.5

In the year 1998, changes were made in the BMI's diagnostic thresholds.
The BMI scores were lowered for all weight classes. A consequence of the
lowering of the diagnostic thresholds was to raise the prevalence of
individuals considered "overweight" or "obese." For example the cutoff
score for the category of "overweight" was lowered from 27 to 25. This
resulted in 29 million Americans being added to the overweight category,
a 42 percent increase. Although it was hoped that this move would allow
for early treatment and disease prevention, will such a move take away
limited resources from those with severe weight issues? In addition,
what are the implications for those who now bear the stigma of being
"overweight" or "obese" (Schwartz & Woloshin, 1999)? Is the change in
BMI standards justiﬁed? One study of 2.3 million American adults found
that although both obesity and being underweight were related to
increased mortality, such an association did not exist for being up to
twenty-ﬁve pounds overweight. In fact, the death rate for those who were
"overweight" was lower than that for other weight groups (Flegal et al.,
2007). As we mentioned earlier, the BMI standards have changed. Present
BMI standards are the same for men and women, whereas

Using the newer standards, a man who is 5'10" and weighs 175 pounds has

classiﬁed as overweight. For Further Consideration 1. Are the current

regarding dopamine receptors were found among genetically lean and obese
rats (Thanos et al., 2008). It is not clear, however, whether reduced
dopamine receptor levels are the cause or effect of obesity. It is
possible that overeating may produce lower receptor levels or that those
with genetically low receptor levels may be predisposed to overeat. In
the Thanos et al. study (2008), restricting food intake in rats caused
an increase in dopamine receptors. Also, in the Epstein and colleagues
(2007) study, many individuals with the genetic variation associated
with obesity did not become overweight, and some without the genetic
variation became obese. Clearly, additional factors are involved in the
etiology of obesity.

Psychological Dimension Individuals who are obese report negative mood
states and poor self-esteem. These responses are likely affected by the
weight stigma that exists in society with the resultant harassment,
teasing, and discrimination in school, work, and hiring practices
(Obesity Action Coalition, 2007). The stigmatization faced by obese
children from peers, parents, and teachers is pervasive and often
unrelenting (Puhl & Latner, 2007). Among a

Treatments for Obesity

471

sample of 122 overweight youths, many reported being teased about their
weight, as well as suffering from mood and anxiety disorder, and having
a thin-ideal internalization; more than one-third had engaged in recent
binge eating (Eddy et al., 2007). It is not clear whether negative mood
states are the cause of being overweight, but it is easy to imagine how
they can be the result of societal responses to excess weight.

Social Dimension Family environments have also been associated with
overweight and obese children and adolescents, including reports of
teasing by family members about weight issues (Eddy et al., 2007).
Parental eating patterns and attitudes influence food intake in children
(Bruss et al., 2003). In families in which a positive mealtime
atmosphere was reported, adolescents were less likely to engage in
disordered eating (Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2004), although parental
encouragement to diet affected mealtime atmosphere in a negative manner
(Fulkerson et al., 2007). In an interesting study, Christakis and Fowler
(2007) followed the social networks of 12,067 adults over a period of
thirty-two years to determine social factors associated with obesity.
They wanted to see whether friends, siblings, spouses, or neighbors had
an impact on weight gain. Some of the findings were quite surprising. If
someone a person considers to be a friend becomes obese, a person's
chances of also becoming obese increased by 57 percent. (In the case in
which two individuals considered each other as friends, the chances
increased by 171 percent.) Geographic distance between friends was not a
factor, so the effect involves more than just proximity. The chances for
obesity in an individual also increased when one of the following
individuals became obese: adult sibling: 40 percent; spouse: 37 percent;
neighbors: 0 percent (unless they were also friends). The researchers
hypothesize that weight gains in others in the social network changed
the norms or acceptability of being overweight for these individuals.

Sociocultural Dimension Attitudes regarding food and weight normalcy are
developed in the home and community. Rates of obesity tend to be highest
among ethnic minorities. In many ethnic groups, there is less pressure
to remain thin, and being overweight is not a big concern unless it is
extreme. As noted earlier, among African Americans, there is greater
acceptance of fuller figures, and a larger derriere in women is seen as
desirable (Foster-Scott, 2007). Rates of obesity also tend to be higher
among lower social class individuals and may be a product of limited
availability of fruits, vegetables, low-fat food, and opportunities for
exercise in poorer neighborhoods (Peralta, 2003). Advertising of
high-calorie foods is also seen by some to be a contributor to obesity.
Food advertising to children in both Sweden and Quebec was banned more
than ten years ago. However, neither region showed any benefit from this
action; the childhood obesity rate increased in a manner similar to that
of other areas (Adamson & Zywicki, 2007).

Treatments for Obesity Treatments for obesity have included dieting,
lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery. In general, dieting in and
of itself may produce short-term weight loss but tends to be ineffective
long term; some individuals gain back more weight than was lost. Mann
and colleagues (2007) concluded that most would be better off not
dieting because of the stress on the body as a result of weight cycling.
Indeed, the "yo-yo" effect in dieting (cycles of weight gain and loss)
has been found to be related to an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease, stroke, and altered immune functioning. Comprehensive programs
appear to be somewhat more promising. In a metaanalysis of studies
incorporating "rigorous randomized trials" of obesity treatments that
have included a minimum of two years of follow-up, Powell, Calvin, and
Calvin (2007) reported the following conclusions: 1. Lifestyle
interventions (low-calorie diets and exercise) were successful in
producing moderate and sustained reductions in weight. This modest
weight loss was associated with a reduction in Type 2 diabetes, blood
pressure, and overall mortality rate.

2.  Drug treatments such as the use of Orlistat, which blocks the
    gastrointestinal uptake of about 30 percent of ingested fat,
    resulted in a sustainable weigh loss of about seven pounds.
3.  Gastric bypass surgery for individuals who are morbidly obese (BMI
    greater or equal to 35) or obese with serious comorbid disease
    resulted in a weight loss of about fifty to eighty pounds for about
    70 percent of the patients. In one trial, over a period of five
    years, 45 percent had sustained only a twenty-two-pound loss. It
    appears that following surgical intervention, it is not unusual for
    weight gain to occur after the initial period of rapid weight loss.
    Thus comprehensive interventions that combine lifestyle changes with
    drugs and/or surgery appear to be most beneficial in sustaining
    weight loss.

I M P L I C AT I O N S

Eating disorders and obesity are a heterogeneous group of disorders.
Scientists are only recently focusing on how genetics influences
neurochemistry. Most of the research has been done with anorexia nervosa
and obesity on dopaminergic activity that affects both a lack of
appetite and overeating. However, we must be aware that, in some cases,
the behavior of overeating or not eating may, in fact, result in changes
in the level of dopamine in certain areas of the brain. Also, some
individuals may have an eating disorder or problem even without evidence
of biological predisposition. Thus it is important to consider
psychological, social, and sociocultural dimensions that may also be
involved. Eating disorders have become more prevalent as media provides
thin models as the standard of beauty for women. Among men, body
dissatisfaction is also increasing due to portrayals of muscular men in
advertising, television, and movies. Because of a broader definition of
beauty and the greater cultural acceptance of increased weight among
African Americans, there is somewhat less body dissatisfaction within
this group. Thus the topic of eating disorders and obesity is complex
and is best understood using the multipath model and rejecting any
single dimensional explanation.

Summary 1. What kinds of eating disorders exist? ■ Individuals with
anorexia nervosa suffer from body image distortion. They weigh less than
85 percent of their expected weight and suffer from effects of
starvation but are still deathly afraid of getting fat. ■ An individual
with bulimia nervosa is generally of normal weight, engages in binge
eating, feels a loss of control over eating during these periods, and
uses vomiting, exercise, or laxatives to attempt to control weight. Some
people with anorexia nervosa also engage in binge/purge eating but weigh
less than 85 percent of their expected weight. ■ Although many people
have engaged in binge eating,

the diagnosis for the disorder is given only when the individual has
regularly recurrent episodes in which she or he feels a loss of control
over eating and shows marked distress about the activity. ■ Individuals
who show atypical patterns of severely disordered eating that do not
fully meet the criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or
binge-eating disorder are given the diagnosis of eating disorder not
otherwise specified. Currently, binge-eating disorders are subsumed
under this category.

2.  What are some causes of eating disorders? ■ Genetics

and neurotransmitter abnormalities are implicated in eating disorders.
Research currently is focusing on the role of dopamine in eating
disorders.

■ It is believed that the societal emphasis on thinness

as being attractive may contribute to the increasing incidence of eating
disorder. This is believed to lead to an internalized thin ideal that
girls and women aspire to achieve. ■ Parental attitudes regarding the
importance of thin-

ness are implicated in eating disorders, as is teasing regarding weight,
especially among children with low self-esteem or with childhood trauma.
■ Countries

that are influenced by western standards also report an increased
incidence of eating disorders in women.

3.  What are some treatment options for eating disorders? ■ Many of the
    therapies attempt to teach clients to identify the impact of
    societal messages regarding thinness and encourage them to develop
    healthier goals and values.

Summary ■ For

individuals with anorexia nervosa, medical, as well as psychological,
treatment is necessary because the body is in starvation mode. The goal
is to help clients gain weight, normalize their eating patterns,
understand and alter their thoughts related to body image, and develop
more healthy methods of dealing with stress.

4.  What is obesity, and should it be included in DSM-V? ■ Obesity is
    defined as having a body mass index greater than 30. Some
    researchers believe that obesity should be included because it has

n June 30, 2001, Andrea Yates waited until her husband left for work,
ﬁlled the bathtub to the very top, and proceeded to kill her ﬁve
children, whose ages ranged from seven months to seven years. She
systematically drowned each child in the bathtub, carried them to a
bedroom, laid them out next to one another, and covered them with a
sheet. The ﬁfth child to be killed was left ﬂoating in the water. Yates
then called 911 and asked for the police. She called her husband next
and stated "You need to come home. . . . It's time. I did it." When
asked what she meant, Yates responded "It's the children . . . all of
them." When the police arrived and discovered the bodies, Yates was
drenched in water, offered no resistance, and in a calm manner explained
how she had killed her ﬁve young children. Police report that the
children had struggled vigorously as the mother held each under the
water until they drowned. The case of Andrea Yates shocked the nation.
How could a mother possibly commit such an unthinkable deed? Although
ﬁlicides (killing one's own child or children) are often reported in the
news media, this one was especially heinous because it involved ﬁve
children and was carried out in such a methodical manner. During Yates's
trial in 2002, the prosecution asked for the death penalty, but the
defense contended that she was psychotic, suffering from postpartum
depression, insane, and should not be held accountable for her actions.
The jury, however, found her guilty. The verdict was subsequently
overturned by an appeals court, and on July 26, 2006, another Texas jury
found her not guilty by reason of insanity. Questions: What criteria are
used to determine sanity and insanity? Is being mentally ill the same as
being insane? On July 24, 1998, Russell Weston, Jr., carried a concealed
gun into the nation's Capitol building as literally hundreds of tourists
crowded through the security machines. Setting off an alarm as he passed
through, Weston was confronted by Capitol guards

and exchanged volleys of gunﬁre with them. Tourists ran panic stricken
throughout the hallways as Weston killed two police ofﬁcers and wounded
a tourist. Weston was subsequently captured, arrested, and charged with
murder. Prosecutors offered no motive for the killings, but family
members testiﬁed that Weston had a twenty-year history of mental
illness, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, and believed government
agents were out to get him. A government psychiatrist concluded that
Weston "suffers from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally
incapable of assisting in his defense" and that he should be
hospitalized indeﬁnitely until he was capable of understanding the
proceedings. To improve his condition and render him competent,
psychiatrists attempted to administer antipsychotic drugs. When consent
forms for the medication were presented to Weston, he refused to sign.
His attorneys successfully fought for his right to refuse treatment
until January 2002, when a judge allowed forced medication of Weston.
However, as of 2007, Weston still has not been tried for the murders of
two Capitol police ofﬁcers. Questions: Is being insane at the commission
of a crime different from being mentally incapable to stand trial? If
medication will improve people's mental state, can they be forced to
take it? Don't people have a right to refuse treatment? Known as the
"Wild Man of West 96th Street," Larry Hogue is a homeless Vietnam
veteran who lives in the alleyways and doorways of Manhattan. He sleeps
on park benches or in cardboard boxes, constantly forages for food from
garbage cans, urinates and defecates on public streets, and wanders
through the neighborhood talking to himself. But Hogue's notoriety and
visibility go beyond these dimensions. He has been reported to harass
passersby, threaten and stalk people in the area, and smoke crack. When
Hogue's behavior has been perceived as a threat to others, he has been
committed and treated. With psychiatric help and medication, Hogue
usually improves and is discharged. Without family or friends, ﬁnancial
resources, or a place to live, however, he returns to his former haunts,
where his behavior once again deteriorates. Although Hogue is generally
not violent when on prescribed medications, he is noted to be unreliable
in taking them. Questions: How do we determine whether people are
dangerous to others? Can we commit them even if they have not committed
a crime? Under what conditions can they be conﬁned (committed) against
their will? In 1968, Prosenjit Poddar, a graduate student from India
studying at the University of California at Berkeley, sought therapy
from the student health services for depression. Poddar was apparently
upset over what he perceived to be a rebuff from a female student,
Tatiana Tarasoff, whom he claimed to love. During the course of

O R M A L P S Y C H O LO G Y

treatment, Poddar informed his therapist that he intended to purchase a
gun and kill the woman. Judging Poddar to be dangerous, the psychologist
breached the conﬁdentiality of the professional relationship by
informing the campus police. The police detained Poddar brieﬂy but freed
him because he agreed to stay away from Tarasoff. On October 27, Poddar
went to Tarasoff's home and killed her, ﬁrst wounding her with a gun and
then stabbing her repeatedly with a knife. Because of this case, the
California Supreme Court made a landmark 1976 ruling popularly known as
"the Duty to Warn"; the therapist should have warned not only the police
but the intended victim as well. Questions: What are the limits of
therapeutic conﬁdentiality? What legal obligations do therapists have in
reporting whether clients pose a threat to themselves or to others? If
conﬁdentiality cannot be absolutely guaranteed, how will it affect
client self-disclosures?

THE INSANITY DEFENSE Naveed Haq, a Pakistani American, invaded the
downtown ofﬁce of the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle railing
against Israel and the Iraq war. He ﬁred at workers, killing one woman
and wounding ﬁve. He appears here on April 14, 2008, the ﬁrst day of his
trial. Haq is pleading innocent by reason of insanity. His family and a
psychiatrist testiﬁed that he has a long history of mental illness and
that Haq was in a manic state on the morning of the rampage. In June
2008, the jury became hopelessly deadlocked, and a mistrial was
declared. Prosecutors assert they will try Haq again.

Psychologists and mental health professionals are increasingly becoming
involved in the legal system and must deal with the multiple questions
posed here. They are playing important roles in determining the state of
mind of individuals and are participating in decisions and actions of
the legal system that affect human relationships (Simon & Gold, 2004;
Tolman & Mullendore, 2003). In the past, psychologists dealt primarily
with evaluation of competency and issues related to criminal cases such
as those of Andrea Yates and Russell Weston. Now, however, their
expanded roles include giving expert opinions on child custody, organic
brain functioning, traumatic injury, suicide, and even deprogramming
activities (see Table 17.1). And just as psychologists have influenced
decisions in the legal system, they have also been influenced by mental
health laws passed at local, state, and federal levels (Shuman,
Cunningham, Connell, & Reid, 2003). All four of the preceding examples
fit the definition of abnormal behavior, and we can clearly see many of
their clinical implications. What is less clear to many is that clinical
or mental health issues can often become legal and ethical ones as well.
This is evident in the Capitol Hill shooting of two police officers, for
which the court psychiatrist ruled that Russell Weston is not competent
to stand trial. Yet how do we determine whether a person is competent to
stand trial or whether someone like Yates is insane or sane? What
criteria do we use? If we call on experts, we find that professionals
often disagree with one another (Shuman & Greenberg, 2003; Tolman &
Mullendore, 2003). Further, might defendants in criminal trials attempt
to fake mental disturbances to escape guilty verdicts? The task of
determining sanity is even more difficult because many lawyers are using
clients' claims of child abuse, domestic violence, and other
psychological traumas to explain the criminal actions of their clients.
The example of Larry Hogue leads us into the area of civil and criminal
commitments, and legal rulings that force mental health practitioners to
go beyond clinical concepts defined in DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000a). Some of Hogue's behaviors are extreme, but should a
person who has committed no crime be institutionalized because he
appears severely disturbed? Certainly, defecating and urinating in
public are disgusting to most people and are truly unusual behaviors,
but are they enough to deprive someone of his civil liberties? Does
being a nuisance or a "potential danger" to oneself or others constitute
grounds for commitment? What are the procedures for civil commitment?
What happens to people once they are committed? In the first three case
examples, the focus of legal and ethical issues tends to be on the
individual or defendant. Mental health issues become legal ones (1) when
competence to stand trial is in doubt, (2) when an accused person bases
his or her criminal defense on insanity or diminished mental capacity,
(3) when decisions must

17.1

THE INTERSECTION OF PSYCHOLOGY AND THE LAW Psychologists are ﬁnding that
their expertise is either being sought in the legal system or being
inﬂuenced by the law. Only a few of these roles and activities are
described here: Assessing dangerousness The psychologist engaged in
assessing dangerousness---suicide and homicide potential, child
endangerment, civil commitment, and so on---must be knowledgeable about
the clinical and research ﬁndings affecting such determinations. Child
custody evaluations in divorce proceedings Psychologists provide
expertise to help courts and social service agencies to determine the
"best interests of the child" in custody cases involving parenting
arrangements, termination of parental rights, and issues of neglect and
abuse. Psychological evaluations in child protection matters While being
mindful of the parents' civil and constitutional rights, the
psychologist may attempt to determine whether abuse or neglect has
occurred, whether the child is at risk for harm, and what, if any,
corrective action should be recommended. Repressed/recovered or false
memory determinations Psychologists may be asked to determine the
accuracy and validity of repressed memories---claims by adults that they
have recovered memories of childhood abuse. Although psychologists are
usually called as expert witnesses by the lawyers defending or
prosecuting the alleged abuser, they sometimes play another role: suits
have also been ﬁled against mental health professionals for promoting
the recall of false memories. Civil commitment determination
Psychologists may become involved in the civil commitment of an
individual or the discharge of a person who has been so conﬁned. They
must determine whether the person is at risk of harm to him- or herself
or others, is too mentally disturbed to take care of him- or herself, or
lacks the appropriate resources for care if left alone.

Determination of sanity or insanity Mental health experts are often
asked by the court, prosecution, or defense to determine the sanity or
insanity of someone accused of a crime. Results are usually presented
via a private hearing to the judge or expert testimony in front of a
jury. Determination of competency to stand trial Psychologists may
determine whether an individual is competent to stand trial. Is the
accused sufﬁciently rational to aid in his or her own defense? Jury
selection Jury specialists help attorneys determine whether prospective
jurors might favor one side or the other. They use clinical knowledge in
an attempt to screen out individuals who might be biased against their
clients. Proﬁling of serial killers, mass murderers, or speciﬁc
criminals Law enforcement ofﬁcers now work hand in hand with
psychologists and psychiatrists in developing proﬁles of criminals. The
Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski, for example, was proﬁled with amazing
accuracy. Testifying in malpractice suits A psychologist may testify in
a civil suit on whether another practicing clinician failed to follow
the "standards of the profession" and is thus guilty of negligence or
malpractice and/or on whether the client bringing the suit suffered
psychological harm or damage as a result of the clinician's actions.
Protection of patient rights Psychologists may become involved in seeing
that patients are not grievously wronged by the loss of their civil
liberties on the grounds of mental health treatment. Some of these
valued liberties are the right to receive treatment, to refuse
treatment, and to live in the least restrictive environment.

be made about involuntary commitment to mental hospitals, and (4) when
the rights of mental patients are legally tested. In the Tarasoff case,
the focus of legal and ethical concern shifts to the therapist. When is
a therapist legally and ethically obligated to breach patient-therapist
confidentiality? In this case, had the therapist done enough to prevent
a potentially dangerous situation from occurring? According to all
previous codes of conduct issued by professional organizations such as
the American Psychological Association, and according to accepted
practice in the field, many would answer yes. Yet in 1976 the California
Supreme Court ruled that the therapist should have warned not only the
police but also the likely victim. The ruling has major implications for
therapists in the conduct of therapy. One implication is also related to
the earlier cases. How does a therapist predict that

478

C H A P T E R 1 7 • L E G A L A N D E T H I C A L I S S U E S I N A B N
O R M A L P S Y C H O LO G Y

another person is dangerous (to him- or herself, to others, or to
society)? To protect themselves from being sued, do therapists report
all threats of homicide or suicide? Should psychologists warn clients
that not everything they say is privileged or confidential? How will
this affect the clinical relationship? We cover these and other topics
in this chapter, and we begin by examining some of the issues of
criminal and civil commitment. Then we look at patients' rights and
deinstitutionalization. We end by exploring the legal and ethical
parameters of the therapist-client relationship, taking a final look at
ethical issues related to cultural competence in mental health.

Myth vs Reality Myth: Because psychologists are specialists in
understanding the human condition, they can predict the dangerousness of
their clients well. We should rely on them to determine whether clients,
inmates, and others are in danger of violence to others or of harm to
themselves. Reality: It would be wonderful if psychologists could
predict dangerousness well. They appear to be no better than other
citizens in predicting dangerousness, and some believe they are poorer;
most mental health professionals overpredict dangerousness, thus
lowering their accuracy. This seems to make sense, as they may be
inclined to "play it safe." Some believe that police ofﬁcers do a better
job of ascertaining potential violence in people.

Criminal Commitment A basic premise of criminal law is that all of us
are responsible beings who exercise free will and are capable of
choices. If we do something wrong, we are responsible for our actions
and should suffer the consequences. Criminal commitment is the
incarceration of an individual for having committed a crime. Abnormal
psychology accepts different perspectives on free will; criminal law
does not. Yet criminal law does recognize that some people lack the
ability to discern the ramifications of their actions because they are
mentally disturbed. Although they may be technically guilty of a crime,
their mental state at the time of the offense exempts them from legal
responsibility. Let us explore the landmark cases that have influenced
this concept's evolution and application. Standards arising from these
cases and some other important guidelines are summarized in Figure 17.1.

The Insanity Defense

SHOULD THIS MAN BE COMMITTED? Between 1986 and 1993, Larry Hogue, known
to some as the "Wild Man of West 96th Street" in New York City,
frightened and intimidated residents in the neighborhood. Living in
alleys and doorways of Manhattan, he would talk to himself, walk
barefoot in winter, threaten to eat pets, and generally behave in
bizarre ways. He has been arrested numerous times for threatening people
and damaging property, but he has never been permanently conﬁned.

The concept of "innocent by reason of insanity" has provoked much
controversy among legal scholars, mental health practitioners, and the
general public. The insanity defense is a legal argument used by
defendants who admit they have committed a crime but plead not guilty
because they were mentally disturbed at the time the crime was
committed. The insanity plea recognizes that under specific
circumstances people may not be held accountable for their behavior. The
fear that such a plea might be used by a guilty individual to escape
criminal responsibility was portrayed in a popular film, Primal Fear, in
which actor Richard Gere, playing a high-powered attorney, was duped
into believing that his client suffered from a dissociative identity
disorder (formerly known as multiple-personality disorder). The client
was found not guilty by reason of insanity at the trial, only to have
Gere's character discover the ghastly truth. Unfortunately, the rare but
highly publicized cases---such as those of John Hinckley (the person who
attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan)---seem to have the
greatest ability to provoke public outrage and suspicion (Rogers, 1987).

17.1 LEGAL STANDARDS THAT ADDRESS THE MENTAL STATE OF DEFENDANTS

Legal Precedents In this country, a number of different standards are
used as legal tests of insanity. One of the earliest is the M'Naghten
Rule. In 1843, Daniel M'Naghten, a grossly disturbed woodcutter from
Glasgow, Scotland, claimed that he was commanded by God to kill the
English Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel. He killed a lesser minister by
mistake and was placed on trial, at which it became obvious that
M'Naghten was quite delusional. Out of this incident emerged the
M'Naghten Rule, popularly known as the "right-wrong" test, which holds
that people can be acquitted of a crime if it can be shown that, at the
time of the act, they (1) had such defective reasoning that they did not
know what they were doing or (2) were unable to comprehend that the act
was wrong. The M'Naghten Rule has come under tremendous criticism from
some who regard it as being exclusively a cognitive test (knowledge of
right or wrong), which does not consider volition, emotion, and other
mental activity. Further, it is often difficult to evaluate a
defendant's awareness or comprehension. The second major precedent that
strengthened the insanity defense was the irresistible impulse test. In
essence, the doctrine says that a defendant is not criminally
responsible if he or she lacked the will power to control his or her
behavior. Combined with the M'Naghten Rule, this rule broadened the
criteria for using the insanity defense. In other words, a verdict of
not guilty by reason of insanity could be obtained if it was shown that
the defendant was unaware of or did not comprehend the act (M'Naghten
Rule) or was irresistibly impelled to commit the act. Criticisms of the
irresistible impulse defense revolve around what constitutes an
irresistible impulse. Shapiro (1984, p. 30) asked the question, "What is
the difference between an irresistible impulse (unable to exert control)
and an unresisted impulse (choosing not to exert control)?" For example,
is a person with a history of antisocial behavior unable to resist his
or her impulses, or is he or she choosing not to exert control?

onfessed Hillside Strangler Kenneth Bianchi attempted to fake mental
illness for his part in raping, torturing, and murdering a number of
young women in the late 1970s. Wanting to use the insanity plea to get a
reduced sentence, Bianchi tried to convince psychiatrists that he
suffered from multiple-personality disorder (now called dissociative
identity disorder). His scheme was exposed as a fake by psychologist and
hypnosis expert Dr. Martin Orne, and Bianchi was found guilty of murder
and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Durham standard a test of legal insanity known as the products test---an
accused person is not responsible if the unlawful act was the product of
mental disease or defect American Law Institute (ALI) Model Penal Code a
test of

legal insanity that combines both cognitive criteria (diminished
capacity) and motivational criteria (speciﬁc intent); its purpose is to
give jurors increased latitude in determining the sanity of the accused

Neither the mental health profession nor the legal profession has
answered this question satisfactorily. In the case of Durham v. United
States (1954), the U.S. Court of Appeals broadened the M'Naghten Rule
with the so-called products test or Durham standard. An accused person
is not considered criminally responsible if his or her unlawful act was
the product of mental disease or defect. It was Judge David Bazelon's
intent to (1) give the greatest possible weight to expert evaluation and
testimony and (2) allow mental health professionals to define mental
illness. The Durham standard also has its drawbacks. The term product is
vague and difficult to define because almost anything can cause anything
(as you have learned by studying the many theoretical viewpoints in this
text). Leaving the task of defining mental illness to mental health
professionals often results in having to define mental illness in every
case. In many situations, relying on psychiatric testimony serves only
to confuse the issues, because both the prosecution and defense bring in
psychiatric experts, who often present conflicting testimony (Otto,
1989; Shuman & Greenberg, 2003). Interestingly, Judge Bazelon eventually
recognized these problems and withdrew support for the test. In 1962,
the American Law Institute (ALI), in its Model Penal Code, produced
guidelines to help jurors determine the validity of the insanity defense
on a case-bycase basis. The guidelines combined features from the
previous standards. 1. A person is not responsible for criminal conduct
if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect
he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of
his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. 2.
As used in the Article, the terms "mental disease or defect" do not
include an abnormality manifested by repeated criminal or otherwise
antisocial conduct (Sec. 401, p. 66). It is interesting to note that the
second point was intended to eliminate the insanity defense for people
diagnosed as antisocial personalities. With the attempt to be more
specific and precise, the ALI guidelines moved the burden of determining
criminal responsibility back to the jurors. As we have seen, previous
standards, particularly the Durham standard, gave great weight to expert
testimony, and many feared that it would usurp the jury's
responsibilities. By using phrases such as "substantial capacity,"
"appreciate the criminality of his conduct," and "conform his conduct to
the requirements of the law," the ALI standard was intended to allow the
jurors the greatest possible flexibility in ascribing criminal
responsibility. In some jurisdictions, the concept of diminished
capacity has also been incorporated into the ALI standard. As a result
of a mental disease or defect, a person may lack the specific intent to
commit the offense. For example, a person under the influence of drugs
or alcohol may commit a crime without premeditation or intent; a person
who is grief-stricken over the death of a loved one may harm the one
responsible for the death. Although diminished capacity has been used
primarily to guide the sentencing and disposition of the defendant, it
is now introduced in the trial phase as well. Such was the trial of Dan
White, a San Francisco supervisor who killed Mayor George Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk on November 27, 1978. White blamed both
individuals for his political demise. During the trial, his attorney
used the nowfamous "Twinkie defense" (White gorged himself on junk food
such as Twinkies, chips, and soda) as a partial explanation for his
client's actions. White's attorney attempted to convince the jury that
the high sugar content of the junk food affected his cognitive and
emotional state and was partially to blame for his actions. Because of
the unusual defense (the junk food diminished his judgment), White was
convicted only of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to less than
eight years in jail. Of course, the citizens of San Francisco were
outraged by the verdict and never forgave Dan White. Facing constant
public condemnation, he eventually committed suicide after his release.

Criminal Commitment

481

Guilty, but Mentally Ill Perhaps no other trial has more greatly
challenged the use of the insanity plea than the case of John W.
Hinckley, Jr. Hinckley's attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan
and his subsequent acquittal by reason of insanity outraged the public,
as well as legal and mental health professionals. Even before the
shooting, the increasingly successful use of the insanity defense had
been a growing concern in both legal circles and the public arena. Many
had begun to believe that the criteria for the defense were too broadly
interpreted. These concerns were strong, even though findings indicate
that the insanity defense is used in less than 1 percent of cases, that
its use is rarely successful, and that few defendants fake or exaggerate
their psychological disorders (Callahan et al., 1991; Silver,
Cirincione, & Steadman, 1994; Steadman et al., 1993). For quite some
time, the Hinckley case aroused NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY John
Hinckley, Jr., was charged with such strong emotional reaction that
calls for the attempted murder of President Ronald Reagan. His acquittal
by reason of insanity created a furor among the American public over use
of the insanity reform were rampant. The American Psychiatric defense.
The outrage forced Congress to pass the Insanity Reform Act. Association
(1983), the American Medical Association (Kerlitz & Fulton, 1984), and
the American Bar Association (1984) all advocated a more stringent
interpretation of insanity. As a result, Congress passed the Insanity
Reform Act of 1984, which based the definition of insanity totally on
the individual's ability to understand what he or she did. The American
Psychological Association's position on the insanity defense ran counter
to these changes (Rogers, 1987). Its position is that even though a
given verdict might be wrong, the standard is not necessarily wrong.
Nevertheless, in the wake of the Hinckley verdict, some states have
adopted alternative pleas, such as "culpable and mentally disabled,"
"mentally disabled, but neither culpable nor innocent," and "guilty, but
mentally ill." These pleas are attempts to separate mental illness from
insanity and to hold people responsible for their acts (Slovenko, 1995;
Steadman et al., 1993). Such pleas allow jurors to reach a decision that
not only convicts individuals for their crimes and holds them
responsible but also ensures that they will be given treatment for their
mental illnesses. Just such a decision was handed down in the case of
twenty-eight-year-old Nader Ali, who admitted to using an aluminum bat
to beat twenty-five-year-old Lea Sullivan to death near the Whole Foods
grocery store in Philadelphia. Both were classmates, and the prosecution
claimed that Ali stalked and killed Sullivan in a premeditated manner.
During the trial, the defense presented compelling evidence that Ali
suffered from schizophrenia and a bipolar disorder. They claimed Ali was
not guilty by reason of insanity. His attempt to use the insanity plea,
however, failed, and the jury returned a verdict in 2006 of guilty, but
mentally ill. Despite attempts at reform, however, states and
municipalities continue to use different tests of insanity with varying
outcomes, and the use of the insanity plea remains controversial.

Competency to Stand Trial The term competency to stand trial refers to a
defendant's mental state at the time of psychiatric examination after
arrest and before trial. It has nothing to do with the issue of criminal
responsibility, which refers to an individual's mental state or behavior
at the time of the offense. If you recall from the case of Russell
Weston, Jr., who killed the two Capitol police officers, the
court-appointed psychiatrist declared Weston not competent to stand
trial. In such cases, our system of law states that an accused person
cannot be tried unless three criteria are satisfied (Shapiro, 1984): 1.
Does the defendant have a factual understanding of the proceedings?

competency to stand trial

a judgment that a defendant has a factual and rational understanding of
the proceedings and can rationally consult with counsel in presenting
his or her own defense; refers to the defendant's mental state at the

2.  Does the defendant have a rational understanding of the proceedings?
3.  Can the defendant rationally consult with counsel in presenting his
    or her own defense? Given this third criterion, a defendant who is
    suffering from paranoid delusions could not stand trial because a
    serious impairment exists. It is clear that many more people are
    committed to prison hospitals because of incompetency determinations
    than are acquitted on insanity pleas (Rogers, 1987; Steadman et al.,
    1993). It is estimated, for example, that some twenty-five thousand
    people in the United States are evaluated for their competency to
    stand trial and that, as noted, less than 1 percent of felony
    defenses use an insanity plea (Nicholson & Kugler, 1991; Silver et
    al., 1994). Determination of competency to stand trial is meant to
    ensure that a person understands the nature of the proceedings and
    is able to help in his or her own defense. This effort is an attempt
    to protect mentally disturbed people and to guarantee preservation
    of criminal and civil rights. But being judged incompetent to stand
    trial may have unfair negative consequences as well. A person may be
    committed for a long period of time, denied the chance to post bail,
    and isolated from friends and family, all without having been found
    guilty of a crime. Such a miscarriage of justice was the focus of a
    U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1972 in the case of Jackson v. Indiana.
    In that case, a severely retarded, brain-damaged person who could
    neither hear nor speak was charged with robbery but was determined
    incompetent to stand trial. He was committed indefinitely, which in
    his case probably meant for life, because it was apparent by the
    severity of his disorders that he would never be competent. His
    lawyers filed a petition to have him released on the basis of
    deprivation of due process---the legal checks and balances that are
    guaranteed to everyone, such as the right to a fair trial, the right
    to face accusers, the right to present evidence, the right to
    counsel, and so on. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a defendant
    cannot be confined indefinitely solely on the grounds of
    incompetency. After a reasonable time, a determination must be made
    as to whether the person is likely or unlikely to regain competency
    in the foreseeable future. If, in the hospital's opinion, the person
    is unlikely to do so, the hospital must either release the
    individual or initiate civil commitment procedures.

Sometimes action seems necessary when people are severely disturbed and
exhibit bizarre behaviors that can pose a threat to themselves or
others. Government has a long-standing precedent of parens patriae
("father of the country" or "power of the state"), in which it has
authority to commit disturbed individuals for their own best interest.
Civil commitment is the involuntary confinement of individuals judged to
be a danger to themselves or others, even though they have not committed
a crime. Factors relevant to civil commitment are displayed in Figure
17.2. The commitment of a person in acute distress may be viewed as a
form of protective confinement (Bednar et al., 1991) and concern for the
psychological and physical well-being of that person or others.
Hospitalization is considered in the case of potential suicide or
assault, bizarre behavior, destruction of property, and severe anxiety
leading to loss of impulse control. Involuntary hospitalization should,
however, be avoided if at all possible because it has many potentially
negative consequences. It may result in the lifelong social stigma
associated with psychiatric hospitalization, major interruption in the
person's life, losing control of his or her life and being dependent on
others, and loss of self-esteem and self-concept. To this we would add a
possible loss or restriction of civil liberties---a point that becomes
even more glaring when we consider that the person has actually
committed no crime other than being a nuisance or assailing people's
sensibilities. Larry Hogue, described earlier, had committed no crime,
although he violated many social norms. But at what point do we

confine people simply because they fail to conform to our standards of
"decency" or "socially appropriate" behavior?

Criteria for Commitment States vary in the criteria used to commit a
person, but there do appear to be certain general standards. It is not
enough that a person be mentally ill; additional conditions need to
exist before hospitalization is considered (Corey, Corey, & Callanan,
2003; Turkheimer & Parry, 1992). 1. The person presents a clear and
imminent danger to him- or herself or others. An example is someone who
is displaying suicidal or bizarre behavior (such as walking out on a
busy freeway) that places the individual in immediate danger. Threats to
harm someone or behavior viewed to be assaultive or destructive are also
grounds for commitment. 2. The person is unable to care for himself or
herself or does not have the social network to provide for such care.
Most civil commitments are based primarily on this criterion. The
details vary, but states generally specify an inability to provide
sufficient forms of the following: • Food (person is malnourished, food
is unavailable, and person has no feasible plan to obtain it) • Clothing
(attire is not appropriate for climate or is dirty or torn, and person
has no plans for obtaining others) • Shelter (person has no permanent
residence, insufficient protection from climatic conditions, and no
logical plans for obtaining adequate housing) 3. The person is unable to
make responsible decisions about appropriate treatment and
hospitalization. As a result, there is a strong chance of deterioration.
4. The person is in an unmanageable state of fright or panic. Such
people may believe and feel that they are on the brink of losing
control. In the past, commitments could be obtained solely on the basis
of mental illness and a person's need for treatment, which was often
determined arbitrarily. Increasingly,

O R M A L P S Y C H O LO G Y

the courts have tightened up civil commitment procedures and have begun
to rely more on a determination of whether the person presents a danger
to him- or herself or others. How do we determine this possibility? Many
people would not consider Larry Hogue a danger to himself or others.
Some, however, might believe that he could be assaultive to others and
injurious to himself. Disagreements among the public may be
understandable, but are trained mental health professionals more
accurate in their predictions? Let's turn to that question. Assessing
Dangerousness As noted earlier, most studies have indicated that mental
health professionals have difficulty predicting whether their clients
will commit dangerous acts and that they often overpredict violence
(Buchanan, 1997; McNiel & Binder, 1991; Monahan & Walker, 1990). The
fact that civil commitments are often based on a determination of
dangerousness---the person's potential for doing harm to himself or
herself or to others---makes this conclusion even more disturbing. The
difficulty in predicting this potential seems linked to four factors. 1.
The rarer something is, the more difficult it is to predict. As a group,
psychiatric patients are not dangerous! Although some evidence suggests
that individuals suffering from severe psychotic disorders may have
slightly higher rates of violent behavior (Hodgins et al., 1996;
Junginger, 1996; Monahan, 1993), the risk is not considered a major
concern. A frequent misconception shared by both the public and the
courts is that mental illnesses are in and of themselves dangerous.
Studies have indicated that approximately 90 percent of people suffering
from mental disorders are neither violent nor dangerous (Swanson et al.,
1990), and few psychotic patients are assaultive: estimates range from
10 percent of hospitalized patients to about 3 percent in outpatient
clinics (Tardiff, 1984; Tardiff & Koenigsburg, 1985; Tardiff & Sweillam,
1982). Homicide is even rarer: a psychiatric patient is no more likely
to commit a homicide than is someone in the population at large
(Monahan, 1981). 2. Violence seems as much a function of the context in
which it occurs as a function of the person's characteristics. Although
it is theoretically possible for a psychologist to accurately assess an
individual's personality, we can have little idea about the situations
in which people will find themselves. Shapiro (1984) advocated that the
mental health professional needs to help the court define the term
dangerous so that testimony can be restricted to a description of the
patient's personality and the kinds of situations in which personality
may deteriorate, lead to assaultive behavior, or both. 3. The best
predictor of dangerousness is probably past criminal conduct or a
history of violence or aggression. Such a record, however, is frequently
ruled irrelevant or inadmissible by mental health commissions and the
courts. 4. The definition of dangerousness is itself unclear. Most of us
would agree that murder, rape, torture, and physical assaults are
dangerous. But are we confining our definition to physical harm only?
What about psychological abuse or even destruction of property?

Procedures in Civil Commitment

a person's potential for doing harm to himself or herself or to others

dangerousness

Despite the difficulties in defining dangerousness, once someone
believes that a person is a threat to himself or herself or to others,
civil commitment procedures may be instituted. The rationale for this
action is that it (1) prevents harm to the person or to others, (2)
provides appropriate treatment and care, and (3) ensures due process of
law (that is, legal hearing). In most cases, people deemed in need of
protective confinement can be persuaded to voluntarily commit themselves
to a period of hospitalization. This process is fairly straightforward,
and many believe that it is the preferred one. Involuntary commitment
occurs when the client does not consent to hospitalization. Involuntary
commitment can be a temporary emergency action or a longer period of
detention that is determined at a formal hearing. All states recognize
that cases arise in which a person is so grossly disturbed that
immediate detention is required.

Rights of Mental Patients

485

Because formal hearings may take a long time, delaying commitment might
prove adverse to the person or to other individuals. Formal civil
commitment usually follows a similar process, regardless of the state in
which it occurs. First, a concerned person, such as a family member,
therapist, or family physician, petitions the court for an examination
of the person. If the judge believes there is responsible cause for this
action, he or she will order an examination. Second, the judge appoints
two professionals with no connection to each other to examine the
person. In most cases, the examiners are physicians or mental health
professionals. Third, a formal hearing is held in which the examiners
testify to the person's mental state and potential danger. Others, such
as family members, friends, or therapists, may also testify. The person
is allowed to speak on his or her own behalf and is represented by
counsel. Fourth, if it is determined that the person must enter
treatment, a finite period may be specified; periods of six months to
one year are common. Some states, however, have indefinite periods
subject to periodic review and assessment. Protection Against
Involuntary Commitment We have said that involuntary commitment can lead
to a violation of civil rights. Some have even argued that criminals
have more rights than the mentally ill. For example, a person accused of
a crime is considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
Usually, he or she is incarcerated only after a jury trial, and only if
a crime is committed (not if there is only the possibility or even high
probability of crime). Yet a mentally ill person may be confined A

Although Dahmer had been imprisoned in 1988 for sexual molestation, it
would have been difﬁcult (for the individual's benefit). For example, it
is often argued that mentally ill people may be incapable of determining
their own treatment, and that, to predict his degree of dangerousness.
Despite an attempt to use the insanity plea, Dahmer was once treated,
they will be grateful for the treatment they received. If people found
guilty in 1994 and imprisoned. He was resist hospitalization, they are
thus being irrational, which is a symptom of subsequently killed by
another inmate. their mental disorder. Critics do not accept this
reasoning. They point out that civil commitment is for the benefit of
those initiating commitment procedures (society) and not for the
individual. Even after treatment, people rarely appreciate it. These
concerns have raised and heightened sensitivity toward patient welfare
and rights, resulting in a trend toward restricting the powers of the
state over the individual.

Rights of Mental Patients Many people in the United States are concerned
about the balance of power among the state, our mental institutions, and
our citizens. The U.S. Constitution guarantees certain "inalienable
rights" such as trial by jury, legal representation, and protection
against self-incrimination. The mental health profession has great
power, which may be used wittingly or unwittingly to abridge individual
freedom. In recent decades, some courts have ruled that commitment for
any purpose constitutes a major deprivation of liberty that requires due
process protection. Until 1979, the level of proof required for civil
commitments varied from state to state. In a case that set a legal
precedent, a Texas man claimed that he was denied due process because
the jury that committed him was instructed to use a lower standard than
"beyond a reasonable doubt" (more than 90 percent certainty). The
appellate court agreed with the man, but when the case finally reached
the Supreme Court in April 1979 (Addington v. Texas), the Court ruled
that the state must provide only "clear and convincing evidence"
(approximately 75 percent certainty) that a person is mentally ill and
potentially dangerous before that person can be committed. Although

Predicting Dangerousness: The Case of Serial Killers and Mass Murderers

J

effrey L. Dahmer admitted to killing his ﬁrst victim in 1978 near his
boyhood home. After killing his second victim, Dahmer stated he began to
lose control of his necrophilia, a desire to have sex with the dead.
Over a period of years until 1991 when he was arrested, he killed ﬁfteen
other men or young boys. Not only did he murder them, but he often
killed them in hideous and torturous ways. Once they were dead he would
have sex with them, dismember their bodies, and feed on them in
cannibalistic fashion. Dahmer pleaded "not guilty by reason of mental
disease or defect," but he was subsequently found guilty and was killed
by another inmate in prison. In 2007, nineteen-year-old Robert Hawkins,
a school dropout, shot and killed eight people in a Nebraska shopping
mall with an assault riﬂe that he smuggled into the building wrapped in
a sweatshirt. He apparently selected his victims at random, and security
cameras captured his image as he aimed and shot his victims who ranged
in age from twentyfour to sixty-six. After the bloodbath, he committed
suicide by shooting himself. He had recently lost his job and
girlfriend; in his suicide note he stated "I'm a piece of shit" and "but
I'm going to be famous now." And who can forget April 20, 1999, when
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went on a shooting rampage at Columbine
High School, killing twelve students and a teacher before they both
committed suicide. These examples of serial killers and mass murderers
often make us wonder why such people were never identiﬁed as being
potentially dangerous. Jeffrey Dahmer, for example, tortured animals as
a small boy and was arrested in 1988

for molesting a child. Even though his father suspected his son was
dangerous, Jeffrey Dahmer was released. And there appears to be
sufﬁcient evidence to suggest that mass murderer Hawkins was a deeply
disturbed young man who harbored great resentment and anger waiting to
explode. Harris and Klebold created a Web site that seemed to foretell
their proclivity toward violence. In all three situations, aberrant
thoughts and behaviors appeared to go unrecognized or ignored. Lest we
be too harsh on psychologists and law enforcement ofﬁcials, it is
important to realize that few serial killers or mass murderers willingly
share their deviant sexual or asocial fantasies. Furthermore, many of
the problems in predicting whether a person will commit dangerous acts
lie in (1) limited knowledge concerning the characteristics associated
with violence, (2) lack of a oneto-one correspondence between danger
signs and possible violence, (3) increasing knowledge that violent
behavior is most often the result of many variables, and (4) recognition
that incarceration---both criminal and civil---cannot occur on the basis
of "potential danger" alone. Nevertheless, our limited experiences with
mass murderers and serial killers have produced patterns and proﬁles of
interest to mental health practitioners and law enforcement ofﬁcials.
Although similar, the proﬁles of mass murderers and serial killers also
differ in some major ways. Proﬁle of Serial Killers Serial killers are

these standards for confinement are higher than those advocated by most
mental health organizations, this ruling nevertheless represented the
first time that the Supreme Court considered any aspect of the civil
commitment process. Due to decisions in several other cases (Lessard v.
Schmidt, 1972, Wisconsin Federal Court; and Dixon v. Weinberger, 1975),
states must provide the least restrictive environment for people. This
means that people have a right to the least restrictive alternative to
freedom that is appropriate to their condition. Only patients who cannot
adequately care for themselves are confined to hospitals. Those who can
function acceptably should be given alternative choices, such as
boarding homes and other shelters.

right to treatment

One of the primary justifications for commitment is that treatment will
improve a person's mental condition and increase the likelihood that he
or she will be able to return to the community. If we confine a person
involuntarily and do not provide the means for release (therapy), isn't
this deprivation of due process? Several cases have raised this problem
as a constitutional issue. Together, they have determined that mental
patients who have been involuntarily committed have a right to
treatment---a right to receive therapy that would improve their
emotional state. In 1966, in a lawsuit brought against St. Elizabeth's
Hospital in Washington, D.C. (Rouse v. Cameron), the court held that (1)
right to treatment is a constitutional right and (2) failure to provide
treatment cannot be justified by lack of resources. In

sadism, antisocial personality, extreme narcissism, and borderline
personality disorder. Few are psychotic, and psychoses do not appear to
be the cause of their compulsion to kill. Almost all, however, entertain
violent sexual fantasies and have experienced traumatic sex at a young
age. Their earlier years are troubled with family histories of abuse,
alcoholism, and criminal activity. Dahmer, for example, was sexually
molested as a youngster. Most serial killers seem to exhibit little
remorse for their victims, have little incentive to change, and seem to
lack a value system. The compulsion to kill is often associated with
what has been described as "morbid prognostic signs" (Schlesinger,
1989): breaking and entering for nonmonetary purposes; unprovoked
assaults and mistreatment of women; a fetish for female undergarments
and destruction of them; showing hatred, contempt, or fear of women;
violence against animals, especially cats; sexual identity confusion,
including underlying homosexual feelings; a "violent and primitive
fantasy life"; and sexual inhibitions and preoccupation with rigid
standards of morality (Youngstrom, 1991, p. 32). Although we have come a
long way in being able to compile a composite description of serial
killers, some have challenged the accuracy of such proﬁles. Two highly
visible examples appear to break this mold. On April 16, 2007, Seung Hui
Cho, a Korean American, used two semiautomatic handguns on the Virginia
Tech campus to kill thirty-two people before committing suicide. The
incident was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. In the

They were originally thought to be angry white men, with no military
background and probably local residents. As it turned out, the snipers
were African Americans, one had combat experience, and they were
drifters. Proﬁle of Mass Murderers Mass murderers are usually men who
are social isolates and seem to exhibit inadequate social and
interpersonal skills. They have been found to be quite angry and to be
ﬁlled with rage. The anger appears to be cumulative and is triggered by
some type of event, usually a loss. For example, they may view the end
of a job or a relationship as a catastrophic loss. Most have strong
mistrust of people and entertain paranoid fantasies, such as a
wide-ranging conspiracy against them. They tend to be rootless and have
few support systems such as family, friends, or religious or fraternal
groups. Many researchers believe that the number of mass murders will
increase as ﬁrearms proliferate in our society. Other social correlates
affecting mass murders are an increasing sense of rootlessness in the
country, general disenchantment, and loneliness. The more random the
killings, the more disturbed, delusional, and paranoid the person is
likely to be. What criteria would you use to determine whether someone
is dangerous or not? Can you identify the weaknesses or possible dangers
to using this set of criteria? Can you give speciﬁc examples of cases in
which they would prove problematic to apply? How does one balance
applying and implementing criteria of dangerousness with the loss of
civil liberties of citizens?

other words, a mental institution or the state could not use lack of
funding facilities or labor power as reasons for not providing
treatment. Although this decision represented a major advance in patient
rights, the ruling provided no guidelines for what constitutes
treatment. This issue was finally addressed in 1972 by U.S. District
Court Judge Frank Johnson in the Alabama federal court. The case (Wyatt
v. Stickney) involved a boy with mental retardation who not only was not
given treatment but also was made to live in an institution that was
unable to meet even minimum standards of care. Indeed, the living
conditions in two of the hospital buildings resembled those found in
early asylums of the eighteenth century. Less than 50 cents a day was
spent on food for each patient; the toilet facilities were totally
inadequate and filthy; patients were crowded in group rooms with minimal
or no privacy; and personnel (one physician per two thousand patients)
and patient care were practically nonexistent. Judge Johnson not only
ruled in favor of the right to treatment but also specified standards of
adequate treatment, such as staff-patient ratios, therapeutic
environmental conditions, and professional consensus about appropriate
treatment. The court also made it clear that mental patients could not
be forced to work (scrub floors, cook, serve food, wash laundry, and so
on) or to engage in work-related activities aimed at maintaining the
institution in which they lived. This practice, widely used in
institutions, was declared unconstitutional. Moreover, patients who
volunteered to perform tasks had to be paid at least the minimum wage to
do them instead of merely

he legal system uses three different standards of proof. Beyond a
reasonable doubt is conﬁned to criminal trials and is generally accepted
to be 95% certainty; clear and convincing evidence is used in civil
commitments (75% certainty); and preponderance of evidence is generally
used in civil actions (51% certainty). For mental health purposes, the
burden of proof standard falls in between the two extremes.

eung Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech mass murderer, was believed to be of
imminent danger to himself and others. It was recommended that he be
committed, but a court magistrate implemented the "least restrictive
environment" criterion to guard against a restriction of his civil
liberties. Instead, it was determined that an alternative choice,
outpatient treatment, was more appropriate. As we now know, Cho failed
to show for his therapy sessions and shortly carried out the massacre of
thirty-two people.

being given token allowances or special privileges. This landmark
decision ensures treatment beyond custodial care and protection against
neglect and abuse. Another important case (tried in the U.S. District
Court in Florida), O'Connor v. Donaldson (1975), has also had a major
impact on the right-to-treatment issue. It involved Kenneth Donaldson,
who at age forty-nine was committed for twenty years to the
Chattahoochee State Hospital on petition by his father. He was found to
be mentally ill, unable to care for himself, easily manipulated, and
dangerous. Throughout his confinement, Donaldson petitioned for release,
but Dr. O'Connor, the hospital superintendent, determined that the
patient was too dangerous. Finally, Donaldson threatened a lawsuit and
was reluctantly discharged by the hospital after fourteen years of
confinement. He then sued both O'Connor and the hospital, winning an
award of \$20,000. The monetary award is insignificant compared with the
significance of the ruling. Again, the court reaffirmed the client's
right to treatment. It ruled that Donaldson did not receive appropriate
treatment and said that the state cannot constitutionally confine a
nondangerous person who is capable of caring for himself or herself
outside of an institution or who has willing friends or family to help.
Further, it said that physicians, as well as institutions, are liable
for improper confinements. One major dilemma facing the courts in all
cases of court-ordered treatment is determining what constitutes
treatment. Treatment can range from rest and relaxation to
psychosurgery, medication, and aversion therapy. Mental health
professionals believe that they are in the best position to evaluate the
type and efficacy of treatment, a position supported by the case of
Youngberg v. Romeo (1982). The court ruled that Nicholas Romeo, a boy
with mental retardation, had a constitutional right to "reasonable care
and safety," and it deferred judgment to the mental health professional
as to what constitutes therapy.

Right to Refuse Treatment Russell Weston, the man suffering from
paranoid schizophrenia who killed two U.S. Capitol police officers in
1998, refused antipsychotic drugs. As you recall, he was declared
mentally incompetent to stand trial, and he refused to take medication
to make him competent. Court-appointed psychiatrists testified that his
mental condition had worsened and that without treatment he could be
dangerous. His attorneys, however, supported his right to refuse
treatment and fought government officials on this point. Many believe
that the refusal was based on a Supreme Court ruling (Ford
vs. Wainwright) that stated that the government cannot execute an
incompetent convict. Thus it would seem ironic for any prisoner to agree
to medication only to be executed. As noted earlier, in January 2002,
Russell Weston was forced by the courts to take antipsychotic medication
based on the likelihood of improvement. Several other cases have come
before the courts since then. In June 2003, the Supreme Court placed
strict limits on the ability to medicate mentally ill defendants
forcibly to make them competent to stand trial. Such actions must be,
according to the court, in the "best interest of the defendant." What
this means will have to be played out in the future. As of 2007, Weston
remains in a mental institution and has yet to be tried in court.
Although it may be easy for us to surmise the reason for Weston's
attorneys refusing treatment to make him better, does it make sense for
others? Patients frequently refuse medical treatment on religious
grounds or because the treatment would only prolong a terminal illness.
In many cases, physicians are inclined to honor such refusals,
especially if they seem to be based on reasonable grounds. But should
mental patients have a right to refuse treatment? At first glance, it
may appear illogical. After all, why commit patients for treatment and
then allow them to refuse it? Furthermore, isn't it possible that mental
patients may be incapable of deciding what is best for themselves? For
example, a man with a paranoid delusion may refuse treatment because he
believes the hospital staff is plotting against him. If he is allowed to
refuse medication or other forms of therapy, his condition may
deteriorate more. The result is that the client may become even more
dangerous or incapable of caring for himself outside of hospital
confinement.

Court-Ordered Assisted Treatment: Coercion or Caring?

I

n January 1999, Kendra Webdale waited for a subway train at a midtown
Manhattan station. It was reported that Andrew Goldstein, twenty-nine
years old, moved toward the woman and pushed her onto the tracks as a
subway train pulled into the station. Riders watched in horror as the
train struck Kendra Webdale, killing her on that fateful morning.
Passengers surrounded the suspect and held him until the police arrived.
It was found that Goldstein was carrying medical papers indicating that
he was under psychiatric care at an outpatient clinic and had a history
of multiple hospitalizations. Many people were outraged because they
believed that Goldstein had failed to take his antipsychotic medication.
Although his ﬁrst trial resulted in a hung jury, he was convicted in the
second trial and sentenced to twenty-ﬁve years to life in prison. The
incident, along with a similar one, evoked such a large public outcry
about protecting the public from psychiatric patients that New York
State passed an assisted outpatient commitment law, known as "Kendra's
Law" (in memory of Kendra Webdale). Kendra's Law has caused considerable
controversy among the public, civil rights advocates, and mental health
practitioners. As mentioned earlier, most forms of civil commitment are
based on the criteria of "imminent danger to self or others." The New
York Court of Appeals' landmark ruling, Rivers v. Katz (67 NY2d 485,
1986) speciﬁcally states that every adult of sound mind has a right to
determine what shall be done with his or her body and to control his or
her own course of medical treatment. But what about people who are not
determined to be dangerous and

who refuse treatment that might help them or prevent potential harmful
actions? The case is not unlike that of Russell Weston, although the
implications for civil liberties in Kendra's Law are much more likely to
affect many more people. As a result, debates on individual rights,
constitutionality of the law, and public safety have all given answers
to the question as to whether the law is one of "caring" or "coercion."
Kendra's Law allows court-ordered treatment without meeting the criteria
for imminent dangerousness. As of this writing, ten states have statutes
that allow for court-ordered outpatient treatment without manifesting
the criteria of dangerousness: Alabama, Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi,
Montana, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, and Texas.
The statutes all allow for compliance in medication, blood tests,
urinalysis, psychotherapy, and day programs. Patients must meet the
criteria of age (eighteen years) and a history of signiﬁcant
noncompliance with treatment. Any number of signiﬁcant individuals can
petition the court to force assisted outpatient treatment. Some claim
that many homeless people would beneﬁt from assisted outpatient
treatment. For Further Consideration 1. As part of our guaranteed civil
liberties, shouldn't we have the right to refuse treatment? Under what
conditions would you take away the right of patients to refuse
treatment? 2. When examining these conditions, can you make a case for
how they might be problematic?

Proponents of the right to refuse treatment argue, however, that many
forms of treatment, such as medication or electroconvulsive therapy
(ECT), may have long term side effects, as discussed in earlier
chapters. They also point out that involuntary treatment is generally
much less effective than treatment accepted voluntarily (Shapiro, 1984).
People forced into treatment seem to resist it, thereby nullifying the
potentially beneficial effects. The case of Rennie v. Klein (1978)
involved several state hospitals in New Jersey that were forcibly
medicating patients in nonemergency situations. The court ruled that
people have a constitutional right to refuse treatment (psychotropic
medication) and to be given due process. In another related case, Rogers
v. Okin (1979), a Massachusetts court supported these guidelines. Both
cases made the point that psychotropic medication was often used only to
control behavior or as a substitute for treatment. Further, the
decisions noted that drugs might actually inhibit recovery. In these
cases, the courts supported the right to refuse treatment under certain
conditions and extended the least restrictive alternative principle to
include least intrusive forms of treatment. Generally, psychotherapy is
considered less intrusive than somatic or physical therapies (ECT and
medication). Although this compromise may appear reasonable, other
problems present themselves. First, how do we define intrusive
treatment? Are insight therapies as intrusive as behavioral techniques
(punishment and aversion procedures)? Second, if patients are allowed to
refuse certain forms of treatment and if the hospital does not have
alternatives for them, can clients sue the institution? These questions
remain unanswered.

JOB TRAINING FOR THE MENTALLY CHALLENGED Increasingly, it is recognized
that the mentally challenged or those suffering from mental disorders
can be helped if they are taught functional skills in self-care and
those related to employment. Here we see such a program in action, in
which basic skills such as cooking, grooming, and conversation starters
are taught.

Deinstitutionalization

large central institutions to agencies within local communities
mainstreaming integrating mental patients as soon as possible back into
the community

Deinstitutionalization is the shifting of responsibility for the care of
mental patients from large central institutions to agencies within local
communities. When originally formulated in the 1960s and 1970s, the
concept excited many mental health professionals. Since its inception,
many state-run hospitals have experienced a reduction of more than 50
percent in the hospital population and a 75 percent decrease in the
average daily number of committed patients (Turkheimer & Parry, 1992).
The impetus behind deinstitutionalization came from several quarters.
First, there was (and still is) a feeling that large hospitals provide
mainly custodial care, that they produce little benefit for the patient,
and that they may even impede improvement. Court cases discussed earlier
(Wyatt v. Stickney and O'Connor v. Donaldson) exposed the fact that many
mental hospitals are no better than "warehouses for the insane."
Institutionalization was accused of fostering dependency, promoting
helplessness, and lowering self-sufficiency in patients. The longer
patients were hospitalized, the more likely they were to remain
hospitalized, even if they had improved. Further, symptoms such as flat
affect and nonresponsiveness, which were thought to be clinical signs of
schizophrenia, may actually result from hospitalization. Second, the
issue of patient rights was receiving increased attention. Mental health
professionals became very concerned about keeping patients confined
against their will and began to discharge patients whenever they
approached minimal competencies. It was believed that
mainstreaming---integrating mental patients as soon as possible back
into the community---could be accomplished by providing local outpatient
or transitory services (such as board-and-care facilities, halfway
houses, and churches). In addition, advances in tranquilizers and other
drug treatment techniques made it possible to medicate patients, which
made them manageable once discharged. Third, insufficient funds for
state hospitals almost forced these institutions to release patients
back into communities. Overcrowded conditions made mental health
administrators view the movement favorably; state legislative branches
encouraged the trend, especially because it reduced state costs and
funding. What has been the impact of deinstitutionalization on patients?
Its critics believe that deinstitutionalization is a policy that allows
states to relinquish their responsibility to care for patients unable to
care for themselves. There are alarming indications

Deinstitutionalization

THE DOWNSIDE OF DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION Homelessness has become one of
the great social problems of urban communities. Many believe that
deinstitutionalization has contributed to the problem, although it is
not clear what proportion of homeless people are mentally ill. Scenes
such as this one, however, are becoming all too common in large urban
areas.

that deinstitutionalization has been responsible for placing or
"dumping" on the streets up to 1 million former patients who should have
remained institutionalized (Toro & Wall, 1991). Critics believe that the
"Wild Man of West 96th Street" is an example of the human cost and
tragedy of such a policy. Most of these people appear severely disabled,
have difficulty coping with daily living, suffer from schizophrenia, and
are alcoholic (Fischer & Breakey, 1991; Lamb, 1984; Toro & Wall, 1991).
It appears that millions of mentally ill individuals have joined the
ranks of the homeless and that existing programs are woefully fragmented
and inadequate in delivering needed services (U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, 2003). Thus it is becoming apparent that many
mentally ill people are not receiving treatment. Approximately 750,000
of them now live in nursing homes, board-and-care homes, or group
residences (Applebaum, 1987). The quality of care in many of these
places is marginal, forcing continuing and periodic rehospitalization of
their residents (Turkheimer & Parry, 1992). People with mental illnesses
constitute a substantial portion of the homeless population (Fischer &
Breakey, 1991; Levine & Rog, 1990). Much of the problem with
deinstitutionalization appears to be the community's lack of preparation
and resources to care for people with chronic mental illness. Many
patients lack family or friends who can help them make the transition
back into the community; many state hospitals do not provide patients
with adequate skills training; many discharged patients have difficulty
finding jobs; many find substandard housing that is worse than the
institutions from which they came; many are not adequately monitored and
receive no psychiatric treatment; and many become homeless (Westermeyer,
1987). It is difficult to estimate how many discharged mental patients
have been added to the burgeoning ranks of the homeless. We do know that
homelessness in the United States, especially in large, urban areas, is
increasing at an alarming pace (Kondratas, 1991; Toro & Wall, 1991).
Certainly, it is not difficult to see the number of people who live in
transport terminals, parks, flophouses, homeless shelters, cars, and
storefronts. It is hard to determine how many of these homeless people
were deinstitutionalized before adequate support services were present
in a community. We do know, however, that the homeless have
significantly poorer psychological adjustment and higher arrests and
conviction records (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2003).
The solution, although complex, probably does not call for a return to
the old institutions of the 1950s but rather for the provision of more
and better community-based treatment facilities and alternatives
(Kiesler, 1991).

O R M A L P S Y C H O LO G Y

For patients involved in alternative community programs, the picture
appears somewhat more positive. After reviewing reports of experimental
studies on alternative treatment, a group of researchers concluded that
such patients fared at least as well as those in institutions. Where
differences were found, they favored the alternative programs (Braun et
al., 1981). Such studies are few, however, and much remains to be done
if deinstitutionalized patients are to be provided with the best
supportive treatment.

The Therapist-Client Relationship The therapist-client relationship
involves a number of legal, moral, and ethical issues. Three primary
concerns are issues of confidentiality and privileged communication; the
therapist's duty to warn others of a risk posed by a dangerous client;
and the therapist's obligation to avoid sexual intimacies with clients.

Conﬁdentiality and Privileged Communication Basic to the
therapist-patient relationship is the premise that therapy involves a
deeply personal association in which clients have a right to expect that
whatever they say will be kept private. Therapists believe that genuine
therapy cannot occur unless clients trust their therapists and believe
that they will not divulge confidential communications. Without this
guarantee, clients may not be completely open with their thoughts and
may thereby lose the benefits of therapy. Confidentiality is an ethical
standard that protects clients from disclosure of information without
their consent. The importance of confidentiality is also shared by the
public; in one study it was found that 74 percent of respondents thought
everything told to a therapist should be confidential; indeed, 69
percent believed that whatever they discussed was never disclosed
(Miller & Thelen, 1986). Confidentiality, however, is an ethical, not a
legal, obligation. Privileged communication, a narrower legal concept,
protects privacy and prevents the disclosure of confidential
communications without a client's permission (Corey et al., 2003;
Herlicky & Sheeley, 1988). An important part of this concept is that the
"holder of the privilege" is the client, not the therapist. In other
words, if a client waives this privilege, the therapist has no grounds
for withholding information. Our society recognizes how important
certain confidential relationships are and protects them by law. These
relationships are the husband-wife, attorney-client, pastor-congregant,
and therapist-client relationships. Psychiatric practices are regulated
in all fifty states and the District of Columbia, and most have
privileged-communication statutes.

conﬁdentiality an ethical standard

that protects clients from disclosure of information without their
consent; an ethical obligation of the therapist privileged communication

a therapist's legal obligation to protect a client's privacy and to
prevent the disclosure of conﬁdential communications without a client's
permission

Exemptions from Privileged Communication Although states vary
considerably, all states recognize certain situations in which
communications can be divulged (Brown & Srebalus, 2003). Corey and
associates (1998) summarized these conditions: 1. In situations that
deal with civil or criminal commitment or competency to stand trial, the
client's right to privilege can be waived. 2. Disclosure can also be
made when a client sees a therapist and introduces his or her mental
condition as a claim or defense in a civil action. 3. When the client is
younger than sixteen years of age or is a dependent elderly person and
information leads the therapist to believe that the individual has been
a victim of crime (incest, rape, or child and elder abuse), the
therapist must provide that information to the appropriate protective
services agency. 4. When the therapist has reason to believe that a
client presents a danger to himself or herself (possible injury or
suicide) or may potentially harm someone else, the therapist must act to
ward off the danger. Privilege in communication is not absolute. Rather,
it strikes a delicate balance between the individual's right to privacy
and the public's need to know certain information (Leslie, 1991).
Problems arise when we try to determine what the balance should be and
how important various events and facts are in individual cases.

The Therapist-Client Relationship

493

The Duty-to-Warn Principle At the beginning of the chapter, we briefly
described the case of Prosenjit Poddar (Tarasoff v. Board of Regents of
the University of California, 1976), a graduate student who killed
Tatiana Tarasoff after notifying his therapist that he intended to take
her life. Before the homicide, the therapist had decided that Poddar was
dangerous and likely to carry out his threat, and he had notified the
director of the psychiatric clinic that the client was dangerous. He
also informed the campus police, hoping that they would detain the
student. Surely the therapist had done all that could be reasonably
expected. Not so, ruled the California Supreme Court. In the Tarasoff
ruling, the court stated that when a therapist determines, according to
the standards of the mental health profession, that a patient presents a
serious danger to another, the therapist is obligated to warn the
intended victim. The court went on to say that protective privilege ends
where public peril begins. In general, courts have ruled that therapists
have a responsibility to protect the public from dangerous acts of
violent clients and have held therapists accountable for (1) failing to
diagnose or predict dangerousness, (2) failing to warn potential
victims, (3) failing to commit dangerous individuals, and (4)
prematurely discharging dangerous clients from a hospital. Criticism of
the Duty-to-Warn Principle The Tarasoff ruling seems to place the
therapist in the unenviable role of being a double agent (Bednar et al.,
1991). Therapists have an ethical and legal obligation to their clients,
but they also have legal obligations to society. Not only can these dual
obligations conflict with one another, but they can also be quite
ambiguous. Many situations exist in which state courts must rule to
clarify the implications and uncertainties of the "duty-to-warn" rule
(Fulero, 1988). Siegel (1979) loudly criticized the Tarasoff ruling,
stating that the outcome was a hollow victory for individual parties,
but it was devastating for the mental health professions. He reasoned
that if confidentiality had been an absolute policy, Poddar might have
been kept in treatment, thus ultimately saving Tarasoff's life. Other
mental health professionals have echoed this theme in one form or
another. Hostile clients with pent-up feelings and emotions may be less
likely to act out or become violent when allowed to vent their thoughts.
The irony, according to critics, is that the duty-to-warn principle may
actually be counterproductive to its intent to protect the potential
victim. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and Conﬁdentiality
of College Student Life Elizabeth Shin, a nineteen-year-old sophomore at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was believed to have
set fire to herself and died on April 14, 2000. Two years after the
death, her parents filed a \$27 million wrongful death suit against MIT,
accusing them of breach of contract, medical malpractice, and negligence
on the part of university psychiatrists, student life staff, and campus
police. The Shins contend that MIT knew their daughter had made suicide
attempts, cut herself frequently, and suffered from depression but
failed to inform them of her deteriorating mental state. Had they done
so, they assert, Elizabeth Shin might still be alive today. They further
claim that MIT broke the "business contract" with the family, which they
say is implied in their daughter's college enrollment at MIT. Not unlike
the Tarasoff case, the outcome of the Shins' lawsuit had the power to
set legal precedence and potentially radically change the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act that prevents colleges and
universities from disclosing any personal information about students,
even to their parents. Colleges and universities generally assume that
students are adults, and if they were required to report every problem
to parents, they would infantilize students by sending the wrong
message. Students may also be less inclined to share personal
information with school officials if they knew that such information may
be reported back to their parents. Yet institutions of higher education
are very aware that they are grappling to minister to an undergraduate
population that seems to require more coddling and mental health care
than ever before. One national study of counseling center client
problems over thirteen years reveals that students are entering with
more severe problems than in the past

A DUTY TO WARN Tatiana Tarasoff, a college student, was stabbed to death
in 1969 by Prosenjit Poddar, a graduate student at the University of
California at Berkeley. Although Poddar's therapist notiﬁed the
university that he thought Poddar was dangerous, the California Supreme
Court ruled that the therapist should have warned the victim as well.

Tarasoff ruling often referred to as the "duty-to-warn" principle;
obligates mental health professionals to break conﬁdentiality when their
clients pose clear and imminent danger to another person

O R M A L P S Y C H O LO G Y

(Benton et al., 2003). The lawsuit never tested the issue of student
confidentiality and privacy, because the case was settled out of court
in 2005 for an undisclosed sum and an agreement by MIT that the Shins'
daughter died by accident rather than suicide to protect both parties
involved.

Sexual Relationships with Clients Therapeutic practice can also be
legally regulated by civil lawsuits brought by clients against their
therapists for professional malpractice. To be successful, however,
these lawsuits must satisfy four conditions: (1) the plaintiff must have
been involved in a professional therapeutic relationship with the
therapist, (2) there must have been negligence in the care of the
client, (3) demonstrable harm must have occurred, and (4) there must be
a cause-effect relationship between the negligence and harm. If these
four conditions are demonstrated, a jury may find the therapist guilty
and award the plaintiff monetary damages. Although malpractice claims
can be brought in any number of situations, by far the most common type
involves sexual intimacies with a current or former client (Corey et
al., 2003; Olarte, 1997). Traditionally, mental health practitioners
have emphasized the importance of separating their personal and
professional lives. They reasoned that therapists need to be objective
and removed from their clients because becoming emotionally involved
with them was nontherapeutic. A therapist in a personal relationship
with a client may be less confrontative, may fulfill his or her own
needs at the expense of the client's, and may unintentionally exploit
the client because of his or her position (Corey et al., 1998, 2003).
Although some people question the belief that a social or personal
relationship is necessarily antitherapeutic, matters of personal
relations with clients, especially those dealing with erotic and sexual
intimacies, are receiving increasing attention. Sexual misconduct of
therapists is considered to be one of the most serious of all ethical
violations. Indeed, virtually all professional organizations condemn
sexual intimacies in the therapist-client relationship. The American
Psychological Association (1995) states explicitly, "Psychologists do
not engage in sexual intimacies with current patients or clients"
(p. 474). But how do practitioners view sexual intimacies with clients?
How often do such intimacies really occur? Who does what to whom? Some
studies indicate that being sexually attracted to a client or engaging
in sexual fantasy about one is not uncommon among therapists (Pope &
Tabachnick, 1993; Pope, Tabachnick, & Keith-Spiegel, 1987). Furthermore,
complaints to state licensing boards about sexual misconduct by
therapists have increased significantly (Zamichow, 1993). Although these
are indisputable facts, the vast majority of psychologists are able to
control their sexual feelings and to behave in a professional manner.

Cultural Competence and the Mental Health Profession Many mental health
professionals assert that the prevailing concepts of mental health and
mental disorders are culture bound and that contemporary theories of
therapy are based on values specific to a middle-class, white, highly
individualistic, and ethnocentric population (American Psychological
Association, 2003; Sue & Sue, 2008a). There are strong concerns that the
services offered to culturally different clients are frequently
antagonistic or inappropriate to their life experiences and that these
services not only lack sensitivity and understanding but may also be
oppressive and discriminating toward minority populations. These
assertions about counseling and psychotherapy are echoed by other
marginalized groups (women, gays/lesbians, disabled, etc.) in our
society as well. The American Psychological Association (2002), in its
most recent Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, has
made it clear that working with culturally different clients is
unethical unless the mental health professional has adequate training
and expertise in multicultural psychology. Such a position has resulted
in the development of "Guidelines for Providers of Psychological
Services to Ethnic,

Cultural Competence and the Mental Health Profession

CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND THERAPY The Teaching Tolerance program,
founded in 1991 by the Southern Poverty Law Center, supports the efforts
of K--12 teachers and other educators to promote respect for differences
and appreciation of diversity. This photo was taken at the Mix It Up at
Lunch Day program, which encourages students to step outside their
social boundaries through various activities.

Linguistic, and Culturally Diverse Populations" (American Psychological
Association, 1993) and "Guidelines for Psychotherapy with Lesbian, Gay,
and Bisexual Clients" (American Psychological Association, 2000). In a
historic move by the American Psychological Association (2003), the
Council of Representatives passed "Guidelines on Multicultural
Education, Training, Research, Practice, and Organizational Change for
Psychologists." This document has now become official policy of the
American Psychological Association and extends to nearly every realm of
psychological practice. One of the most comprehensive guidelines on
racial/ethnic minorities to be proposed, the document makes it clear
that service providers need to become aware of how their own culture,
life experiences, attitudes, values, and biases have influenced them. It
also emphasizes the importance of cultural and environmental factors in
diagnosis and treatment, and it insists that therapists respect and
consider using traditional healing approaches intrinsic to a client's
culture. Finally, it suggests that therapists learn more about cultural
issues and seek consultation when confronted with culturalspecific
problems. Inherent in all these documents is their call for "cultural
competence" and the conclusion that psychotherapy may represent biased,
discriminatory, and unethical treatment if the racial/cultural
backgrounds of clients are ignored and if the therapist does not possess
adequate training in working with a culturally diverse population. From
this perspective, mental health professionals have a moral and
professional responsibility to become culturally competent if they work
with people who differ from them in terms of race, culture, ethnicity,
gender, sexual orientation, and so forth. To become culturally competent
requires mental health professionals to strive toward attaining three
goals (Sue & Sue, 2008a): (1) to become aware of and deal with the
biases, stereotypes, and assumptions that affect their practice; (2) to
become aware of the culturally different client's values and worldview;
and (3) to develop appropriate intervention strategies that take into
account the social, cultural, historical, and environmental influences
on culturally different clients. As we have seen, the increased
awareness of multicultural influences in our understanding of abnormal
psychology is reflected in the most recent version of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV-TR;
American Psychiatric Association, 2000a). For the first time since its
publication in 1952, DSM is acknowledging the importance of culture in
the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.

I M P L I C AT I O N S

It is clear that psychology is increasingly serving a larger and larger
role in our legal system. From evaluating the mental state of people to
aiding in decisions regarding the care and treatment of patients,
psychological knowledge has informed and been informed by legal statutes
that guide our behavior. More important, mental health professionals
realize that they do not work in isolation from the broader society and
that clinical decisions must take into consideration changing legal
precedents and the law. Just as psychological science may produce new
knowledge that will affect the legal system and change our roles (such
as better prediction of dangerousness and violence), so too the legal
landscape may change and affect the field of abnormal psychology as
well. None of us can accurately predict the nature and form of future
laws that may potentially affect the role of psychologists and our
perspectives on abnormal behavior.

Summary 1. What are the criteria used to judge insanity, and what is the
difference between being insane and being incompetent to stand trial? ■
Insanity is a legal concept. Historically, several standards have been
used. ■ The M'Naghten Rule holds that people can be acquitted of a crime
if it can be shown that their reasoning was so defective that they were
unaware of their actions or, if aware of their actions, were unable to
comprehend the wrongness of them. The irresistible impulse test holds
that people are innocent if they are unable to control their behavior.
The Durham decision acquits people if their criminal actions were
products of mental disease or defects. The American Law Institute
guidelines state that people are not responsible for a crime if they
lack substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of their conduct
or to conform their conduct to the requirements of the law. ■ The phrase
"competency to stand trial" refers to defendants' mental state at the
time they are being examined. It is a separate issue from criminal
responsibility, which refers to past behavior at the time of the
offense. Accused people are considered incompetent if they have
difficulty understanding the trial proceedings or cannot rationally
consult with attorneys in their defense. Although competency to stand
trial is important in ensuring fair trials, being judged incompetent can
have negative consequences, such as unfair and prolonged denial of civil
liberties. 2. Under what conditions can a person be involuntarily
committed to a mental institution? ■ People who have committed no crime
can be confined against their will if it can be shown that (1) they
present a clear and imminent danger to themselves or others, (2) they
are unable to care for themselves, (3) they are

496

unable to make responsible decisions about appropriate treatment and
hospitalization, and (4) they are in an unmanageable state of fright or
panic. ■ Courts have tightened criteria and rely more than ever on the
concept of dangerousness. Mental health professionals have great
difficulty in predicting dangerousness because dangerous acts depend as
much on social situations as on personal attributes and because the
definition is unclear. 3. What rights do mental patients have with
respect to treatment and care issues? ■ Concern with patients' rights
has become an issue because many practices and procedures seem to
violate constitutional guarantees. As a result, court rulings have
established several important precedents. Among these are the right to
treatment and the right to refuse treatment. 4. What is
deinstitutionalization? ■ During the 1960s and 1970s, the policy of
deinstitutionalization became popular: the shifting of responsibility
for the care of mental patients from large central institutions to
agencies within the local community. Deinstitutionalization was
considered a promising answer to the "least restrictive environment"
ruling and to monetary problems experienced by state governments.
Critics, however, have accused the states of "dumping" former patients
and avoiding their responsibilities under the guise of mental health
innovations. 5. What legal and ethical issues govern the
therapist-client relationship? ■ Most mental health professionals
believe that confidentiality is crucial to the therapist-client
relationship. Exceptions to this privilege include situations that
involve (1) civil or criminal commitment and competency to

Summary

stand trial, (2) a client's initiation of a lawsuit for malpractice or a
civil action in which the client's mental condition is introduced, (3)
the belief that child or elder abuse has occurred, (4) a criminal
action, or (5) the danger a client poses to himself or herself or to
others. ■ Although psychologists have always known that privileged
communication is not an absolute right, the Tarasoff decision makes
therapists responsible for warning a potential victim to avoid
liability. ■ Sexual misconduct by therapists is considered to be one of
the most serious of all ethical violations by virtually all professional
organizations.

497

6.  What is cultural competence in the mental health profession? ■ Major
    demographic changes are forcing mental health

professionals to consider culture, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic
status as powerful variables in (1) the manifestation of mental
disorders and (2) the need to provide culturally appropriate
intervention strategies for minority groups. Increasingly, mental health
organizations are taking the position that it is unethical to treat
members of marginalized groups without adequate training and expertise
in multicultural psychology.

A

t some time in our lives, all of us have experienced personal, social,
and emotionally distressing problems. Although many of us have been
fortunate enough to handle such difﬁculties on our own, others have been
greatly helped by discussing them with someone who could reassure and
advise them. People have always relied on friends, relatives, members of
the clergy, teachers, and even strangers for advice, emotional and
social support, approval, and validation. In our society, however, this
function has been increasingly taken over by psychotherapists. In
preceding chapters, we have examined a wide variety of disorders,
ranging from personality disturbances to schizophrenia. We have also
examined the treatment approaches that seem to help people suffering
from these disorders. In this chapter, we provide a more rounded view of
the various techniques used to treat psychopathology: biology-based
approaches, individual psychotherapy (both insight and action
approaches), and group, family, and couples therapies. We also provide
insights into therapeutic approaches in working with four major
racial/ethnic minority groups: African Americans, Asian Americans/Paciﬁc
Islanders, Latino or Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans. We end
the chapter with a brief examination of community psychology.

Biology-Based Treatment Techniques Biological or somatic treatment
techniques use physical means to alter the patient's physiological state
and

hence his or her psychological state (Kolb, Gibb, & Robinson, 2003;
Lickey & Gordon, 1991; Miller & Keller, 2000). The basic philosophy
underlying this approach can be traced to ancient times, beginning with
the practices of trephining (see the chapter on abnormal behavior) and
bleeding and purging (laxatives and emetics) unwanted substances from
the body. These primitive and barbaric methods of treatment have given
way to more enlightened and benign forms. As our understanding of human
physiology and brain functioning has increased, so has our ability to
provide more effective biologically based therapies for the mentally ill
(Department of Health and Human Services \[DHHS\], 1999). Three such
techniques are examined here: electroconvulsive therapy, psychosurgery,
and psychopharmacology (medication or drug therapy).

Electroconvulsive Therapy Many people consider physically shocking the
patient's body an abhorrent form of treatment. But electroconvulsive
therapy (ECT) can be used successfully to treat certain mental
disorders. This is especially true for severe depressive reactions, in
which it can effect quite dramatic improvements (National Institute of
Mental Health, 1985; Sackheim, Prudic, & Devanand, 1990). But how ECT
acts to improve depression is still unclear. Whatever the mechanism, ECT
seems to be effective against severe depression. Indeed, psychologist
Norman Endler (1990) wrote a biography about his own struggle with
depression and how ECT greatly helped his recovery. Evidence

499

Therapeutic Interventions

suggests that the treatment is particularly useful for endogenous cases
of depression---those in which some internal cause can be determined
(Klerman et al., 1994; see also the chapter on mood disorders). The ﬁrst
therapeutic use of shock was insulin shock treatment, introduced in the
1930s by psychiatrist Manfred Sakel. Insulin was injected into the
patient's body, drastically reducing the blood sugar level. The patient
then went into convulsions and coma. The behavior of some patients with
schizophrenia improved after awakening from this shock treatment. Also
in the 1930s, another psychiatrist, Lazlo von Meduna, hypothesized that
schizophrenia and epileptic seizures are antagonistic (seizures seem to
prevent schizophrenic symptoms) and that by inducing convulsions in
people with schizophrenia he could eliminate their bizarre behaviors.
Meduna injected patients with the drug metrazol to induce the seizures.
Neither insulin nor metrazol shock treatment was very effective,
however, and their use declined with the advent of electroconvulsive
therapy. In 1938, two Italian psychiatrists, Ugo Cerletti and Lucio
Bini, introduced electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or electroshock
treatment. ECT is the application of electric voltage to the brain to
induce convulsions. The patient lies on a padded bed or couch and is
ﬁrst injected with a muscle relaxant to minimize the chance of
self-injury during the later convulsions. Then 65 to 140 volts of
electricity are applied to the temporal region of the patient's skull,
through electrodes, for 0.1 to 0.5 seconds. Convulsions occur, followed
by coma. On regaining consciousness, the patient is often confused and
suffers a memory loss for events immediately before and after the ECT.
Research indicates that unilateral shock (applying shock to only one
hemisphere) causes less confusion and memory loss and is just as
effective as bilateral shock (Abrams & Essman, 1982; Horne, Pettinati,
Sugerman, & Varga, 1985). For several reasons, the use of ECT declined
in the 1960s and 1970s, despite its success. The ﬁrst reason was concern
that ECT might cause permanent damage to important parts of the brain.
Indeed, animals that have undergone ECT treatment show brain damage.
Would it be unreasonable to expect similar damage in human beings?
Second, a small percentage of patients fracture or dislocate bones
during treatment. Although modern techniques have reduced pain and side
effects (the convulsions are now almost unnoticeable), many patients
anticipate a very unpleasant experience. Third, clinicians often argue
that the "beneﬁcial changes" initially observed in patients after ECT do
not persist over the long term. Fourth, the abuses and side effects of
ECT have been dramatized---often sensationally---in the mass media. In
the movie One Flew

Shocking the Brain Electroconvulsive therapy involves the administration
of electric shock to the brain. The treatment appears to be effective,
especially with severe depression, although the precise reasons for its
effectiveness are unclear.

Over the Cuckoo's Nest, for instance, ECT was administered repeatedly to
the protagonist because he would not conform to regulations while in a
mental hospital (such use of ECT is now illegal and probably
nonexistent). Fifth, and most important, recent advances in medication
have diminished the need for ECT, except in the treatment of people with
profound depression for whom medications act too slowly.

Psychosurgery As noted in the chapter on cognitive disorders, damage to
brain tissue can dramatically alter a person's emotional characteristics
and intellectual functioning. In the 1930s, the Portuguese neurologist
Egas Moniz theorized that destroying certain connections in the brain,
particularly in the frontal lobes, could disrupt psychotic thought
patterns and behaviors. During the 1940s and 1950s,
psychosurgery---brain surgery performed for the purpose of correcting a
severe mental disorder---became increasingly popular. The treatment was
used most often with patients suffering from schizophrenia and severe
depression, although many who had personality and anxiety disorders also
underwent psychosurgery. Psychosurgery is a term applied to several
procedures or techniques. In a prefrontal lobotomy holes are drilled in
the skull, and a leukotome (a hollow tube that extrudes a cutting wire)
is inserted through the holes to cut nerve ﬁbers between the frontal
lobes and the thalamus or hypothalamus. In transorbital lobotomy, the
instrument is inserted through the eye socket, eliminating the need to
drill holes in the skull. In a lobectomy, some or all of the frontal
lobe is removed (to treat such disorders as brain tumors). Parts of the

Biology-Based Treatment Techniques

brain may also be subjected to electrical cauterization (searing or
burning), which destroys selected brain tissue. Psychosurgical
techniques have been reﬁned to the point at which it is possible to
operate on extremely small and contained areas of the brain. For
example, videolaserscopy allows the surgeon to use a video camera in
making extremely small incisions with a laser (Cowley, 1990). Critics of
psychosurgical procedures have raised both scientiﬁc and ethical
objections. In the case of lobotomies, for example, initial reports of
results were enthusiastic, but later evaluations indicated that the
patient's improvement or lack of improvement was independent of the
psychosurgical treatment. In addition, serious negative and irreversible
side effects were frequently observed. Although postlobotomy patients
often became quite manageable, calm, and less anxious, many emerged from
surgery with impaired cognitive and intellectual functioning, were
listless (even vegetative), or showed uninhibited impulsive behavior.
Some such patients were described as "robots" or "zombies." A small
number suffered from continuing seizures and, in rare cases, some died
from the surgery. Finally, because psychosurgery always produces
permanent brain damage, some critics called for a halt to this form of
treatment on humanitarian grounds. On the whole, restriction and
regulation of its use seem wise.

Psychopharmacology Psychopharmacology is the study of the effects of
drugs on the mind and on behavior; it is also known as medication or
drug therapy. The use of medications has generally replaced shock
treatment and psychosurgery for treating serious behavior disorders.
Since the 1950s medication has been a major factor in allowing the early
discharge of hospitalized mental patients and permitting them to
function in the community. Medication is now widely used throughout the
United States: more mental patients receive drug therapy than receive
all other forms of therapy combined (Levinthal, 2005). Table 17.1 lists
the generic and brand names of the drugs most frequently prescribed to
treat psychological disorders. The rise in the use of minor
tranquilizers has become a concern to society because of possible abuses
and because of their addictive qualities. Some researchers have also
noted that gender bias may operate in the extent to which they are
prescribed for women. Studies indicate that women receive twice as many
antianxiety medication prescriptions than are given to men; that
although women make up only slightly more than one-half of the patients
seen by psychiatrists, they receive 73 percent of all prescriptions;

501

and that male psychiatrists prescribe medication twice as often as their
female counterparts (Cypress, 1980; Hohmann, Larson, Thompson, &
Beardsley, 1988; Rossiter, 1983). These issues will become even more
prominent because many psychologists are advocating for the right to
prescribe medication to their psychiatric patients, a right that has
been largely limited to physicians (Gutierrez & Silk, 1998; Norﬂeet,
2002). We discuss four major categories of medication in this section.
These are the antianxiety drugs (or minor tranquilizers), the
antipsychotic drugs (or major tranquilizers), the antidepressant drugs
(which relieve depression by elevating one's mood), and antimanic drugs
(such as lithium). Many of these will be familiar to you from our
earlier discussions in the context of speciﬁc disorders. Antianxiety
Drugs (Minor Tranquilizers) Before

the 1950s, barbiturates were often prescribed to relieve anxiety.
Barbiturates are sedatives that have a calming effect but that are also
highly addictive. Many people who take barbiturates develop a physical
tolerance to these medications and require increasing doses to obtain
the same effects. An overdose can result in death, and discontinuing the
medication can produce agonizing withdrawal symptoms. Moreover, physical
and mental disturbances, such as muscular incoordination and mental
confusion, can result even from normal dosages. For these reasons, the
barbiturates were replaced with antianxiety drugs almost as soon as the
latter became available. During the 1940s and 1950s, the propanediols
(meprobamate compounds) and benzodiazepines took over as the preferred
medications. Researchers ﬁrst developed meprobamate (the generic name of
Miltown and Equanil) for use as a muscle relaxant and anxiety reducer.
Within a few years, it was being prescribed for patients who complained
of anxiety and nervousness or who had psychosomatic problems. Soon other
antianxiety drugs, the benzodiazepines (Librium and Valium), also
entered the market. Studies suggest that the benzodiazepines work by
binding to speciﬁc receptor sites at the synapses and blocking
transmission, which is another piece of evidence that supports the
hypothesis that anxiety, like many other mental conditions, is linked to
brain structure and physiology (Hayward, Wardie, & Higgitt, 1989). The
antianxiety medications can be addictive and can impair psychomotor
skills; discontinuing them after prolonged usage at high doses can
result in withdrawal symptoms (DHHS, 1999). But they are considered
safer than barbiturates, and there is little doubt that they effectively
reduce anxiety and the behavioral symptoms of anxiety disorder.

The major problem with the minor tranquilizers is the great potential
for overuse and overreliance. Because of its selective ability to
diminish anxiety and leave adaptive behavior intact, Valium has been
widely prescribed in the past. In addition, antianxiety drugs have
gained in popularity among the general public, and they are widely used
in relieving psychological problems. Almost everyone feels anxious at
one time or another, and the antianxiety drugs are effective, readily
available, low in cost, and easy to administer. They are a quick, easy
alternative to developing personal coping skills. As a result, people
tend to choose the short-term relief offered by these medications over
the long-term but more gradual gains of developing the ability to manage
stress and to learn to solve one's own problems. Antipsychotic

impact on the hallucinations and distorted thinking of highly agitated
patients and patients with schizophrenia. In 1950 a synthetic sedative
was developed in France. This medication, chlorpromazine (the generic
name of Thorazine), had an unexpected tranquilizing effect that
decreased patients' interest in the events taking place around them.
Within less than a year after its introduction, some 2 million patients
used Thorazine. Chlorpromazine also seemed to reduce psychotic symptoms
(believed to be a biochemical effect of blocking dopamine receptors).
Thereafter, a number of other major tranquilizers were developed, mainly
for administration to patients with schizophrenia. (The chapter on
schizophrenia discusses use of medication as a treatment for this
disorder.) Several experimental studies have demonstrated the efﬁcacy of
antipsychotic drugs in treating schizophrenia (Klerman et al., 1994). A
review of many large-scale controlled studies indicates that the ben-

Biology-Based Treatment Techniques

eﬁcial effects of Thorazine, Stelazine, Prolixin, and other
antipsychotic drugs have allowed institutions to release thousands of
chronic "incurable" mental patients throughout the country (Lickey &
Gordon, 1991; Wender & Klein, 1981). When patients hospitalized with
schizophrenia were given phenothiazines (a class of major
tranquilizers), they showed more social interaction with others, better
self-management, and less agitation and excitement than when they were
given placebos. Despite their recognized effectiveness, antipsychotic
drugs do not always reduce anxiety, and they can produce side effects.
Patients may develop psychomotor symptoms resembling those of
Parkinson's disease, sensitivity to light, dryness of the mouth,
drowsiness, or liver disease. After an extended period of continuous
treatment with antipsychotic drugs, some patients (usually patients
older than forty years of age) develop tardive dyskinesia---a disorder
characterized by involuntary movement of the head, tongue, and
extremities. Patients discharged from hospitals typically show only
marginal adjustments to community life, and psychotic symptoms usually
return when the medication is discontinued. As a result, the
rehospitalization rate is high. Nevertheless, medication or drug therapy
is very important in treating schizophrenia, and nearly all psychiatric
institutions use it. Antipsychotic drugs have dramatically increased the
proportion of patients with this disorder who can return to and function
in the community, even though they may show residual symptoms.

503

Antidepressant Drugs As in the case of antipsy-

chotic drugs, the development of antidepressants was aided by a
fortunate coincidence. During the 1950s, clinicians noticed that
patients treated with the antituberculosis medication iproniazid became
happier and more optimistic. When tested on people diagnosed with
depression, the medication was found to be effective as an
antidepressant. Unfortunately, liver damage and fatalities caused by the
medication were relatively high. Continued interest in antidepressants
has led to the identiﬁcation of three large classes of the compounds:
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclics, and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (a type of tricyclic). Monoamine oxidase (MAO)
inhibitors are antidepressant compounds that are believed to correct the
balance of neurotransmitters in the brain. A number of the MAO
inhibitors, such as phenelzine, were found to be less dangerous but
similar in effect to iproniazid. It is hypothesized that the MAO
inhibitors work primarily to correct a deﬁciency in concentrations of
neurotransmitters in the brain. They block the action of monoamine
oxidase, thereby preventing the breakdown of norepinephrine and
serotonin. As you may recall from the chapters on abnormal behavior and
on mood disorders, the lack of these neurotransmitters at pertinent
synaptic sites has been implicated in depression. Although the MAO
inhibitors relieve depression, they produce certain toxic effects and
require careful dietary monitoring. (Certain foods and other drugs, when
taken with an MAO inhibitor, could cause severe illness.) More
frequently used in cases of depression are the tricyclics,
antidepressant compounds that relieve symptoms of depression and seem to
work like the MAO inhibitors but produce fewer of the side effects
associated with prolonged drug use. The medication imipramine, a
tricyclic, has been at least as effective as psychotherapy in relieving
the symptoms of depression (Elkin et al., 1995). Until recently, the
tricyclics were the most widely used medication in treating depression.
Medications that may replace tricyclics as the preferred medication for
treating depression are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
They work by inhibiting the central nervous system's neuronal uptake of
serotonin---a mechanism that appears to be the treatment of choice for
unipolar depression (Seligman & Levant, 1998). SSRIs include the drugs
Prozac (ﬂuoxetine hydrochloride), Paxil (paroxetine), and Zoloft
(sertraline). The use of SSRIs has increased dramatically. These drugs
affect serotonin but not other neurotransmitters, take effect in a
shorter period of time than other antidepressants, have fewer side
effects than the tricyclics, and are less likely to result in
overdosing. However,

504

Chapter 18

Therapeutic Interventions

reported side effects include feeling jittery and having stomach
irritation. In October 2004, the Food and Drug Administration issued a
"black box" warning on the use of antidepressants with children and
adolescents. Ironically, it was shown that the use of many popular
antidepressants increased the risk of children's suicidal thinking
and/or behaviors. Research is being conducted to determine which
antidepressants have this unfortunate effect and what would explain
susceptibility to suicidal ideation and behavior. Antimanic Drugs
Lithium is another mood-controlling (antimanic) medication that has been
very effective in treating bipolar disorders, especially mania (Klerman
et al., 1994). About 70 to 80 percent of manic states can be controlled
by lithium, and it also controls depressive episodes. How lithium works
remains highly speculative. One hypothesis is that it somehow limits the
availability of serotonin and norepinephrine at the synapses and
produces an effect opposite from that of the antidepressants. Yet
lithium's ability to relieve depression appears to contradict this
explanation. Other speculations involve electrolyte changes in the body,
which alter neurotransmission in some manner. Strangely enough, lithium,
which is administered as a salt, has no known physiological function.
Yet with proper administration of lithium---a single tablet in the
morning and another in the evening---patients' manic and depressive
cycles can be modulated or prevented. However, cautions limit its use in
treating bipolar disorders. First, it is largely preventive and must be
taken before symptoms appear. Once a manic or depressive state occurs,
lithium's effect is minimal. Second, it is often extremely difﬁcult to
determine a patient's appropriate dosage. The effective dosage level
often borders on toxicity, which can cause convulsions, delirium, and
other bad effects. Careful and constant monitoring of the lithium level
in a patient's blood is very important. Psychopharmacological
Considerations A major issue in psychopharmacology is deciding which
medication to use with which kind of patient under what circumstances
(Grilly, 2002). For example, although imipramine is more effective with
longstanding and severe depressions without speciﬁc situational causes,
antidepressants often do not begin to help patients until two to three
weeks after treatment begins. The SSRI drugs appear to work more
quickly. If very rapid improvement is necessary, ECT may be used as a
last resort to treat a patient with severe depression or suicidal
ideation.

The use of antidepressant, antianxiety, and antipsychotic drugs has
greatly changed therapy. Patients who take them report that they feel
better, that symptoms decline, and that overall functioning improves.
Long periods of hospitalization are no longer needed in most cases, and
patients are more amenable to other forms of treatment, such as
psychotherapy. Remember, however, that medications do not cure mental
disorders. Some would characterize their use as "control measures,"
somewhat better than traditional hospitalization, "straitjackets," or
"padded cells." Furthermore, medications seem to be most effective in
treating "active" symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and
aggression and much less effective with "passive" symptoms such as
withdrawal, poor interpersonal relationships, and feelings of
alienation. Medication does not help patients improve their living
skills. A large number of patients discharged from mental hospitals
require continuing medication to function even minimally in the
community. Unfortunately, many of them do not continue to take their
medication after leaving the hospital. Some do not realize the
importance of continued and timely medication. Others are unable to pay
for medication, either individually or through an insurance plan.
Others' lifestyles are not conducive to taking the medications. Once
they discontinue their medications, patients may again experience the
same disorder that led to their hospitalization. Finally, both
medication and psychotherapy (administered together or alone) appear to
be of beneﬁt to clients (Gould, Buckminster, Pollack, Otto, & Yap,
1997).

Psychotherapy In most cases, biological treatments such as medication
are used as an adjunct to psychotherapy. But beyond general agreement
that psychotherapy is an internal approach to treating psychopathology,
involving interaction between one or more clients and a therapist, there
is little consensus on exactly what else it is. Psychotherapy has been
called "a conversation with a therapeutic purpose"; it has also been
called "the talking cure" or the "purchase of friendship" (Sue & Sue,
2003). For our purposes, psychotherapy may be deﬁned as the systematic
application, by a trained and experienced professional therapist, of
techniques derived from psychological principles, for the purpose of
helping psychologically troubled people (Day, 2004; Sommers-Flanagan &
Sommers-Flanagan, 2004). We cannot be more succinct or precise without
getting involved in speciﬁc types of therapy. Depending on their
perspective and theoretical orientation, therapists may seek to modify
attitudes, thoughts, feelings, or

Science, Art, or a Mix of Both? Psychotherapy relies on the systematic
use of techniques based on psychological principles to provide the
client with an opportunity not only for catharsis but also for the
acquisition of new behaviors and expectancies to help overcome
psychological problems.

behaviors; to facilitate the patient's self-insight and rational control
of his or her own life; to cure mental illness; to enhance mental health
and self-actualization; to make clients "feel better"; to remove a cause
of a disorder; to change a self-concept; or to encourage adaptation
(Corey, 2005). Psychotherapy is practiced by many different kinds of
people in many different ways---a fact that seems to preclude
establishing a single set of standard therapeutic procedures. And---
despite our emphasis on the scientiﬁc basis of therapy---in practice it
is often more art than science. Diverse psychotherapies do seem to share
some common therapeutic factors. In one study the investigators examined
ﬁfty publications on psychotherapy and found that the characteristics
common to most of them were (1) development of a therapeutic alliance,
(2) opportunity for catharsis, (3) acquisition and practice of new
behaviors, and (4) the clients' positive expectancies (Grencavage &
Norcross, 1990). These characteristics are very consistent with those
ﬁrst proposed by Korchin (1976) nearly thirty years ago: ■

■

Psychotherapy is a chance for the client to relearn. Many people say to
their psychotherapists, "I know I shouldn't feel or act this way, but I
just can't help it." Psychotherapy provides a chance to unlearn,
relearn, develop, or change certain behaviors or levels of functioning.
Psychotherapy helps generate the development of new, emotionally
important experiences. A person questioning the value of psychotherapy
may ask,

"If I talk about my problems, how will that cause me to change, even
though I may understand myself better? I talk things over now, with
friends." But psychotherapy is not merely a "talking cure." It involves
the reexperiencing of emotions that clients may have avoided, along with
the painful and helpless feelings fostered by these emotions. This
experiencing allows relearning, as well as emotional and intellectual
insight into problems and conﬂicts. ■

A therapeutic relationship exists. Therapists have been trained to
listen, to show empathic concern, to be objective, to value the client's
integrity, to communicate understanding, and to use their professional
knowledge and skills. Therapists may provide reassurance,
interpretations, self-disclosures, reﬂections of the client's feelings,
or information, each at appropriate times. As a team, therapist and
client are better prepared to venture into frightening areas that the
client would not have faced alone.

■

Clients in psychotherapy have certain motivations and expectations. Most
people enter therapy with both anxiety and hope. They are frightened by
their emotional difﬁculties and by the prospect of treatment, but they
expect or hope that therapy will be helpful.

The goals and general characteristics of psychotherapy as described seem
admirable, and most people consider them so. Nevertheless, psychotherapy
itself has been criticized as being biased and inappropriate to the
lifestyles of many clients, including members of minority

506

Chapter 18

Therapeutic Interventions

groups. Indeed, many psychologists have called for psychotherapy
approaches that can better relate to the cultures of different ethnic
groups (Carter & McGoldrick, 2005; Ivey, D'Andrea, Ivey, & Simek-Morgan,
2002; Sue & Sue, 2003). As we shall shortly see, racial/ethnic minority
status must be considered in the provision of psychological services to
these populations. In the next two sections we discuss individual
psychotherapy, in which one therapist treats one client at a time. We
also distinguish between insight- and action-oriented approaches to
individual therapy. This distinction separates approaches that stress
awareness, understanding, and consciousness of one's own motivations
(that is, insight) from those approaches that stress actions, such as
changing one's behavior or thoughts. The ﬁrst set includes the
psychoanalytic and humanistic-existential therapies, whereas the second
set involves mainly behavioral therapies. Following those two
discussions, we turn to group, family, and couples therapy. Despite this
variety of approaches, many therapists use similar treatment strategies.
And, as noted in the chapter on abnormal behavior, many therapists
choose relevant techniques from all the various "pure" approaches to
develop the most effective integrative approach for each particular
client.

Insight-Oriented Approaches to Individual Psychotherapy The theoretical
bases of the major insight-oriented psychotherapies were discussed in
the chapter on models of abnormal behavior. Here we brieﬂy review these
theoretical bases and then discuss the most common treatment techniques.

Psychoanalysis According to Freud's theory of personality, people are
born with certain instinctual drives, urges that constantly seek to
discharge or express themselves. As the personality structure develops,
conﬂicts occur among the id, ego, and superego. If conﬂicts remain
unresolved, they will resurface during adulthood. The relative
importance of such an unresolved conﬂict depends on the psychosexual
stage (oral, anal, phallic, or genital) in which it occurs. The earlier
the stage in which an unresolved conﬂict arises, the greater the
conﬂict's effect on subsequent behaviors. Repressing unacceptable
thoughts and impulses (within the unconscious) is the primary way that
people defend themselves against such thoughts. Psychoanalytic therapy,
or psychoanalysis, seeks to overcome defenses so that (1) repressed
material can be uncovered, (2) the client can achieve insight into his
or

her inner motivations and desires, and (3) unresolved childhood conﬂicts
can be controlled. Traditional psychoanalysis requires many sessions of
therapy over a long period of time. It may not be appropriate for
certain types of people, such as nonverbal adults, young children who
cannot be verbally articulate or reasonable, people with schizoid
disorders, those with urgent problems requiring immediate reduction of
symptoms, and people with mental retardation. Psychoanalysts
traditionally use four methods to achieve their therapeutic goals: free
association and dream analysis, analysis of resistance, transference,
and interpretation. Free Association and Dream Analysis In free

association the patient says whatever comes to mind, regardless of how
illogical or embarrassing it may seem, for the purpose of revealing the
contents of the patient's unconscious. Psychoanalysts believe the
material that surfaces in this process is determined by the patient's
psychic makeup and that it can provide some understanding of the
patient's conﬂicts, unconscious processes, and personality dynamics.
Simply asking patients to talk about their conﬂicts is fruitless,
because they have repressed the most important material from their
consciousness. Instead, reports of dreams, feelings, thoughts, and
fantasies reﬂect a patient's psychodynamics; the therapist's tasks are
to encourage continuous free association of thoughts and to interpret
the results. Similarly, dream analysis is a very important therapeutic
tool that depends on psychoanalytic interpretation of hidden meanings in
dreams. Freud is often credited with referring to dreams as "the royal
road to the unconscious." According to psychoanalytic theory, when
people sleep, defenses and inhibitions of the ego weaken, allowing
unacceptable motives and feelings to surface. This material comes out in
the disguised and symbolic form of a dream. The portion we remember is
called the manifest content, and the deeper, unacceptable impulse is the
latent content. The therapist's job is to uncover the disguised symbolic
meanings and let the patient achieve insight into the anxietyprovoking
implications. Analysis of Resistance Throughout the course of

psychoanalytic therapy, the patient's unconscious may try to impede the
analysis, in a process known as resistance, by preventing the exposure
of repressed material. In free association, for example, the patient may
suddenly change the subject, lose the train of thought, go blank, or
become silent. Such resistance may also show up in a patient's late
arrival or failure to keep an appointment. A trained analyst is alert to
telltale signs of resistance because they indicate that a

Insight-Oriented Approaches to Individual Psychotherapy

sensitive area is being approached. The therapist can make therapeutic
use of properly interpreted instances of resistance to show the patient
that repressed material is coming close to the surface and to suggest
means of uncovering it. Transference When a patient begins to perceive,
or behave toward, the analyst as though the analyst were an important
person in the patient's past, the process of transference is occurring.
In transference the patient reenacts early conﬂicts by carrying over and
applying to the analyst feelings and attitudes that the patient had
toward signiﬁcant others---primarily parents---in the past. These
feelings and attitudes then become accessible to understanding. They may
be positive, involving feelings of love for the analyst, or negative,
involving feelings of anger and hostility. Part of the psychoanalyst's
strategy is to remain "unknown" or ambiguous, so that the client can
freely develop whatever kind of transference is required. The patient is
allowed, even encouraged, to develop unrealistic expectations and
attitudes regarding the analyst. These expectations and attitudes are
used as a basis for helping the patient deal realistically with painful
early experiences. In essence, a miniature neurosis is re-created; its
resolution is considered crucial to the therapy. At the same time, the
analyst must be careful to recognize and control any instances of
countertransference. In this process, the analyst---who is also a human
being with feelings and fears---transfers those feelings to the patient.
This is one reason that Freud believed so strongly that all
psychoanalysts need to undergo psychoanalysis themselves.

Sandy: Huh? Therapist: Who's the "he" who'd be waiting? Sandy: John---I
mean, my father---you're confusing me now. ... My father would sit
there---smoking his pipe. I knew what he was thinking, though---he
didn't have to say it---he was thinking I was a slut! Someone---who, who
was a slut! So what if I stayed up late and had some fun? What business
was it of his? He never took any interest in any of us. \[Begins to
weep.\] It was my mother---rest her soul---who loved us, not our father.
He worked her to death. Lord, I miss her. \[Weeps uncontrollably\]---I
must sound angry at my father. Don't you think I have a right to be
angry? Therapist: Do you think you have a right to be angry? Sandy: Of
course, I do! Why are you questioning me? You don't believe me, do you?
Therapist: You want me to believe you. Sandy: I don't care whether you
believe me or not. As far as I'm concerned, you're just a wall that I'm
talking to---I don't know why I pay for this rotten therapy.---Don't you
have any thoughts or feelings at all? I know what you're thinking---you
think I'm crazy---you must be laughing at me---I'll probably be a case
in your next book! You're just sitting there---smirking---making me feel
like a bad person---thinking I'm wrong for being mad, that I have no
right to be mad. Therapist: Just like your father. Sandy: Yes, you're
just like my father.---Oh my God! Just now---I---I---thought I was
talking to him. Therapist: You mean your father.

Interpretation Through interpretation---the expla-

nation of a patient's free associations, reports of dreams, and the
like---a sensitive analyst can help the patient gain insight (both
intellectual and emotional) into his or her repressed conﬂicts. By
pointing out the symbolic attributes of a transference relationship or
by noting the peculiar timing of symptoms, the analyst can direct the
patient toward conscious control of unconscious conﬂicts. The following
example shows the timely interpretation of an important instance of
transference: Sandy (the patient): John \[her ex-husband\] was just like
my father. Always condemning me, always making me feel like an idiot!
Strange, the two of them---the most important men in my life---they did
the most to screw me up. When I would have fun with my friends and come
home at night, he would be sitting there---waiting---to disapprove.
Therapist (male): Who would be waiting for you?

Sandy: Yes---I'm really scared now---how could I have---can this really
be happening to me? Therapist: I know it must be awfully scary to
realize what just happened---but don't run away now, Sandy. Could it be
that your relationship with your father has affected many of the
relationships you've had with other men? It seems that your reaction to

it?---Is it real? Modern Psychodynamic Therapy In the chapter

on models of abnormal behavior, we noted the contemporary changes in
theoretical formulations of psychodynamic theory, especially the
increased importance of the ego (ego autonomy theorists) and past
interpersonal relationships (object relations theorists). Among the ego
autonomy theorists were people such as Anna Freud,

508

Chapter 18

Therapeutic Interventions

Heinz Hartmann, and Erik Erikson, who believed that cognitive processes
of the ego were often constructive, creative, and productive
(independent from the id). Likewise, object relations theorists such as
Melanie Klein, Margaret Mahler, Otto Kernberg, and Heinz Kohut stressed
the importance of interpersonal relationships and the child's separation
from the mother as important in one's psychological growth. The
contributions of these theorists and practitioners expanded and loosened
the rigid therapeutic techniques of traditional psychoanalysis (James &
Gilliland, 2003). Today, very few psychodynamic therapists practice
traditional psychoanalysis. Most are more active in their sessions,
restrict the number of sessions they have with clients, place greater
emphasis on current rather than past factors, and seem to have adopted a
number of clientcentered techniques in their practice (Nystul, 2003).
The Effectiveness of Psychoanalysis Psycho-

analysis has been criticized for a number of reasons. Psychoanalysts
tend to select certain kinds of clients for treatment, usually those who
are young, white, and highly educated (Garﬁeld, 1994). This means that
psychoanalysis has been limited in addressing the needs of a larger
population. Providing operational deﬁnitions for such constructs as the
unconscious and the libido has been problematic, making it extremely
difﬁcult to conﬁrm the various aspects of the theory. For example,
psychoanalytic theory suggests that neurotic or anxiety symptoms are
caused by underlying emotional conﬂicts. (DSM in the past had a
diagnostic category for "neurotic disorders," which is no longer used.
Psychoanalysts often refer to neuroses or neurotic disorders because the
disorders have played an important role in conceptualizing
psychoanalytic views.) When these symptoms are eliminated without
removing the conﬂict, the person merely expresses the neurosis in other
ways and shows other symptoms---a phenomenon known as symptom
substitution. Many researchers, particularly behavior therapists, assert
that it is possible to eliminate neurotic or anxiety symptoms without
symptom substitution occurring. Furthermore, they contend that when the
symptoms are eliminated, the neurosis or anxiety disorder is cured. Thus
psychoanalysis has encountered many problems despite its vast inﬂuence
in the ﬁeld of psychotherapy. Although it is still widely practiced,
many therapists do not strictly follow all psychoanalytic procedures,
preferring psychodynamic or ego psychological modiﬁcations. Many
psychotherapists predict that the use of psychoanalysis will decline in
the future (Norcross & Freedheim, 1992).

Humanistic-Existential Therapies In contrast to the psychic determinism
implicit in psychoanalysis, the humanistic-existential therapies stress

the importance of self-actualization, self-concept, free will,
responsibility, and the understanding of the client's phenomenological
world. The focus of therapy is on qualities of "humanness"; human beings
cannot be understood without reference to their personal uniqueness and
wholeness. Among the several humanistic-existential therapies are
person-centered therapy, existential analysis, and gestalt therapy.
Person-Centered

Therapy Carl Rogers, the founder of person-centered therapy, believed
that people could develop better self-concepts and move toward
self-actualization if the therapist provided certain therapeutic
conditions. These are the conditions in which clients use their own
innate tendencies to grow, to actively negotiate with their environment,
and to realize their potential. Therefore, therapists must accept
clients as people, show empathy and respect, and provide unconditional
positive regard for them. A therapist should not control, inhibit,
threaten, or interpret a client's behaviors. These actions are
manipulative, and they undermine the client's ability to ﬁnd his or her
own direction. Person-centered therapy thus emphasizes the kind of
person the therapist should be in the therapeutic relationship rather
than the precise techniques to use in therapy. Particular details of
this therapeutic approach were discussed in the chapter on models of
abnormal behavior.

Existential Analysis Existential analysis follows no single theory or
group of therapeutic techniques. Instead, it is concerned with the
person's experience and involvement in the world as a being with
consciousness and self-consciousness. Existential therapists believe
that the inability to accept death or nonbeing as a reality restricts
self-actualization. In contemporary society, many people feel lonely and
alienated; they lose a sense of the meaning of life, of
self-responsibility, and of free will. This state of mind is popularly
called "existential crisis." The task of the therapist is to engage
clients in an encounter in which they can experience their own existence
as being real. The encounter should involve genuine sharing between
partners, in which the therapist, too, may grow and be inﬂuenced. When
clients can experience their existence and nonexistence, then feelings
of responsibility, choice, and meaning reemerge. (Again, see the chapter
on models of abnormal behavior for additional details.) Existential
approaches to therapy are strongly philosophical in nature. They have
not received any research scrutiny because many existential concepts and
methods are difﬁcult to deﬁne operationally for research purposes.
Furthermore, existential therapists

Action-Oriented Approaches to Individual Psychotherapy

point out that therapist and client are engaged in a complex encounter
that cannot be broken down into components for empirical observation, so
research studies are incapable of assessing the impact of therapy.
Although impressive case histories indicate its effectiveness, little
empirical support for existential analysis exists.

mal behavior. Treatment based on classical conditioning, operant
conditioning, observational learning, and cognitive-behavioral processes
has gained widespread popularity (DHHS, 1999; Norcross & Freedheim,
1992). Behavior therapists typically use a variety of techniques, many
of which were discussed in preceding chapters. This section presents a
selection of the most important behavioral techniques.

Gestalt Therapy The German word gestalt means

"whole." As conceptualized by Fritz Perls in 1969, gestalt therapy
emphasizes the importance of a person's total experience, which should
not be fragmented or separated. Perls believed that when affective and
cognitive experiences are isolated, people lack full awareness of their
complete experience. In gestalt therapy, clients are asked to discuss
the totality of the here and now. Only experiences, feelings, and
behaviors occurring in the present are stressed. Past experiences or
anticipated future experiences are brought up only in relation to
current feelings. Interestingly, Perls was originally trained as a
psychoanalyst, but he later rejected Freudian theory. He did, however,
incorporate dream analysis in his work. Dreams, too, are interpreted in
relation to the here and now in gestalt therapy. As a means of opening
clients to their experiences, therapists encourage clients to: 1. Make
personalized and unqualiﬁed statements that help them "act out" their
emotions. For example, instead of hedging by saying, "It is sometimes
upsetting when your boss yells at you," a client is encouraged to say,
"I get scared when my boss yells at me." 2. Exaggerate the feelings
associated with behaviors to gain greater awareness of their experiences
and to eliminate intellectual explanations for them. 3. Role-play
situations and then focus on what was experienced during the role
playing. Like existential analysis, gestalt therapy has generated little
research. Thus it is difﬁcult to evaluate its effectiveness. Proponents
of gestalt therapy are convinced that clients are helped, but sufﬁcient
empirical support has never emerged. (You might be interested in reading
Perls's remarkable book Gestalt Therapy Verbatim, 1969, for a fuller
explanation of this approach.)

Action-Oriented Approaches to Individual Psychotherapy The principles
underlying the action-oriented or behaviorist approaches to abnormal
behavior were discussed in depth in the chapter on models of abnor-

Classical Conditioning Techniques Using the classical conditioning
principles described in the chapter on models of abnormal behavior,
Joseph Wolpe (1973) used systematic desensitization as treatment for
anxiety. This technique attempts to reduce anxiety in response to a
stimulus situation by eliciting in the given situation an alternative
response that is incompatible with anxiety. For example, if a woman is
afraid of ﬂying in a jet plane, her anxiety response could be reduced by
training her to relax while in airplanes. Systematic desensitization
typically includes training in relaxation, the construction of a fear
hierarchy, and the combination of relaxation and imagined scenes from
the fear hierarchy. This process is described in detail in the chapter
on anxiety disorders, but we can illustrate the process using the
example of the woman who wants to overcome her fear of ﬂying. The
therapist would ﬁrst train her to relax, probably employing a
progressive relaxation method in which she learns to alternately tense
and relax her muscles. Working with the therapist, the client would
construct a fear hierarchy for ﬂying, rating the level of fear in
various scenarios on a scale of 1 to 100, as in Table 17.2. Notice that
self-reported anxiety increases as the task approaches, and a high level
of fear occurs in response to a scene in which the plane is shaking due
to turbulence while ﬂying. If there are large increases in anxiety from
one consecutive scene to the next, other scenes may be constructed that
occupy an intermediate position. For example, a 20-point difference
occurs in Table 17.2 between scenes 5 and 6 (and between scenes 6 and
7). The client and therapist may ﬁnd another scene that the client rates
as 50 on the hierarchy---for example, she might imagine getting a
boarding pass and checking in her luggage. The client is then asked to
imagine herself in each of these situations. Most clients experience
anxiety when they imagine such situations, and it is obviously more
convenient to imagine them than to actually go through them. If the
client is actually present in the fear-provoking situations, the
approach is known as an in vivo approach. The development of a fear
hierarchy is important in systematic desensitization when an in vivo
approach is not used.

510

Chapter 18

Therapeutic Interventions

Once the person is able to relax, the therapist asks the client ﬁrst to
imagine a low-anxiety scene (such as making ﬂight reservations) and to
relax at the same time. The client then proceeds up the fear hierarchy,
imagining each situation in order. If a particular situation elicits too
much anxiety, the client is told to return to a less anxiety-provoking
one. This procedure is repeated until the client can imagine the entire
hierarchy without anxiety.

Facing the Problem Head-On Fear of snakes is not uncommon in the general
population. Some people, however, have such intense fears that they are
considered phobic. In such cases, desensitization procedures may be used
to help reduce or eradicate the emotional reaction. In this session, a
client is helped by the therapist to overcome her fear. The technique
being used is ﬂooding, which uses a real snake. According to classical
conditioning principles, the anxiety and fear should be extinguished in
the absence of any negative consequences happening.

Behavior therapists believe that systematic desensitization is more
effective than psychotherapy for certain kinds of problems such as
simple phobias; it certainly requires fewer sessions to achieve desired
results (Wolpe, 1973). Systematic desensitization has stimulated a great
deal of research, and its efﬁcacy in reducing fears has been well
documented. Some researchers question the need for certain procedural
aspects of the treatment approach. For example, Wolpe's rather rigid
format for desensitization may be unnecessary, and alternatives to
relaxation, such as talking about the fear or listening to soothing
music, may be used in the process. Flooding and Implosion Two other
techniques that

use the classical conditioning principles of extinction are ﬂooding and
implosion (Sommers-Flanagan & Sommers-Flanagan, 2004). The two are very
similar. Flooding attempts to extinguish fear by placing the client in a
real-life anxiety-provoking situation at full intensity. Implosion
attempts to extinguish fear by having the client imagine the
anxiety-provoking situation at full intensity. The difference between
systematic desensitization and ﬂooding and implosion lies in the speed
with which the fearful situation is introduced to the client. Systematic
desensitization introduces it more slowly. Flooding and implosion
require the client to immediately confront the feared situation in its
full intensity. The belief is that the client's fears will be
extinguished if he or she is not allowed to avoid or escape the
situation. In ﬂooding, for example, a client who is afraid of heights
may be taken to the top of a tall building, mountain, or bridge and
physically prevented from leaving. Some studies have indicated that
ﬂooding effectively eliminates

Action-Oriented Approaches to Individual Psychotherapy

speciﬁc fears such as phobias (Bornas, Fullana, TortellaFeliu, Llabres,
& de la Banda, 2001; Garcia-Palacios, Hoffman, Carlin, Furness, &
Botella, 2002). In implosion therapy, the client is forced to imagine a
feared situation. For example, a therapist might ask a client who is
afraid of ﬂying to close her eyes and imagine the following: You are
ﬂying in an airplane. Suddenly the plane hits an air pocket and begins
to shake violently from side to side. Meal trays ﬂy around, and
passengers who do not have their seatbelts fastened are thrown from
their seats. People start to scream. As you look out the window, the
plane's wing is ﬂying by. The pilot's frantic voice over the loudspeaker
is shouting: "Prepare to crash, prepare to crash!" Your seatbelt breaks
and you must hang on for dear life, while the plane is spinning around
and careening. You can tell that the plane is falling rapidly. The
ground is coming up toward you. The situation is hopeless---all will
die.

Presumably the client feels intense anxiety, after which she is told to
"wake up." Repeated exposure to such a high level of anxiety eventually
causes the stimulus to lose its power to elicit anxiety and leads to
extinction. The developers of implosion and ﬂooding believe that they
can be effective, though some clients ﬁnd the procedures too traumatic
and discontinue treatment. In general, these methods have not been
scrutinized as carefully as systematic desensitization has been, but
they appear to be equally effective with clients with phobias
(Emmelkamp, 1994). Aversive Conditioning In aversive conditioning, a
widely used classical conditioning technique, the undesirable behavior
is paired with an unpleasant stimulus to suppress the undesirable
behavior. For example, aversive conditioning has been used to modify the
smoking behaviors of heavy smokers. In the rapid smoking technique,
smokers who are trying to quit are asked to puff cigarettes at a fast
rate (perhaps a puff every six or seven seconds). Pufﬁng at this rate
usually brings on nausea, so the nausea from pufﬁng is associated with
smoking behaviors. After repeated pairings, many smokers ﬁnd cigarette
smoke aversive and are more motivated to quit. Aversive conditioning has
also been used in therapy with people who have drug or alcohol
addictions or sexual disorders, again with varying degrees of success.
The noxious stimuli have included electric shock, drugs, odors, verbal
censure, and reprimands. Some aversive conditioning programs also
provide positive reinforcement for alternative behaviors that are deemed
appropriate (Emmelkamp, 1994).

511

Several problems have been encountered in the use of aversive
conditioning. First, because noxious stimuli are used, many people in
treatment discontinue therapy, as in the smoking-reduction program just
described. Second, aversive methods often suppress the undesirable
behavior only temporarily, especially when punishment for those
behaviors is applied solely in a laboratory situation that bears little
resemblance to real life. Third, the client may become anxious and
hostile. And some critics argue that punishment is unethical or has the
potential for misuse and abuse. Partially as a response to these
criticisms, as well as for practical reasons, some therapists advocate
the use of covert sensitization. Like implosion, it requires imagining
the aversive situation, along with the behavior one is trying to
eliminate. A person who wants to stop smoking may be asked to imagine a
smoke-ﬁlled room, becoming nauseated, suffocating, and dying slowly of
lung cancer and emphysema.

Operant Conditioning Techniques Behavior modiﬁcation using operant
methods has ﬂourished, and many ingenious programs have been developed.
As in the case of classical conditioning, only a few important examples
are presented here. Token Economies Treatment programs that reward
patients with tokens for appropriate behaviors are known as token
economies. The tokens may be exchanged for hospital privileges, food, or
weekend passes. The goal is to modify patient behaviors using a
secondary reinforcer (the tokens). In much the same way, money operates
as a secondary reinforcer for people who work. Three elements are
necessary to a token economy: (1) the designation by hospital staff of
certain patient behaviors as desirable and reinforceable; (2) a medium
of exchange, such as coinlike tokens or tallies on a piece of paper; and
(3) goods, services, or privileges that the tokens can buy
(Christophersen & Mortweet, 2001; Watson & Tharp, 1997). It is up to the
hospital staff to dispense the tokens for desirable patient behaviors.
For example, tokens can be exchanged for hospital passes, cigarettes,
food, television viewing, and the choice of dining room tablemates.
Patients can be given tokens for good grooming and neat physical
appearance or for washing dishes and performing other chores. Token
economy programs are used in a variety of settings, with such different
types of people as juvenile delinquents, schoolchildren, people with
mental retardation, and patients in residential community homes (Kazdin,
1994). Although such programs have been

512

Chapter 18

Therapeutic Interventions

extremely successful in modifying behaviors in institutional settings,
problems remain. Some patients do not respond to token economies.
Complex behaviors, such as those involving language, are difﬁcult to
modify with this technique. A ﬁnal criticism is that desirable patient
behaviors that are exhibited in a hospital may not be continued outside
the hospital setting. Punishment When less drastic methods are
ineffective, punishment is sometimes used in treating children with
autism and schizophrenia (Prochaska & Norcross, 2003). In an early
study, Lovaas (Lovaas, 1977; Lovaas, Schaeffer, & Simmons, 1965)
attempted to modify the behaviors of ﬁve-year-old identical twins, both
diagnosed with schizophrenia. The children had shown no response to
conventional treatment and were largely unresponsive in everyday
interpersonal situations. They showed no reaction to speech and did not
themselves speak. They did not recognize adults or each other, and they
engaged in temper tantrums, selfdestructive behaviors, and inappropriate
handling of objects. The experimenters decided to use electric shock as
a punishment for the purpose of modifying the children's behaviors. A
ﬂoor gridded with metal tape was constructed so that a painful but not
physically damaging shock could be administered to their bare feet. By
turning the shock on and off, the experimenters were able to condition
desired behaviors in the children. Affectionate responses such as
kissing and hugging were developed, and tantrum behaviors were
eliminated---all via the use of shock as an aversive stimulus. Lovaas
(1987) has also used a loud "No," as well as a slap to the thigh of a
child, to reduce undesirable or self-destructive behaviors. Lovaas's
work has shown that operant conditioning is a powerful technique for
changing the behavior of children who have autism and have failed to
respond to other forms of treatment. Because of the ethical issues
raised by the use of electric shocks, however, use of this punishment
technique has declined in recent years.

Observational Learning Techniques As discussed in the chapter on models
of abnormal behavior, observational learning is the acquisition of new
behaviors by watching them being performed. The process of demonstrating
these behaviors to a person or an audience is called modeling. Modeling
has been shown to be effective in helping people acquire more
appropriate behaviors. In one experiment, young adults who showed an
intense fear of snakes were assigned to four groups: 1. The live
modeling with participation group watched a live model who initiated
progressively

more fear-evoking activities with the snake. Participants were then
guided to imitate the model and were encouraged to touch the snake, ﬁrst
with a gloved hand and then with a bare hand. 2. The symbolic modeling
group underwent relaxation training and then viewed a ﬁlm in which
children and adults were seen handling snakes in progressively more
fear-evoking circumstances. 3. The systematic desensitization group
received systematic desensitization treatment for snake phobias. 4. The
control group received no treatment. Before treatment, the approach
behaviors of all four groups of participants toward snakes were equally
few. After treatment, the ability to approach and touch snakes had
increased for members of all treated groups, who performed better than
individuals in the control group. Group 1, in which treatment involved
live modeling with participation, showed the greatest change: nearly all
its members voluntarily touched the snake (Bandura, Blanchard, & Ritter,
1969). Observation of models who verbalize how to perform a task and who
make a few mistakes while completing the task has been found to be more
effective than viewing models who do not verbalize or who perform with
no anxiety or mistakes (Braswell & Kendall, 1988). The modeling of
behaviors shown in ﬁlms has been successfully used in medical and dental
practices to reduce fears of medical procedures (Wilson & O'Leary,
1980), in teaching social and problemsolving skills (Bellack, Hersen, &
Himmelhoch, 1983; Braswell & Kendall, 1988), and in reducing compulsions
and phobias (Rachman & Hodgson, 1980).

Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy In the chapter on models of abnormal
behavior, we discussed in some detail how cognitive-behavioral
approaches rest on the belief that psychopathology stems from
irrational, faulty, negative, and distorted thinking or self-statements
that a person makes to himself or herself. As a result, most cognitive
approaches share several elements. First, cognitive restructuring is
used to change a client's irrational, self-defeating, and distorted
thoughts and attitudes to more rational, positive, and appropriate ones.
Second, skills training is used to help clients learn to manage and
overcome stress. Third, problem solving provides clients with strategies
for dealing with speciﬁc problems in living. Initially, Albert Ellis's
rational-emotive therapy, or RET (Ellis, 1962), was not well received by
therapists. Attitudes soon changed, however, when the behaviorists
became increasingly interested in mediating cognitive

Action-Oriented Approaches to Individual Psychotherapy

processes. In addition, RET and the behavioral strategies are similar in
a number of ways. For example, RET incorporates cognitive restructuring,
skills training, and problem-solving skills (Corey, 2005). Cognitive
restructuring speciﬁcally is used to help clients deal with their
irrational thoughts and beliefs. For example, a client's belief that he
or she should be loved by everyone is attacked directly by the
therapist: "What is so awful about not being loved by everyone? If your
father doesn't love you, that's his problem!" Once the client begins to
restructure his or her thoughts, the therapist begins the task of
helping the client learn new ways to appraise and evaluate situations.
Finally, homework assignments (behavioral rehearsal) are given to help
the client learn new strategies to deal with situations. Aaron Beck
(1976, 1985; Beck & Weishaar, 1989) has also been a major contributor to
cognitivebehavioral therapy. Originally using this approach to treat
depression, he extended his treatment to other disorders such as anxiety
and phobias. Beck holds that emotional disorders are primarily caused by
negative patterns of thought, which he labels the "cognitive
triad"---errors in how we think about ourselves (such as "I'm
worthless"), our world ("Everything bad happens to me"), and our future
("Nothing is ever going to change") (see Table 17.3). Whereas RET
engages the client in a rational or Socratic "debate," Beck's approach
emphasizes the client's capacity for selfdiscovery. Less hurried and
confrontative, the therapist and client work as a team to uncover
underlying assumptions, to test them in the client's everyday life
situations, and to determine by logical means whether they are valid. As
in systematic desensitization, smaller challenges are assigned ﬁrst, and
more difﬁcult ones are tackled as successes are experienced.

513

Other variations of cognitive-behavioral methods have been developed,
and all are based on similar assumptions. For example, stress
inoculation therapy was developed by Meichenbaum (Meichenbaum, 1985;
Meichenbaum & Cameron, 1982). The assumption behind stress inoculation
training is that people can be taught better ways to handle life
stresses. Meichenbaum uses cognitive preparation and skill acquisition,
rehearsal, application, and practice.

Beck's Cognitive Triad of Depression

TABLE 17.3

Negative View of Self---"I'm Worthless" Believing that one is worthless,
defective, inadequate, and undesirable. A person with depression may
interpret negative events as being caused by personal inadequacies and
failures. Negative View of the World---"Everything Bad Happens to Me"
Perceiving the world and one's environment as being unreceptive,
frustrating, and demanding. A person with depression may see the world
in the most pessimistic and cynical manner. Negative View of the
Future---"Nothing Is Ever Going to Change" Perceiving the future as
hopeless and believing that negative events will continue to occur. The
person with depression believes that one is helpless and powerless to
improve the situation in the future.

Albert Ellis (left) (b. 1913) and Aaron Beck (right) (b. 1921) Ellis's
rationalemotive therapy (RET) and Beck's cognitive triad have been
widely used in promoting the cognitive restructuring that is the
foundation of cognitivebehavioral therapies.

514

Chapter 18

Therapeutic Interventions

Cognitive-behavioral therapy shows much promise. Studies have indicated
successful use of rationalemotive therapy, of Beck's approach, and of
stress inoculation therapy (Chambless et al., 1998; Foa, Rothbaum, &
Furr, 2003). Furthermore, some evidence suggests that the approaches may
be at least as effective as medication or drug therapy for certain
situational and speciﬁc depressions (Hollon & Beck, 1994; Lipman &
Kendall, 1992). In one survey of psychotherapists, cognitive-behavioral
approaches were rated as a therapeutic orientation that will continue to
grow in popularity (Norcross & Freedheim, 1992).

Health Psychology Health psychology integrates behavioral and biomedical
science (Lewis, 2001). The two ﬁelds merged because people realized that
psychological factors were often related to the cause and treatment of
physical illnesses (Chiles, Lambert, & Hatch, 1999). The term
psychobiology has also been used to address the importance of viewing
the totality of the human condition (both biology and experience) in
explaining and understanding behavior (Dewsbury, 1991). The goal of
clinical health psychology is to help people change their lifestyles to
prevent illness or to enhance the quality of their lives (Belar &
Deardorff, 1995). As discussed in the chapter on psychological factors
affecting medical conditions, heart disease, strokes, and cancer have
been correlated with lack of exercise, diet, smoking, alcohol
consumption, and other behaviors of a particular lifestyle. Health
psychology makes people aware of the effects of these behaviors and
helps them to develop healthier patterns of living. One way to do this
is through biofeedback therapy, which combines physiological and
behavioral approaches. A patient receives information, or feedback,
regarding particular autonomic functions, such as heart rate, blood
pressure, and brain wave activity, and is rewarded for inﬂuencing those
functions in a desired direction. Monitoring devices supply the
information; the rewards vary, depending on the patient and the
situation. Studies have found that biofeedback therapy can help reduce
high blood pressure (Blanchard, 1992). In an early study, researchers
attempted to help patients with essential hypertension (elevated blood
pressure) lower their systolic pressure. They used an operant
conditioning feedback system in which patients saw a ﬂash of light and
heard a tone whenever their systolic blood pressure decreased. They were
told that the light and tone were desirable and were given rewards---
slides of pleasant scenes and money---for achieving a certain number of
light ﬂashes and tones. The patients gradually reduced their blood
pressure at succeeding

biofeedback sessions. When they reached the point at which they were
unable to reduce their pressure further for ﬁve consecutive sessions,
the experiment was discontinued (Benson, Shapiro, Tursky, & Schwartz,
1971). Meyer Friedman (1984) reported a study in which coronary patients
who changed their lifestyles drastically reduced their recurrence of
heart attacks. The investigation discovered that 95 percent of patients
who suffer heart attacks exhibit what is called "Type A" behavior
(discussed in the chapter on psychological factors affecting medical
conditions), which is characterized by time urgency (the compulsion to
ﬁnish tasks early, to be early for appointments, and to always race
against the clock), attempts to perform several tasks at once, a
propensity to anger quickly when others do not perform as expected, and
rapid speech and body movements. The patients in Friedman's Recurrent
Coronary Prevention Project learned, through counseling and practice
drills, to control and change their Type A behaviors. Although the Type
A hypothesis has proven to have a number of shortcomings (H. S. Friedman
& Booth-Kewley, 1988), health psychology techniques, which focus on
lifestyle changes, have proven very beneﬁcial. Some of these are listed
here: 1. Establish priorities. It is important for each of us to
determine where to put our time and energies. Establishing a daily or
weekly priority list, including everything that must be done, is a
helpful strategy. If time is limited, learn to postpone the low-priority
items without feeling guilty. 2. Avoid stressful situations. Do not put
yourself in situations that involve unnecessary stress. For example, if
you know that a particular trafﬁc route involves constant tie-ups,
consider another time for your commuting or take another route.
Remember, we can and do have control over much of our lives. 3. Take
time out for yourself. We all need to engage in activities that bring
pleasure and gratiﬁcation. Whether they involve going ﬁshing, playing
cards, talking to friends, or taking a vacation, they are necessary for
physical and mental health. And they give the body time to recover from
the stresses of everyday life. 4. Exercise regularly. Exercise is
effective in reducing anxiety and increasing tolerance for stress.
Furthermore, a healthy body gives us greater energy to cope with stress
and greater ability to recover from a stressful situation. 5. Eat right.
You have heard this advice before, but it happens to be excellent
advice: eat well-balanced meals that are high in ﬁber and protein but
low in

Evaluating Individual Psychotherapy

fat and cholesterol. Nutritional deﬁciencies can lower our resistance to
stress. 6. Make friends. Good friends share our problems, accept us as
we are, and laugh and cry with us. Their very presence enables us to
reduce or eliminate much of the stress we may be experiencing. 7. Learn
to relax. A major ﬁnding of stress management research is that tense,
"uptight" people are more likely to react negatively to stress than are
relaxed people. Relaxation can do much to combat the autonomic effects
of anxiety and stress; thus the various relaxation techniques are
helpful in eliminating stress. Health psychology approaches have also
been used to address a wide range of problems, including chronic pain,
recurring headaches, and insomnia.

Evaluating Individual Psychotherapy Both insight- and action-oriented
approaches have attracted ﬁrm followers and loud critics (Kottler,
2002). Behavioral therapists, for example, believe that their
action-oriented approach has solid theoretical support and empirical
justiﬁcation; that it provides a rapid means of changing behaviors; and
that (unlike the insightoriented approaches) it includes speciﬁc goals,
procedures, and means of assessing its effectiveness. Critics have
argued that behavioral therapy is dehumanizing,

515

mechanical, and manipulative; that its relationship to learning theory
is more apparent than real; and that it is applicable only to a narrow
range of problems. Whether one argues for either insight- or
actionoriented therapies depends largely on whether one believes that
human behavior is determined primarily by internal or external factors.
Interestingly, Norcross and Freedheim (1992) surveyed a group of
prominent psychotherapists and psychotherapy researchers about which
therapeutic orientations would grow or decline in use during the next
decade. As indicated in Figure 17.1, the respondents predicted that
theoretical integration, eclecticism, and cognitive orientations would
gain popularity, whereas psychoanalysis and transactional analysis would
decrease in use. More than ﬁfty years ago, Hans Eysenck (1952) concluded
that there was no evidence that psychotherapy facilitates recovery from
what were then classiﬁed as neurotic disorders. According to the
criteria he used, patients receiving no formal psychotherapy recovered
at least as well as those who were treated! Since that time, others have
also claimed that psychotherapy's success has been oversold and that
both its practitioners and its clients are wasting time, money, and
effort (Masson, 1998; Carey, 2004). Some opponents feel so strongly that
they advocate a "truth in packaging" policy: prospective clients should
be warned that "psychotherapy will probably not help you very much." In
a thought-provoking article, Persons (1991) pointed out that past
outcome studies showing no

The Laughing Club of India reﬂects an interesting way to do this.
According to the club's founder, Dr. Madan Kataria, laughter reduces
stress. Shown here, the members breathe yoga-like, reach for the sky to
reduce inhibitions, and then force a "ho, ho, ha, ha" until the laughter
becomes contagious.

Hans Eysenck (b. 1916) Hans Eysenck started a controversy by asserting
in 1952 that there was no evidence that psychotherapy was effective.
Research, however, indicates that psychotherapy is effective and that
the real issues concern types of treatment and their suitability for
clients and their particular circumstances.

positive effects from psychotherapy or no difference in outcome in the
use of different therapies suffered from major methodological ﬂaws. They
were based on poorly controlled studies, issues of diagnostic severity
were not addressed, and the improvement measures were simplistic or
poor. Taken together, these three points led Persons (1991) to conclude
that contemporary outcome studies did not accurately represent
psychotherapy. Furthermore, attempts to study psychotherapy and
treatment outcomes often simplify human interactions, which are ongoing,
context bound, and difﬁcult to measure. There is now an increasing
distinction between efﬁcacy research and effectiveness research
(Seligman, 1995, 1998). An efﬁcacy study is a laboratory distillation of
treatment. It consists of a brief, well-controlled, and well-designed
research investigation into the outcome of a treatment---a "laboratory"
study of treatment. In contrast, an effectiveness study examines the
outcome of treatment as it is actually delivered in real life, without
the rigorous controls and designs found in efﬁcacy studies. Importantly,
in contrast to efﬁcacy studies, effectiveness research demonstrates
greater patient improvement and improvements across different kinds of
therapies.

Meta-analysis and Effect Size A form of statistical analysis
(meta-analysis) has been found to be an extremely useful tool in
analyzing therapy outcome studies. Meta-analysis allows us to analyze a
large number of different studies by looking at

517

Evaluating Individual Psychotherapy

effect size, a term that refers to treatment-produced change. To
determine effect size, researchers subtract the mean of the control
group from the mean of the treatment group. The difference is then
divided by the standard deviation of the control group. The larger the
numerical ﬁgure obtained, the larger is the effect of the treatment.
Ideally, this comparison of effect size in many studies allows us to
determine the effectiveness of different treatment approaches. It is
important to note that meta-analysis is controversial; it has both
staunch supporters (Shapiro & Shapiro, 1983; Smith, Glass, & Miller,
1980) and detractors (Erwin, 1986; Paul, 1985). Meta-analytic studies
strongly support the conclusion that psychotherapy is effective, and
they allow researchers to estimate how large the effect is. Figure 17.2
graphically displays the effect of treatment based on two meta-analytic
studies (Lambert & Bergin, 1994). As can be seen, individuals who
receive psychotherapy are better off than 79 percent of individuals who
receive no treatment. Those receiving minimal treatment (for example, a
placebo) are better off than 66 percent of the people in no-treatment
control groups. Many reviews of outcome research have indicated that
psychotherapy is effective and that people who are treated show more
desirable and larger changes than those who do not receive formal
psychotherapy (Garﬁeld & Bergin, 1994; Shadish et al., 1997; Sloane et
al., 1975; Smith & Glass, 1977; Smith et al., 1980). In addition, the
largest gains in treatment tend to occur within the ﬁrst few months and
tend to endure (Lambert, Shapiro, & Bergin, 1986; Nicholson & Berman,
1983; Smith et al., 1980). Howard (1994) argues that psychotherapy is
one of the best documented and most studied treatment interventions and
that research clearly attests to its beneﬁcial impact in people's lives.
One recent trend in psychotherapy research is the designation of
empirically supported treatments (ESTs), clearly speciﬁed psychological
treatments shown to be efﬁcacious in controlled research with a
delineated population (Chambless & Hollon, 1998). In other words, ESTs
are those treatments for which rigorously designed research has
demonstrated effectiveness in beneﬁting clients. Among the many ESTs are
cognitive-behavioral treatment for anxiety and depression, interpersonal
therapy for depression and bulimia, and behavioral therapy for sexual
dysfunctions. Obviously, other forms of treatment may be effective, but
they are not designated as ESTs because they have not yet been
rigorously studied. This distinction has provoked some controversy.
Critics of EST note that those treatments that are empirically supported
tend to be either behavioral in nature or narrowly deﬁned

FIGURE 17.2 Effect Sizes for Psychotherapy, Placebo,

and No-Treatment Groups Effect size is the result of calculations that
reﬂect the changes produced by treatment. The effect size of
psychotherapy is much higher than that of the placebo condition, which
in turn is higher than the no-treatment condition. In terms of
percentage improved, the ﬁgure can be interpreted as follows: the
average client undergoing a placebo treatment is better off than 66
percent of the no-treatment controls; the average client undergoing
psychotherapy appears to be better off than 79 percent of the
no-treatment controls.

kinds of treatment, implying that other forms of treatment are being
ignored and are not the focus of research attention (Carey, 2004;
Nathan, 1998). The controversy has resulted in a polarization between
those who emphasize the common therapeutic factors that exist across all
therapies and those who emphasize empirically supported therapies (Day,
2004). The "common factors" advocates identify four common dimensions of
curative inﬂuence in therapy (Lambert, 1992). First, improvement is
inﬂuenced by extratherapeutic variables such as degree of
psychopathology, motivation, ego strength, psychological-mindedness, and
support in the environment. Second, the therapeutic change is affected
by the relationship with the therapist, or the therapeutic alliance.
Third, expectancy effects (hope for change) seem to play a role. Last,
techniques, or the theoretical orientation, seem to play a role as well.
In an empirical analysis of the contributions of common factors to
therapeutic improvement, it was concluded that extratherapeutic
variables accounted for 40 percent of the change, the therapeutic
relationship for 30 percent, expectancy or placebo effects for 15
percent, and techniques for 15 percent (Lambert, 1992). Regardless of
the debate over the common factors approach versus the ESTs approach, we
believe that

CRITICAL THINKING What Kind of Therapist Do You Want? In general, people
who experience emotional and behavioral problems beneﬁt from
psychotherapy. Yet beneﬁts often vary according to client, therapist,
and treatment characteristics. Given this fact, it is surprising that
many individuals in need of therapy do little prior thinking about the
kind of therapist they would like to see or about how and where to ﬁnd
"good" therapists. If you were depressed or anxious, what kind of
therapist would you like to ﬁnd? What characteristics are important to
you? What characteristics do you consider to be relatively unimportant?
Why? The answers to these questions are complex and vary from person to
person. Let us examine some of the factors that might be important and
then provide an example of the kind of issues that can be raised. ■

Demographic characteristics of the therapist These include age, gender,
educational and experi-

ential background, ethnicity, and other similar characteristics. For
example, would you mind seeing a therapist who had just recently
completed training in psychotherapy? Overall reputation and professional
standing How can you determine how effective or successful a therapist
is? Experience with clients having problems similar to yours Does it
matter whether the therapist specializes in your problem or is a general
practitioner? Therapeutic orientation (such as psychodynamic,
behavioral, spiritual, and so on) Would you want to work with a
therapist who believes that meditation is the primary tool to use
against mental disorders? Interpersonal style (such as humorous,
serious, formal, informal, dominant, and submissive) Would you like a
therapist who provides only mini-

psychotherapy is valuable and would best be served by emphasizing an
integration of both views (Prochaska & Norcross, 1999). Increasingly,
research now supports the effectiveness of psychotherapy (Ahn & Wampold,
2001; Hubble, Duncan, & Miller, 1999; Seligman, 1995). We also believe
its maximal value is attained not by unreservedly accepting or rejecting
any group of treatments, either behavioral or insight-oriented, but by
using research to ﬁnd the best match that can be made among therapist,
client, and situational variables. The Critical Thinking feature
discusses some options that should be considered in choosing a
therapist.

Group, Family, and Couples Therapy The classic form of psychotherapy is
a one-to-one relationship between one therapist and one client. Group,
family, and couples therapies are forms of treatment that involve the
simultaneous treatment of two or more clients and may involve more than
one therapist

and beliefs If you were a Christian fundamentalist, how comfortable
would you feel working with an agnostic therapist?

Undoubtedly, many other important factors and issues can be listed. Your
preferences will reﬂect your culture, feelings, beliefs, and needs. In
"A Buyer's Guide to Psychotherapy," psychotherapist Frank Pittman (1994)
considers the client as a consumer who should not be afraid to ask
questions of therapists in order to ascertain if they seem suitable. He
recommends that the consumer should hire a therapist who has worked
effectively with people the consumer knows, who leads a life that seems
desirable to the consumer, and who treats a consumer with respect. In
other words, Pittman argues that clients should become informed and
selective in choosing a therapist.

Corey, 2004). Their increasing popularity stems from certain economic
and therapeutic advantages: because the therapist sees several clients
at each session, he or she can provide much more mental health service
to the community. And, because several clients participate in the
sessions, the cost to each person is noticeably reduced. Saving time and
money is important, but the increasing use of group therapy seems also
to be related to the fact that many psychological difﬁculties are
basically interpersonal in nature---they involve relationships with
others, and these problems are best treated within a group rather than
individually. Most of the techniques of individual psychotherapy are
also used in group forms of treatment. Rather than repeat them here, we
ﬁrst discuss some general features of group therapy, family therapy, and
couples therapy.

Group Therapy There is now a great variety of group therapies, reﬂecting
the many dimensions along which a therapeutic

Group, Family and Couples Therapy

group may be characterized (Corey, 2004). One obvious dimension is the
type of people who make up the group. In couples (which includes
marital) and family therapy, they are related; in most other groups,
they are initially strangers. Group members may share various
characteristics. Groups may be formed to treat older clients, unemployed
workers, or pregnant women; to treat clients with similar psychological
disturbances; or to treat people with similar therapeutic goals.
Therapeutic groups also differ with regard to psychological orientation
and treatment techniques, number of members, frequency and duration of
meetings, and the role of the therapist or group leader. Some groups
work without a leader. Others have leaders who play active or passive
roles within the group. Moreover, the group may focus either on
interrelationships and the dynamics of interaction or on the individual
members. And groups may be organized to prevent problems, as well as to
solve them; for example, group therapy has been suggested for divorced
people who are likely to encounter stress. Despite their wide diversity,
successful groups and group approaches share several features that
promote beneﬁcial change in clients (Corey, 2004; Kottler & Brown, 1992;
Yalom, 1970): 1. The group experience allows each client to become
involved in a social situation and to see how his or her behavior
affects others. An underlying assumption of group therapy is that
problems are most likely manifested in interpersonal interactions with
others. Once the group member can view his or her interactions
realistically, problems can be identiﬁed and then resolved.

519

2.  In group therapy the therapist can see how clients respond in a
    real-life social and interpersonal context. In individual therapy,
    the therapist either must rely on what clients say about their
    social relationships or must assess those relationships on the basis
    of client-therapist interactions. But data gathered thus are often
    unrepresentative or inaccurate. In the group context, response
    patterns are observed rather than communicated or inferred.
3.  Group members can develop new communication skills, social skills,
    and insights. (This is one of the most powerful mechanisms of group
    therapy.) The group provides an environment for imitative learning
    and practice.
4.  Groups often help their members feel less isolated and fearful about
    their problems. Many clients enter therapy because they believe that
    their problems are unique: no one else could possibly be burdened
    with such awful impulses, evil or frightening thoughts, and
    unacceptable ways. The fear of having others ﬁnd out how "sick" they
    are may be as problematic to clients as their actual disorders. But
    when they suddenly realize that their problems are common, that
    others also experience them, and that others have similar fears,
    their sense of isolation is eased. This realization allows group
    members to be more open about their thoughts and feelings.
5.  Groups can provide their members with strong social and emotional
    support. The feelings of intimacy, belonging, protection, and trust
    (which members may not be able to experience outside the group) can
    be a powerful motivation to confront

Sharing the Problems and Solutions Group therapy may be used in place
of, or in conjunction with, individual therapy. In a group setting,
participants often gain a sense of connection with others, achieve
feelings of mutual support and assistance, and experience a decreased
sense of isolation as they work toward solutions as part of a
collective.

one's problems and actively seek to overcome them. The group can be a
safe environment in which to share one's innermost thoughts and to try
new adaptive behaviors without fear of ridicule or rejection. Evaluating
Group Therapy Clients are sometimes treated in group and individual
psychotherapy simultaneously. There are no simple rules for determining
when one or the other, or both, should be employed. The decision is
usually based on the therapist's judgment, the client's wishes, and the
availability (or unavailability) of one treatment or the other. Of
course, people who are likely to be disruptive are generally excluded
from group therapy. As desirable as it would be to base decisions
regarding treatment techniques on the observed effectiveness of group
therapy, little substantial research has been done on that topic.
Reviews of studies have suggested that group therapy results in
improvement, compared with no treatment or placebo treatment (Bednar &
Kaul, 1978, 1994; Kaul & Bednar, 1986). The problems encountered in
evaluating the success of group therapy include all those problems
involved in assessing individual therapy, compounded by group variables
and the behaviors of group members. Indeed, some have even questioned
whether group therapy is really any different from individual therapy
because the same therapeutic variables are involved (Hills, 1990). Group
therapy also has some disadvantages. For example, groups cannot give
intensive and sustained attention to the problems of individual clients.
Moreover, clients may not want to share some of their

Treating the Family Not Just the Individual Family therapy is a group
approach that works with the family as a unit, not just one individual,
to modify behaviors within the family system. In this photo, a family
meets with a therapist to discuss issues regarding disagreements and
miscommunications between the parents and their teenaged daughter. The

aware of multicultural issues that may alter her conceptualization of
the family.

problems with a large group, and the sense of intimacy with one's
therapist is often lost in a group. Group pressures may prove too strong
for some members, or the group may adopt values or behaviors that are
themselves deviant. And, in leaderless groups, the group members may not
recognize or be able to treat people with psychotic or suicidal
impulses.

Family Therapy Family therapy may be broadly deﬁned as group therapy
that seeks to modify relationships within a family to achieve harmony.
We use this deﬁnition to include all forms of therapy that involve more
than one family member in joint sessions, including marital therapy and
parent-child therapy. The important point is that the focus is not on an
individual but on the family as a whole (Nichols & Schwartz, 2005).
Family therapy is based on three assumptions: (1) it is logical and
economical to treat together all those who exist and operate within a
system of relationships (here, the primary nuclear family); (2) the
problems of the "identiﬁed patient" are only symptoms, and the family
itself is the client; and (3) the task of the therapist is to modify
relationships within the family system (Corey, 2004; Day, 2004). Two
general classes of family therapy have been identiﬁed: the
communications approach and the systems approach (Foley, 1989). Let us
look brieﬂy at each of them. The Communications Approach The communi-

cations approach to family therapy is based on the

Group, Family and Couples Therapy

assumption that family problems arise from communication difﬁculties.
Many family communication problems are both subtle and complex. Family
therapists may have to concentrate on improving not only faulty
communications but also interactions and relationships among family
members (Satir, 1967). The ways in which rules, agreements, and
perceptions are communicated among members may also be important (Haley,
1963). The therapist's role in repairing faulty family communications is
active but not dominating. He or she must seek to show family members
how they are now communicating with one another; to prod them into
revealing what they feel and think about themselves and other family
members and what they want from the family relationship; and to persuade
them to practice new ways of responding.

521

The Systems Approach People who favor the sys-

tems approach to family therapy also consider communication important,
but they especially emphasize the interlocking roles of family members
(Minuchin, 1974). Their basic assumption is that the family system
itself contributes to pathological behavior in the family. A family
member becomes "sick" because the family system requires a sick member.
Treating that person outside the system may result in transitory
improvement, but once the client returns to the family system, he or she
will be forced into the "sick role" again. Thus family systems therapy
is directed at the organization of the family. It stresses accurate
assessment of family roles and dynamics and intervention strategies to
create more ﬂexible or changed roles that foster positive
interrelationships.

Couples Therapy Although the term marital therapy is often used in the
mental health ﬁeld, we prefer to use the more inclusive term couples
therapy because it includes both marital relationships and intimate
relationships between unmarried partners. It is a treatment aimed at
helping couples understand and clarify their communications, role
relationships, unfulﬁlled needs, and unrealistic or unmet expectations.
Couples therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment for those
who ﬁnd that the quality of their relationship needs improvement
(Nichols & Schwartz, 2005). Indeed, seeing only one partner has proven
less effective in resolving interpersonal problems than seeing both
together (Gurman & Kniskern, 1978). Couples therapists work on the
assumption that it is normal for partners in an intense long-term
relationship to experience conﬂicts. For example, the husband may ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to express affectionate feelings toward his wife, who may have
a

strong need to be nurtured and loved. Or the couple may be locked in a
power struggle involving ﬁnancial decisions. Or the wife may resent a
husband who shows any sign of weakness, because the man she married was
supposed to be "strong and invulnerable." In all these cases, couples
therapy attempts to clarify and improve the communications,
interactions, and role relationships between the couple. Note that it is
not the purpose of couples therapy to "save a relationship or marriage,"
as many couples believe when they ﬁrst enter treatment. The decision to
remain together, to separate, or to leave or divorce is a decision that
must be made by the couple. The role of the therapist is to help the
couple understand the nature of their relationship, how it may be
contributing to conﬂicts and unhappiness, their available options, and,
if they want, how to work toward a healthier and happier relationship.
Research on the effects of family and couples therapy has been
consistent in pointing to the value of therapy compared with
no-treatment and alternativetreatment control groups. However, research
studies have generally not been rigorous in design; they often lacked
appropriate control groups, follow-up periods of outcome, or good
measures of outcome (Alexander, Holtzworth-Munroe, & Jameson, 1994). As
a result, no strong conclusions are warranted at this time.

Chapter 18

Therapeutic Interventions

Systematic Integration and Eclecticism The therapies discussed in this
chapter share the common goal of relieving human suffering. Yet as we
have seen, they differ considerably in their basic conceptions of
psychopathology and in the methods they use to treat mental disorders.
Many theories and techniques seem almost diametrically opposed to one
another. For example, early criticisms of psychoanalysis concentrated on
the mystical and unscientiﬁc nature of its explanation and treatment of
behavioral pathology. Most of these criticisms came from behaviorists,
who were likewise attacked by psychoanalysts as being superﬁcial and
concerned with "symptom removal" rather than with the cure of "deeper
conﬂicts in the psyche." There have been attempts at rapprochement
between psychodynamic therapy and behavior therapy (Davis, 1983;
Goldfried, Greenberg, & Marmar, 1990; Marmor & Woods, 1980; Murray,
1983; Wachtel, 1982). But even these sophisticated attempts have come
under ﬁre as being empirically and theoretically inconsistent. As we
stated in the chapter on abnormal behavior, most practicing clinicians
consider themselves eclectics (Garﬁeld & Bergin, 1994). Relying on a
single theory and a few techniques appears to be correlated with
inexperience; the more experienced the clinician, the greater the
diversity and resourcefulness used in a session (Norcross & Prochaska,
1988). Therapeutic eclecticism has been deﬁned as the "process of
selecting concepts, methods, and strategies from a variety of current
theories which work" (Brammer & Shostrom, 1982, p. 35). An example is
the early "technical eclecticism" of Arnold Lazarus (1967), which has
been reﬁned into a theoretical model called multimodal behavior therapy
(Lazarus, 1967, 1984). Although behavioral in basis, this approach
embraces many cognitive and affective concepts as well. The eclectic
model calls for openness and ﬂexibility, but it can also encourage the
indiscriminate, haphazard, and inconsistent use of therapeutic
techniques and concepts. As a result, therapists who call themselves
eclectic have been severely criticized as confused, inconsistent,
contradictory, lazy, and unsystematic (Goldfried & Safran, 1986;
Patterson, 1980). The resulting negative reception of the term
eclecticism has led to other terms (including creative synthesis,
masterful integration, and systematic eclecticism) that are more
positively associated with attempts to integrate, to be consistent, to
validate, and to create a unique and personalized theoretical position.
Indeed, evidence indicates that practitioners prefer the term
integrative to eclectic (Norcross & Prochaska, 1988). There is, of
course, no single integrative theory or position. Rather, an integrative
approach recognizes

that no one theory or approach is sufﬁcient to explain and treat the
complex human organism (SommersFlanagan & Sommers-Flanagan, 2004). All
the therapies that we have discussed have both strengths and weaknesses;
no one of them can claim to tell "the whole truth." The goal of the
eclectic approach is to integrate those therapies that work best with
speciﬁc clients who show speciﬁc problems under speciﬁc conditions
(Corey, 2005). Thus in one sense, all therapists are eclectics---that
is, each has his or her own personal and unique approach to therapy.

Culturally Diverse Populations and Psychotherapy Just as the European
American worldview is reﬂected throughout our society, Western
psychology and mental health concepts are often characterized by an
assumption that they are universal and that the human condition is
governed by universal principles (Ridley, 1995; Sue et al., 1998). For
example, cultural components of psychotherapy encompass the following
characteristics: (1) healthy functioning is equated with individualism
and independence, (2) clients can and should master and control their
own lives and the universe, (3) self-awareness and personal growth are
goals of the therapeutic process (DHHS, 1999). Many racial/ethnic
minority groups possess values and beliefs that are at odds with these
culture-bound traits: interdependence and collectivism are valued over
individualism, concern is with group rather than selfdevelopment, and
being in harmony with the universe is preferred over mastering it. The
Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health (DHHS, 1999) makes it
explicitly clear that using European American standards to judge
normality and abnormality is fraught with dangers; that it may result in
denying appropriate treatment to minority groups; that it may oppress
rather than help culturally different clients; and that it is important
for mental health practitioners to recognize and respond to cultural
concerns of African Americans, Asian Americans/Paciﬁc Islanders, Latino
or Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans (Boyd-Franklin, 2003; Flores
& Carey, 2000; Ridley, 1995). Further, many ethnic minority researchers
(Takeuchi & Uehara, 1996; Sue & Sue, 2003) have pointed out the
appalling lack of research on the effectiveness of therapy for minority
groups; few studies exist on empirically supported treatments with
minority populations. Many minority mental health professionals have
advocated the development of culture-speciﬁc treatments that recognize
the cultural values, life experiences, and minority status of these
populations in the United States (Ivey et al., 2002).

Culturally Diverse Populations and Psychotherapy

-YTH vs Reality Myth: Psychotherapy is equally effective across all
populations and problems. There is no major need to adapt the techniques
and strategies when working with different racial/ethnic minority
groups. Reality: There is considerable truth to this statement, but
current clinical work and research reveal that the most effective forms
of therapy are those that adapt to the clients' cultural values,
lifestyles, and experiences. It is important to note that all therapy
arises from a particular cultural context and that it is culture bound.
Thus therapy techniques developed for one group may not be applicable to
another.

African Americans African Americans number between 34 and 35 million, or
13 percent of the population. The prevalence of mental disorders among
African Americans is believed to be higher than that of the general
population (DHHS, 1999). Further, they are underrepresented in privately
ﬁnanced care but overrepresented in public inpatient psychiatric care in
relation to whites (Snowden & Cheung, 1990; Sue & Sue, 2003). These
differences do not appear to be the result of intrinsic differences
between racial groups but a function of socioeconomic, cultural, and
stress factors such as racism. The poverty rate for African Americans,
for example, remains nearly three times higher than that of white
Americans, and unemployment rates are twice as high (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1995). Black Americans have also been subjected to continual
prejudice and discrimination in society, making it understandable that
these forces may cause greater personal distress and health problems
(DHHS, 1999). African Americans who seek therapy often have a negative
view of mental health services and possess "historical hostility,"
triggering mistrust of the white therapist. Some minority therapists
believe that it is important for the therapist to acknowledge the
existence of historical hostility if effective psychotherapy is to be
conducted with African Americans (Parham, White, & Ajamu, 1999; Vontress
& Epps, 1997). In addition, these researchers believe that white
therapists who work with minority populations must become aware of their
own stereotypes, biases, and preconceived notions concerning African
Americans. In one study, for example, African American and European
American psychologists were presented a photograph and case information
on an African American female and asked to rate the client on her
attractiveness and ability to beneﬁt from therapy (Atkinson et al.,
1996).

523

White psychologists were more likely to rate the black female as less
attractive, suffering from a more severe disorder, and less likely to be
helped in therapy. Another barrier to providing effective treatment for
African Americans lies in the belief that therapies developed on
European American populations are equally applicable across racial
groups. Most forms of treatment are insight oriented, focus on
individual development, are intrapsychic in orientation, and occur in
the ofﬁce on a one-to-one basis. As a group, African Americans tend to
be more group centered and sensitive to interpersonal matters, to have
strong kinship bonds, to be work and education oriented, and to have a
strong commitment to religious values and church participation (Parham
et al., 1999). They are more likely to believe that their problems are
not internal but external: they live with discrimination, prejudice,
racism, poverty, and other environmental concerns. Effective therapy for
African Americans may mean understanding conﬂicting values in the
therapeutic process and being able to play a more active role in helping
African American clients deal with external problems rather than
internal ones (Ridley, 1995). Some guidelines in working with African
American clients have been suggested by a number of multicultural
specialists (Boyd-Franklin, 2003; Carter & McGoldrick, 2005; Nwachuku &
Ivey, 1991; Parham 2002; Sue & Sue, 2003): ■

During the ﬁrst session, it may be beneﬁcial for the white therapist to
bring up the issue of racial difference between the two.

■

Try to understand the worldview of African American clients before
making an interpretation; determine how they view the problem and the
possible solutions.

■

Do not pathologize or prejudge the client's initial suspiciousness and
reluctance to self-disclose. See it as a survival mechanism developed by
the client to deal with issues of racism.

■

Many African Americans have experienced racism as part of their life
experiences. Don't be afraid to freely discuss issues of prejudice and
discrimination.

■

Assess the positive assets of the client, such as family (including
relatives and nonrelated friends), community resources, and the church.

■

Consider external factors related to the problem. This may involve
contact with outside agencies and not dismissing issues of racism as
"just an excuse."

■

Use problem-solving approaches to deal with external issues.

Above all, know that these are guidelines and should not be rigidly
applied to all African Americans.

Cultural Diversity The increasing diversiﬁcation of the United States
has introduced many new customs, celebrations, and cultural events. In
these photos, teenagers participate in a Dragon Dance in Chinatown
(immediate right); a Latino family celebrates Christmas; an African
American family celebrates Kwanzaa (a cultural rather than a religious
holiday) (below, left and right); and a group of American Indians
perform the Buffalo Dance during New Mexico's American Indian Day (far
right).

Asian Americans/Paciﬁc Islanders Between 10 and 12 million people in the
United States are Asian Americans (including Chinese, Filipinos,
Koreans, Asian Indians, Vietnamese, Laotians, Japanese) and between
345,000 and 750,000 are Paciﬁc Islanders (including Hawaiians,
Guamanians, Samoans), forming a combined 4.1 percent of the population.
Asian Americans are among the fastest growing minority groups in the
United States (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001). Although they are
generally lumped together, their population comprises at least forty
distinct subgroups that differ in language, religion, and values
(Sandhu, 1997). The contemporary image of Asian Americans is that of a
highly successful minority who have "made it" in society. Indeed, a
close analysis of census ﬁgures (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1995) seems
to support this contention. Mental health

statistics, for example, reinforce the belief that Asians in America are
relatively well adjusted, function effectively in society, and
experience few difﬁculties. Studies consistently reveal that they have
low ofﬁcial rates of juvenile delinquency, divorce, psychiatric contact,
and hospitalization (Sue & Sue, 2003). Whether Asian Americans'
underutilization of mental health facilities, however, is due to low
rates of mental disorders, to discriminatory mental health practices,
and/or to cultural values that inhibit self-referral is not known. It is
becoming clear that many of the mental disorders, adjustment problems,
and character disorders among Asians are hidden. Increasing evidence
suggests that the discrepancy between ofﬁcial and real rates may be due
to such cultural factors as the shame and disgrace associated with
admitting to emotional problems, the desire to handle problems within
the family rather than relying on outside resources, and the

Culturally Diverse Populations and Psychotherapy

manner of symptom formation, such as a low prevalence of acting-out
disorders (DHHS, 1999; Sue & Sue, 2003). Many Southeast Asian refugees
show psychiatric symptoms associated with past traumas and current
resettlement problems. Very high levels of posttraumatic stress disorder
and depression have been identiﬁed among this population. Further, to
believe that the issue of racism is not central to the life experiences
of Asian Americans and Paciﬁc Islanders is to deny social reality. Yet
this appears to be a belief held by many mental health practitioners in
our society. This belief is ironic in light of the historical and
continuing bias directed at Asians. Denied the rights of citizenship and
ownership of land and interned during World War II, Asians in America
have been subjected to some of the most appalling forms of
discrimination ever perpetrated against any immigrant group (Ina, 1997).
Even more disturbing was a recent study indicating that 25 percent of
the American public harbor negative attitudes toward and stereotypes
about Chinese Americans, that 23 percent would be uncomfortable
supporting an Asian American presidential candidate (as opposed to 15
percent who would be uncomfortable with an African American candidate),
and that the public did not distinguish between Chinese Americans and
other Asian American/Paciﬁc Islander groups ("Asian Americans seen
negatively," 2001). Like their African American counterparts, Asian
Americans and Paciﬁc Islanders may also approach mental health services
with considerable suspiciousness. Another potential barrier to effective
therapeutic services for Asian Americans and Paciﬁc Islanders lies

525

in both the process and the goals of therapy that may prove antagonistic
to their cultural values. First, mental health and psychotherapy are
foreign concepts in Asian countries. Many refugees and immigrants have
limited faith in talking about problems. Second, therapy often asks the
clients to self-disclose their most intimate thoughts and feelings. Yet
Asian cultural values make it clear that talking about one's personal
life and family concerns to a stranger is inappropriate. Third,
traditional Asian values regarding restraint of strong feelings contrast
sharply with the more open and free expression of feelings in therapy.
In light of these factors, several suggestions have been offered for
working with Asian American populations (Ina, 1997; Sandhu, 1997; Sue &
Sue, 2003): ■

Therapists should be aware of potential social stigma attached to
seeking mental health services; issues of conﬁdentiality should be
strongly stressed.

■

Be aware that Asian Americans and Paciﬁc Islanders are more likely to
express psychological conﬂicts via somatic complaints and/or other
socially acceptable issues (educational and vocational problems).

■

Consider the possibility that client reluctance to self-disclose and to
freely express feelings and/or lower levels of verbalization in the
therapy session may be due to cultural factors and not indicative of
pathology.

■

The therapist should consider explaining the purpose of therapy, the
expectations, and the process itself.

Therapeutic Interventions

A more action-oriented problem-solving approach may be more consistent
with the therapeutic expectations of the client.

Latino or Hispanic Americans More than 35 million people, approximately
13 percent of the population, are Latino or Hispanic Americans. In
physical characteristics, the appearance of Latinos varies greatly and
may include resemblance to North American Indians, Blacks, Asians, or
Latins and Europeans, depending on their country of origin. The U.S.
Census classiﬁes Hispanics not as a racial but as an ethnic group. As
such, they can be members of any racial group. Latinos are
overrepresented among the poor, they have lower levels of education and
high unemployment, and they often live in substandard housing. They have
lower annual incomes, higher rates of poverty, greater rates of medical
problems, and less access to adequate health care than whites (DHHS,
1999; Flack et al., 1995; U.S. Bureau of Census, 1995). For Hispanic
Americans, family unity is seen as very important, as is respect for and
loyalty to the family. For many Hispanic Americans, the extended family
includes not only relatives but also "relatives" (though not by blood)
such as the best man (padrino), maid of honor (madrina), and godparents
(compadre and comadre). Each member of the family has a role:
grandparents (wisdom), father (responsibility), children (obedience),
and godparents (resourcefulness; Ruiz, 1995). Because of these
relationships and resources, they generally do not seek outside help
until after they obtain advice from the extended family and close
friends (Flores & Carey, 2000; Paniagua, 1998; Santiago-Rivera,
Arredondo, & Gallardo-Cooper, 2002; Sue & Sue, 2003). Epidemiological
studies indicate that the lifetime rates of mental illness of whites and
Latino Americans are no different (DHHS, 1999; Robins & Regier, 1991).
Nevertheless, there do appear to be differences in the stressors
experienced by Latinos, cultural differences that must be considered and
unique problems related to mental health care access. First, because
many Hispanics suffer from external factors such as prejudice,
discrimination, and poverty, some professionals have argued for social
change (Paniagua, 1998). The role of therapists should be to help
Hispanic clients become more aware of the oppression they face and to
attain personal and collective liberation. As a result, it is important
for therapists to understand the psychosocial, economic, and political
needs of the Hispanic client (Flores & Carey, 2000).

Second, the most appropriate therapist to work with traditional Hispanic
clients would be bilingual and bicultural. Yet the lack of bilingual
therapists poses communication problems with Hispanics who are not
conversant in English. It has been found, for example, that Mexican
American clients are seen as suffering from greater pathology when they
are interviewed in English rather than in Spanish (Sue & Sue, 2003).
Further, the use of interpreters causes as many problems as it cures.
Interpreters often misinterpret or distort the communication, become
embarrassed with the topics discussed, fail to understand the
therapeutic need for conﬁdentiality, lack adequate psychiatric knowledge
to work effectively, and may form an unhealthy alliance with the
therapist or the client. Third, the family structure of the traditional
Hispanic family tends to be patriarchal, and sex roles are clearly
deﬁned. In working with Hispanic Americans, the therapist will often
face problems dealing with conﬂicts over sex roles. In dealing with
sexrole conﬂicts, the therapist faces a dilemma and a potential value
conﬂict of his or her own. If therapists believe in equal relationships,
should they move clients in this direction, or should they respect the
cultural values of the group? Doing the former may be imposing one's
view on the culturally different client. Doing the latter raises the
question of whether the culture justiﬁes a practice. Clear answers to
these questions are difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Nevertheless, some suggestions can
be given when working with Hispanic clients (Munoz & Sanchez, 1996;
Paniagua, 1998; Sue & Sue, 2003; Vazquez, 1997): ■

Because interpersonal relationships are so valued in Hispanic culture
(personalismo), it is important for the therapist to engage the client
in a warm and respectful manner while maintaining a more formal persona.

■

The therapist must be sensitive to the possibility of linguistic
misunderstandings, especially if the client speaks limited English.
Determine whether a translator is needed.

■

Explaining therapy goals to the client is important.

■

Guard against misinterpretations. Lack of eye contact, silences, and
other nonverbal behaviors may be an indicator of respect for the
therapist rather than depression or cognitive dysfunction.

■

Determine the positive assets and resources available to the client and
his or her family. Remember that the extended family system of the
Hispanic family is often a source of help for the client.

Community Psychology

Native Americans Native Americans, with a population of approximately
3.5 million, make up slightly less than 1 percent of the U.S.
population. They form a highly heterogeneous group composed of more than
550 distinct tribes. The population is young, with 39 percent under
twenty-nine years of age, as compared with 29 percent of the total U.S.
population. It is difﬁcult to describe the Indian family, because tribes
vary from matriarchal structures (Navajo) to patriarchal ones.
Nevertheless, we know that as a group they have higher rates of poverty
than their white counterparts, die at younger ages, have less education,
and suffer from high unemployment rates. Although their diversity is
great, certain generalizations can be made about their values: (1) honor
and respect in a tribe is gained from sharing and giving, (2)
cooperation to achieve mutually shared goals is valued over individual
competition, (3) the concept of noninterference is valued over action
and taking charge, (4) present time rather than the future is
valued---punctuality or planning for the future is less important than
experiencing the current moment, (5) the extended family is the unit of
operation, and (6) harmony with nature is stressed (Carter & McGoldrick,
2005; Herring, 1999). These value differences can produce problems,
especially when interpreted from a non-Indian perspective. Wars and
diseases that resulted from contact with Europeans decimated the Native
American population so that by the end of the eighteenth century their
population had decreased to only 10 percent of its original numbers. The
experience of Native Americans in the United States is not comparable to
that of any other ethnic group. They were the original people who lived
on this land until it was taken from them due to federal and state
policies (Johnson et al., 1995). During the 1930s, over 125,000 Native
Americans from different tribes were forced from their homes in many
different states to reservations. The move was and continues to be a
traumatic one for Native American families, in many cases, disrupting
their cultural traditions, forcing them into English-speaking schools,
and removing children from their homes until the Child Welfare Act was
passed in 1978. No wonder Native Americans are very suspicious of the
motives of the majority culture and almost expect to be treated unfairly
by non--Native American agencies (Johnson et al., 1995). Many
multicultural psychologists believe that the oppressive acts of the
United States government toward Native Americans have resulted in the
many mental health disorders in this group. The suicide epidemic among
Native Americans is thought to be the result of poverty, a breakdown in
family values caused by the

527

disruption of the family, and prejudice and discrimination. American
Indians have twice the rate of attempted and completed suicide as other
youths (DHHS, 1999). Substance abuse is one of the greatest problems
faced by Native Americans; they are more likely to die of
alcohol-related causes than the general U.S. population (Penn, Kar,
Kramer, Skinner, & Zambrana, 1995). In working with Native Americans,
some therapists have recommended the following guidelines (Carter &
McGoldrick, 2005; DHHS, 1999; Herring, 1999; Sue & Sue, 2003): ■

The therapist must be patient. Expectations that the client will rapidly
and easily talk about sensitive materials may be unrealistic; it may
take longer for clients to open up, because trust must be established
ﬁrst.

■

Basic needs should be addressed ﬁrst. Problems related to nourishment,
health care, poverty, shelter, child care, and employment should receive
top priority in the sessions, and appropriate action should be taken.

■

The value of noninterference and the reality that problems reside in the
client's environment may mean that the therapist should use a
combination of therapeutic approaches. For example, personcentered
strategies of respect and acceptance of the client and allowing the
client to develop his or her solutions to the problem must be balanced
with more behavioral/cognitive approaches to dealing with systemic
issues.

■

The therapist should be aware that communication style differences (eye
contact, silences, and the expression of affect) are culturally
determined. Making unwarranted psychiatric interpretations should be
guarded against.

■

Finally, the therapist might beneﬁt from seeking counsel with indigenous
healers in the Native American community.

Community Psychology It is difﬁcult to discuss psychotherapy and
intervention without reference to the context in which services are
provided. The context involves people living in families and communities
and functioning within social, economic, educational, political,
religious, cultural, and health institutions. Community psychology is an
approach to mental health that takes into account the inﬂuence of
environmental factors and that encourages

A Shameful Past, a Hope for the Future In the past, patients with mental
disorders were often kept in mental hospitals under substandard living
conditions, like those shown here. Today, community psychologists work
to improve both community resources for people with disorders and the
effectiveness of the services provided.

the use of community resources and agencies to eliminate conditions that
produce psychological problems. It is concerned with the promotion of
well-being and the prevention of mental disturbance. Pertinent issues
include managed health care and the prevention of psychopathology.

Managed Health Care The delivery of mental health services is headed for
major changes. Concerns have been expressed over

the rising costs of medical and mental health care, the uncertainty of
treatment outcome, and the inadequacies in the delivery of treatment to
certain segments of the population, such as older individuals and
members of ethnic minority groups (Holloway, 2004). As Figure 17.3
indicates, only a small proportion of individuals with mental disorders
seek care from the mental health system, and changes are needed to make
services accessible, available, and affordable. Reform is occurring in
several ways. The following are among the most important. First, mental
health care is shifting to health maintenance organizations (HMOs),
which operate to reduce costs as much as possible. At the same time,
traditional fee-for-service ﬁnancing of services is diminishing. Many
HMOs are turning to managed-care companies to administer their mental
health beneﬁt plans. Second, care providers tend to emphasize short-term
treatment, intended to enable the client to function, rather than
long-term treatment that attempts to "cure" the client. Third,
individuals with master's degrees and others who do not have doctorates
are increasingly providing services formerly provided by therapists with
M.D.'s, Ph.D.'s or Psy.D.'s. Because doctoral providers' services cost
more, they will be less in demand. Fourth, the effectiveness and cost
efﬁciency of treatments and of clinicians must be continually assessed
to reduce cost and inefﬁciency. Accountability and quality assurance are
emphasized to an even greater degree than in the past. Although there is
general consensus that problems have existed in the mental health
system, managed care has not been enthusiastically embraced by many
mental health professionals. For example, there are concerns that health
maintenance organizations may FIGURE 17.3 Use of Mental

Epidemiologic Catchment Area survey of adult Americans, 28.1 percent of
the sample said they were experiencing or had experienced a mental or
addictive disorder during the previous year. During that year, 14.7
percent of Americans sought mental health services. Because many of
those who sought services did not meet the criteria for a mental
disorder, only 8 percent of the population had both a mental or
addictive disorder and sought services. Thus only 28.5 percent of those
with mental or addictive disorders used services (8 percent divided by
28.1 percent).

Community Psychology

attempt to reduce costs simply by reducing the quality or extent of
services, expending little effort on preventing problems, hiring
providers to give cheap services, and gaining a much stronger voice than
providers of services in determining treatment for clients (Holloway,
2004; Karon, 1995; Seligman & Levant, 1998). Clients may have a difﬁcult
time obtaining more long-term care. In adapting to the reforms in mental
health care, some have pointed out the need for focused training of
mental health care providers. These reforms could ensure that clinical
health psychologists' educational background includes behavioral
medicine and health psychology, as well as clinical psychology. Other
skills in health assessment and intervention and outcome assessment are
also needed (Belar, 1995). Reform is also taking place in other ways.
For example, the American Psychological Association has endorsed the
principle that clinical psychologists with proper training should be
able to prescribe medication for patients with mental disorders (Martin,
1995), although some psychologists oppose such a move (Hayes, 1995).
Another facet of the reform movement is a systematic attempt that is
being made to identify those treatments that have been empirically
supported as being effective (Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination
of Psychological Procedures, 1995). It is hoped that the effort will
make it possible to establish standards for client and therapist
treatment decisions based on scientiﬁc research. "Manualized" treatment
programs are also gaining popularity (Addis, 1997; Woody & Sanderson,
1998). These programs have manuals that instruct therapists
(particularly those using cognitive and cognitive-behavioral approaches)
to conduct treatment in a planned, systematic, and guided fashion. The
assumption is that following treatment manuals will reduce possible
ineffective discretionary practices that therapists use when they base
procedures largely on their own judgment. The use of manuals in
treatment, however, has generated some controversy, especially among
those clinicians who believe that discretionary practices are necessary
in psychotherapy (see Kazdin, 1998). Finally, the increasing use of
computer programs to provide psychotherapy to clients is evident (Marks,
Shaw, & Parkin, 1998). Clients describe their problems on a computer and
then receive programmed information and advice on the problems and how
to deal with them. Proponents see advantages to computer-aided
treatments, such as low cost and easy accessibility. Opponents believe
that clients need the human contact of a therapist and that a computer
cannot consider factors for which it was not programmed. Thus the ﬁeld

media to reach out to people with emotional problems. These

involved in mental health, is changing, and with this change come both
opportunities and conﬂicts.

Prevention of Psychopathology Preventing psychopathology is one of the
most innovative functions of community psychology. Prevention programs
are attempts to maintain health rather than to treat sickness. The main
emphasis is on reducing the number of new cases of mental disorders, the
duration of disorders among afﬂicted people, and the disabling effects
of disorders. These three areas of prevention have been called primary,
secondary, and tertiary prevention. Primary Prevention Primary
prevention is an effort to lower the incidence of new cases of
behavioral disorders by strengthening or adding to resources that
promote mental health and by eliminating community characteristics that
threaten mental health. As an example of the former, Project Head Start
was initiated in 1964 with the goal of setting up a new and massive
preschool program to help neglected or deprived children develop social,
emotional, and intellectual skills. Examples of the latter are efforts
to eliminate discrimination against members of minority groups to help
them fulﬁll their potential. Both techniques---introducing new resources
and eliminating causal factors---can be directed toward speciﬁc groups
of people or toward the community as a whole. Munoz and colleagues
(Munoz, Glish, Soo-Hoo, & Robertson, 1982; Munoz et al., 1995) have been
systematically attempting to prevent depression in a

community-wide project and in primary care patients. The project was
particularly interesting. During a twoweek period, nine televised
programs intended to prevent depression were broadcast in San Francisco.
Each program lasted for four minutes and showed viewers some coping
skills, such as how to think positively, engage in rewarding activities,
and deal with depression. Telephone interviews were conducted with 294
San Francisco residents. Some respondents were interviewed one week
before the television segments were shown; others were interviewed one
week after; and still others were interviewed both before and after the
segments. Information about respondents' depression levels was collected
during the interviews. (For those who were interviewed before and after
the segments, the depression measure was administered twice.)
Respondents who were interviewed after the televised segments were also
asked to indicate whether they had watched any of the segments. Results
indicated that those who saw the segments exhibited a signiﬁcantly lower
level of depression than that found among the nonviewers. The results,
however, held only for respondents who had some symptoms of depression
to begin with. Watching the television programs did not change the
depression levels of those who initially (before the segments) reported
little depression. The results indicated that a community-wide
prevention program could be beneﬁcial. A large proportion (approximately
one-third) of the viewers had some symptoms of depression, and this
group showed fewer symptoms after viewing the programs. The long-term

effects of the programs were not assessed. Another problem in the study
was that those who beneﬁted from the programs had exhibited some initial
symptoms. If they were clinically diagnosable as being depressed, the
intervention might be considered secondary rather than primary
prevention. (Secondary prevention is discussed in the next section.)
Nevertheless, the San Francisco study demonstrated the effects of
large-scale interventions that may help disorders. Evidence also exists
that early, primary prevention efforts can be successful in reducing the
incidence of juvenile delinquency. Zigler, Taussig, and Black (1992)
noted that few treatment and rehabilitation programs for juvenile
delinquents have had much effect. In their review of early intervention
programs aimed at children, they found evidence that these programs,
intended to promote social and intellectual competence, have had an
expected positive effect on preventing delinquency. The investigators
speculated that gaining competence may snowball to generate further
success in other aspects of life and prevent delinquency. Although
interest in primary prevention continues to grow, resistance to
prevention is also strong. First, only through prospective and
longitudinal research can developmental processes in primary prevention
be uncovered (Lorion, 1990). Primary prevention is futureoriented, in
that the beneﬁts of the effort are not immediately apparent. Second,
primary prevention competes with traditional programs aimed at treating
people who already show emotional disturbances. Third, prevention may
require social and environmental changes so that

Community Psychology

531

stresses can be reduced or resources can be enhanced. Most mental health
workers are either unable or unwilling to initiate such changes; many
others doubt that people have the ability to modify social structures.
Fourth, funding for mental health programs has traditionally been
earmarked for treatment. Prevention efforts constitute a new demand on
the funding system. And ﬁfth, primary prevention requires a great deal
of planning, work, and long-term evaluation. This effort alone
discourages many from becoming involved.

detected, it is often difﬁcult to decide what form of treatment will be
most effective with a particular patient. Third, prompt treatment is
frequently unavailable because of the shortage of mental health
personnel and the inaccessibility of services. Indeed, many mental
health facilities have long lists of would-be patients who must wait
months before receiving treatment. "Walk-in" clinics, crisis
intervention facilities, and emergency telephone lines have been
established in an attempt to provide immediate treatment.

Secondary Prevention Secondary prevention is an attempt to shorten the
duration of mental disorders and to reduce their impact. If the presence
of a disorder can be detected early and an effective treatment can be
found, it is possible to minimize the impact of the disorder or to
prevent its developing into a more serious and debilitating form. For
example, classroom teachers can play an important role in secondary
prevention by identifying children who are not adjusting to the school
environment. Once identiﬁed, such children can be helped by teachers,
parents, or school counselors. In practice, there are a number of
problems associated with secondary prevention. First, traditional
diagnostic methods are often unreliable and provide little insight into
which treatment procedures to use. It has been suggested that more
specialized diagnostic techniques be used, perhaps focusing on certain
behaviors or on demographic characteristics that may be related to
psychopathology. Second, once a disorder is

Tertiary Prevention The goal of tertiary prevention is to facilitate the
readjustment of the person to community life after hospital treatment
for a mental disorder. Tertiary prevention focuses on reversing the
effects of institutionalization and on providing a smooth transition to
a productive life in the community. Several programs have been developed
to accomplish this goal. One involves the use of "passes," whereby
hospitalized patients are encouraged to leave the hospital for short
periods of time. By spending gradually increasing periods of time in the
community (and then returning each time to the hospital), the patient
can slowly readjust to life away from the hospital while still beneﬁting
from therapy. Psychologists can also ease readjustment to the community
by educating the public about mental disorders. Public attitudes toward
mental patients are often based on fears and stereotypes. Factual
information can help modify these attitudes so that patients will be
more graciously accepted. This help is especially important for

Serving Those in Need Because of client demand, some mental health
clinics have waiting lists. Clients, therefore, may not receive
immediate treatment unless it is an emergency. Walk-in clinics and
drop-in centers like this one allow individuals easy and quick access to

the family, friends, and business associates of patients, who must
interact frequently with them. A more difﬁcult problem to deal with is
the growing backlash against the discharge of former mental patients
into nursing homes or rooming houses in the community.

What forms of medical treatment have been found to be successful in
treating mental disorders? Biological (or somatic) treatments use
physical means to alter the physiological and psychological states of
patients. The use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or electroshock,
has diminished, but it is still used for some patients with severe
depression. ■ Because psychosurgery permanently destroys brain tissue,
it is now rarely used and strictly regulated. ■ One reason for the
declining use of both ECT and psychosurgery is a correspondingly greater
reliance on medication or drug therapy. Antianxiety drugs reduce
anxiety, antipsychotic drugs help control or eliminate psychotic
symptoms, antimanic drugs reduce mania, and antidepressants effectively
reduce depression. Medication has enabled many patients to function in
the community and to be more amenable to other forms of treatment,
particularly insight-oriented and behavioral therapy. ■

What is psychotherapy? ■

Psychotherapy is the application of techniques derived from
psychological principles to help disturbed clients. Clients, who usually
have certain hopes and anxiety on entering therapy, have an opportunity
to develop a therapeutic relationship with a therapist and, in the
process, to learn new ways of dealing with problems and to experience or
reexperience important emotions. The techniques therapists use vary
widely and depend on the therapist's theoretical orientation.

What are the different approaches to psychotherapy? ■

The insight-oriented therapeutic approaches include psychodynamic
therapy, person-centered therapy, existential analysis, and gestalt
therapy. These approaches provide the patient with an opportunity to
develop better levels of functioning, to undergo new and emotionally
important experi-

Many community members feel threatened when such patients live in their
neighborhoods. Again, education programs may help dispel community
members' fears and stereotypes.

ences, to develop a therapeutic relationship with a professional, and to
relate personal thoughts and feelings. ■ Action-oriented or behavior
therapies (based on classical conditioning, operant conditioning,
modeling, and cognitive restructuring) have been applied to a variety of
disorders. Behavioral assessment, procedures, goals, and outcome
measures are more clearly deﬁned and more easily subjected to empirical
investigation than are insight-oriented approaches. Two promising
approaches are behavioral medicine and stress resistance training, which
combine behavioral, cognitive, medical, and social knowledge.

How successful is therapy in treating mental disorders? Some critics
claim that the effectiveness of psychotherapy---of whatever
orientation---has not been demonstrated. ■ Results from numerous studies
and meta-analyses of these studies have pointed to the beneﬁcial impact
of treatment. The real issue, however, may be one of ﬁnding the best
combination of therapies and situational variables for each client. ■
Although critics argue that behavior therapy is dehumanizing, limited to
a narrow range of human problems, and mechanical, proponents consider
behavior modiﬁcation both effective and efﬁcient. ■

How are group forms of therapy different from individual ones? Group
therapy involves the simultaneous treatment of more than one person. ■
Many psychological difﬁculties are interpersonal in nature, and the
group format allows the therapist and clients to work in an
interpersonal context. ■ Family and couples therapies consider
psychological problems as residing within the family or couple rather
than in one individual. ■ The communications approach to family therapy
concentrates on improving family communications, whereas the systems
approach stresses the understanding and restructuring of family roles
and dynamics. ■

strategies in working with African Americans, Asian Americans/Paciﬁc
Islanders, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans seem to require that
the therapist take into consideration several important factors in
therapy: (1) historical and continuing oppression in the form of
prejudice and discrimination, (2) the cultural values and assumptions of
the minority group, and (3) recognition that the process and goals of
therapy may be antagonistic to the life experiences of the minority
group. ■

In discussing therapeutic intervention, it is also important to be aware
of broader mental health efforts involving community psychology or
community mental health. Several developments are necessary to consider.
• First, a growing trend in the delivery of mental health services is
managed health care. Under managed health care, consideration will be
given to cost effectiveness of services and short-term care. Although
many mental health providers are critical of managed care, others have
called for changes in the role of and services given by providers. •
Second, the mental health ﬁeld is also grappling with issues involving
prescription privileges for psychologists, using empirically supported
treatments as a guideline for delivery services, and employing treatment
manuals in the practice of psychotherapy and behavioral modiﬁcation. •
Third, in addition to treatment, primary, secondary, and tertiary forms
of prevention are important in our efforts to enhance mental health and
well-being.
