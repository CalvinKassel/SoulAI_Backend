Naval's Razor Figure out how much an hour of your time is worth. Your
'aspirational hourly' rate. When deciding whether or not to do a task,
ask whether it's worth more or less than your rate. If it's worth less
than your rate, outsource it, automate it, or delete it.

Munger's Razor Never allow yourself to have an opinion unless you can
state the other side's argument better than they can. This is the
antiodote to confirmation bias. Doing the work required to hold an
opinion means you can argue against yourself better than others can.

Hitchen's Razor What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed
without evidence. The burden of proof regarding the truthfulness of a
claim lies with who makes the claim; if it's not met, then the claim is
unfounded. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

Newton's Flaming Laser Sword If a question can't be answered through
experiment, it's not worth asking. If something can't be settled by
observation, then it's not worthy of debate. Pick your battles.

Joe Rogan's Razor If unsure what action to take, act like your life is a
movie, and you are the superhero starring in it. Do what your kids would
one day look back at with pride.
