CLOSE TO MORNING

Why do people keep asking to see

God's identity papers

when the darkness opening into morning

is more than enough?

Certainly any god might turn away in disgust.

Think of Sheba approaching

the kingdom of Solomon.

Do you think she had to ask,

"Is this the place?"

<div>

[]{#009_THIS_MORNING.xhtml_pageMap_4 .pagebreak title="4"}THIS MORNING

This morning the redbirds' eggs

have hatched and already the chicks

are chirping for food. They don't

know where it's coming from, they

just keep shouting, "More! More!"

As to anything else, they haven't

had a single thought. Their eyes

haven't yet opened, they know nothing

about the sky that's waiting. Or

the thousands, the millions of trees.

They don't even know they have wings.

And just like that, like a simple

neighborhood event, a miracle is

taking place.

The world I live in and believe in

is wider than that. And anyway,

what's wrong with *Maybe*?

You wouldn't believe what once or

twice I have seen. I'll just

tell you this:

only if there are angels in your head will you

ever, possibly, see one.

SWANS

Do you bow your head when you pray or do you look

up into that blue space?

Take your choice, prayers fly from all directions.

And don't worry about what language you use,

God no doubt understands them all.

Even when the swans are flying north and making

such a ruckus of noise, God is surely listening

and understanding.

Rumi said, There is no proof of the soul.

But isn't the return of spring and how it

springs up in our hearts a pretty good hint?

Yes, I know, God's silence never breaks, but is

that really a problem?

There are thousands of voices, after all.

And furthermore, don't you imagine (I just suggest it)

that the swans know about as much as we do about

the whole business?

So listen to them and watch them, singing as they fly.

Take from it what you can.

[]{#012_STORAGE.xhtml_pageMap_7 .pagebreak title="7"}STORAGE

When I moved from one house to another

there were many things I had no room

for. What does one do? I rented a storage

space. And filled it. Years passed.

Occasionally I went there and looked in,

but nothing happened, not a single

twinge of the heart.

As I grew older the things I cared

about grew fewer, but were more

important. So one day I undid the lock

and called the trash man. He took

everything.

I felt like the little donkey when

his burden is finally lifted. Things!

Burn them, burn them! Make a beautiful

fire! More room in your heart for love,

for the trees! For the birds who own

nothing---the reason they can fly.

That pretty little beast, a poem,

has a mind of its own.

Sometimes I want it to crave apples

but it wants red meat.

Sometimes I want to walk peacefully

on the shore

and it wants to take off all its clothes

and dive in.

Sometimes I want to use small words

and make them important

and it starts shouting the dictionary,

the opportunities.

Sometimes I want to sum up and give thanks,

putting things in order

and it starts dancing around the room

on its four furry legs, laughing

and calling me outrageous.

But sometimes, when I'm thinking about you,

and no doubt smiling,

it sits down quietly, one paw under its chin,

and just listens.

August of another summer, and once again

I am drinking the sun

and the lilies again are spread across the water.

I know now what they want is to touch each other.

I have not been here for many years

during which time I kept living my life.

Like the heron, who can only croak, who wishes he

could sing,

I wish I could sing.

A little thanks from every throat would be appropriate.

This is how it has been, and this is how it is:

All my life I have been able to feel happiness,

except whatever was not happiness,

which I also remember.

Each of us wears a shadow.

But just now it is summer again

and I am watching the lilies bow to each other,

then slide on the wind and the tug of desire,

close, close to one another.

Soon now, I'll turn and start for home.

And who knows, maybe I'll be singing.

I was that way, asleep, for years.

That way, you forget too many important things.

How the little stones, even if you can't hear them,

are singing.

How the river can't wait to get to the ocean and

the sky, it's been there before.

What traveling is that!

It is a joy to imagine such distances.

I could skip sleep for the next hundred years.

There is a fire in the lashes of my eyes.

It doesn't matter where I am, it could be a small room.

The glimmer of gold BÃ¶hme saw on the kitchen pot

was missed by everyone else in the house.

Maybe the fire in my lashes is a reflection of that.

Why do I have so many thoughts, they are driving me

crazy.

Why am I always going anywhere, instead of

somewhere?

Listen to me or not, it hardly matters.

I'm not trying to be wise, that would be foolish.

rattles and stares

I step into the painting of the four blue horses.

I am not even surprised that I can do this.

One of the horses walks toward me.

His blue nose noses me lightly. I put my arm

over his blue mane, not holding on, just

commingling.

He allows me my pleasure.

Franz Marc died a young man, shrapnel in his brain.

I would rather die than try to explain to the blue horses

what war is.

They would either faint in horror, or simply

find it impossible to believe.

I do not know how to thank you, Franz Marc.

Maybe our world will grow kinder eventually.

Maybe the desire to make something beautiful

is the piece of God that is inside each of us.

Now all four horses have come closer,

are bending their faces toward me

as if they have secrets to tell.

I don't expect them to speak, and they don't.

If being so beautiful isn't enough, what

could they possibly say?

MEDITATING, SORT OF

Meditation, so I've heard, is best accomplished

if you entertain a certain strict posture.

Frankly, I prefer just to lounge under a tree.

So why should I think I could ever be successful?

Some days I fall asleep, or land in that

even better place---half-asleep---where the world,

spring, summer, autumn, winter---

flies through my mind in its

hardy ascent and its uncompromising descent.

So I just lie like that, while distance and time

reveal their true attitudes: they never

heard of me, and never will, or ever need to.

Of course I wake up finally

thinking, how wonderful to be who I am,

made out of earth and water,

Is the tree as it rises delighted with its many

I was enjoying everything: the rain, the path

wherever it was taking me, the earth roots

beginning to stir.

I didn't intend to start thinking about God,

it just happened.

How God, or the gods, are invisible,

quite understandable.

But holiness is visible, entirely.

It's wonderful to walk along like that,

thought not the usual intention to reach an answer

but merely drifting.

Like clouds that only seem weightless

but of course are not.

Are really important.

I mean, terribly important.

Not decoration by any means.

By next week the violets will be blooming.

Anyway, this was my delicious walk in the rain.

What was it actually about?

Think about what it is that music is trying to say.

I'm living in a warm place now, where

you can purchase fresh blueberries all

year long. Labor free. From various

countries in South America. They're

as sweet as any, and compared with the

berries I used to pick in the fields

outside of Provincetown, they're

enormous. But berries are berries. They

don't speak any language I can't

understand. Neither do I find ticks or

small spiders crawling among them. So,

generally speaking, I'm very satisfied.

There are limits, however. What they

don't have is the field. The field they

belonged to and through the years I

began to feel I belonged to. Well,

there's life, and then there's later.

Maybe it's myself that I miss. The

field, and the sparrow singing at the

edge of the woods. And the doe that one

morning came upon me unaware, all

tense and gorgeous. She stamped her hoof

as you would to any intruder: Then gave

me a long look, as if to say, Okay, you

stay in your patch, I'll stay in mine.

Which is what we did. Try packing that

up, South America.

runs for the yard.

Then he's back, and we

hug for a long time.

In his low-to-the-ground chest

I can hear his heart slowing down.

Then I rub his shoulders and

kiss his feet

and fondle his long hound ears.

Benny, I say,

don't worry. I also know the way

the old life haunts the new.

Where goes he now, that dark little dog

who used to come down the road barking and shining?

He's gone now, from the world of particulars,

the singular, the visible.

So, that deepest sting: sorrow. Still,

is he gone from us entirely, or is he

a part of that other world, everywhere?

Come with me into the woods where spring is

advancing, as it does, no matter what,

not being singular or particular, but one

of the forever gifts, and certainly visible.

See how the violets are opening, and the leaves

unfolding, the streams gleaming and the birds

singing. What does it make you think of?

She would come back, dripping thick water, from the green bog.

She would fall at my feet, she would draw the black skin

from her gums, in a hideous and wonderful smile---

and I would rub my hands over her pricked ears and her

cunning elbows,

and I would hug the barrel of her body, amazed at the unassuming

perfect arch of her neck.

![](image/1.jpg){.h1em}

It took four of us to carry her into the woods.

We did not think of music,

but, anyway, it began to rain

slowly.

![](image/1.jpg){.h1em}

Her wolfish, invitational, half-pounce.

Her great and lordly satisfaction at having chased something.

My great and lordly satisfaction at her splash

of happiness as she barged

through the pitch pines swiping my face with her

wild, slightly mossy tongue.

![](image/1.jpg){.h1em}

A dog lives fifteen years, if you're lucky.

[]{#039_HER_GRAVE.xhtml_pageMap_39 .pagebreak title="39"}Do the cranes
crying out in the high clouds

think it is all their own music?

A dog comes to you and lives with you in your own house, but you

do not therefore own her, as you do not own the rain, or the

Does the bear wandering in the autumn up the side of the hill

think all by herself she has imagined the refuge and the refreshment

of her long slumber?

A dog can never tell you what she knows from the

smells of the world, but you know, watching her, that you know

almost nothing.

Does the water snake with his backbone of diamonds think

the black tunnel on the bank of the pond is a palace

of his own making?

![](image/1.jpg){.h1em}

She roved ahead of me through the fields, yet would come back, or

wait for me, or be somewhere.

Now she is buried under the pines.

Nor will I argue it, or pray for anything but modesty, and

not to be angry.

[]{#039_HER_GRAVE.xhtml_pageMap_40 .pagebreak title="40"}Through the
trees there is the sound of the wind, palavering.

The smell of the pine needles, what is it but a taste

in the room. I could hear Ben among

other voices barking, howling in the

but he was unreachable. As music

is present yet you can't touch it.

"Yes, it's all different," he said.

"You're going to be very surprised."

But I wasn't thinking of that. I only

wanted to hold him. "Listen," he said,

"I miss that too.

And now you'll be telling stories

of my coming back

and they won't be false, and they won't be true,

but they'll be real."

And then, as he used to, he said, "Let's go!"

I don't know where prayers go,

Do cats pray, while they sleep

half-asleep in the sun?

Does the opossum pray as it

The sunflowers? The old black oak

growing older every year?

I know I can walk through the world,

along the shore or under the trees,

with my mind filled with things

of little importance, in full

self-attendance. A condition I can't really

call being alive.

Is a prayer a gift, or a petition,

or does it matter?

The sunflowers blaze, maybe that's their way.

Maybe the cats are sound asleep. Maybe not.

While I was thinking this I happened to be standing

just outside my door, with my notebook open,

which is the way I begin every morning.

Then a wren in the privet began to sing.

He was positively drenched in enthusiasm,

I don't know why. And yet, why not.

[]{#044_I_HAPPENED_TO_BE_STA.xhtml_pageMap_47 .pagebreak title="47"}I
wouldn't persuade you from whatever you believe

wave and seaweed, their piled curvatures

When I lived under the black oaks

When I lived by Little Sister Pond,

I dreamed I was the feather of the blue heron

left on the shore;

I was the pond lily, my root delicate as an artery,

my face like a star,

my happiness brimming.

Later I was the footsteps that follow the sea.

I knew the tides, I knew the ingredients of the wrack.

I knew the eider, the red-throated loon

with his uplifted beak and his smart eye.

I felt I was the tip of the wave,

the pearl of water on the eider's glossy back.

No, there's no escaping, nor would I want to escape

this outgo, this foot-loosening, this solution

to gravity and a single shape.

Now I am here, later I will be there.

I will be that small cloud, staring down at the water,

Early in the morning we crossed the ghat,

where fires were still smoldering,

and gazed, with our Western minds, into the Ganges.

A woman was standing in the river up to her waist;

she was lifting handfuls of water and spilling it

over her body, slowly and many times,

as if until there came some moment

of inner satisfaction between her own life and the river's.

Then she dipped a vessel she had brought with her

and carried it filled with water back across the ghat,

no doubt to refresh some shrine near where she lives,

for this is the holy city of Shiva, maker

of the world, and this is his river.

I can't say much more, except that it all happened

in silence and peaceful simplicity, and something that felt

like the bliss of a certainty and a life lived

in accordance with that certainty.

of fighting back, that sometimes something happens better than all the
riches or power in the world. It could be anything, but very likely you
notice it in the instant when love begins. Anyway, that's often the

1\.

Will the hungry ox stand in the field and not eat

Will the owl bite off its own wings?

Will the lark forget to lift its body in the air or

forget to sing?

Will the rivers run upstream?

Behold, I say---behold

2\.

Eat bread and understand comfort.

Drink water, and understand delight.

Visit the garden where the scarlet trumpets

are opening their bodies for the hummingbirds

who are drinking the sweetness, who are

thrillingly gluttonous.

For one thing leads to another.

Soon you will notice how stones shine underfoot.

Eventually tides will be the only calendar you believe in.

And someone's face, whom you love, will be as a star

both intimate and ultimate,

and you will be both heart-shaken and respectful.

is my whole conversation

with you, my darlings.

All I can tell you is what I know.

Look, and look again.

This world is not just a little thrill for the eyes.

It's more than bones.

It's more than the delicate wrist with its personal pulse.

It's more than the beating of the single heart.

It's praising.

It's giving until the giving feels like receiving.

still another.

I cast them out, I put them on the mush pile.

Love yourself. Then forget it. Then, love the world.

[]{#069_EVIDENCE.xhtml_pageMap_80 .pagebreak title="80"}EVIDENCE

1\.

Where do I live? If I had no address, as many people

do not, I could nevertheless say that I lived in the

same town as the lilies of the field, and the still

waters.

Spring, and all through the neighborhood now there are

strong men tending flowers.

Beauty without purpose is beauty without virtue. But

all beautiful things, inherently, have this function---

to excite the viewers toward sublime thought. Glory

to the world, that good teacher.

Among the swans there is none called the least, or

the greatest.

I believe in kindness. Also in mischief. Also in

singing, especially when singing is not necessarily

prescribed.

As for the body, it is solid and strong and curious

and full of detail; it wants to polish itself; it

wants to love another body; it is the only vessel in

the world that can hold, in a mix of power and

sweetness: words, song, gesture, passion, ideas,

ingenuity, devotion, merriment, vanity, and virtue.

Keep some room in your heart for the unimaginable.

[]{#069_EVIDENCE.xhtml_pageMap_81 .pagebreak title="81"}2.

There are many ways to perish, or to flourish.

How old pain, for example, can stall us at the

threshold of function.

Memory: a golden bowl, or a basement without light.

For which reason the nightmare comes with its

painful story and says: *you need to know this.*

Some memories I would give anything to forget.

Others I would not give up upon the point of

death, they are the bright hawks of my life.

Still, friends, consider stone, that is without

the fret of gravity, and water that is without

anxiety.

And the pine trees that never forget their

recipe for renewal.

And the female wood duck who is looking this way

and that way for her children. And the snapping

turtle who is looking this way and that way also.

This is the world.

And consider, always, every day, the determination

of the grass to grow despite the unending obstacles.

[]{#069_EVIDENCE.xhtml_pageMap_82 .pagebreak title="82"}3.

I ask you again: if you have not been enchanted by

this adventure---your life---what would do for

you?

And, where are you, with your ears bagged down

as if with packets of sand? Listen. We all

have much more listening to do. Tear the sand

away. And listen. The river is singing.

What blackboard could ever be invented that

could hold all the zeros of eternity?

Let me put it this way---if you disdain the

cobbler may I assume you walk barefoot?

Last week I met the so-called deranged man

who lives in the woods. He was walking with

great care, so as not to step on any small,

living thing.

For myself, I have walked in these woods for

more than forty years, and I am the only

thing, it seems, that is about to be used up.

Or, to be less extravagant, will, in the

foreseeable future, be used up.

[]{#069_EVIDENCE.xhtml_pageMap_83 .pagebreak title="83"}First, though, I
want to step out into some

fresh morning and look around and hear myself

crying out: "The house of money is falling!

How grass can be nourishing in the

How rivers and stones are forever

in allegiance with gravity

while we ourselves dream of rising.

How two hands touch and the bonds will

never be broken.

How people come, from delight or the

scars of damage,

to the comfort of a poem.

Let me keep my distance, always, from those

who think they have the answers.

Let me keep company always with those who say

"Look!" and laugh in astonishment,

and bow their heads.

[]{#072_AT_THE_RIVER_CLARION.xhtml_pageMap_86 .pagebreak title="86"}AT
THE RIVER CLARION

1\.

I don't know who God is exactly.

But I'll tell you this.

I was sitting in the river named Clarion, on a

water splashed stone

and all afternoon I listened to the voices

of the river talking.

Whenever the water struck the stone it had

something to say,

and the water itself, and even the mosses trailing

under the water.

And slowly, very slowly, it became clear to me

what they were saying.

Said the river: I am part of holiness.

And I too, said the stone. And I too, whispered

the moss beneath the water.

I'd been to the river before, a few times.

Don't blame the river that nothing happened quickly.

You don't hear such voices in an hour or a day.

You don't hear them at all if selfhood has stuffed your ears.

And it's difficult to hear anything anyway, through

all the traffic, and ambition.

2\.

If God exists he isn't just butter and good luck.

He's also the tick that killed my wonderful dog Luke.

Said the river: imagine everything you can imagine, then

keep on going.

[]{#072_AT_THE_RIVER_CLARION.xhtml_pageMap_87 .pagebreak
title="87"}Imagine how the lily (who may also be a part of God)

would sing to you if it could sing, if

you would pause to hear it.

And how are you so certain anyway that it doesn't sing?

If God exists he isn't just churches and mathematics.

He's the forest, He's the desert.

He's the ice caps, that are dying.

He's the ghetto and the Museum of Fine Arts.

He's van Gogh and Allen Ginsberg and Robert

Motherwell.

He's the many desperate hands, cleaning and preparing

their weapons.

He's every one of us, potentially.

The leaf of grass, the genius, the politician,

the poet.

And if this is true, isn't it something very important?

Yes, it could be that I am a tiny piece of God, and

each of you too, or at least

of his intention and his hope.

Which is a delight beyond measure.

I don't know how you get to suspect such an idea.

I only know that the river kept singing.

It wasn't a persuasion, it was all the river's own

constant joy

which was better by far than a lecture, which was

comfortable, exciting, unforgettable.

[]{#072_AT_THE_RIVER_CLARION.xhtml_pageMap_88 .pagebreak title="88"}3.

Of course for each of us, there is the daily life.

Let us live it, gesture by gesture.

When we cut the ripe melon, should we not give it thanks?

And should we not thank the knife also?

We do not live in a simple world.

4\.

There was someone I loved who grew old and ill.

One by one I watched the fires go out.

There was nothing I could do

except to remember

that we receive

then we give back.

5\.

My dog Luke lies in a grave in the forest,

she is given back.

But the river Clarion still flows

from wherever it comes from

to where it has been told to go.

I pray for the desperate earth.

I pray for the desperate world.

I do the little each person can do, it isn't much.

Sometimes the river murmurs, sometimes it raves.

[]{#072_AT_THE_RIVER_CLARION.xhtml_pageMap_89 .pagebreak title="89"}6.

Along its shores were, may I say, very intense

cardinal flowers.

And trees, and birds that have wings to uphold them,

for heaven's sakes---

the lucky ones: they have such deep natures,

they are so happily obedient.

While I sit here in a house filled with books,

ideas, doubts, hesitations.

7\.

And still, pressed deep into my mind, the river

keeps coming, touching me, passing by on its

long journey, its pale, infallible voice

After the wind-bruised sea

furrowed itself back

into folds of blue, I found

in the black wrack

a shell called the Neptune---

tawny and white,

spherical,

with a tail

and a tower

and a dark door,

and all of it

no larger

than my fist.

It looked, you might say,

very expensive.

I thought of its travels

in the Atlantic's

wind-pounded bowl

and wondered

that it was still intact.

Ah yes, there was

that door

that held only the eventual, inevitable

emptiness.

There's that---there's always that.

Still, what a house

to leave behind!

I held it

The darkest thing

met me in the dark.

It was only a face

and a brace of teeth

that held no words,

though I felt a salty breath

sighing in my direction.

Once, in an autumn that is long gone,

I was down on my knees

in the cranberry bog

and heard, in that lonely place,

two voices coming down the hill,

and I was thrilled

to be granted this secret,

that the coyotes, walking together

can talk together,

for I thought, what else could it be?

And even though what emerged

were two young women, two-legged for sure

and not at all aware of me,

their nimble, young women tongues

telling and answering,

and though I knew

I had believed something probably not true,

yet it was wonderful

to have believed it.

And it has stayed with me

1\.

Something came up

out of the dark.

It wasn't anything I had ever seen before.

It wasn't an animal

or a flower,

unless it was both.

Something came up out of the water,

a head the size of a cat

but muddy and without ears.

I don't know what God is.

I don't know what death is.

But I believe they have between them

some fervent and necessary arrangement.

2\.

Sometimes

melancholy leaves me breathless.

3\.

Later I was in a field full of sunflowers.

I was feeling the heat of midsummer.

I was thinking of the sweet, electric

drowse of creation,

when it began to break.

[]{#081_SOMETIMES.xhtml_pageMap_105 .pagebreak title="105"}In the west,
clouds gathered.

Thunderheads.

In an hour the sky was filled with them.

In an hour the sky was filled

with the sweetness of rain and the blast of lightning.

Followed by the deep bells of thunder.

Water from the heavens! Electricity from the source!

Both of them mad to create something!

The lightning brighter than any flower.

The thunder without a drowsy bone in its body.

4\.

Instructions for living a life:

*Pay attention.*

*Be astonished.*

*Tell about it.*

5\.

Two or three times in my life I discovered love.

Each time it seemed to solve everything.

Each time it solved a great many things

but not everything.

Yet left me as grateful as if it had indeed, and

thoroughly, solved everything.

God, rest in my heart

and fortify me,

take away my hunger for answers,

like the hands of my beloved.

Let the cathead appear again---

the smallest of your mysteries,

some wild cousin of my own blood probably---

some cousin of my own wild blood probably,

in the black dinner-bowl of the pond.

7\.

Death waits for me, I know it, around

one corner or another.

This doesn't amuse me.

Neither does it frighten me.

After the rain, I went back into the field of sunflowers.

It was cool, and I was anything but drowsy.

I walked slowly, and listened

to the crazy roots, in the drenched earth, laughing and growing.

filled with light, now the darkness grows

and it is filled with crooked things, bitter

and weak, each one bearing my name.

3\.

I lounge on the grass, that's all. So

simple. Then I lie back until I am

inside the cloud that is just above me

but very high, and shaped like a fish.

Or, perhaps not. Then I enter the place

of not-thinking, not-remembering, not-

wanting. When the blue jay cries out his

[]{#094_SIX_RECOGNITIONS_OF_.xhtml_pageMap_126 .pagebreak
title="126"}riddle, in his carping voice, I return.

But I go back, the threshold is always

near. Over and back, over and back. Then

I rise. Maybe I rub my face as though I

have been asleep. But I have not been

asleep. I have been, as I say, inside

the cloud, or, perhaps, the lily floating

on the water. Then I go back to town,

to my own house, my own life, which has

now become brighter and simpler, some-

where I have never been before.

4\.

Of course I have always known you

are present in the clouds, and the

black oak I especially adore, and the

wings of birds. But you are present

too in the body, listening to the body,

teaching it to live, instead of all

that touching, with disembodied joy.

We do not do this easily. We have

lived so long in the heaven of touch,

and we maintain our mutability, our

physicality, even as we begin to

apprehend the other world. Slowly we

make our appreciative response.

Slowly appreciation swells to

astonishment. And we enter the dialogue

[]{#094_SIX_RECOGNITIONS_OF_.xhtml_pageMap_127 .pagebreak title="127"}of
our lives that is beyond all under-

standing or conclusion. It is mystery.

It is love of God. It is obedience.

5\.

Oh, feed me this day, Holy Spirit, with

the fragrance of the fields and the

freshness of the oceans which you have

made, and help me to hear and to hold

in all dearness those exacting and wonderful

words of our Lord Christ Jesus, saying:

*Follow me*.

6\.

Every summer the lilies rise

and open their white hands until they almost

cover the black waters of the pond. And I give

thanks but it does not seem like adequate thanks,

it doesn't seem

festive enough or constant enough, nor does the

name of the Lord or the words of thanksgiving come

into it often enough. Everywhere I go I am

treated like royalty, which I am not. I thirst and

am given water. My eyes thirst and I am given

the white lilies on the black water. My heart

sings but the apparatus of singing doesn't convey

half what it feels and means. In spring there's hope,

in fall the exquisite, necessary diminishing, in

[]{#094_SIX_RECOGNITIONS_OF_.xhtml_pageMap_128 .pagebreak
title="128"}winter I am as sleepy as any beast in its

leafy cave, but in summer there is

everywhere the luminous sprawl of gifts,

the hospitality of the Lord and my

inadequate answers as I row my beautiful, temporary body

through this water-lily world.

The grass never sleeps.

Or the roses.

Nor does the lily have a secret eye that shuts until morning.

Jesus said, wait with me. But the disciples slept.

The cricket has such splendid fringe on its feet,

and it sings, have you noticed, with its whole body,

and heaven knows if it ever sleeps.

Jesus said, wait with me. And maybe the stars did, maybe

the wind wound itself into a silver tree, and didn't move,

maybe

the lake far away, where once he walked as on a

blue pavement,

lay still and waited, wild awake.

Oh the dear bodies, slumped and eye-shut, that could not

keep that vigil, how they must have wept,

so utterly human, knowing this too

must be a part of the story.

On the outskirts of Jerusalem

the donkey waited.

Not especially brave, or filled with understanding,

he stood and waited.

*How horses, turned out into the meadow,*

*leap with delight!*

*How doves, released from their cages,*

*clatter away, splashed with sunlight!*

But the donkey, tied to a tree as usual, waited.

Then he let himself be led away.

Then he let the stranger mount.

Never had he seen such crowds!

And I wonder if he at all imagined what was to happen.

Still, he was what he had always been: small, dark, obedient.

I hope, finally, he felt brave.

I hope, finally, he loved the man who rode so lightly upon him,

as he lifted one dusty hoof and stepped, as he had to, forward.

[]{#099_ON_THY_WONDROUS_WORK.xhtml_pageMap_134 .pagebreak title="134"}ON
THY WONDROUS WORKS I WILL MEDITATE

[(Psalm 145)]{.Runin-Date}

1\.

All day up and down the shore the

fine points of the waves keep on

tapping whatever is there: scatter of broken

clams, empty jingles, old

oyster shells thick and castellated that held

once the pale jewel of their bodies, such sweet

tongue and juice. And who do you

think you are sauntering along

five feet up in the air, the ocean a blue fire

around your ankles, the sun

on your face on your shoulders its golden mouth whispering

(so it seems) *you! you! you!*

2\.

Now the afternoon wind

all frill and no apparent purpose

takes her cloud-shaped

hand and touches every one of the

waves so that rapidly

they stir the wings of the eiders they blur

the boats on their moorings; not even the rocks

black and blunt interrupt the waves on their

[]{#099_ON_THY_WONDROUS_WORK.xhtml_pageMap_135 .pagebreak
title="135"}way to the shore and one last swimmer (is it you?) rides

their salty infoldings and outfoldings until,

peaked, their blue sides heaving, they pause; and God

whistles them back; and you glide safely to shore.

3\.

One morning

a hundred pink and cylindrical

squid lay beached their lacy faces,

their gnarls of dimples and ropy tentacles

limp and powerless; as I watched

the big gulls went down upon

this sweetest trash rolling

like the arms of babies through the

swash---in a feathered dash,

a calligraphy of delight the beaks fell

grabbing and snapping; then was left only the

empty beach, the birds floating back over the waves.

4\.

How many mysteries have you seen in your

lifetime? How many nets pulled

full over the boat's side, each silver body

ready or not falling into

submission? How many roses in early summer

uncurling above the pale sands then

[]{#099_ON_THY_WONDROUS_WORK.xhtml_pageMap_136 .pagebreak
title="136"}falling back in unfathomable

willingness? And what can you say? Glory

to the rose and the leaf, to the seed, to the

silver fish. Glory to time and the wild fields,

and to joy. And to grief's shock and torpor, its near swoon.

5\.

So it is not hard to understand

where God's body is, it is

everywhere and everything; shore and the vast

fields of water, the accidental and the intended

over here, over there. And I bow down

participate and attentive

it is so dense and apparent. And all the same I am still

unsatisfied. Standing

here, now, I am thinking

not of His thick wrists and His blue

shoulders but, still, of Him. Where, do you suppose, is His

pale and wonderful mind?

6\.

I would be good---oh, I would be upright and good.

To what purpose? To be shining not

sinful, not wringing out of the hours

petulance, heaviness, ashes. *To what purpose?*

*[]{#099_ON_THY_WONDROUS_WORK.xhtml_pageMap_137 .pagebreak
title="137"}Hope of heaven?* Not that. But to enter

the other kingdom: grace, and imagination,

and the multiple sympathies: to be as a leaf, a rose,

a dolphin, a wave rising

slowly then briskly out of the darkness to touch

the limpid air, to be God's mind's

servant, loving with the body's sweet mouth---its kisses, its

words---

everything.

7\.

I know a man of such

mildness and kindness it is trying to

change my life. He does not

preach, teach, but simply is. It is

astonishing, for he is Christ's ambassador

truly, by rule and act. But, more,

he is kind with the sort of kindness that shines

out, but is resolute, not fooled. He has

eaten the dark hours and could also, I think,

soldier for God, riding out

under the storm clouds, against the world's pride and unkindness

with both unassailable sweetness, and consoling word.

[]{#099_ON_THY_WONDROUS_WORK.xhtml_pageMap_138 .pagebreak title="138"}8.

Every morning I want to kneel down on the golden

cloth of the sand and say

some kind of musical thanks for

the world that is happening again---another day---

from the shawl of wind coming out of the

west to the firm green

flesh of the melon lately sliced open and

eaten, its chill and ample body

flavored with mercy. I want

to be worthy of---what? Glory? Yes, unimaginable glory.

O Lord of melons, of mercy, though I am

not ready, nor worthy, I am climbing toward you.

What is this dark hum among the roses?

The bees have gone simple, sipping,

that's all. What did you expect? Sophistication?

They're small creatures and they are

filling their bodies with sweetness, how could they not

moan in happiness? The little

worker bee lives, I have read, about three weeks.

Is that long? Long enough, I suppose, to understand

that life is a blessing. I have found them---haven't you?---

stopped in the very cups of the flowers, their wings

a little tattered---so much flying about, to the hive,

then out into the world, then back, and perhaps dancing,

should the task be to be a scout---sweet, dancing bee.

I think there isn't anything in this world I don't

admire. If there is, I don't know what it is. I

haven't met it yet. Nor expect to. The bee is small,

and since I wear glasses, so I can see the traffic and

read books, I have to

take them off and bend close to study and

understand what is happening. It's not hard, it's in fact

as instructive as anything I have ever studied. Plus, too,

it's love almost too fierce to endure, the bee

nuzzling like that into the blouse

of the rose. And the fragrance, and the honey, and of course

the sun, the purely pure sun, shining, all the while, over

all of us.

Here is a story

to break your heart.

Are you willing?

This winter

the loons came to our harbor

and died, one by one,

of nothing we could see.

A friend told me

of one on the shore

that lifted its head and opened

the elegant beak and cried out

in the long, sweet savoring of its life

which, if you have heard it,

you know is a sacred thing,

and for which, if you have not heard it,

you had better hurry to where

they still sing.

And, believe me, tell no one

just where that is.

The next morning

this loon, speckled

and iridescent and with a plan

to fly home

to some hidden lake,

was dead on the shore.

I tell you this

to break your heart,

[]{#104_LEAD.xhtml_pageMap_147 .pagebreak title="147"}by which I mean
only

that it break open and never close again

to the rest of the world.

[]{#105_OXYGEN.xhtml_pageMap_148 .pagebreak title="148"}OXYGEN

Everything needs it: bone, muscles, and even,

while it calls the earth its home, the soul.

So the merciful, noisy machine

stands in our house working away in its

lung-like voice. I hear it as I kneel

before the fire, stirring with a

stick of iron, letting the logs

lie more loosely. You, in the upstairs room,

are in your usual position, leaning on your

right shoulder which aches

all day. You are breathing

patiently; it is a

beautiful sound. It is

your life, which is so close

to my own that I would not know

where to drop the knife of

separation. And what does this have to do

with love, except

everything? Now the fire rises

and offers a dozen, singing, deep-red

roses of flame. Then it settles

to quietude, or maybe gratitude, as it feeds

as we all do, as we must, upon the invisible gift:

our purest, sweet necessity: the air.

Who can tell how lovely in June is the

a tree should be so sweet and live

in this world? Each white blossom

on a dangle of white flowers holds one green seed---

a new life. Also each blossom on a dangle of flowers

holds a flask

of fragrance called *Heaven*, which is never sealed.

The bees circle the tree and dive into it. They are crazy

with gratitude. They are working like farmers. They are as

happy as saints. After a while the flowers begin to

wilt and drop down into the grass. Welcome

shines in the grass.

Every year I gather

handfuls of blossoms and eat of their mealiness; the honey

melts in my mouth, the seeds make me strong,

both when they are crisp and ripe, and even at the end

when their petals have turned dull yellow.

So it is

if the heart has devoted itself to love, there is

not a single inch of emptiness. Gladness gleams

all the way to the grave.

inside their bodies? And don't you hear

the goldenrod whispering goodbye,

the everlasting being crowned with the first

tuffets of snow? The pond

vanishes, and the white field over which

the fox runs so quickly brings out

You want to cry aloud for your

So if you're going to do it and can't

stop yourself, if your pretty mouth can't

hold it in, at least go by yourself across

the forty fields and the forty dark inclines

of rocks and water to the place where

the falls are flinging out their white sheets

like crazy, and there is a cave behind all that

jubilation and water-fun and you can

stand there, under it, and roar all you

want and nothing will be disturbed; you can

drip with despair all afternoon and still,

on a green branch, its wings just lightly touched

puffing out its spotted breast, will sing

But often, alas, improbable.

Wild sings the bird of the heart in the forests

has come home. He is shy and likes the

evening best, also the hour just before

morning; in that blue and gritty light he

climbs to his branch, or smoothly

sails there. It is okay to know only

one song if it is this one. Hear it

rise and fall; the very elements of your soul

shiver nicely. What would spring be

without it? Mostly frogs. But don't worry, he

arrives, year after year, humble and obedient

and gorgeous. You listen and you know

you could live a better life than you do, be

softer, kinder. And maybe this year you will

be able to do it. Hear how his voice

rises and falls. There is no way to be

sufficiently grateful for the gifts we are

given, no way to speak the Lord's name

often enough, though we do try, and

Don't think just now of the trudging forward of thought,

but of the wing-drive of unquestioning affirmation.

It's summer, you never saw such a blue sky,

and here they are, those white birds with quick wings,

sweeping over the waves,

chattering and plunging,

their thin beaks snapping, their hard eyes

happy as little nails.

The years to come---this is a promise---

will grant you ample time

to try the difficult steps in the empire of thought

where you seek for the shining proofs you think you must have.

But nothing you ever understand will be sweeter, or more binding,

than this deepest affinity between your eyes and the world.

The flock thickens

over the roiling, salt brightness. Listen,

maybe such devotion, in which one holds the world

in the clasp of attention, isn't the perfect prayer,

but it must be close, for the sorrow, whose name is doubt,

is thus subdued, and not through the weaponry of reason,

[]{#113_TERNS.xhtml_pageMap_159 .pagebreak title="159"}but of pure
submission. Tell me, what else

could beauty be for? And now the tide

is at its very crown,

the white birds sprinkle down,

gathering up the loose silver, rising

as if weightless. It isn't instruction, or a parable.

It isn't for any vanity or ambition

except for the one allowed, to stay alive.

It's only a nimble frolic

over the waves. And you find, for hours,

you cannot even remember the questions

I think sometimes of the possible glamour of death---

that it might be wonderful to be

lost and happy inside the green grass---

or to be the green grass!---

or, maybe the pink rose, or the blue iris,

or the affable daisy, or the twirled vine

looping its way skyward---that it might be perfectly peaceful

to be the shining lake, or the hurrying, athletic river,

or the dark shoulders of the trees

where the thrush each evening weeps himself into an ecstasy.

I lie down in the fields of goldenrod, and everlasting.

Who could find me?

My thoughts simplify. I have not done a thousand things

or a hundred things but, perhaps, a few.

As for wondering about answers that are not available except

in books, though all my childhood I was sent there

to find them, I have learned

to leave all that behind

as in summer I take off my shoes and my socks,

my jacket, my hat, and go on

happier, through the fields. The little sparrow

I grow wiser, listening to him,

I walk beside the ocean, then turn and continue walking just beside the
first berm, a few yards from the water which is at half tide. Eventually
I find what I'm looking for, a plant green and with the flavor of raw
salt, and leaves shaped like arrow-heads. But before that, down the long
shore, I have seen many things: shells, waves, once a pair of whimbrels,
gulls and terns over the water, rabbits long-legging it through the

It's almost dawn

and the usual half-miracles begin

within my own personal body as the light

enters the gates of the east and climbs

into the fields of the sky, and the birds lift

their very unimportant heads from the branches

and begin to sing; and the insects too,

and the rustling leaves, and even

that most common of earthly things, the grass,

can't let it begin---another morning---without

making some comment of gladness, respiring softly

with the honey of their green bodies; and the white

blossoms of the swamp honeysuckle, hovering just where

the path and the pond almost meet,

shake from the folds of their bodies

such happiness it enters the air as fragrance,

the day's first pale and elegant affirmation.

And the old gods liked so well, they say,

the sweet odor of prayer.

to its slow prayers as you fell asleep? What if

the stars began to shout their names, or to run

this way and that way above the clouds? What if

you painted a picture of a tree, and the leaves

began to rustle, and a bird cheerfully sang

from its painted branches? What if you suddenly saw

that the silver of water was brighter than the silver

of money? What if you finally saw

that the sunflowers, turning toward the sun all day

and every day---who knows how, but they do it---were

more precious, more meaningful than gold?

the small suns of their center-piece---their, if you don't

I could be wrong, perhaps their hearts are pale and

narrow and hidden in the roots. What do I know.

But this: it is heaven itself to take what is given,

a flock of snow geese, winging it

faster than the ones we usually see,

being lean, as if for the narrow path. The beans themselves sit quietly
inside their green pods. Instinctively one picks with care, never
tearing down the fine vine, never not noticing their crisp bodies, or
feeling their willingness for the pot, for the fire.

I have thought sometimes that something---I can't name it---watches as I
walk the rows, accepting the gift of their lives to assist mine.

I know what you think: this is foolishness. They're only vegetables.
Even the blossoms with which they begin are small and pale, hardly
significant. Our hands, or minds, our feet hold more intelligence. With

Once I saw

as well as, sometimes, on a rock-peak, starting up

there being no words to transcribe, I had to

bend forward, as it were,

into his frame of mind, catching

everything I could in the tone,

cadence, sweetness, and briskness

of his affirmative report.

Though not by words, it was

a more than satisfactory way to the

bridge of understanding. This happened

in Colorado

more than half a century ago---

more, certainly, than half my lifetime ago---

and, just as certainly, he has been sleeping for decades

in the leaves beside the stream,

his crumble of white bones, his curl of flesh

comfortable even so.

and whenever I open the ponderous book of riddles

and thus the world is full of leaves and feathers,

He picks his pond, and the soft thicket of his world.

He bids his lady come, and she does,

flirting with her tail.

He begins early, and makes up his song as he goes.

He does not enter a house at night, or when it rains.

He is not afraid of the wind, though he is cautious.

He watches the snake, that stripe of black fire,

until it flows away.

He watches the hawk with her sharpest shins, aloft

in the high tree.

He keeps his prayer under his tongue.

In his whole life he has never missed the rising of the sun.

He dislikes snow.

But a few raisins give him the greatest delight.

He sits in the forelock of the lilac, or he struts

in its shadow.

He is neither the rare plover or the brilliant bunting,

but as common as grass.

His black cap gives him a jaunty look, for which

we humans have learned to tilt our caps, in envy.

When he is not singing, he is listening.

Neither have I ever seen him with his eyes closed.

Though he may be looking at nothing more than a cloud

it brings to his mind a several dozen new remarks.

From one branch to another, or across the path,

he dazzles with flight.

Yet never, once has he answered my nod.

strikes me from sleep, and I rise

from the comfortable bed and go

to another room, where my books are lined up

in their neat and colorful rows. How

magical they are! I choose one

and open it. Soon

I have wandered in over the waves of the words

to the temple of thought.

And then I hear

outside, over the actual waves, the small,

perfect voice of the loon. He is also awake,

and with his heavy head uplifted he calls out

to the fading moon, to the pink flush

swelling in the east that, soon,

will become the long, reasonable day.

Inside the house

it is still dark, except for the pool of lamplight

in which I am sitting.

I do not close the book.

Neither, for a long while, do I read on.

title="211"}WINTER AT HERRING COVE

Years ago,

in the bottle-green light

of the cold January sea,

two seals

suddenly appeared together

in a single uplifting wave---

each in exactly the same relaxed position---

each, like a large, black comma,

upright and staring;

it was like a painting

done twice

and, twice, tenderly.

The wave hung, then it broke apart;

its lip was lightning;

its floor was the blow of sand

over which the seals rose and twirled and were gone.

Of all the reasons for gladness,

what could be foremost of this one,

that the mind can seize both the instant and the memory!

Now the seals are no more than the salt of the sea.

If they live, they're more distant than Greenland.

[]{#148_WINTER_AT_HERRING_CO.xhtml_pageMap_212 .pagebreak
title="212"}But here's the kingdom we call remembrance

with its thousand iron doors

through which I pass so easily,

switching on the old lights as I go---

while the dead wind rises and the old rapture rewinds,

the stiff waters once more begin to kick and flow.

[]{#149_MINK.xhtml_pageMap_213 .pagebreak title="213"}MINK

A mink,

jointless as heat, was

tip-toeing along

the edge of the creek,

which was still in its coat of snow,

yet singing---I could hear it!---

the old song

of brightness.

It was one of those places,

turning and twisty,

that Ruskin might have painted, though

he didn't. And there were trees

leaning this way and that,

seed-beaded

buckthorn mostly, but at the moment

no bird, the only voice

that of the covered water---like a long,

unknotted thread, it kept

slipping through. The mink

had a hunger in him

bigger than his shadow, which was gathered

like a sheet of darkness under his

neat feet which were busy

making dents in the snow. He sniffed

slowly and thoroughly in all

four directions, as though

[]{#149_MINK.xhtml_pageMap_214 .pagebreak title="214"}it was a prayer to
the whole world, as far

as he could capture its beautiful

smells---the iron of the air, the blood

of necessity. Maybe, for him, even

the pink sun fading away to the edge

of the world had a smell,

of roses, or of terror, who knows

what his keen nose was

finding out. For me, it was the gift of the winter

to see him. Once, like a hot, dark-brown pillar,

he stood up---and then he ran forward, and was gone.

I stood awhile and then walked on

over the white snow: the terrible, gleaming

loneliness. It took me, I suppose,

something like six more weeks to reach

finally a patch of green, I paused so often

to be glad, and grateful, and even then carefully across

the vast, deep woods I kept looking back.

Now that I'm free to be myself, who am I?

Can't fly, can't run, and see how slowly I walk.

Well, I think, I can read books.

"What's that you're doing?"

the green-headed fly shouts as it buzzes past.

I close the book.

Well, I can write down words, like these, softly.

"What's that you're doing?" whispers the wind, pausing

in a heap just outside the window.

Give me a little time, I say back to its staring, silver face.

It doesn't happen all of a sudden, you know.

"Doesn't it?" says the wind, and breaks open, releasing

distillation of blue iris.

And my heart panics not to be, as I long to be,

the empty, waiting, pure, speechless receptacle.

the thrush.

And you are just

taking in

the sweetness of it---those chords,

out of the same twilight

the wildest red outcry. It pitches itself

forward, it flails and scabs

all the surrounding space with such authority

you can't tell

whether it is crying out on the

scarp of victory, with its hooked foot

dabbed into some creature that now

with snapped spine

lies on the earth---or whether

it is such a struck body itself, saying

goodbye.

All afternoon I have been walking over the dunes, hurrying from one
thick raft of the wrinkled, salt roses to another, leaning down close to
their dark or pale petals, red as blood or white as snow. And now I am
beginning to breathe slowly and evenly---the way a hunted animal
breathes, finally, when it has galloped, and galloped---when it is wrung
dry, but, at last, is far away, so the panic begins to drain from the
chest, from the wonderful legs, and the exhausted mind.

Oh sweetness pure and simple, may I join you?

I lie down next to them, on the sand. But to tell about what happens
next, truly I need help.

*Will somebody or something please start to sing?*

The white stones were mountains, then they went traveling.

The pink stones also were part of a mountain before

the glacier's tongue gathered them up.

Now they lie resting under the waves.

The green stones are lovelier than the blue stones, I thought

for a little while,

then I changed my mind.

Stones born of the sediments tell what ooze floated down

the outwash once.

Stones born of the fire have red stars inside their bodies,

and seams of white quartz.

Also I admire the heft, and the circularities

as they lie without wrists or ankles just under the water.

Also I imagine how they lie quietly all night

under the moon and whatever passes overhead---say, the floating

lily of the night-heron.

It is apparent also how they lie relaxed under the sun's

golden ladders.

Each one is a slow-wheeler.

Each one is a tiny church, locked up tight.

Each one is perfect---but none of them is ready quite yet

to come to the garden, to raise corn

or the bulb of the iris.

If I lived inland I would want to take one or two home with me

just to look at in that long life of dust and grass,

[]{#153_STONES.xhtml_pageMap_220 .pagebreak title="220"}but I hope I
wouldn't.

I hope I wouldn't take even one like a seed from the sunflower's face,

like an ant's white egg from the warm nursery under the hill.

I hope I would leave them, in the perfect balance of things,

in the clear body of the sea.

1\.

Fat,

black, slick,

galloping in the pitch

of the waves, in the pearly

fields of the sea,

they leap toward us,

they rise, sparkling, and vanish, and rise

sparkling,

they breathe little clouds of mist, they lift

perpetual smiles,

they slap their tails on the waves, grandmothers and grandfathers

enjoying the old jokes,

they circle around us,

they swim with us---

2\.

a hundred white-sided dolphins

on a summer day,

each one, as God himself

could not appear more acceptable

a hundred times,

in a body blue and black threading through

the sea foam,

and lifting himself up from the opened

[]{#154_ONE_HUNDRED_WHITE-SI.xhtml_pageMap_222 .pagebreak

to look

with the moon of his eye

into my heart,

and find there

pure, sudden, steep, sharp, painful

gratitude

that falls---

I don't know---either

unbearable tons

or the pale, bearable hand

of salvation

on my neck,

lifting me

from the boat's plain plank seat

into the world's

4\.

unspeakable kindness.

It is my sixty-third summer on earth

and, for a moment, I have almost vanished

into the body of the dolphin,

[]{#154_ONE_HUNDRED_WHITE-SI.xhtml_pageMap_223 .pagebreak
title="223"}into the moon-eye of God,

into the white fan that lies at the bottom of the sea

with everything

that ever was, or ever will be,

supple, wild, rising on flank or fishtail---

singing or whistling or breathing damply through blowhole

at top of head. Then, in our little boat, the dolphins suddenly gone,

we sailed on through the brisk, cheerful

1\.

Welcome to the silly, comforting poem.

It is not the sunrise,

which is a red rinse,

which is flaring all over the eastern sky;

it is not the rain falling out of the purse of God;

it is not the blue helmet of the sky afterward,

or the trees, or the beetle burrowing into the earth;

it is not the mockingbird who, in his own cadence,

will go on sizzling and clapping

from the branches of the catalpa that are thick with blossoms,

that are billowing and shining,

that are shaking in the wind.

2\.

You still recall, sometimes, the old barn on your great-grandfather's
farm, a place you visited once, and went into, all alone, while the
grown-ups sat and talked in the house.

It was empty, or almost. Wisps of hay covered the floor, and some wasps
sang at the windows, and maybe there was a strange fluttering bird high
above, disturbed, hoo-ing a little and staring down from a messy ledge
with wild, binocular eyes.

[]{#156_FLARE.xhtml_pageMap_228 .pagebreak title="228"}Mostly, though,
it smelled of milk, and the patience of animals; the give-offs of the
body were still in the air, a vague ammonia, not unpleasant.

Mostly, though, it was restful and secret, the roof high up and arched,
the boards unpainted and plain.

You could have stayed there forever, a small child in a corner, on the
last raft of hay, dazzled by so much space that seemed empty, but
wasn't.

Then---you still remember---you felt the rap of hunger---it was
noon---and you turned from that twilight dream and hurried back to the
house, where the table was set, where an uncle patted you on the
shoulder for welcome, and there was your place at the table.

3\.

Nothing lasts.

There is a graveyard where everything I am talking about is,

now.

I stood there once, on the green grass, scattering flowers.

4\.

Nothing is so delicate or so finely hinged as the wings

of the green moth

against the lantern

against its heat

[]{#156_FLARE.xhtml_pageMap_229 .pagebreak title="229"}against the beak
of the crow

in the early morning.

Yet the moth has trim, and feistiness, and not a drop

of self-pity.

Not in this world.

5\.

My mother

was the blue wisteria,

my mother

was the mossy stream out behind the house,

my mother, *alas, alas,*

did not always love her life,

heavier than iron it was

as she carried it in her arms, from room to room,

*oh, unforgettable!*

I bury her

in a box

in the earth

and turn away.

My father

was a demon of frustrated dreams,

was a breaker of trust,

was a poor, thin boy with bad luck.

He followed God, there being no one else

he could talk to;

[]{#156_FLARE.xhtml_pageMap_230 .pagebreak title="230"}he swaggered
before God, there being no one else

who would listen.

*Listen,*

this was his life.

I bury it in the earth.

I sweep the closets.

I leave the house.

6\.

I mention them now,

I will not mention them again.

It is not lack of love

nor lack of sorrow.

But the iron thing they carried, I will not carry.

I give them---one, two, three, four---the kiss of courtesy,

of sweet thanks,

of anger, of good luck in the deep earth.

May they sleep well. May they soften.

But I will not give them the kiss of complicity.

I will not give them the responsibility for my life.

7\.

Did you know that the ant has a tongue

with which to gather in all that it can

of sweetness?

[]{#156_FLARE.xhtml_pageMap_231 .pagebreak title="231"}Did you know
that?

8\.

The poem is not the world.

It isn't even the first page of the world.

But the poem wants to flower, like a flower.

It knows that much.

It wants to open itself,

like the door of a little temple,

so that you might step inside and be cooled and refreshed,

and less yourself than part of everything.

9\.

The voice of the child crying out of the mouth of the

grown woman

is a misery and a disappointment.

The voice of the child howling out of the tall, bearded,

muscular man

is a misery, and a terror.

10\.

Therefore, tell me:

what will engage you?

What will open the dark fields of your mind,

like a lover

at first touching?

[]{#156_FLARE.xhtml_pageMap_232 .pagebreak title="232"}11.

Anyway,

there was no barn.

No child in the barn.

No uncle no table no kitchen.

Only a long lovely field full of bobolinks.

12\.

When loneliness comes stalking, go into the fields, consider

the orderliness of the world. Notice

something you have never noticed before,

like the tambourine sound of the snow-cricket

whose pale green body is no longer than your thumb.

Stare hard at the hummingbird, in the summer rain,

shaking the water-sparks from its wings.

Let grief be your sister, she will whether or no.

Rise up from the stump of sorrow, and be green also,

like the diligent leaves.

A lifetime isn't long enough for the beauty of this world

and the responsibilities of your life.

Scatter your flowers over the graves, and walk away.

Be good-natured and untidy in your exuberance.

[]{#156_FLARE.xhtml_pageMap_233 .pagebreak title="233"}In the glare of
your mind, be modest.

And beholden to what is tactile, and thrilling.

Live with the beetle, and the wind.

*This is the dark bread of the poem.*

*This is the dark and nourishing bread of the poem.*

1\.

I rose this morning early as usual, and went to my desk.

But it's spring,

and the thrush is in the woods,

somewhere in the twirled branches, and he is singing.

And so, now, I am standing by the open door.

And now I am stepping down onto the grass.

I am touching a few leaves.

I am noticing the way the yellow butterflies

move together, in a twinkling cloud, over the field.

And I am thinking: maybe just looking and listening

is the real work.

Maybe the world, without us,

is the real poem.

2\.

For how many years have you gone through the house

shutting the windows,

while the rain was still five miles away

and veering, o plum-colored clouds, to the north,

away from you

and you did not even know enough

to be sorry,

[]{#157_FROM_THE_BOOK_OF_TIM.xhtml_pageMap_235 .pagebreak
title="235"}you were glad

those silver sheets, with the occasional golden staple,

were sweeping on, elsewhere,

violent and electric and uncontrollable---

and will you find yourself finally wanting to forget

all enclosures, including

the enclosure of yourself, o lonely leaf, and will you

dash finally, frantically,

to the windows and haul them open and lean out

to the dark, silvered sky, to everything

that is beyond capture, shouting

*I'm here, I'm here! Now, now, now, now, now.*

3\.

I dreamed

I was traveling

from one country

to another

jogging

on the back

of a white horse

whose hooves

[]{#157_FROM_THE_BOOK_OF_TIM.xhtml_pageMap_236 .pagebreak
title="236"}were the music

of dust and gravel

whose halter

was made of the leafy braids

of flowers,

whose name

was Earth.

And it never

grew tired

though the sun

went down

like a thousand roses

and the stars

put their white faces

in front of the black branches

above us

and then

there was nothing around us

but water

and the white horse

turned suddenly

like a bolt of white cloth

opening

under the cloth-cutter's deft hands

[]{#157_FROM_THE_BOOK_OF_TIM.xhtml_pageMap_237 .pagebreak

a swan.

Its red tongue

flickered out

as it perceived

my great surprise

my huge and unruly pleasure

my almost unmanageable relief.Â .Â .Â .

"'Whoever shall be guided so far towards the mysteries of love, by
contemplating beautiful things rightly in due order, is approaching the
last grade. Suddenly he will behold a beauty marvellous in its nature,
that very Beauty, Socrates, for the sake of which all the earlier
hardships had been borne: in the first place, everlasting, and never
being born nor perishing, neither increasing nor diminishing; secondly,
not beautiful here and ugly there, not beautiful now and ugly then, not
beautiful in one direction and ugly in another direction, not beautiful
in one place and ugly in another place. Again, this beauty will not show
itself like a face or hands or any bodily thing at all, nor as a
discourse or a science, nor indeed as residing in anything, as in a
living creature or in earth or heaven or anything else, but being by
itself with itself always in simplicity; while all the beautiful things
elsewhere partake of this beauty in such manner, that when *they* are
born and perish *it* becomes neither less nor more and nothing at all
happens to it.Â .Â .Â .'"

What secrets fly out of the earth

when I push the shovel-edge,

when I heave the dirt open?

And if there are no secrets

what is that smell that sweetness rising?

What is my name,

o what is my name

that I may offer it back

to the beautiful world?

Have I walked

long enough

where the sea breaks raspingly

all day and all night upon the pale sand?

Have I admired sufficiently the little hurricane

of the hummingbird?

the heavy

thumb

of the blackberry?

the falling star?

Count the roses, red and fluttering.

Count the roses, wrinkled and salt.

Each with its yellow lint at the center.

Each with its honey pooled and ready.

Do you have a question that can't be answered?

Do the stars frighten you by their heaviness

and their endless number?

Does it bother you, that mercy is so difficult to

understand?

For some souls it's easy; they lie down on the sand

and are soon asleep.

For others, the mind shivers in its glacial palace,

and won't come.

Yes, the mind takes a long time, is otherwise occupied

than by happiness, and deep breathing.

Now, in the distance, some bird is singing.

And now I have gathered six or seven deep red,

half-opened cups of petals between my hands,

and now I have put my face against them

and now I am moving my face back and forth, slowly,

against them.

The body is not much more than two feet and a tongue.

Come to me, says the blue sky, and say the word.

And finally even the mind comes running, like a wild thing,

and lies down in the sand.

Eternity is not later, or in any unfindable place.

*Roses, roses, roses, roses.*

Okay, not one can write a symphony, or a dictionary,

or even a letter to an old friend, full of remembrance

and comfort.

Not one can manage a single sound, though the blue jays

carp and whistle all day in the branches, without

the push of the wind.

But to tell the truth after a while I'm pale with longing

for their thick bodies ruckled with lichen

and you can't keep me from the woods, from the tonnage

of their shoulders, and their shining green hair.

Today is a day like any other: twenty-four hours, a

little sunshine, a little rain.

Listen, says ambition, nervously shifting her weight from

one boot to another---why don't you get going?

For there I am, in the mossy shadows, under the trees.

And to tell the truth I don't want to let go of the wrists

of idleness, I don't want to sell my life for money,

I don't even want to come in out of the rain.

I NOT AMONG THE EARLY RISERS

Am I not among the early risers

and the long-distance walkers?

Have I not stood, amazed, as I consider

the perfection of the morning star

above the peaks of the houses, and the crowns of the trees

blue in the first light?

Do I not see how the trees tremble, as though

sheets of water flowed over them

though it is only wind, that common thing,

free to everyone, and everything?

Have I not thought, for years, what it would be

worthy to do, and then gone off, barefoot and with a silver pail,

to gather blueberries,

thus coming, as I think, upon a right answer?

What will ambition do for me that the fox, appearing suddenly

at the top of the field,

her eyes sharp and confident as she stared into mine,

has not already done?

What countries, what visitations,

what pomp

would satisfy me as thoroughly as Blackwater Woods

on a sun-filled morning, or, equally, in the rain?

Here is an amazement---once I was twenty years old and in

every motion of my body there was a delicious ease,

[]{#163_AM_I_NOT_AMONG_THE_E.xhtml_pageMap_255 .pagebreak
title="255"}and in every motion of the green earth there was

a hint of paradise,

and now I am sixty years old, and it is the same.

Above the modest house and the palace---the same darkness.

Above the evil man and the just, the same stars.

Above the child who will recover and the child who will

not recover, the same energies roll forward,

from one tragedy to the next and from one foolishness to the next.

I bow down.

Have I not loved as though the beloved could vanish at any moment,

or become preoccupied, or whisper a name other than mine

in the stretched curvatures of lust, or over the dinner table?

Have I ever taken good fortune for granted?

Have I not, every spring, befriended the swarm that pours forth?

Have I not summoned the honey-man to come, to hurry,

to bring with him the white and comfortable hive?

And, while I waited, have I not leaned close, to see everything?

Have I not been stung as I watched their milling and gleaming,

and stung hard?

Have I not been ready always at the iron door,

not knowing to what country it opens---to death or to more life?

[]{#163_AM_I_NOT_AMONG_THE_E.xhtml_pageMap_256 .pagebreak
title="256"}Have I ever said that the day was too hot or too cold

or the night too long and as black as oil anyway,

or the morning, washed blue and emptied entirely

of the second-rate, less than happiness

as I stepped down from the porch and set out along

the green paths of the world?

You don't ever know where

a sentence will take you, depending

on its roll and fold. I was walking

over the dunes when I saw

the red fox asleep under the green

branches of the pine. It flared up

in the sweet order of its being,

the tail that was over the muzzle

lifting in airy amazement

and the fire of the eyes followed

and the pricked ears and the thin

barrel body and the four

athletic legs in their black stockings and it

came to me how the polish of the world changes

everything, I was hot I was cold I was almost

dead of delight. Of course the mind keeps

cool in its hidden palace---yes, the mind takes

a long time, is otherwise occupied than by

happiness, and deep breathing. Still,

at last, it comes too, running

like a wild thing, to be taken

with its twin sister, breath. So I stood

on the pale, peach-colored sand, watching the fox

as it opened like a flower, and I began

softly, to pick among the vast assortment of words

that it should run again and again across the page

that you again and again should shiver with praise.

If there is life after the earth-life, will you come with me? Even then?
Since we're bound to be something, why not together. Imagine! Two little
stones, two fleas under the wing of a gull, flying along through the
fog! Or, ten blades of grass. Ten loops of honeysuckle, all flung
against each other, at the edge of Race Road! Beach plums! Snowflakes,
coasting into the winter woods, making a very small sound, like this

soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

as they marry the dusty bodies of the pitch-pines. Or, rain---that gray
light running over the sea, pocking it, lacquering it, coming, all

And what did you think love would be like? A summer day? The brambles in
their places, and the long stretches of mud? Flowers in every field, in
every garden, with their soft beaks and their pastel shoulders? On one
street after another, the litter ticks in the gutter. In one room after
another, the lovers meet, quarrel, sicken, break apart, cry out. One or
two leap from windows. Most simply lean, exhausted, their thin arms on
the sill. They have done all that they could. The golden eagle, that
lives not far from here, has perhaps a thousand tiny feathers flowing
from the back of its head, each one shaped like an infinitely small but

What lay on the road was no mere handful of snake. It was the copperhead
at last, golden under the street lamp. I hope to see everything in this
world before I die. I knelt on the road and stared. Its head was
wedge-shaped and fell back to the unexpected slimness of a neck. The
body itself was thick, tense, electric. Clearly this wasn't black snake
looking down from the limbs of a tree, or green snake, or the garter,
whizzing over the rocks. Where these had, oh, such shyness, this one had
none. When I moved a little, it turned and clamped its eyes on mine;
then it jerked toward me. I jumped back and watched as it flowed on
across the road and down into the dark. My heart was pounding. I stood a
while, listening to the small sounds of the woods and looking at the
stars. After excitement we are so restful. When the thumb of fear lifts,
we are so alive.

How necessary it is to have opinions! I think the spotted trout lilies
are satisfied, standing a few inches above the earth. I think serenity
is not something you just find in the world, like a plum tree, holding
up its white petals.

The violets, along the river, are opening their blue faces, like small
dark lanterns.

The green mosses, being so many, are as good as brawny.

How important it is to walk along, not in haste but slowly, looking at
everything and calling out

*Yes! No!* The

swan, for all his pomp, his robes of glass and petals, wants only to be
allowed to live on the nameless pond. The catbrier is without fault. The
water thrushes, down among the sloppy rocks, are going crazy with
happiness. Imagination is better than a sharp instrument. To pay

Three women

They come toward us, to see

what we are doing.

What we are doing

is reading the strange,

of the dead.

One of the women

speaks to us---

after we speak to her.

She walks with us and shows us,

with a downward-thrust finger,

which of the dead

were her people.

She tells us

about two brothers, and an argument,

and a gun---she points

to one of the slabs

on which there is a name,

some scripture, a handful of red

plastic flowers. We ask her

about the other brother.

"Chain gang," she says,

as you or I might say

"Des Moines," or "New Haven." And then,

"Look around all you want."

she is blind, and clearly

she can't rise, but they lift her, like a child,

and lead her away, across the graves, as though,

as old as anything could ever be, she was, finally,

perfectly finished, perfectly heartbroken, perfectly wild.

This morning

two mockingbirds

in the green field

were spinning and tossing

the white ribbons

of their songs

into the air.

I had nothing

better to do

than listen.

I mean this

seriously.

In Greece,

a long time ago,

an old couple

opened their door

to two strangers

who were,

it soon appeared,

not men at all,

but gods.

It is my favorite story---

how the old couple

had almost nothing to give

but their willingness

to be attentive---

and for this alone

the gods loved them.

and blessed them.

When the gods rose

out of their mortal bodies,

like a million particles of water

from a fountain,

the light

swept into all the corners

of the cottage,

and the old couple,

shaken with understanding,

bowed down---

but still they asked for nothing

beyond the difficult life

which they had already.

And the gods smiled as they vanished,

clapping their great wings.

Wherever it was

I was supposed to be

this morning---

whatever it was I said

I would be doing---

I was standing

at the edge of the field---

I was hurrying

through my own soul,

opening its dark doors---

I was leaning out;

I was listening.

FOUND A DEAD FOX

I found a dead fox

beside the gravel road,

curled inside the big

iron wheel

of an old tractor

that has been standing,

for years,

in the vines at the edge

of the road.

I don't know

what happened to it---

when it came there

or why it lay down

for good, settling

its narrow chin

on the rusted rim

of the iron wheel

to look out

over the fields,

and that way died---

but I know

this: its posture---

of looking,

to the last possible moment,

back into the world---

made me want

to sing something

joyous and tender

about foxes.

But what happened is this---

when I began,

when I crawled in

through the honeysuckle

and lay down,

curling my long spine

inside that cold wheel,

and touched the dead fox,

and looked out

into the wide fields,

the fox

vanished.

There was only myself

and the world,

and it was I

who was leaving.

And what could I sing

then?

Oh, beautiful world!

I just lay there

and looked at it.

And then it grew dark.

That day was done with.

And then the stars stepped forth

and held up their appointed fires---

those hot, hard

watchmen of the night.

Our neighbor, tall and blond and vigorous, the mother of many children,
is sick. We did not know she was sick, but she has come to the fence,
walking like a woman who is balancing a sword inside of her body, and
besides that her long hair is gone, it is short and, suddenly, gray. I
don't recognize her. It even occurs to me that it might be her mother.
But it's her own laughter-edged voice, we have heard it for years over
the hedges.

All summer the children, grown now and some of them with children of
their own, come to visit. They swim, they go for long walks along the
harbor, they make dinners for twelve, for fifteen, for twenty. In the
early morning two daughters come to the garden and slowly go through the
precise and silent gestures of T'ai Chi.

They all smile. Their father smiles too, and builds castles on the shore
with the children, and drives back to the city, and drives back to the
country. A carpenter is hired---a roof repaired, a porch rebuilt.
Everything that can be fixed.

June, July, August. Every day, we hear their laughter. I think of the
painting by van Gogh, the man in the chair. Everything wrong, and
nowhere to go. His hands over his eyes.

I was walking by. He was sitting there.

It was full morning, so the heat was heavy on his sand-colored head and
his webbed feet. I squatted beside him, at the edge of the path. He
didn't move.

I began to talk. I talked about summer, and about time. The pleasures of
eating, the terrors of the night. About this cup we call a life. About
happiness. And how good it feels, the heat of the sun between the
shoulder blades.

He looked neither up nor down, which didn't necessarily mean he was
either afraid or asleep. I felt his energy, stored under his tongue
perhaps, and behind his bulging eyes.

I talked about how the world seems to me, five feet tall, the blue sky
all around my head. I said, I wondered how it seemed to him, down there,
intimate with the dust.

He might have been Buddha---did not move, blink, or frown, not a tear
fell from those gold-rimmed eyes as the refined anguish of language
passed over him.

a ruffle of fire trailing over the shoulders and down the back---

color of copper, iron, bronze---

lighting up the dark branches of the pine.

What misery to be afraid of death.

What wretchedness, to believe only in what can be proven.

When I made a little sound

it looked at me, then it looked past me.

Then it rose, the wings enormous and opulent,

and, as I said, wreathed in fire.

the face that has no eyes, and recognized

the sea mouse---

toothless, legless, earless too,

it had been flung out of the stormy sea

and dropped

into the world's outer weather, and clearly it was

what was not even a fist

I looked in vain

for elbows and wrists;

I counted

the thirty segments, with which

rippled its mouse-like dance

over the sea's black floor---not on

feet, which it did not have, but on

tiny buds tipped with bristles,

like paintbrushes---

to find and swallow

the least pulse, and so stay alive, and feel---

however a worm feels it---satisfaction.

Before me

the sea still heaved, and the heavens were dark,

the storm unfinished,

and whatever was still alive

stirred in the awful cup of its power,

though it breathe like fire, though it love

the lung of its own life.

Little mat, little blot, little crawler,

full of bees and yellow beads and perfect flowerlets

and orange butterflies.

I don't suppose

blank blaze.

I don't suppose anything loves it except, perhaps,

filled by its dumb dazzle.

For myself,

I was just passing by, when the wind flared

Are not the difficult labors of our lives

they toss in the wind,

and I consider eternity as another possibility,

and I think of each life as a flower, as common

wait for midsummer,

dazzling as the teeth of mice,

The poppies send up their

orange flares; swaying

in the wind, their congregations

are a levitation

of bright dust, of thin

and lacy leaves.

There isn't a place

in this world that doesn't

sooner or later drown

in the indigos of darkness,

but now, for a while,

the roughage

shines like a miracle

as it floats above everything

with its yellow hair.

Of course nothing stops the cold,

black, curved blade

from hooking forward---

of course

loss is the great lesson.

But also I say this: that light

is an invitation

to happiness,

and that happiness,

when it's done right,

[]{#185_POPPIES.xhtml_pageMap_292 .pagebreak title="292"}is a kind of
holiness,

palpable and redemptive.

Inside the bright fields,

touched by their rough and spongy gold,

I am washed and washed

in the river

of earthly delight---

and what are you going to do---

what can you do

about it---

deep, blue night?

I saw him

in a dry place

on a hot day,

a traveler

making his way

from one pond

to another,

and he lifted up

his chary face

and looked at me

with his gravel eyes,

and the feather of his tongue

shot in and out

of his otherwise clamped mouth,

and I stopped on the path

to give him room,

and he went past me

with his head high,

loathing me, I think,

for my long legs,

my poor body, like a post,

my many fingers,

for he didn't linger

but, touching the other side of the path,

he headed, in long lunges and quick heaves,

straight to the nearest basin

of sweet black water and weeds,

and solitude---

Last night

in the fields

I lay down in the darkness

to think about death,

but instead I fell asleep,

as if in a vast and sloping room

filled with those white flowers

that open all summer,

sticky and untidy,

in the warm fields.

When I woke

the morning light was just slipping

in front of the stars,

and I was covered

with blossoms.

I don't know

how it happened---

I don't know

if my body went diving down

under the sugary vines

in some sleep-sharpened affinity

with the depths, or whether

that green energy

rose like a wave

and curled over me, claiming me

in its husky arms.

I pushed them away, but I didn't rise.

Never in my life had I felt so plush,

or so slippery,

[]{#187_WHITE_FLOWERS.xhtml_pageMap_296 .pagebreak title="296"}or so
resplendently empty.

began.

to break my heart

as the sun rises,

as the sun strokes them with his old, buttery fingers

and they open---

pools of lace,

white and pink---

and all day the black ants climb over them,

boring their deep and mysterious holes

into the curls,

craving the sweet sap,

taking it away

to their dark, underground cities---

and all day

under the shifty wind,

as in a dance to the great wedding,

the flowers bend their bright bodies,

and tip their fragrance to the air,

and rise,

their red stems holding

all that dampness and recklessness

gladly and lightly,

and there it is again---

beauty the brave, the exemplary,

[]{#188_PEONIES.xhtml_pageMap_298 .pagebreak title="298"}blazing open.

Do you love this world?

Do you cherish your humble and silky life?

Do you adore the green grass, with its terror beneath?

Do you also hurry, half-dressed and barefoot, into the garden,

and softly,

and exclaiming of their dearness,

fill your arms with the white and pink flowers,

with their honeyed heaviness, their lush trembling,

their eagerness

to be wild and perfect for a moment, before they are

nothing, forever?

Then,

2\. [The Swamp]{._4-Free-Style-22}

Last night, in the rain, some of the men climbed over

the barbed-wire fence of the detention center.

In the darkness they wondered if they could do it, and knew

they had to try to do it.

In the darkness they climbed the wire, handful after handful

of barbed wire.

Even in the darkness most of them were caught and sent back

to the camp inside.

But a few are still climbing the barbed wire, or wading through

the blue swamp on the other side.

What does barbed wire feel like when you grip it, as though

it were a loaf of bread, or a pair of shoes?

lying in the flower bed,

cold and broken,

dragged from the idling car

with its plug of rags, and its gleaming

length of hose. My father

shouted,

then the ambulance came,

then we all looked at death,

then the ambulance took him away.

From the porch of the house

I turned back once again

looking for my father, who had lingered,

who was still standing in the flowers,

who was that motionless muddy man,

who was that tiny figure in the rain.

Once, in summer,

in the blueberries,

I fell asleep, and woke

when a deer stumbled against me.

I guess

she was so busy with her own happiness

she had grown careless

and was just wandering along

listening

to the wind as she leaned down

to lip up the sweetness.

So, there we were

with nothing between us

but a few leaves, and the wind's

glossy voice

shouting instructions.

The deer

backed away finally

and flung up her white tail

and went floating off toward the trees---

but the moment before she did that

was so wide and so deep

it has lasted to this day;

I have only to think of her---

[]{#192_PICKING_BLUEBERRIES_.xhtml_pageMap_307 .pagebreak
title="307"}the flower of her amazement

and the stalled breath of her curiosity,

and even the damp touch of her solicitude

before she took flight---

to be absent again from this world

and alive, again, in another,

for thirty years

sleepy and amazed,

rising out of the rough weeds,

listening and looking.

Beautiful girl,

where are you?

1\.

There's this shape, black as the entrance to a cave.

A longing wells up in its throat

like a blossom

as it breathes slowly.

What does the world

mean to you if you can't trust it

to go on shining when you're

not there? And there's

a tree, long-fallen; once

the bees flew to it, like a procession

of messengers, and filled it

with honey.

2\.

I said to the chickadee, singing his heart out in the

green pine tree:

little dazzler,

little song,

little mouthful.

3\.

The shape climbs up out of the curled grass. It

grunts into view. There is no measure

[]{#193_OCTOBER.xhtml_pageMap_309 .pagebreak title="309"}for the
confidence at the bottom of its eyes---

there is no telling

the suppleness of its shoulders as it turns

and yawns.

Near the fallen tree

something---a leaf snapped loose

from the branch and fluttering down---tries to pull me

into its trap of attention.

4\.

It pulls me

into its trap of attention.

And when I turn again, the bear is gone.

5\.

Look, hasn't my body already felt

like the body of a flower?

6\.

Look, I want to love this world

as though it's the last chance I'm ever going to get

to be alive

and know it.

[]{#193_OCTOBER.xhtml_pageMap_310 .pagebreak title="310"}7.

Sometimes in late summer I won't touch anything, not

the flowers, not the blackberries

brimming in the thickets; I won't drink

from the pond; I won't name the birds or the trees;

I won't whisper my own name.

One morning

the fox came down the hill, glittering and confident,

and didn't see me---and I thought:

so this is the world.

I'm not in it.

It is beautiful.

Why should I have it, and not the anteater

"Make of yourself a light,"

I think of this every morning

as the east begins

to tear off its many clouds

of darkness, to send up the first

signal---a white fan

streaked with pink and violet,

even green.

An old man, he lay down

between two sala trees,

and he might have said anything,

knowing it was his final hour.

The light burns upward,

it thickens and settles over the fields.

Around him, the villagers gathered

and stretched forward to listen.

Even before the sun itself

hangs, disattached, in the blue air,

I am touched everywhere

by its ocean of yellow waves.

No doubt he thought of everything

that had happened in his difficult life.

And then I feel the sun itself

as it blazes over the hills,

like a million flowers on fire---

clearly I'm not needed,

who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down---

who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.

Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.

Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.

I don't know exactly what a prayer is.

I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down

into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,

how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,

In Singapore, in the airport,

a darkness was ripped from my eyes.

In the women's restroom, one compartment stood open.

A woman knelt there, washing something

in the white bowl.

Disgust argued in my stomach

and I felt, in my pocket, for my ticket.

A poem should always have birds in it.

Kingfishers, say, with their bold eyes and gaudy wings,

Rivers are pleasant, and of course trees.

A waterfall, or if that's not possible, a fountain

rising and falling.

A person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem.

When the woman turned I could not answer her face.

Her beauty and her embarrassment struggled together, and

neither could win.

She smiled and I smiled. What kind of nonsense is this?

Everybody needs a job.

Yes, a person wants to stand in a happy place, in a poem.

But first we must watch her as she stares down at her labor,

which is dull enough.

She is washing the tops of the airport ashtrays, as big as

hubcaps, with a blue rag.

Her small hands turn the metal, scrubbing and rinsing.

She does not work slowly, nor quickly, but like a river.

Her dark hair is like the wing of a bird.

[]{#203_SINGAPORE.xhtml_pageMap_327 .pagebreak title="327"}I don't doubt
for a moment that she loves her life.

And I want her to rise up from the crust and the slop

and fly down to the river.

This probably won't happen.

But maybe it will.

If the world were only pain and logic, who would want it?

Of course, it isn't.

Neither do I mean anything miraculous, but only

the light that can shine out of a life. I mean

the way she unfolded and refolded the blue cloth,

the way her smile was only for my sake; I mean

the way this poem is filled with trees, and birds.

like a blue flower, in his beak

that doesn't have its splash of happiness?

There are more fish than there are leaves

on a thousand trees, and anyway the kingfisher

wasn't born to think about it, or anything else.

When the wave snaps shut over his blue head, the water

remains water---hunger is the only story

he has ever heard in his life that he could believe.

I don't say he's right. Neither

do I say he's wrong. Religiously he swallows the silver leaf

over the bright sea to do the same thing, to do it

(as I long to do something, anything) perfectly.

Across the wide waters

something comes

floating---a slim

and delicate

ship, filled

with white flowers---

and it moves

on its miraculous muscles

as though time didn't exist,

as though bringing such gifts

to the dry shore

was a happiness

almost beyond bearing.

And now it turns its dark eyes,

it rearranges

the clouds of its wings,

it trails

an elaborate webbed foot,

the color of charcoal.

Soon it will be here.

Oh, what shall I do

when that poppy-colored beak

rests in my hand?

Said Mrs. Blake of the poet:

[]{#206_THE_SWAN.xhtml_pageMap_332 .pagebreak title="332"}I miss my
husband's company---

he is so often

in paradise.

Of course! the path to heaven

doesn't lie down in flat miles.

It's in the imagination

with which you perceive

this world,

and the gestures

with which you honor it.

Oh, what will I do, what will I say, when those white wings

touch the shore?

Now I see it---

it nudges with its bulldog head

the slippery stems of the lilies, making them tremble;

and now it noses along in the wake of the little brown teal

who is leading her soft children

from one side of the pond to the other; she keeps

close to the edge

and they follow closely, the good children---

the tender children,

the sweet children, dangling their pretty feet

into the darkness.

And now will come---I can count on it---the murky splash,

the certain victory

of that pink and gassy mouth, and the frantic

circling of the hen while the rest of the chicks

flare away over the water and into the reeds, and my heart

will be most mournful

on their account. But, listen,

what's important?

Nothing's important

except that the great and cruel mystery of the world,

of which this is a part,

not be denied. Once,

I happened to see, on a city street, in summer,

[]{#207_TURTLE.xhtml_pageMap_334 .pagebreak title="334"}a dusty, fouled
turtle plodding along---

a snapper---

broken out I suppose from some backyard cage---

and I knew what I had to do---

I looked it right in the eyes, and I caught it---

I put it, like a small mountain range,

into a knapsack, and I took it out

of the city, and I let it

down into the dark pond, into

the cool water,

and the light of the lilies,

to live.

I'd seen

they ended the long night

under the pines, walking

like two mute

and beautiful women toward

the deeper woods, so I

got up in the dark and

went there. They came

slowly down the hill

the blue trees, shyly

they stepped

closer and stared

from under their thick lashes and even

nibbled some damp

tassels of weeds. This

is not a poem about a dream,

Finally

one of them---I swear it!---

A blue preacher

flew toward the swamp,

in slow motion.

On the leafy banks,

an old Chinese poet,

hunched in the white gown of his wings,

was waiting.

The water

was the kind of dark silk

that has silver lines

shot through it

when it is touched by the wind

or is splashed upward,

in a small, quick flower,

by the life beneath it.

The preacher

made his difficult landing,

his skirts up around his knees.

The poet's eyes

flared, just as a poet's eyes

are said to do

when the poet is awakened

from the forest of meditation.

It was summer.

[]{#210_SOME_HERONS.xhtml_pageMap_339 .pagebreak title="339"}It was only
a few moments past the sun's rising,

which meant that the whole long sweet day

lay before them.

equally as beautiful---

joined them and stood just beneath them

in the black, polished water

The butterfly's loping flight

carries it through the country of the leaves

delicately, and well enough to get it

where it wants to go, wherever that is, stopping

here and there to fuzzle the damp throats

of flowers and the black mud; up

and down it swings, frenzied and aimless; and sometimes

for long delicious moments it is perfectly

lazy, riding motionless in the breeze on the soft stalk

of some ordinary flower.

3\.

The god of dirt

came up to me many times and said

so many wise and delectable things, I lay

on the grass listening

crow voice,

frog voice; *now*,

is created.

Under the orange

the heaped

ashes of the night

turn into leaves again

and fasten themselves to the high branches

and the ponds appear

like black cloth

on which are painted islands

of summer lilies.

If it is your nature

to be happy

you will swim away along the soft trails

alighting everywhere.

And if your spirit

carries within it

the thorn

that is heavier than lead---

if it's all you can do

to keep on trudging---

Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.

Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain

are moving across the landscapes,

over the prairies and the deep trees,

the mountains and the rivers.

Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,

are heading home again.

And meanwhile

the gold-trimmed thunder

wanders the sky; the river

Cyclone, fire, and their merry cousins

bring us to grief---but these are the hours

we lift them to our shoulders like so many

into the future. I don't mean

there are no bodies in the river,

or bones broken by the wind. I mean

everyone who has heard the lethal train-roar

of the tornado swears there was no mention ever

of any person, or reason---I mean

the waters rise without any plot upon

was terrible.

It was already late

enough, and a wild night,

and the road full of fallen

But little by little,

as you left their voices behind,

the stars began to burn

through the sheets of clouds,

which you slowly

recognized as your own,

1\.

Last night the geese came back,

slanting fast

from the blossom of the rising moon down

to the black pond. A muskrat

swimming in the twilight saw them and hurried

to the secret lodges to tell everyone

spring had come.

And so it had.

By morning when I went out

the last of the ice had disappeared, blackbirds

sang on the shores. Every year

the geese, returning,

do this, I don't

know how.

2\.

The curtains opened and there was

an old man in a headdress of feathers,

leather leggings and a vest made

from the skin of some animal. He danced

in a kind of surly rapture, and the trees

in the fields far away

began to mutter and suck up their long roots.

Slowly they advanced until they stood

pressed to the schoolhouse windows.

[]{#218_TWO_KINDS_OF_DELIVER.xhtml_pageMap_354 .pagebreak title="354"}3.

I don't know

lots of things but I know this: next year

when spring

flows over the starting point I'll think I'm going to

drown in the shimmering miles of it and then

one or two birds will fly me over

the threshold.

As for the pain

of others, of course it tries to be

abstract, but then

there flares up out of a vanished wilderness, like fire,

still blistering: the wrinkled face

of an old Chippewa

smiling, hating us,

dancing for his life.

though in truth

there was no sound, only

the rough wing of fright

rushing

through our bodies.

One flowed

under the leaves, the other flared

half its length

into the air

against my body, then swirled

away. Once I had steadied,

I thought: how valiant!

and I wished

I had come softly, I wished

For a moment I stared

coiled, cringing,

Sometimes,

walking for hours through the woods,

I don't know what I'm looking for,

maybe for something

shy and beautiful to come

frisking out of the undergrowth.

Once a fawn did just that.

My dog didn't know

what dogs usually do.

And the fawn didn't know.

As for the doe, she was probably

down in Round Pond, swizzling up

the sweet marsh grass and dreaming

that everything was fine.

![](image/1.jpg){.h1em}

The way I'd like to go on living in this world

wouldn't hurt anything, I'd just go on

walking uphill and downhill, looking around,

and so what if half the time I don't know

what for---

so what if it doesn't come

to a hill of beans---

so what if I vote liberal,

[]{#220_1945_1985_POEM_FOR_T.xhtml_pageMap_358 .pagebreak
title="358"}and am Jewish,

or Lutheran---

or a game warden---

or a bingo addict---

and smoke a pipe?

In the films of Dachau and Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen

the dead rise from the earth

and are piled in front of us, the starved

stare across forty years,

and lush, green, musical Germany

shows again its iron claw, which won't

ever be forgotten, which won't

ever be understood, but which did,

slowly, for years, scrape across Europe

![](image/1.jpg){.h1em}

while the rest of the world

did nothing.

![](image/1.jpg){.h1em}

Oh, you never saw

such a good leafy place, and

everything was fine, my dog and the fawn

did a little dance,

they didn't get serious.

Then the fawn clambered away through the leaves

[]{#220_1945_1985_POEM_FOR_T.xhtml_pageMap_359 .pagebreak
title="359"}and my gentle dog followed me away.

![](image/1.jpg){.h1em}

Oh, you never saw such a garden!

A hundred kinds of flowers in bloom!

A waterfall, for pleasure and nothing else!

The garden furniture is white,

tables and chairs in the cool shade.

A man sits there, the long afternoon before him.

He is finishing lunch, some kind

of fruit, chicken, and a salad.

A bottle of wine with a thin and beaded neck.

He fills a glass.

You can tell it is real crystal.

He lifts it to his mouth and drinks peacefully.

It is the face of Mengele.

![](image/1.jpg){.h1em}

Later

the doe came wandering back in the twilight.

She stepped through the leaves. She hesitated,

sniffing the air.

Then she knew everything.

![](image/1.jpg){.h1em}

The forest grew dark.

She nuzzled her child wildly.

and one doe, dimpling the ground as she touches

its dampness sharply, flares

out of the brush and gallops away.

deep into night,

it has finally ended.

is immense,

and the heavens still hold

a million candles; nowhere

the familiar things:

stars, the moon,

glitter like castles

smolder with light, a passing

Where so many millions of powerful bawling beasts

1805

near the Bitterroot Mountains:

a man named Lewis kneels down

on the prairie watching

a sparrow's nest cleverly concealed in the wild hyssop

and lined with buffalo hair. The chicks,

not more than a day hatched, lean

quietly into the thick wool as if

content, after all,

to have left the perfect world and
fallen,[]{#228_GHOSTS.xhtml_pageMap_374 .pagebreak title="374"}

Said the old-timers:

stubbornly, after a hundred years,

mark the grass where the rich droppings

fell to the earth as the herd stood

I watched while, secretly

and with the tenderness of any caring woman,

a cow gave birth

to a red calf, tongued him dry and nursed him

in a warm corner

of the clear night

in the fragrant grass

in the wild domains

of the prairie spring, and I asked them,

in my dream I knelt down and asked them

to make room for me.

CABBAGE

And now as the iron rinds over

the ponds start dissolving,

you come, dreaming of ferns and flowers

and new leaves unfolding,

upon the brash

turnip-hearted skunk cabbage

slinging its bunched leaves up

through the chilly mud.

You kneel beside it. The smell

is lurid and flows out in the most

unabashed way, attracting

into itself a continual spattering

of protein. Appalling its rough

green caves, and the thought

of the thick root nested below, stubborn

and powerful as instinct!

But these are the woods you love,

where the secret name

of every death is life again---a miracle

wrought surely not of mere turning

but of dense and scalding reenactment. Not

tenderness, not longing, but daring and brawn

pull down the frozen waterfall, the past.

Ferns, leaves, flowers, the last subtle

refinements, elegant and easeful, wait

to rise and flourish.

What blazes the trail is not necessarily pretty.

I once saw two snakes,

northern racers,

hurrying through the woods,

their bodies

like two black whips

lifting and dashing forward;

in perfect concert

they held their heads high

and swam forward

on their sleek bellies;

under the trees,

through vines, branches,

over stones,

through fields of flowers,

they traveled

like a matched team

like a dance

like a love affair.

Once

I saw her hand reach

to touch the muskrat's

I want to flow out

and died

in the slow pouring off

I opened his body and separated

the flesh from the bones

and ate him. Now the sea

is in me: I am the fish, the fish

glitters in me; we are

risen, tangled together, certain to fall

back to the sea. Out of pain,

and pain, and more pain

we feed this feverish plot, we are nourished

by the mystery.

And not for any reason

they crash back under those black silks

and we all fall back

together into that wet fire, you

playing with seaweed, swimming

through the green islands, tossing

the slippery branches into the air.

She steps into the dark swamp

where the long wait ends.

The secret slippery package

drops to the weeds.

She leans her long neck and tongues it

between breaths slack with exhaustion

and after a while it rises and becomes a creature

like her, but much smaller.

So now there are two. And they walk together

like a dream under the trees.

In early June, at the edge of a field

thick with pink and yellow flowers

I meet them.

I can only stare.

She is the most beautiful woman

I have ever seen.

Her child leaps among the flowers,

the blue of the sky falls over me

to live my life all over again, to begin again,

to be utterly

worse than the risk of death and that's

Tecumseh lived here.

The wounds of the past

are ignored, but hang on

like the litter that snags among the yellow branches,

newspapers and plastic bags, after the rains.

Where are the Shawnee now?

Do you know? Or would you have to

write to Washington, and even then,

whatever they said,

would you believe it? Sometimes

I would like to paint my body red and go out into

the glittering snow

to die.

His name meant Shooting Star.

From Mad River country north to the border

he gathered the tribes

and armed them one more time. He vowed

to keep Ohio and it took him

over twenty years to fail.

[]{#237_TECUMSEH.xhtml_pageMap_388 .pagebreak title="388"}After the
bloody and final fighting, at Thames,

it was over, except

he turned into a little boy again, and leaped

into a birch canoe and went

To live in this world

to love what is mortal;

and my hands like fire,

the leaping in the moonlight, and can't touch it,

wanting it miraculously to heal

and spring up

joyful. But finally

title="395"}THREE POEMS FOR JAMES WRIGHT

1\. Hearing of Your Illness

I went out

from the news of your illness

like a broken bone

I spoke your name

to the sickle moon and saw her white wing

fall back toward the blackness, but she

rowed deep past that hesitation, and

kept rising.

Then I went down

to a black creek and alder grove

that is Ohio like nothing else is

and told them. There was an owl there,

sick of its hunger but still

trapped in it, unable to be anything else.

And the creek

tippled on down over some dark rocks

and the alders

breathed fast in their red blossoms.

Then I lay down in a rank and spring-sweet field.

Weeds sprouting in the darkness, and some

small creatures rustling about, living their lives

as they do, moment by moment.

I felt better, telling them about you.

They know what pain is, and they knew you,

[]{#242_THREE_POEMS_FOR_JAME.xhtml_pageMap_396 .pagebreak
title="396"}and they would have stopped too, as I

was longing to do, everything, the hunger

and the flowing.

That they could not---

merely loved you and waited

to take you back

as a stone,

as a small quick Ohio creek,

as the beautiful pulse of everything,

meanwhile not missing one shred of their own

assignments of song

and muscle---

was what I learned there, so I

got up finally, with a grief

worthy of you, and went home.

[]{#242_THREE_POEMS_FOR_JAME.xhtml_stanza2}2. Early Morning in Ohio

A late snowfall.

In the white morning the trains

whistle and bang in the freightyard,

shifting track, getting ready

to get on with it, to roll out

into the country again, to get

far away from here and closer

to somewhere else.

[]{#242_THREE_POEMS_FOR_JAME.xhtml_pageMap_397 .pagebreak title="397"}A
mile away, leaving the house, I hear them

and stop, astonished.

Of course. I thought they would stop

when you did. I thought you'd never sicken

anyway, or, if you did, Ohio

would fall down too, barn

by bright barn, into

hillsides of pain: torn boards,

bent nails, shattered

windows. My old dog

who doesn't know yet he is only mortal

bounds limping away

through the weeds, and I don't do

anything to stop him.

I remember

what you said.

And think how somewhere in Tuscany

a small spider might even now

be stepping forth, testing

the silks of her web, the morning air,

the possibilities; maybe even, who knows,

singing a tiny song.

And if the whistling of the trains drags through me

like wire, well, I can hurt can't I? The white fields

[]{#242_THREE_POEMS_FOR_JAME.xhtml_pageMap_398 .pagebreak
title="398"}burn or my eyes swim, whichever; anyway I whistle

to the old dog and when he comes finally

I fall to my knees in the glittering snow, I throw

my arms around him.

[]{#242_THREE_POEMS_FOR_JAME.xhtml_stanza3}3. The Rose

I had a red rose to send you,

but it reeked of occasion, I thought,

so I didn't. Anyway

it was the time

the willows do what they do

every spring, so I cut some

down by a dark Ohio creek and was ready

to mail them to you when the news came

that nothing

could come to you

in time

anymore

ever.

I put down the phone

and I thought I saw, on the floor of the room, suddenly,

a large box,

and I knew, the next thing I had to do,

was lift it

and I didn't know if I
could.[]{#242_THREE_POEMS_FOR_JAME.xhtml_pageMap_399 .pagebreak
title="399"}

Well, I did.

But don't call it anything

but what it was---the voice

of a small bird singing inside, Lord,

how it sang, and kept singing!

how it keeps singing!

in its deep

and miraculous

I thought the earth

remembered me, she

took me back so tenderly, arranging

her dark skirts, her pockets

full of lichens and seeds. I slept

as never before, a stone

on the riverbed, nothing

between me and the white fire of the stars

but my thoughts, and they floated

light as moths among the branches

of the perfect trees. All night

I heard the small kingdoms breathing

around me, the insects, and the birds

who do their work in the darkness. All night

I rose and fell, as if in water, grappling

with a luminous doom. By morning

I had vanished at least a dozen times

into something better.

IN WINTER

Deep in the woods,

under the sprawled upheavals of rocks,

dozens lie coiled together.

Touch them: they scarcely

breathe; they stare

out of such deep forgetfulness

that their eyes are like jewels---

and asleep, though they cannot close.

And in each mouth the forked tongue,

sensitive as an angel's ear,

lies like a drugged muscle.

With the fires of spring they will lash forth again

on their life of ribs!---

bodies like whips!

But now under the lids of the mute

succeeding snowfalls

they sleep in their cold cauldron: a flickering broth

six months below simmer.

Sometimes, in the middle of the lesson,

we exchanged places. She would gaze a moment at her

hands

spread over the keys; then the small house with its knick-knacks,

its shut windows,

its photographs of her sons and the serious husband,

vanished as new shapes formed. Sound

became music, and music a white

scarp for the listener to climb

alone. I leaped rock over rock to the top

and found myself waiting, transformed,

and still she played, her eyes luminous and willful,

her pinned hair falling down---

forgetting me, the house, the neat green yard,

she fled in that lick of flame all tedious bonds:

supper, the duties of flesh and home,

the knife at the throat, the death in the metronome.

They stretch their glossy necks

In the tallest branches

Of green trees. I am

Possibly dangerous, I am

Entering the kingdom.

The dream of my life

Is to lie down by a slow river

And stare at the light in the trees---

To learn something by being nothing

A little while but the rich

Lens of attention.

But the crows puff their feathers and cry

Between me and the sun,

And I should go now.

They know me for what I am.

On his way to a worried house.

But when he stops at your gate,

Under the room where you lie half-asleep,

You know it is not just anyone---

It is the Night Traveler.

You lean your arms on the sill

And stare down. But all you can see

Are bits of wilderness attached to him---

Twigs, loam and leaves,

Vines and blossoms. Among these

You feel his eyes, and his hands

Lifting something in the air.

He has a gift for you, but it has no name.

It is windy and woolly.

He holds it in the moonlight, and it sings

Like a newborn beast,

Like a child at Christmas,

Like your own heart as it tumbles

In love's green bed.

You take it, and he is gone.

All night---and all your life, if you are willing---

It will nuzzle your face, cold-nosed,

Like a small white wolf;

It will curl in your palm

[]{#248_THE_NIGHT_TRAVELER.xhtml_pageMap_408 .pagebreak title="408"}Like
a hard blue stone;

That last Friday he looked

so ill, like an old mountain-climber

lost on the white trails, listening

to the ice breaking upward, under

his worn-out shoes. You say:

I heard rumors of trouble, but after all

we all have that. You say:

what could I have done? and you go

with the rest, to bury him.

That night, you turn in your bed

to watch the moon rise, and once more

see what a small coin it is

against the darkness, and how everything else

is a mystery, and you know

nothing at all except

the moonlight is beautiful---

Now he lies looped and useless

I stop the car

He is as cool and gleaming

as a braided whip, he is as beautiful and quiet

as a dead brother.

I leave him under the leaves

and drive on, thinking

about *death*: its suddenness,

its terrible weight,

its certain coming. Yet under

reason burns a brighter fire, which the bones

have always preferred.

It is the story of endless good fortune.

It says to oblivion: not me!

It is the light at the center of every cell.

It is what sent the snake coiling and flowing forward

There's a bear in the Truro woods.

People have seen it---three or four,

or two, or one. I think

of the thickness of the serious woods

around the dark bowls of the Truro ponds;

I think of the blueberry fields, the blackberry tangles,

the cranberry bogs. And the sky

with its new moon, its familiar star-trails,

burns down like a brand-new heaven,

while everywhere I look on the scratchy hillsides

shadows seem to grow shoulders. Surely

a beast might be clever, be lucky, move quietly

through the woods for years, learning to stay away

from roads and houses. Common sense mutters:

it can't be true, it must be somebody's

runaway dog. But the seed

has been planted, and when has happiness ever

required much evidence to begin

its leaf-green breathing?

in barnacled fistfuls,

in the dampness that never

of high tide, in the slow

washing away of the water

in which they feed,

in which the blue shells

open a little, and the orange bodies

make a sound,

not loud,

not unmusical, as they take

nourishment, as the ocean

enters their bodies. At low tide

I am on the riprap, clattering

with boots and a pail,

rock over rock; I choose

the crevice, I reach

forward into the dampness,

my hands feeling everywhere

for the best, the biggest. Even before

I decide which to take,

which to twist from the wet rocks,

which to devour,

[]{#253_MUSSELS.xhtml_pageMap_414 .pagebreak title="414"}they, who have

Out of the black wave of sleep she turned,

enormous beast,

and welcomed the little ones, blind pink islands

no bigger than shoes. She washed them;

she nibbled them with teeth like white tusks;

she curled down

beside them like a horizon.

They snuggled. Each knew what it was:

an original, formed

in the whirlwind, with no recognitions between

itself and the first steams

the white moon over her and a young man near.

The blossoms fell down like white feathers,

the grass was warm as a bed, and the young man

full of promises, and the face of the moon

a white fire.

Later,

when the young man went away and came back with a

bride,

Elizabeth

climbed into the attic.

2\.

Three women came in the night

to wash the blood away,

and burn the sheets,

and take away the child.

Was it a boy or girl?

No one remembers.

3\.

Elizabeth Fortune was not seen again

for forty years

[]{#255_STRAWBERRY_MOON.xhtml_pageMap_417 .pagebreak title="397"}Meals
were sent up,

laundry exchanged.

It was considered a solution

more proper than shame

showing itself to the village.

4\.

Finally, name by name, the downstairs died

or moved away,

and she had to come down,

so she did.

At sixty-one, she took in boarders,

washed their dishes,

made their beds,

spoke whatever had to be spoken,

and no more.

5\.

I asked my mother:

what happened to the man? She answered:

Nothing.

They had three children.

He worked in the boatyard.

[]{#255_STRAWBERRY_MOON.xhtml_pageMap_418 .pagebreak title="398"}I asked
my mother: did they ever meet again?

No, she said,

though sometimes he would come

to the house to visit.

Elizabeth, of course, stayed upstairs.

6\.

Now the women are gathering

in smoke-filled rooms,

rough as politicians,

scrappy as club fighters.

And should anyone be surprised

if sometimes, when the white moon rises,

women want to lash out

with a cutting edge?

MOON---THE POND

You think it will never happen again.

Then, one night in April,

the tribes wake trilling.

You walk down to the shore.

Your coming stills them,

but little by little the silence lifts

until song is everywhere

and your soul rises from your bones

and strides out over the water.

It is a crazy thing to do---

for no one can live like that,

floating around in the darkness

over the gauzy water.

Left on the shore your bones

keep shouting c*ome back!*

But your soul won't listen;

in the distance it is unfolding

like a pair of wings, it is sparking

like hot wires. So,

like a good friend,

you decide to follow.

You step off the shore

and plummet to your knees---

you slog forward to your thighs

and sink to your cheekbones---

and now you are caught

by the cold chains of the water---

you are vanishing while around you

the frogs continue to sing, driving

[]{#256_PINK_MOON_THE_POND.xhtml_pageMap_420 .pagebreak
title="420"}their music upward through your own throat,

not even noticing

you are something else.

And that's when it happens---

you see everything

through their eyes,

their joy, their necessity;

you wear their webbed fingers;

your throat swells.

And that's when you know

you will live whether you will or not,

one way or another,

because everything is everything else,

one long muscle.

It's no more mysterious than that.

So you relax, you don't fight it anymore,

the darkness coming down

called water,

called spring,

called the green leaf, called

a woman's body

as it turns into mud and leaves,

as it beats in its cage of water,

as it turns like a lonely spindle

in the moonlight, as it says

yes.

[]{#257_AUNT_LEAF.xhtml_pageMap_421 .pagebreak title="421"}AUNT LEAF

Needing one, I invented her---

the great-great-aunt dark as hickory

called Shining-Leaf, or Drifting-Cloud

or The-Beauty-of-the-Night.

Dear aunt, I'd call into the leaves,

and she'd rise up, like an old log in a pool,

and whisper in a language only the two of us knew

the word that meant *follow*,

and we'd travel

cheerful as birds

out of the dusty town and into the trees

where she would change us both into something quicker---

two foxes with black feet,

two snakes green as ribbons,

two shimmering fish---

and all day we'd travel.

At day's end she'd leave me back at my own door

with the rest of my family,

who were kind, but solid as wood

and rarely wandered. While she,

old twist of feathers and birch bark,

would walk in circles wide as rain and then

float back

scattering the rags of twilight

on fluttering moth wings;

[]{#257_AUNT_LEAF.xhtml_pageMap_422 .pagebreak title="422"}or she'd
slouch from the barn like a gray opossum;

or she'd hang in the milky moonlight

burning like a medallion,

this bone dream,

this friend I had to have,

this old woman made out of leaves.

I have sharpened my knives, I have

Put on the heavy apron.

In blue willow-pattern bowls.

I have entered

The hen house.

Eight o'clock, no later,

You light the lamps,

The big one by the large window,

The small one on your desk.

They are not to see by---

It is still twilight out over the sand,

The scrub oaks and cranberries.

Even the small birds have not settled

For sleep yet, out of the reach

Of prowling foxes. No,

You light the lamps because

You are alone in your small house

And the wicks sputtering gold

Are like two visitors with good stories

They will tell slowly, in soft voices,

While the air outside turns quietly

A grainy and luminous blue.

You wish it would never change---

[]{#259_THE_LAMPS.xhtml_pageMap_425 .pagebreak title="425"}But of course
the darkness keeps

Its appointment. Each evening,

An inscrutable presence, it has the final word

He danced in feathers, with paint across his nose.

Thump, thump went the drum, and bumped our blood,

And sent a strange vibration through the mind.

White Eagle, he was called, or Mr. White,

And he strutted for money now, in schoolrooms built

On Ohio's plains, surrounded by the graves

Of all of our fathers, but more of his than ours.

Our teachers called it Extracurricular.

We called it fun. And as for Mr. White,

Changed back to a shabby salesman's suit, he called it

Nothing at all as he packed his drums, and drove,

Tires screeching, out of the schoolyard into the night.

It isn't very far as highways lie.

I might be back by nightfall, having seen

The rough pines, and the stones, and the clear water.

Friends argue that I might be wiser for it.

They do not hear that far-off Yankee whisper:

How dull we grow from hurrying here and there!

Many have gone, and think me half a fool

To miss a day away in the cool country.

Maybe. But in a book I read and cherish,

Going to Walden is not so easy a thing

As a green visit. It is the slow and difficult

Trick of living, and finding it where you are.

FLIGHT

Traveling at thirty thousand feet, we see

How much of earth still lies in wilderness,

Till terminals occur like miracles

To civilize the paralyzing dark.

Buckled for landing to a tilting chair,

I think: if miracle or accident

Should send us on across the upper air,

How many miles, or nights, or years to go

Before the mind, with its huge ego paling,

Before the heart, all expectation spent,

Should read the meaning of the scene below?

But now already the loved ones gather

Under the dome of welcome, as we glide

Over the final jutting mountainside,

Across the suburbs tangled in their lights,

And settled softly on the earth once more

Rise in the fierce assumption of our lives---

Discarding smoothly, as we disembark,

All thoughts that held us wiser for a moment

Up there alone, in the impartial []{#263_NIGHT_FLIGHT.xhtml_pageMap_432

I wake earlier, now that the birds have come

And sing in the unfailing trees.

On a cot by an open window

I lie like land used up, while spring unfolds.

Now of all voyagers I remember, who among them

Did not board ship with grief among their maps?---

Till it seemed men never go somewhere, they only leave

Wherever they are, when the dying begins.

For myself, I find my wanting life

Implores no novelty and no disguise of distance;

Where, in what country, might I put down these thoughts,

Who still am citizen of this fallen city?

On a cot by an open window, I lie and remember

While the birds in the trees sing of the circle of time.

Let the dying go on, and let me, if I can,

Inherit from disaster before I move.

O, I go to see the great ships ride from harbor,

And my wounds leap with impatience; yet I turn back

To sort the weeping ruins of my house:

Here or nowhere I will make peace with the fact.

The wagons stand

And rust, and glitter sometimes in the moon,

Since we have lost dominion of the fields.

No more great clattering Jack,

His thick mane filled with chaff and wind,

Will let us lead him from the easy barns;

No more sweet gentle Jack

Will let us strap him to his leather bondage

And help us tow the weight of summer home.

The days

Are easier now, and we have time for thought,

Idling in corners of our weedy land.

But now we learn, as season follows season

And no one plants upon these hills,

How poor a gift is freedom to the spirit

That loved the labor. Now, like Jack,

We stand turned out into eternal Sunday,

And look through moonlight at the silenced wagons.

Yet we have lives to balance our regret,

Can turn to other things.

Now in the moonlight we can move away,

While he is left staring upon the stark

Arrangement of the wagons leaning earthward:

The simple blood that cannot name its lack,

But knows the world has fallen out of reason,

That it is autumn, and no laborer comes.

Over the local stations, one by one,

Announcers list disasters like dark poems

That always happen in the skull of winter.

But once again the storm has passed us by:

Lovely and moderate, the snow lies down

While shouting children hurry back to play,

And scarved and smiling citizens once more

Sweep down their easy paths of pride and welcome.

And what else might we do? Let us be truthful.

Two counties north the storm has taken lives.

Two counties north, to us, is far away,---

A land of trees, a wing upon a map,

A wild place never visited,---so we

Forget with ease each far mortality.

Peacefully from our frozen yards we watch

Our children running on the mild white hills.

This is the landscape that we understand,---

And till the principle of things takes root,

How shall examples move us from our calm?

I do not say that it is not a fault.

I only say, except as we have loved,

All news arrives as from a distant land.

Feeling the icy kick, the endless waves

Reaching around my life, I moved my arms

And coughed, and in the end saw land.

Somebody, I suppose,

Remembering the medieval maxim,

Had tossed me in,

Had wanted me to learn to swim,

Not knowing that none of us, who ever came back

From that long lonely fall and frenzied rising,

Ever learned anything at all

About swimming, but only

How to put off, one by one,

Dreams and pity, love and grace,---

How to survive in any place.

On winter's margin, see the small birds now

With half-forged memories come flocking home

To gardens famous for their charity.

The green globe's broken; vines like tangled veins

Hang at the entrance to the silent wood.

With half a loaf, I am the prince of crumbs;

By time snow's down, the birds amassed will sing

Like children for their sire to walk abroad!

But what I love, is the gray stubborn hawk

Who floats alone beyond the frozen vines;

And what I dream of are the patient deer

Who stand on legs like reeds and drink the wind;---

They are what saves the world: who choose to grow

Thin to a starting point beyond this squalor.

The deed took all my heart.

I did not think of you,

Not till the thing was done.

I put my sword away,

And then no more the cold

And perfect fury ran

Along my narrow bones,

And then no more the black

And dripping corridors

Held anywhere the shape

That I had come to slay.

Then, for the first time,

I saw in the cave's belly

The dark and clotted webs,

The green and sucking pools,

The rank and crumbling walls,

The maze of passages.

And I thought then

Of the far earth,

Of the spring sun

And the slow wind,

And a young girl.

And I looked then

At the white thread.

Hunting the minotaur

I was no common man

And had no need of love.

I trailed the shining thread

[]{#270_THE_RETURN.xhtml_pageMap_441 .pagebreak title="441"}Behind me,
for a vow,

And did not think of you.

It lay there, like a sign,

Coiled on the bull's great hoof

And back into the world.

Half blind with weariness

I touched the thread and wept.

O, it was frail as air.

And I turned then

With the white spool

Through the cold rocks,

Through the black rocks,

Through the long webs,

And the mist fell,

And the webs clung,

And the rocks tumbled,

And the earth shook.

And the thread held.

In trees still dripping night some nameless birds

Woke, shook out their arrowy wings, and sang,

Slowly, like finches sifting through a dream.

The pink sun fell, like glass, into the fields.

Two chestnuts, and a dapple gray,

Their shoulders wet with light, their dark hair streaming,

Climbed the hill. The last mist fell away,

And under the trees, beyond time's brittle drift,

I stood like Adam in his lonely garden

On that first morning, shaken out of sleep,

Rubbing his eyes, listening, parting the leaves,

Like tissue on some vast, incredible gift.
